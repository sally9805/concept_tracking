" ; she spoke again of the poem , I wandered lonely as a cloud , the field of daffodils , ten thousand of them , which later flashed ... upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude . Miss Patrick went on to speak of some of the writers whom they would take up , mentioning the names of the Romantic and Victorian poets . Eddie liked what Miss Patrick said , and guessed that he 'd get something out of the course . But the class was dismissed after about twenty-five or thirty minutes , and Eddie found himself alone and lonely , remembering the sting of the slight which he 'd received from Fox . He left Cobb Hall , not knowing what to do with himself for the next half hour , until the nine-o'clock history class would start . The humiliation to which Fox had subjected him left him depressed and feeling out of place , as though he did n't belong on campus and were an interloper with no right to be there , even though he had been admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his class had quickly scattered and he found himself standing alone on the sidewalk in front of Cobb Hall . From behind the gray and differently shaped buildings , he heard the jarring pulse of pneumatic drills , the fitful starts and stops of tractors , the dropping of materials , the hammering , pounding , and whirring of engines for digging and other construction work , all going on in the continuing process of putting up the new Billings Memorial Hospital on the other side of Ellis Avenue and the Midway , and his thoughts flashed to the summer so recently gone , his morning class hours , his usually confident expectancy for the fall term , his happy belief that somehow his personality would be seen for what it was , and that he would become popularand socially respected , even important , once the fall quarter had begun . It had begun . And the first student he had spoken to , other than Peter , had snubbed him as though he were some grasping , climbing , pushingJew or Polack , an undesirable and an inferior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faintest tang of autumn in the air , and this he liked . He saw the movement of the early morning life on campus . Young men and women walked at a pace which suggested leisure , ease , and naturalness , with the movements of those who were contentedor happy . There was so much less nervousness , tension of body , and shuffling of shoes here than there was in the Loop during those long and finished months when he had worked at the Express Company and had gotten off an elevated train at Congress and Wabash , and then had walked on to Dearborn . His own moods had affected how he saw and whom he saw for instants in the rushing crowd of workers who tramped in a herd to their offices or wherever they worked , and who were subordinated to the stern ticking of a clock . Even with the rackety-racketing , nerve-punching noises of the building machinery , the campus was quiet , as another world might be quiet . Eddie looked about , with eyes of darting nervousness that peered with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked as though he were seeking a face , a form , a person who must be seen now , and as though he were absorbing what he saw , gulping it into himself to keep forever . And there was a suggestion of dreaminess , also , in his restless eyes . His eyes were tired and bloodshot . For several nights , he had stayed up after getting home from work , reading Sinclair Lewis ' Main Street , which was affecting him almost as commandingly as had Babbitt . He smiled , thinking of lunkheadedcharacters in Main Street . He thought of Fox . He 'd read more of Main Street after classes , and perhaps finishthe novel . There was now always much for him to look forward to . There would be books to read from now on until the end of his life . That was , unless he went blind . But he would n't go blind . His mind became a big blot of fear . What could he look forward to , if he were to go blind ? The fear was a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , and eating at his confidence and hopes . For a few seconds , he felt as though doomed . He glanced about . But how bright the morning was . How soft the sun was . Soft with the new and still gentle autumn.  |p102The  grass had not yet withered on campus . It was green and shining , and it was a healthy green because of the morning dew . And the coeds . He searched for words with which to describe some of them to himself . They walked in the sun and brightness of the autumn morning . They were bright as morning . A blonde , radiant to him , was walking on the diagonal path , westward . Would she come in his direction ? And be in his history class ? The blonde passed off onto Ellis Avenue . Students were gathering in front of Cobb Hall . Eddie looked eagerly about , compelled by an impulse which he did not feel . His feelings had faded away within him . He was waiting for the next class , for what it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last moments passed , the bell rang , and the students were swelling into the old building for the nine-o'clock classes . Amidst the usual bubbling of talk and laughter , Eddie went slowly into Cobb . His desire was like determination , and it wore the mask of grimness . The desire in him was a call of mind , of feeling and imagination , for the breaking sunshine which nourishes growth in the inner person . But not knowing and understanding this , Eddie kept looking about with almost stupid eagerness . As he entered the classroom , the thought came to him that what he learned here at the University was all that would count in the long run . He found himself a seat near the window of a big first-floor classroom . He was at the University to learn , but he was hoping that an attractive coed would sit close by and he would get to know her . That hope did n't come to pass . Only male students took seats near him . Three rows away , in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simply made up , with delicate features and nearly olive complexion , Eddie saw a very appealing and poetic beauty in her , and wished that he 'd found himself sitting closer to her . His luck . Four classes in a row , without even havinga halfway presentable girl sitting near him . Just as Eddie was beginning to think about his bum luck , he saw a skinny redhead , almost six feet tall , walking quickly toward the empty seat across the aisle from the girl . P103A lucky , skinny redhead , and Eddie did n't fancy the guy 's looks , none whatever . The redhead was too skinny , and thinfacedfor anyone to call the guy good-looking . Nor did Eddie like his gray suit with white stripes . Not quite a Polack suit , but what was it ? Eddie could n't offhand think of a phrase to describe the suit , but he did n't like it . And he would have found more to dislike in the skinny redhead , plenty more but for the quickly jarring surprise of the buzzing bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a lightish blue suit , immaculately pressed and looking stiff upon his tall frame . His face was prematurely settled rather than aged ; or such was the impression he created . Having burst into the room like one who was late and in a hurry , he spoke rapidly and nervously about the general scope and contents of the course . His accent was Eastern and cultivated , and Eddie guessed that it must be a Harvard one ; he was not good in matters such as accents . Eddie had a very good impression of Professor Carleton . That first class hour passed with unnoticed quickness , while the course was broadly outlined . The events ran from the Great French Revolution to the beginning of the World War . Professor Carleton 's language also impressed Eddie ; he spoke well and clearly , with ease and elegance . Eddie began keenly to look forward to his history course , both to the lectures and the reading which he would do . By the end of the first day 's second class hour , he knew that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd enjoy them , and do well in them , he felt . Eddie 's life became all work and no girl , no play . The classroomsat Cobb Hall , one on the first floor , and the other on the second ; occasionally , Harper Library , after the nine-o'clock history class ; and the filling station ; these were the places where Eddie Ryan was preparing himself , was actually waging his battle for the future . These were the places through which time , some of his time , fell into the hole of yesterday . And these were the places where he was happier than he was able to recognize . Each individual moment when he had a thought , he knew that he was thinking , and what he was thinking about . But itp104never occurred to him that this activity of mind was both a part and a rewarding consequence of his education which could barely be said to have begun . He knew that a major purpose of education was learning how to think , and he believed that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . However , he saw this only in direct reference to the contentof what was taken up in the classroom . What Eddie did not realize was that he was living more and more with his mind an active , functioning , operating part of his full person , just as his heart and other organs were functioning and operating . There were different parts of his life , separate environments which had no connection with each other , except that Eddie was spending part of his time in them . There was his home ; there was school ; there was work . In his mind , these were not separated , disconnected , unrelated . The opposite was true . To him , these were but parts of the world , and they were full of connections and relationships , like cross references in various subjectmatters . Eddie did n't know that he was living with more intensity than many whose lives were , superficially , more varied , and who were having fun and good times . They were not giving themselves to all work and no play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He cast a smaller and more distorted shadow upon the visible earth . Those who cast more comely shadows must be more fortunate than Eddie . And it was so , theirs were the comelier shadows . To those who judged the shadows , Eddie was a young man with an unattractive shadow , a shadow unlike the rest of the shadows . He could cast no comely shadow , no lovely shadow . He was in flight from the shadow world , in search of that which was substance . And he did not know that the more Edward A. Ryan was and became Edward A. Ryan , the more wrong would be his shadow in the world of the comely shadows . He was living beyond the dancing shadows of the present . His mind was reaching out and into what could only be tumult and which did not balance into work and play , or into dullness and excitement . He was reaching out to life and he had nop105measures , no scales , no rulers , no containers which could control this living . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know for what destiny . He could not then have known that growing was a tumult carried into the unknown , unborn nothingness of the future that was only the hope of what he wanted to be and the mystery of what was to be . The tumult of the substance was the feeling , the thinking , the living out of what the shadows merely reflected in outlined , wavering darkness against the light . Eddie walked home alone after his first classes of that autumn quarter . And in the parlor , he sat down before a typewriter , and wanted to write something , a diary in which he would put into words , as though to last forever , what had happened since he had gotten up on that same morning . But he did not know what to write . At the center of the top of the white , lined sheet of looseleaf paper , with two holes on the side , Eddie typed out , in upper case , the word : DIARYHe typed the date on the right-hand side of the paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring something into his mind which would be expressed by words , and which would mean what he wanted it to mean . He sat . In sudden hopeful excitement , he typed : This morning I beganHe stopped typing . He looked at his few words on paper , at the typewriter , around the room . He did not know what to write after the verb " began . " He could not think of what to write , and bring himself to type whateverit might be . He sat looking at the big , secondhand typewriter , and the white paper in the roller . He heard his grandmother moving around in the back of theP106apartment . She was singing a sad song , monotonously . He could not catch the words of the song , and heard only her voice , so monotonous and sad . He looked at the paper . His lips moved , and he read to himself , silently :  --  This morning I beganEddie could n't write any more , gave up trying . Then he read restlessly and in snatches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach . He liked it , but could n't decide why . Then he read Arnold 's poem The Future . Life , the world , man became generalized , and as he read , it was as though the meanings were , also , far away , lost in other and earlier times , as well as in the future . The world seemed empty of people , except for the past , Matthew Arnold , and himself , and he followed the lines as though he were hearing Arnold speak , and , at the same time , he might have been Arnold , or in Arnold 's mind when the poem was written . And then , the images and lines asserted themselves upon him , and he visualized the meaning of the words , but with some vagueness . A girl , and Rebekah by a well , and a herd of sheep , a desert of Araby . Time was an actual river , flowing through a somber world ; he read aloud the two lines : But what was before us we know not And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in his mind there was a growing dimness like the darkening atmosphere of a dejectedday with a dejected gloom of heavy gray in the sky . He put his book down on the floor , and sat , reaching for some sad thought which was hiding from him in his own mind . But the thought went unfound ; it was like an invisible spirit permeatingthe air , floating through the atmosphere , unseen , yet seeing , and he imagined himself standing , alone , in a world where the air was gray and still , looking with a wish and drive beyond his power , wanting to call out for the spirit to tell him its knowledge , its answer to the sealed mystery of life and time.  |p107And  death . The River of Time , he thought , was the River of Life and of Death . It flowed with fast , rich " deliberate aslowness " of The Hound of Heaven , and by its banks men stood , helpless and forever and always helpless . Only man was not standing by the banks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that river . And even the weariest river winds somewhere safe to sea . He wished that the world were Swinburne 's world , Swinburne 's Garden of Proserpine , and that the softness of nothingness , that sleep which was like a dream that was no dream , nothingness that was a dreamless dream and a sleep with no waking , that this were the end . But Hell was a pit of darkness with the silent , always running red flames , and souls were burning , only burning in a silence where their cries were never heard , loud cries shouted in darkness , the agony of dying alone , but never dying , and that was life living forevermore . To burn and burn forever , moaning in the pains of Hell , knowing everything that had ever happened , knowing , helpless in the hot and licking flames of the burning black coal of Hell . But if Adam and Eve . . . if Eve had not heeded the snake , or was it that Eve had let Adam ... let Adam .. . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Screw her , " or the four letter word , or " jump , " " get Eve 's tail , " or " get a piece , " or ... or ... If Eve and Adam had n't had coitus , or copulated .. . Thoughts of Time were melancholy , and Time was a flowing river , a ticking away , a dropping of the grains of sand , one by one by one . Time was sad because the meaning of Time was death , your own death . Eddie had become drowsy , and let out an uncontrolled yawn which interrupted the flow of his thoughts . He felt dull and heavy . He let his eyes move vacantly about the parlor . The room was getting shabby . There were tears in the rug , and the wine-red coloring was faded . The chairs were scratched.  |p108Another  yawn came . Eddie thought that he ought to sleep . There was time for a nap . He wanted to sleep . But he started to read the next day 's history assignment , and persisted in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop for Eddie Ryan as he hoped that it would . The University was a big one , with some thousands of students , and there were about a thousand freshmen . Among them , Eddie Ryan passed unnoticed . He walked to campus in the mornings with Peter Moore , attended classes , and then , occasionally , he would go to Harper Library to study or read , but on most mornings , he returned home after his last class . He read , studied , tried to keep a diary , and on some days , he wrote a book report , term paper , or other papers for his classes . His grandmother fixed lunch , and made him sandwiches to take to work , neatly wrapped up and tied . And then , there was his job at the station . There was a uniformity about Eddie 's days , and a regularity in his life . Most days seemed to be very much alike , and they were in their pattern of events . With the start of the autumn quarter , Eddie slept four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was often tired , but he drank coffee , sometimes to excess , to keep himself awake , and his mind more alert . When he had eyestrain , he increased the quantity of coffee he drank , and added aspirin as well . He would worry about the liberties he took with his health , but should he go blind , wrecked health would not make much difference , and perhaps a shorter life would be a benefit , a blessing in disguise . If he should lose his sight , his capacity to learn would be severely reduced , and he was racing against the possibility of such a disaster.  |p110Eddie  's fears that he might one day go blind had been roused in 1924 when he had gone to a specialist at Michigan and Monroe in the Loop , Dr. Stanford . About two weeks after he 'd started attending night school , he 'd had pains of blinding intensityin his eyeballs , and other , throbbing pains which ran in lines all the way back through his brain . He could remember a rainy Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been murderous , so sharp and pulsating that he had told himself that the pains of death could not be any more excruciating . He was still working at the Express Company and had started working a seven-day week , in order to get the extra day 's pay . The office was never closed , and was spoken of by wagonmen and their supervising bosses as a Stopover on the Way to Hell . On weekdays , the place was noisier than the Devil has any right to permit , because wagonmen and route inspectors came in , and a full staff of nine clerks as well as three wagon dispatchers shouted into the telephones , and there was plenty of additional shouting . But on Sundays , the office was quiet . Three clerks and three wagon dispatchers were on duty , handling the movements of the motor trucks , electrics , various horse-drawn vehicles , and tractors and trailers , in transferring incoming and outgoing shipmentsand taking care of occasional emergencies , such as a corpse . Mickey Logan , nicknamed Funny Puss Jeff , handled special motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dispatcher , with no extra pay for the " Chief . " He was theoretically in charge of the office , and also had authority over the clerks , or at least over those who did n't work at the other end of the long table with Hans Schmidt , of German descent but called the " Dutchman , " and Blubber Cannon , who had once had Funny Puss Jeff 's job but now was on the new tractor board . Funny Puss and Blub hurled insults back and forth at each other , often under the pretense of humor , but they had no use for one another . Funny Puss had told Eddie that since he was going to school and trying to get himself an education , and was helping his mother , he could have work every Sunday . Most of the clerksp111did n't want the work , even though they would earn an extra day 's pay . Compared with other days of the week , Sunday work was easier , and Eddie liked it better , since he had come to accept the permanency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying , because there was n't too much work to do , and the pressure felt on weekdays was relaxed . But that Sunday when his eyeballs burned with pain was Hell for him . Eddie kept trying to study his sociology textbook , but the pains became an agony . The strain of reading was too great for his weak and watering eyes . He closed the textbook , as though in admission of defeat of the spirit . Lou Young and Charlie Norman , who were on the wagon and truck , both told Eddie several times to quit trying to study when he had eyestrain , there was no use in a man killing himself for anything . Young felt almost as badly as Eddie because he 'd drunk too much beer and home-made brew the night before , and he had n't gotten to bed until about three o'clock in the morning . Mickey Logan said that at least Young had had some fun gettinghimself into a passed-out condition , but Ryan , what sense did that make ? When you were cold , you did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this man 's world , and if you did n't have any fun while you were alive either , then , Jesus Christ , you sure were one poor sorry hell of a bastard . Eddie kept looking at the clock and despondently thinking how long the day was , how much more time he had to stay and suffer , and of his misery . He 'd told himself that he could n't last it out until six o'clock , and he longed for that hour , and for his release . He was almost ready to let himself pass out and die . Why did he have to pay so much just to get an education ? Why did n't he give up , give up on everything ? But what do you do when you give up ? That Sunday had seemed like one of the worst days in his life , and had been spent in nausea and blinding pain . He was left in a nerve-shattered condition , and was jittery and restless for a couple of days . At the Express Company , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a whore only cost two bucks , and he 'd better go get himself one.  |p112A  few days later , he went to see Dr. Stanford , a specialist who charged him ten dollars and fitted him with new glasses , but also told him that he could n't use his eyes as much as he was . It was Eddie who had asked the question about blindness , and the doctor 's answer had left him in a suffering state of ominous doubt . Dr. Stanford did n't say definitely that Eddie would go blind , but he did say that by thirty-five , Eddie 's eyes could be very poor ones , very poor , if they were overused . Eddie said that he had to use them . The doctor warned him , and observedthat Nature always took her revenge . Eddie asked if he had a chance of being able to use his sight for study and reading for more than fifteen years , or until he would be thirty-five . A chance , yes , but who could say for sure ? The doctor advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy without having to put too much of a burden on his eyes . " I ca n't , Doctor . I ca n't . " That had been on a gray afternoon , Funny Puss Jeff had given him the time off to have this eye examination , but he 'd told him , for Christ sake , to hurry back . Eddie had walked out of the building entrance on Monroe Street , after his visit to Dr. Stanford 's office , with feelings that he could n't possibly describe . He imagined himself in the future , a man of thirty-five blind , living with the world in darkness , and this was almost as though he were thinking of his doom and death . If he could n't use his eyes for study , he 'd end up like most of the men at the Express Company . His future would be ended now if he could n't use his eyes . Eddie had turned onto Wabash Avenue , and was drooping along southward to Van Buren Street , with a dazed expression on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he have to have lousy eyes ? He saw all right now , and there were no pains . How could he believe that his eyes would n't always be the same ? There were no answers for him , nor was there much more to think of . What could he ask , and what could he think that would give him better eyes ? He could pray and ask for a miracle . But prayers could n't help him . God no longer worked miracles . There was only one question for him to answer . To do or notp113to do , that was the question . To go on , use his eyes as long as he had them , to wear his eyes out in the best way he could , or else to abandon hope and resign himself to the life he 'd have to live as Eddie , Edward Arthur Ryan . Eddie 's thoughts were drenched in pathos . He was creating a mental image of himself as one who bravely and courageously fights with destiny , who risks all and heeds not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who loves a hero 's glory . But what kind of hero was he ? Why should he dream of any fame , and think that he ought to risk going blind in the prime of life , seeking that fame ? Who cared if he should make something out of himself ? And how did he know that he could make the name Edward A. Ryan famous and remembered after he died ? No fellow his own age ever spoke of such glory , that was , none whom he knew . If he dared to speak of his dreams and his hopes , he 'd be laughed at.  --  Ryan , think you 'll ever amount to anything ? Hans Schmidt had asked . To become a salesman and make fifty or a hundred bucks a week , to get an easy and soft job with lots of free time and dough in his pocket , that was one thing . But fame and glory , to become a name that would be imperishable , that was something of another order entirely . Dr. Stanford had told him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of his eyes and to plan a future in the best possible way for saving them . But he was n't blind yet , nor did he have any strain , any pains . How much could happen in fifteen years ? Inventions , discoveries , new cures , and how could he be sure ? It was the uncertainty that had almost floored him , the fearful uncertainty that he 'd carry with him for years , it was that which was the most terrifying for him , at least now and during the days and months and years before him when he would be studying , year upon year . If he could go on and forget , and hope , not given in to terror , then he could face the danger with bravery , with high courage . His work was so long and so short . Joy and sorrow were timeless , not actually , but a screen for time . You forgot time when you were happy , because you forgot yourself , and when youp114were miserable , you forgot the world and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stride along , as though he were without a care in the world , a picture , a walking image , an essence of nonchalance in motion . Eddie drew himself up with an awkward movement which he knew was awkward , and felt he 'd made himself a little ridiculousto anyone who noticed . He had then crossed Adams Street , and had begun to walk with a brisker gait , celebrating a change of mind . The thoughts he 'd just had , sob-sister thoughts , were like fading dreams which had stolen in upon him while he 'd been taking a tired nap . And his mood and brooding thoughts grew strange in his inexplicably sudden state of false elation . It was about three-fifteen , and he had to work until six o'clock . It was n't a school night . He wished he did n't have to go back to work ; perhaps he should have taken the day off , or at least the afternoon . But money talked . He was saving , bit by bit , but how small the bits were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar counted and added up , so long as he could leave it in the bank . He 'd be seven to ten years studying , and then he wanted to do his post-graduate work at the University of Chicago . He saved for the day he might have enough to go to the University during the day . Climbing up the winding steps from the loading platform , where freight was piling up , going back to the office to work out the rest of the day , Eddie 's spirits sank , and he was depressedwith what he was , instead of enthused by the hopes of what he wanted to become . As he had entered the noisy office , with the clerks shouting into telephone mouthpieces , Funny Puss Jeff and Blubber were shouting insults at one another , but Funny Puss paused long enough to tell Eddie that he 'd been gone a long time . " I could n't help it . I had to wait until the doctor took me for an eye examination , " Eddie said . " You ca n't learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ryan , " Blubber yelled at him from the tractor board.  | " Nobody missed him , that 's how smart he is , " Hans Schmidt called out . Eddie clenched his teeth but said nothing . He could n't understand why Blubber , and a lot of the others , the wagon dispatcher and route inspectors , did n't like him , and could get such pleasure in trying to hop on his tail . Eddie did n't realize that these men were ridden by envy because they all felt so small . The mere fact that he had graduated from high school was a cause for envy , a source of many of their belittling wisecracks and of the contempt they would show for him . Some of them had not even finished grammar school , and they all wished that they 'd had some education . Then they could have done better for themselves in life . That 's what they thought . And when he started to go to night school , Eddie had demonstratedthat he wanted to get the hell out of the common trap in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were resentful because he was trying to go beyond them . Before he quit the Express Company to work for Rawlinson , Eddie had become largely impervious to what most of the men said or might think of him . In spirit he was outside of and beyond the company . Except for a passing moment , he had almost no dislike for the men . Eddie did not persist in any dislikes of people , and often he would feel sorry for them , because there was something , or many things , about their lives , which were too bad , just too bad . He saw them all , spending their lives doing the same things , the same work that they were then doing , and sayingthe same things , and telling the same jokes . He wanted to escape . And he did escape . However , it had been while he was still working at the ExpressCompany that he had first been seized with the fear of blindness . A young man can not learn such news about himself , and make the decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thirty-five and be calm , equable , and like other young men of his time and age . He can not go on along the road he had just chosen , and be nonchalant , unaffectedly courageous , fearless , and as casually defiant of his fate as the shadowed image of ap116young man on a black and white screen in a motion picture theater , who is romantically foolhardy , senselessly brave for success and the fair damoiselle . Eddie 's antagonist was himself , his nerves and senses , whose agonies and strains would result in pain that he would feel , and eyes that , he now had to dread , might lose their capability to receive images of light and register them in his brain . And his antagonist was also whatever in the world would impede his onward course . This was his fate , his destiny , and the price which it seemed to place on his meeting it and conquering it was heavy . And all good Americans , presumably millions , were cheering for Eddie because he was going to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was taking a chance of givingup more than his youth and the pleasures of youth . But all of America did not know of Edward Arthur Ryan , and that small percentage which did was concerned with other affairs and interests . Someday , all of America would know of his struggle , and then it would cheer him . So he thought . But he could n't do it as the movie stars did it . He could n't be recklessly brave without fear , without doubt , without his moments of somber and depressed thoughts , his moods when sadnessnot only filled his mind , but also was the shroud of the world . There were times when he wanted to cry out to God across all of the spaces of the sky , to ask why and to say that it should n't be the way it was , it should n't be for him to have eyes too weak for the burden they must bear when others had perfect eyes , which they did n't need or think much about . And he tried to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as batting an eyelash . He wanted his struggle to be spectacular and heroic , for that was the kind of life he wished for himself , and that was the kind of a person he would be , if he could . But the terms of fate , of life , were plain and prosaic , and the risks were great . The risks were not to be talked about with many , for it was crazy in their way of looking at things . And yet he wanted to talk , and to be lauded , praised , patted on the back . Eddie could not explain what he meant in a manner whichp117would win the interest of anyone who did not know and like him . For he spoke only of a personal ambition , and he couched his words in the usual ones of success , getting-ahead , climbing to the top of the heap on the ladder . But that was not what he meant because it was not what he felt . He did not merely feel that he was going to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that he was going to do something , but he did n't fully know what it was . He could and did say that he was going to study law , practice law and go into politics , and he also hoped to teach , and to write . But he felt more than that which each or all of these aims might suggest . He felt that he was going to get deeply into life , and that he was going to achieve some kind of destiny . More vaguely , he felt that he would be important in some sense , some way , and that he was going to pursue and gain knowledge which was the key to power . He did not ask himself what he meant by power ; he did not question the meaning of this word . He felt the sense of destiny which had been in him since his early boyhood . What he was living through to achieve was life and light , and if he did not do it , there would be neither life nor light . He felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to accept a kind of darkness , even though it was not a physical blindness . There was almost a year , less than three weeks short of one , between the visit to Dr. Stanford 's office and the first day of the fall quarter . Eddie 's fears about his eyesight had diminished and were diffused through his thoughts and moods . He had had moments of the most shattering anxiety , when he had wanted to quit , and to cry out against the fate that forced him to suffer as others did not , to suffer for doing what was supposed to be right , and a reason for winning encouragement and admiration . It was for such actions that he suffered , not for sinful or evil conduct . And sin and evil were the reasons why people were punished , were they not ? This was what he had acquired as a belief while he 'd been growing up . But his eyestrains and his moods passed , and he had good days , when he used his eyes as much as he could in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger ahead , and go on assuming that he would have his sight for his whole lifetime.  |p118However  , a whole lifetime was too brief for him , and it was going , racing by . He was taking the Cash and letting the Credit go , but not the Cash that Omar Khayyam meant , the pleasures of the moment . These were the Credit for him , while the Cash was what he could put into his mind . He sometimes thought of the particular quatrain out of FitzGerald in which the Persian poet had used this metaphor , and he would sadden with the awarenessthat he was missing so much of youth and fun , like kisses and all of the sensuous and emotional pleasures and fulfilling feelings which must come from love , the joy of good times , the knowledge of girls and their bodies , so painful to him to see and not to know , not to have , while everyday and everywhere , fellowshis own age were going out with girls , girls young and lovely , and indescribable in their first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming , their breasts quivering under their dresses , their bodies slender and full of grace , their legs shapely , and their faces like lights upon the sea of the world , with bright clear eyes , and soft tender skin , and smiles on their faces which were the smiles and the laughterof life . They could laugh as youth and life could laugh , new and growing , with the dew of spring mornings and the softness and languorousness of spring days in their laughter , and in their eyes , and in their bodies . And others knew these girls , and shared the laughter of life in the springtime of their years . But he was missing this . This , he believed , was the Credit which he was letting go . At least , he wanted to believe it . He was not convinced that it was actually true , or even true at all . He was a failure , a flop with girls , and he did n't know how to amuse them , interest them , win their hearts , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others could , even fellows who were n't in George Raymond'sclass . Eddie felt a slow-growing sense of separation , from old friends , from his environment , and his past . This was vague , and he did not understand it with full clarity , any more than he understood much about who he was , and where he was going in life , and time , and society . He was absorbing , finding his way , not judgingon the instant what he read , learned , thought , whom he met ,  |p119and  he carried his past and his environment with him to the University . He was no young rebel , and did not feel a need to rebel , but only to learn . So he was in the fall of 1925 . He was fighting the future , fighting for the future , fighting for something in that future which he only sensed , for some value beyond just money or having his name known . It was a most vaguely sensed quality of life , something that was like Shelley 's : The desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morrow The devotion to something afar From the sphere of our sorrow . He read this poem of Shelley 's and recited it to himself . He thought of a girl , and of more . He was living to find " something afar . " He also read and reread Shelley 's Adonis . And in the filling station , in class , anywhere , unpredictably , he would be moved by the lines : Who waged contention with their time 's decay . He 'd think of himself finding some way , his way , to do something like that , to wage . . . contention with their time 's decay . Every minute , he felt a need to be working toward that future , toward " something afar , " and toward the waging of that contention with time 's decay . If he had to go blind doing it , he would , but in himself he wept silent tears for himself , as though he were Adonis.  |p120Gradually  , day-by-day , Eddie had been changing and growing , more than he knew or could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim in determination . The hopes were the sunny surface , flashing and glinting with dancing dots and spots and streaks of golden sunlight , and the grim determination was the cold current , running fast and far down . Eddie 's growth and his will for the future had not as yet brought him into conflict with himself or with the values and beliefs that he was bringing with him out of his short past . All that he must sacrifice could be time , and the risk of his eyes . This was what he thought . He had vague premonitions of more , but he never thought about what they might mean , and they were but the result of moods and melancholy broodings . Thus was Eddie Ryan in October 1925 . Up to that time , his life had been one with more sorrows than joys , and he had not known much happiness . The sorrows which he had known and witnessed had been big ; the happinesses had been little . He expected that his happiness would become big . And he liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that others thought of him as someone to be envied , leading the college life , going to dances and parties , knowing keen and much-soughtaftercoeds , acquiring the manners and blandness of a college man who rated socially and was somebody , taking on polish and becoming sophisticated . He wanted it thought that he was happy . Not to be happy , not to have good times , not to bep121socially accepted , these were all signs of incapacity , of something wrong with yourself , something which stamped you as inferior . And he had so frequently suffered from such feelings that he could no longer bear them , or so he thought . Eddie had almost no time for any such campus life , and did n't know how to find it and become a part of it . He was shy about approaching others , and proudly sensitive of being snubbed . He could n't be sure of when to nod and say " Hello " outside of a classroom , and would pass by someone who sat near to him in one of his courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of additional rebuffs , besides the one from Fox . It was bewilderingto know how you decided which students were worth speaking to , and which ones were n't ? He could n't understand it . But being snubbed and ignored hurt him , and he was quickly becomingconditioned to avoid repetitions of this same thing . He was careful about talking to anyone , and those fall days became lonelierones than the mornings of the summer quarter had been . Eddie had looked forward to seeing the home football games , and arranged with his partner , Jameson , to come to work late on Saturdays , and to make up the time on other days . The old man would n't agree to working both Saturday shifts , and taking Sundaysor Mondays off . It was settled how the shifts were to be worked , and he would n't agree to any change . Eddie thought this a dirty trick and selfish . But he did n't know that Jameson 's main reason for refusing was his sick wife , who would have terrors alone in the dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man was n't with her . Jameson , Eddie thought , was mean and , like many old men , just as stiff as a board . Eddie also believed that the old man was dominating him , selfishly using and taking advantage of his need to work the afternoon shift on workdays in order to attend classes and also , selfishly refusing to make any concessions on weekends by taking an afternoon shift . Jameson might have made an arrangementto have a relative or neighbor in and succeeded in accustominghis poor wife to his absence , but he was under enough strain and pressure . And he was tired at night , even though he might nap before supper . His back would ache and his bones would grow weary . The years were penetrating bone and muscle ,  |p122even  though they had not weakened his will and independence . Jameson also liked Eddie in a manner the youth could n't understand . To him , Eddie was " the boy , " " the kid . " He was a good and decent kid , and ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some stiffness of treatment , Ryan would stay a good kid , but he was the kind who could go wild , and squander his chances . Some reins had to be held tight on him , or he 'd run away , and maybe get himself into trouble . A kid who worked like Ryan was overdoing it , and if you overdid things in one way , you could just as easily overdo things in another way . Kids were like that . It was human nature , and he had been around long enough to know a little something of human nature . And Jameson believed that he had a responsibility to watch Eddie , to guide and help him . For when he 'd been given the kid as a partner , after his friend and former partner , Mike Moore , had to quit because of a bad heart , Pat Keefe had come around to see him and had spoken of Ryan.  --  Jamesy , I got a kid I want you to take in place of poor Mike.  --  Pat , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this station  --  them black tarts are out walkin ' the streets every night and you ca n't have no young kid here . You ca n't take a chance . You know what happens just as plain as me.  --  Yeah , but this kid 's different.  --  What do you mean , different ? At that age , they got too much in their pants and too little upstairs.  --  This kid , his name is Ryan , he 's got to work an afternoonnightshift so he can go to college.  --  A fraternity boy , is that what you 're gettin ' me ?  --  No , Jamesy . You 'll like Ryan . He 's not cut out to work in a station.  --  Then why in the name of blazes should I have him ?  --  He 's a genius.  --  I never seen a kid that was that , Pat . They do n't come around this neck of the woods.  --  He is , I 'm certain of it . That 's why I took him on . I had everybody and his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six times as many requests and applications , ten times as many as I could fill . I kept some mighty important menp123waiting with their applicants , and took Ryan ahead of anyone . He 's cut for bigger things than you or I will ever know , and he 's a good , clean Irish boy , and we can be proud of him . A steady hand like yours will help him along . He 's got his head up there in the stars . Jameson had growled that he 'd take the kid . Keefe was the boss , of course , and could have ordered Ryan to the station withoutconsulting Jameson , but the Old Man was like a law and a tradition at Rawlinson 's , and no one ever went against his wishes . It was known that he was the most reliable and honest man in the service stations , and grouchy as he could get , he had a heart of gold and a faithfulness like that of an old servant . Keefe thanked Jameson for being willing to accept Ryan as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help because he was a dreamy kid who studied and thought , but would be reliable , and was the kind of young fellow they wanted.  --  Some day , he might go up so high , Jamesy , that you and I will go to him for a favor . That 's how promising he is . You 're the one man I got who can help him and take care of him the best , better than any other of my men in the stations.  --  Well , I 'll damn quick find out how smart he is and how good . There ai n't a thing can happen in this station that I do n't know about . My friends come around and tell me what goes on when I ai n't here . This is one station that 's always going to be honest and run proper , as long as I 'm around , and you know that , Pat.  --  I sure do , Old Boy . That was how Eddie was assigned to work with the Old Man . When Keefe lost out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did was to convince Mr. Wood about Ryan , and Jameson knew that Mr. Wood had the same ideas about the kid that Pat Keefe had . In fact , Mr. Wood was likely to help the kid go up higher and faster because he had drag with the big shots in the company , back East , so Jameson had heard . Jameson had given his word to take care of Ryan , and he believed that he was performing a duty to the company , as well as helping Eddie . He complained and found little faults , but then , he would soften up and speak to Eddie in a gentle voice.  |p124He  'd do the extra cleaning with the idea of leaving the kid more time to study his books at night , and he had come to take great pride in the boy ; while he did n't know in this man 's hell what they meant by them words like genius , he knew a promising kid when he saw one , and Ryan was a promising kid , who was going somewhere up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a chance . My God , the kid came to work every day with a briefcase chockful of books , and his friends said that at night , when business was dead , you could see him standing up over the desk , studying his books , night after night , and they did n't know how a kid could study that way . And Ryan kept up his end of the stick , and sold oil , too . Since Ryan had come to the station , flushing oil sales had gone up a couple of gallons , and that was a sign the kid was on his toes . Jameson knew how a young fellow liked a night out and a good time , and he had no objections to that , within limits , but with the kid , it was a different matter . He had a responsibility and he thought it best not to give way on certain matters . It was better for Ryan to have a hard fight now . That would make a better man of him , and he 'd value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Old Man 's motives , and of the exceptionallyhigh regard in which he was held in the office , was silently resentful and began to want a change . He tried to dislike Jameson , but he could n't . He would always catch a note of pathos and sadness in the Old Man 's walk , or in his soft gray eyes , or in his voice , and his anger and dislike would crumble in him . But all the more , he knew that something would sooner or later have to be done , and he 'd have to declare his independence from Jameson . It was pretty mean , not agreeing to let him take off Saturdays , after the football games . What fun was there in seeing his first college football game as a student , and then rushing to Saturday night work at the station while most of the students were going on to a night of fun and dates , to parties and dances , the good times of youth and the gaieties of student life ? For over a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his age were out with girls and having good times . He had no girl , no dates , none of the carefree good fellowship that others knew ,  |p125and  of which he 'd known a little during his last year of high school , until he 'd started night school in the fall of 1924.  --  A kid like you do n't need to think about them fraternity boys with rich fathers supportin " em , Jameson had told him . You watch where you 're going , take a little advice , and you 'll go so far past them in life they wo n't see you in the distance . This remark had struck Eddie as very curious , but he 'd liked it . He 'd agreed with it , but he was young , and he wanted fun and romance , the kind of youth he 'd had far too little of , the kind of good times that were supposed to give you lifetime memories . By fall , he had begun to fear that all he 'd be at the University was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew nothing but what was in books , and whose entire college career would be spent with books.  --  You always got your nose in a book , his Uncle Larry had said to him several times . And Freckles Dolan , one of the older guys who hung around 58th Street had told him after Mass one Sunday :  --  You read too many books , Goof , and they 'll lock you up in Dunning or Kankakee  --  you 'll spend your life in the booby hatch . He knew better and was happy with books and study , and already , he had come to realize that his life would be too short for him to read all the books that he must read and wanted to read . But he could n't stop dreaming and wanting and all of the girls he had ever known and wanted to love , and had wanted to love him , had left him with the image of the girl he sought , the girl who would give him love and purity and beauty of living , and he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk in the moonlight with her and feel that the glory and the grandeur of the world was in the conquest of their love , and that their kisses were full of shining silver of the moon , which filled the night with the dancing and glistening beauty of all of life and time . Eddie had hoped for this with the faith of his hungers , even though he had no girl . He imagined , every day in fact , that he 'd find one . And there would be the football games , and a date , dancing , and the moonlight with love.  |p126Jameson  's firm refusal to work the full second Saturday shift was robbing him of this dream . The Old Man could stay on for him while he saw the games , but then , after the games , Eddie would have to come to work . Sunday mornings were busy and a number of customers came in for Jameson to drain their cars . He 'd been doing this for years , and they expected only him to do it . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his toes at seven A.M. on Sunday morning . Eddie even saw in what the Old Man said , and in his keeping special customers , a way of protecting himself and his record with Rawlinson . That was all the Old Man had , and as Eddie often heard , plenty of good men were walking the streets . He could more than see a case for the Old Man , and he thought of Jameson 's age , and felt that , perhaps , he had no right to ask such a favor of him . Eddie went to the football games with Peter Moore . They both had loved sports all through boyhood , and enjoyed playing or watching . Peter was going out for the track team , and he had specialized in high-jumping , although he was also very fast as a runner , and could well stand a chance as one , at least on the relay team . Eddie wished he could go out for freshman football , basketball , or baseball , and hoped that the athletic authorities would look up his high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reputation he had had . He was not heavy enough for college athletics , his weight being around one hundred and fifty-five pounds , but he was worth a man twenty pounds heavier and an inch or more taller because of his broad shoulders , in which there was much power , and his long arms . He hoped that , somehow , he would manage to get the help , or to make arrangements which would give him time for athletics . Perhaps his right knee , injured in high school , and again in prairie football , was in good shape , or he could wear a steel guard , or even have an operation performed on it . He 'd stand a chance of making some of the teams because he had shown enough ability in high school . From early boyhood on , Eddie had dreamed of athletic glory and fame , and his dreams lingered with him . If he could findP127the time to play , maybe he could win a Rhodes Scholarship . This , too , was a dream of his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he wanted to feel it , express it , and believe that it was important . This was one of the preconceptions which he had brought with him to the University . But school spirit was linked up with his dreams and visions of glory , because he did not want merely to be one who cheered others in loud bursts , but he wanted to be one of the cheered . He saw school spirit and college tradition as one who would , if he could , be part of both . He did not belong with those who acclaimed ; his place was among those who achieved and were acclaimed . And he 'd had this feeling concerning himself ever since he had been a little boy of six or seven . Eddie sat among the students with Peter and a few of Peter 's friends . One was Abe Lustig , a big , dark-haired , raw-boned , homely young man from Milwaukee , Wisconsin , who had already jumped 5 feet 11 inches as a freshman high jumper , and might one day break the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who got straight A 's in science , in which he was majoring . His only interests were high-jumping and science , and socially he was shy and awkward . Since he was a Jew , he was n't eligible for membership in the Gentile fraternities , but would have turned down bids from them , as he had from a Jewish one . He had never learned to dance , just as Peter had n't , and was oppressively shy with girls . He was self-contained , and needed few friends and little relaxation . Living in a rooming house near the campus , he made his own lunch , and ate it with Peter , who carried lunch to school every day in his briefcase . Eddie and Abe took to one another , and although they did n't have much to say , they communicated a feeling of mutual respectwhich both caught and accepted . Both Abe and Peter Moore appealed to Eddie , to an important aspect of his nature , and he felt genuine comradeship for them . He respected their seriousness , simplicity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished that he did not have so many counterimpulses , desires , and inclinations . Usually they sat about halfway up in the north stand , in thep128midst of students , and Eddie felt a real satisfaction , a sense of accomplishment , but he could n't get himself to let go and cheer , and he only mumbled the words of songs to himself , because he sang so badly  --  he was totally unable to carry a tune . But the school songs stirred him , and he wanted them to mean much to himself and to other students . There was a need within him , like a vacuum , which the songs seemed to fill . The Alma Mater Song evoked a solemnity and seriousness of mind , and he felt himself as one who had become a part of the University and who would strive and struggle to make himself a part of its traditions . She could not love thee half so well Loved she not honor more . Then he would leave with Peter and Abe , and his mood would sink , falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and walk to the Midway , where he caught a bus to take him to work . It was a lonely experience , one of the loneliest he had ever had , the slow walk from the Reynolds Club , where he could hear a jazz band playing for dancing students , past the tennis courts , the various dormitories , and across the Midway to Woodlawn Avenue , where the bus would stop . The years before him seemed like a long road of sacrifice , and he wondered how many such years there would be , and for how long he would go on , leading this lonely life of his . For two straight Saturdays this happened . Darkness had set in when he reached the station , and Jameson , who was all ready to go , spoke for a few moments about the events of the day at the station , asked about the game , and then left . The football games loosened Eddie 's sense of purpose , and weakened his powers of concentration . He was still developing his habits of concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge , which could serve as the foundation for an embedded intellectual self-assurance . He was prey to distraction ; pleasure , intoxication , a happy or exciting break in his routine , were as much of a torment as a refreshment . He had to struggle with himself to grind on in his merciless routine of study , study . His mind would rebel against the will he tried to impose on it.  |p129He  was very restless , and was sorry for himself . He was missing life and love . He managed to study , but with less consistent concentration , and he went outside often , to look at the sky , at the moon and the stars . Eddie had made a good start in the fall quarter . From the first day , he had kept up with his reading assignments , and done regular , almost daily , collateral reading . Both of his courses could have been easy , if he had allowed this , but Eddie did not think in terms of getting by , nor confine himself to his assignments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a river of knowledge , and to swim as far as swiftly as he could . And he began swimming fast the moment he hit the water . But he became restless and dissatisfied , because he felt himself to be bound and hemmed in , restricted on a long , daily grind , and very lonely . He was not making friends on campus , and none of the fraternities found out about him , and sought him out . He met no girls , even though they were like a swarm on campus , and he could not walk about so long as five minutes without seeing one or more , even a bevy of them . For many others , the campus appeared to be such a friendly place , but for him it was lonely . He attended classes , and sometimes went to Harper Library for books , or to read and study there for a few hours . Eddie was overstimulated intellectually , and otherwise locked up in himself . His full release came from his mind and the physical activity which was required as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happy , and would have known that he was , had he only allowed himself to do so . However , he could not do this . He kept thinking that he ought to be bid by a frat , and know club girls who were popular and sought after , and he ought to be going to dances and parties , and be recognized as somebody , and he ought to be known as having been a pretty damned good Catholic high school athlete , and damned promising varsity material ; he ought to be in the swing of things , socially.  |p130But  he did n't know how to make any of this happen , and he knew that if he were to be living such a student life , he could n't study as much , and he would have to sacrifice precious time . And he did n't think he could like fraternity boys , and campus big shots as he liked Peter Moore and Abe Lustig , and he could n't value a big boy like Fox , because he was a dumb center and a frat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars and money to blow , maybe raccoon coats , and clothes bought at the Hub , Rothschild 's , Marshall Field 's , or one of the other best places down in the Loop , because they had an old man who was in the bucks , and he could n't value and like guys who sat next to him in the classroom and walked by him on campus as though he were an Eskimo whom they 'd never seen before , and he could n't value rich boys who would treat him like an unwantedPolack or inferior if they knew the story of his family and how his father had died , just about a pauper , and he could n't like the frat boys who dressed with careful carelessness , and shook hands with the college handshake as though they were bored , and let conceited and insulting words drop out of the side of their mouths . How could he like the girls he wanted , the snooty blondes , who looked at you and never saw you , the girls who liked you for your slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some man who was rich , your fraternity pin , your drawling tone of voice , your way of calling your old man the " Governor , " the " Pater , " the " Lord of the Exchequer , " your way of dancing as if it did n't interest you , talking as if it were a condescension to speak . And yet he wanted such people to notice him . He wanted it because he had been part of it in grammar school and high school , and it was the world of those who were something and his was the world of those who were n't much . He wanted it because he had been ashamed of so much , of his grandmother smoking a pipe and not being able to read or write , of his mother dressing like the scrubwoman 's cousin and his father driving a horse-and-wagon and not being a businessman , and dying like a sick pauper , of his aunt 's drinking and cursing , of his having had to graduate from high school without paying his seniorp131year 's tuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been ditched by other kids , not invited to parties , turned down when he phoned girls for dates , and of all the pretending that he and his family were more than they were , and were just like those who were better off . Only a week or two of the fall quarter went by before these shames of many years began to crop up in his thoughts , and he would think that he might be snubbed , and that all of those he knew , his old friends , the girls who had refused him dates , and had perhaps laughed at him , and many others , could laugh again because he was a student at the U but no different socially . He had gotten A 's in the summer quarter , and Miss Patrick was praising him in class before the first week was ended , and after the first quiz in History , Professor Carleton had looked at him , and told the class how very few of them wrote well enough for a college student , and he knew that Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once in the classroom , his feelings of shame and inferiority , or , as Freud wrote , his " inferioritycomplex , " were forgotten , and at times he 'd forget himself , in thinking of the lecture or the questions on subjects under discussion . But after his interest in class , there was the emptiness he usually had when the bell rang . A few times , he stood in the crowd before Cobb Hall , and heard snatches of talk about dates , dances , parties after the football games , and he wished he were not at the University . He told himself that he did n't belong where he was . But he quickly corrected himself . He did n't belong with the frat boys , club girls , at parties and in the campus social life . He should give up hoping , and come here to study , and learn with drive , and stun them , anybody and everybody , by forcing them to recognize him . But he was sliding away from a boyhood feeling of showing them , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to tell himself was that he would find , and develop , grow , have power within himself , and that he would win the world with power . It was the growing of sinews of emotions and will in his own character ; it was the strength to bep132more alone with himself ; it was a force of mind and energy . The first surgings of this he had felt , faintly and episodically . In the history class , Professor Carleton had begun with the French Revolution . The lectures and reading overexcited Eddie , and he was living the violent grandeur of those days , wishing that he had been alive at that time , wondering if he would have been brave enough , and what he would have done , what his place in history would have been . The French Revolution as it was described and analyzed in class and in Eddie 's readings , cleared his mind of platitudes , fragmented impressions , like torn bits of old letters or notebooks , remembered cliches and lurid , melodramatic scenes of unmotivatedmob violence and senseless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French Revolution had come from A Tale of Two Cities , and Rafael Sabatini 's Scaramouche , his history lessons in third year of high school , and scraps of remembered allegations and facts from newspapers , magazines , and movies . And he had thought of the French Revolution as an outburst of mob violence and of feeling against the Church , which had resulted in persecutions . Napoleon he had seen separately from the Revolution , and he 'd never thought much of a connection . But he 'd never thought much , or scarcely at all , of the French Revo-lution - until he matriculated at the University . Eddie had few real ideas about history , but a fair number of generalities , prejudices , distorted impressions , and subjective admirations and antipathies , and these , like odds and ends stuffed into an attic , were what history had meant to him . This in spite of the fact that he had acquired , mostly in a random and unintended fashion , much information about the events of history , dates , facts , chronological sequences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in books which usually had a dull colored binding . He was only in the process of losing this preconception when he began to take Professor Carleton 's course . And his awakening memory was one of the most important events of his life . It was something which was happening every day , and which had been happening for over a year . And because of it , he was able to bear the strain , the grind , the restraint , the loneliness of his life better than he otherwise could have . The youth with thickp133glasses , and a touch of wonder in the far-away , dreamy , absentmindednessof his weak eyes , with curly hair and a thin boyish face , who looked far too young to show the determination suggested by his chin , or the sensuality which his lips bore witness to , came and went at the University , carrying his briefcase stuffed with books and notebooks , spoke little because he was too shy and did n't know what to say , and was spoken to but little because he somehow did n't inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like a dull grind , as innocent as he might be uninteresting . Eddie was growing . The roots of his growth were beginning to push up into his consciousness , and break through , as into sunlight and air . He was expanding from within . Eddie was becoming a new , a different Eddie . And also , as he grew , his loneliness could only become more poignant . Growth could only separate him more from those he had known who were not growing . And Eddie was having sex on his mind too much . He could fight sex impulses in himself for years , until he got married , could n't he ? But how did he know that he ever would get married ? Judging by his whopping successes in getting dates , how could he describe his future prospects as promising , or should they even be considered as prospects at all ? Whatever the prospects were , marriage was and would have to remain years off in the future . How could he not go nuts if he should have to practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or did n't , then he 'd be guilty of a mortal sin . This was clear , beyond all doubt , and there were no moderating circumstances . But merely to think of this put him into a slough of gloom . It was hard , damn hard , too damned hard to be a Catholic , and he found himself wishing , as he had often wished in boyhood days when he 'd been tormented by the fear of having made a bad confession , that he were n't a Catholic . It was harder to be a Catholic because you knew , too clearly , the lines between what was and what was n't a mortal sin . This was why he sometimesfell into his dark moods , and became so glum and gloomy and full of pessimism . He knew too clearly the difference be/tween a sin and what was n't a sin , and between a mortal sin and a venial sin . He knew what he should do , and what he should n't do . And how could you live and avoid occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were , sure as hell and high water , going to commit sin , at least he was . And if he did avoid them , he would commit sins of thought and desire , and these , also , could be mortal sins . It was sex , the sixth commandment , Thou shalt not commit adultery . It set you in a battle with yourself , and you never won it , or lost , either . The war did n't stop , and forgetting was only a truce . Eddie knew that it was best not to think of the whole question , and that was what he tried to do . Whenever he was able to throw himself totally into study , he succeeded , but that was n't always possible , not for him , or , perhaps , not yet . Here was one of his problems , the battle of his own will over himself . He had to make his mind obey his will , and he was n't a saint , and knew that he never would be one . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of " The desire of the moth for the star , " but , also of sex and laying a girl , except , no , he did n't like the word " laying . " What substitutedid he like ? He did n't know , he could n't be sure . And every night , he saw the girls go by , alone , or sometimes in pairs , walking slowly , not strolling , but merely taking slow , very slow steps , as though they did n't at all want to be walking , and had no place to go , no destination . The way they walked was like wearing a red light , and he guessed this made it easier for guys to approach them , and it was a means of attracting the attention of men in the cars always zooming by on Michigan Avenue . By eight o'clock , they started coming out , and as the clock ticked close to eight , he 'd start to get a little nervously distracted , and he 'd begin looking up from his books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen by chance , or just to happen , half-thinking that maybe he 'd speak to one , and tell her " Yes , Babe , come back at midnight and stay right there on the sidewalk , and I 'll be ready , Babe , ready to get right out of my shoes . "  |p135He  kept imagining himself doing this , and getting it done and over with , so he could concentrate more easily on study . He did n't do it . Night after night passed . He still did n't do it . The fact that it would be a sin was not the only reason why he did n't , and he was inclined to believe that the fear of sin was the least of the reasons . A venereal disease , the clap or syphilis , would be a lousy kind of bad luck to catch , and he was afraid of that kind of bad luck , especially of syphilis . There was safety and he kept meaning to buy some Merry Widows at a drugstore and he 'd forget , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugstore and asking for them . And would n't it be sordid , paying , getting , getting off ? And he did n't do it , but only thought of it , imagined it happening , planned to do it and then he could n't , and he 'd be breathless and sweating under the armpits , and his heart would start up like an overworked engine , palpitating , and he 'd be helpless , like someone afraid of ghosts , like a hick , a yokel , helpless , quivering , and almost dizzy . It would go , he 'd relax , resume his studying , and be glad and proud of himself . There was masturbation , but he 'd beat that , and stopped it before he was twenty-one , and that was one of his best victories , because it had used to leave him disgusted as well as ashamed and guilty about a mortal sin . A few of the girls became recognizable ; they were regulars , on a beat . One was the little , light tan one with the shabby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , the black bobbed hair and bangs . She was almost a beauty , and she 'd come every night , sometimes with a taller , darker , blacker one who wore a black cloth coat and high , high heels that made it difficult for her to walk , and funny to watch . The littler one , when alone , or else the two of them , would stand outside , near the corner , and wait , with their eyes peeled on the passing automobiles . The sight of the two prostitutes waiting to be picked up would work upon his blood and titillate him . He would try to keep his eyes on his book , but he kept watching , and hoping that the pickup would happen very quickly . It usually did , but on a couple of nights , the wait was about a half-hour , and Eddie wasp136distracted with interest . But he was more sad with pity than he was excited as the two of them stood in the dim glare of light from the station sign , and the automobiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their weight from foot to foot , turning their heads , moving a few feet in one or the other direction , tapping a toe or heel on the sidewalk , swinging a pocketbook , gesturing , and waiting before the eyes of every passing stranger who must have known on sight that they were two whores waiting for trade . If they turned toward the station , he 'd avert his glance in strangely shy embarrassment , and he 'd wish for the pickup to happen quickly , immediately . The sight of them would pull at him , until he was helplessly sorry and sad , and full of a pity that he could n't very well express . And there were others , a hefty blonde , middle-aged and hideously made-up ; a skinny white girl who seemed to him sad to the marrow of her bones ; a kinky-haired , buxom black girl who wore a white fur piece and looked somewhat like a dolled-up African savage ; a fat white woman who always laughed loudly and coarsely ; girls and women , pretty and otherwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the night out to sell the use of their bodies and organs as he sold gasoline and motor oil . Gradually , he was becoming less physically affected and roused , and more moved and hurt by the sight of them . They were girls and women , and he wanted girls to be creatures who walked in sun and brightness and were the image of all the beauty of the world . They hurt him with the heavy impact of prosaic reality of life which seemed leaden with disillusionment . Thinking of the whores , seeing them , going home after he had closed the station , snatches of poetry , verses , lines , phrases would come to his mind. ... she was made to bruise and bless Swift as the swallow along the rivers light . And many times , this line from Byron would run through his mind : With silence and tears.  |p137There  was one fact about Eddie Ryan which differentiated him from so many others , from most other people whom he knew , but Eddie did n't even think of it , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could n't realize it as such . His mind and his emotions were more active than the minds and emotions of people he knew , more so than those of a majority of the students who sat in the same classrooms as he did . He was thinking more , feeling more , responding to others , to what he read , to what he heard said , to his own memories and flow of thoughts and feelings , without let-up , day after day . Nothing was casual to Eddie , and even the casual details of work , the people he serviced , the figure of a man or woman passing by on the sidewalk in front of the service station , people on a bus or an elevated train , an odd pronunciation of a word by a customer , a chance and unexpected remark , all this he was hearing , catching , absorbing , and soaking in like a sponge , and anything which he caught with his senses or which even flickered for an instant in his mind , could affect and influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any human being can be so affected , but with many , powers of absorption close up . There are different intensities in people , and intensity is not a separate trait but rather a changing , an ever-changing energy of the consciousness , a force of response and of all the play of the living awareness of a person . Eddie 's intensity was not revealed in quick responses , but rather as a steady force of energy within himself . As such , it could deceive him and others . A few years earlier , when he played end with St. Basil 's High School team , he had seemed so slow , one of the slowest men on the squad , yet in a game , he would always get where he should be in time , and when covering punts , he would be down the field , even on one of Kid Coyle 's fifty-yard boots . His intensity was like the unexpected speed he used to show on the gridiron.  |p138His  future . It meant and it would have to be more than success and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of himself soaring above and beyond the farthest star . And did n't this seem like a preposterous joke on a dark day in October , when the rain was cold and each drop hitting your face was like a mean sting . The visible world was a terrible swamp , the sky was dismal and the low clouds were streaked with dirt . People on the sidewalk seemed pathetic , and many hurried along . Open black umbrellas moved like toys simulating weirdness . The day was just miserable all around , and it made people look as miserable to him as he felt . He got off the bus at 42nd Street and Michigan Avenue , and walked with lowered head toward the station a block away , carrying his heavy briefcase , and thinking of the long damp hours that separated him from home , sleep , and the end of that long day . He was tired , and the dreariness of the day was settling inside him . Entering the station , he said " Hello " dully , Jameson 's delayed return greeting sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his spirits . But he perked up with hope . The raw , mean day meant lots of time for himself . And the Old Man had the pot-bellied stove going , shedding warmth across the station . There 'd be plenty of time for study this afternoon and evening . He went inside one of the closets to change to old clothes , and put on his company overalls . The room smelled of the old , used , oily and grease-smeared overalls which were hanging on the hooks . It was mildly depressing . Eddie hurriedly made the change of clothes , and came back into the station . The Old Man stood looking at the sodden day through the glass of the front door . Jameson turned as Eddie walked forward , putting on his black-topped Rawlinson Company cap , but did n't speak immediately . Catching an angry , but also hurt , stare in Jameson 's small gray eyes , Eddie 's thought was trapped in his mind for a moment . He had been thinking that Jameson was an old man .   " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth to speak , but the Old Man con-tinued : " Youth ! You young fellows ! I do n't know what the hell 's happening to this damned world . " " What 's the matter ? " Eddie asked , finding his tongue . The Old Man scowled but was silent . Eddie could feel himself getting tense with anger . His lips stiffened , he was pale , and he could almost feel his self-control ebbing out of him . " Do n't be so lazy , goddamn , shake a leg ! " " What the hell .... " " Oh , here , take the money . Everything 's done . Take this , " Jameson said with an intolerant lack of patience ; he handed his belt and money changer to Eddie . What could he say of the man 's conduct when it was so inexplicable , and utterly unexpected . He buckled the belt on and Jameson shoved a roll of dirty bills at him . " I do n't know how you 'd manage without me to protect you . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't watch your business . You do n't watch what you 're doing . " " I do too ! " The Old Man stuck a hand into a striped overall pocket in the back by the right hip , and drew forth the cap of a gas tank , dull with lack of polish and marked with tinges and touches of rust . " What 's this ? " he snapped . " Where did it come from ? " " Where did it come from ? Where in hell do you think ? Where did I get that ? It fell out of the sky like a hailstone or chip off a comet , I guess . " " You do n't have to get so damned cranky , " Eddie said . " Who the hell you talking to ? " Jameson blew out loudly and his anger was a simulation of meanness . Eddie did n't want to call the Old Man . He was afraid . Maybe he was . His growing loss of control was like vertigo . The pause between them was but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the quarrel and into a reawareness of their duties as Rawlinson employees . The Oldp140Man started to belabor Eddie for not being on the ball , then shut up and turned to run out to the waiting dark-colored automobile , the make unrecognizable from where Eddie stood . Eddie took a couple of quick steps , then brought his right foot down hard on the stone floor , and stood rigidly still.  --  Why the goddamn .. . " The goddamned Old Fart ! " Eddie let out in a rage . Eddie 's blasphemous outburst was like an explosive release . The Old Man was pumping ordinary gas into the black car . He came rushing in with two dollars which he handed to Eddie . " Seven gallons , " he said . Eddie gave him the change , and Jameson hurried out to the customer . Eddie stood in a confusion of distress . He did n't know what to say next to Jameson , or what the Old Man would say . He did n't want to have more hard words but he might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sad resolution was forming in his mind as the Old Man came back into the station and the dark car drove out of the driveway . " I have to hurry now and do some shopping . I made out the audit . Watch your change . " " Yes , " Eddie muttered , half under his breath ; Jameson 's voice had been crisp and curt , but with pathos . The Old Man had crossed the station , and he disappeared into the little toilet room opposite the front door . Soon , Eddie heard water running in the sink behind the closed door of the toilet . The Old Man would be out of the station pretty quickly , in a few minutes . Eddie , almost nervously , wanted him out . He never did feel fully at ease with Jameson , and every day , on reporting for duty here at the station , he would be in the same kind of state of uncertainty and embarrassmentabout his job and the Old Man , but some days it would be more , others less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jameson had the jump on him , and took authority into his own hands , although they were now equal in status and position , and they shared responsibility for the way this station was run . But Jameson took over and acted like the boss , and would never listen to Eddie , but rather told him what to do . This re/lationship gnawed at Eddie in a small but persistent manner For long , he 'd wanted to change it , and did n't know how . There were Jameson 's feelings . It was postponed , Eddie thought , hearing the water still run ' ling in the wash bowl . He was half regretful . He could tell himself :  --  Wait , the day will come . But Jameson liked him . That voice of his , a moment ago , wa not without hurt , the pained hurt which had become a mark o life , like the indelible sign of confirmation on the soul . There was a wrench of what was more than sorrow , or pain , o : sadness : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what lifi should not be . An automobile drove in to be serviced , and Eddie hurried ou to it . He was glad for several successive cars , which prevented more talk with the Old Man . Jameson called a " So long " to him a though there had been no scene , and Eddie believed that he wa passing the episode off into forgetfulness as he talked a heavy set , frowning man into having his Oldsmobile drained . Eddie caught a glimpse of Jameson trudging off along the dirt , slickness of the wet sidewalk , a little man growing slowly moll dim in a gradually increasing distance of oppressive , dismal dirty day . A man walking , an old man walking away from work on a day when all the dreams of the world had died the death o vanishing shadows . The world was heavy with itself . But Eddie had a crankcase to drain . A pelting rain came down from a sky which was sagging witl its own useless weight of leaden time , and loosened on him the careless insulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate from all the dreams of youth , the desire to hope , t ( believe : That nothing walks on aimless feetAnd that , particularly , Eddie Ryan would n't walk on aimles feet . And not walking on aimless feet , as Jameson walked , h ( would carry within himself : The mighty hopes that make us men.  |p142He  wanted to keep feeling like that ; but being drenched , he had the feeling of being very dirty . He quickly washed his grimy hands , changed clothes , overalls , and shoes ; he kept an extra pair of old shoes for such emergencies as this . The station was warm , and Eddie 's depression melted in the heat which radiated from the pot-bellied stove . If little things tried his very soul , what could he and all his hopes be worth ? It was merely a miserable and rainy day , getting dark early . Eddie studied history , but his interest was neither as quick nor as keen as it had been during the previous weeks . In Professor Carleton 's class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had gone on to the Congress of Vienna , the Holy Alliance , and the period of conservative reaction which had set in upon Europe after the Battle of Waterloo . The image of Napoleon was in his mind , and thoughts of lessons concluded lingered in his memory because they had dealt with the Emperor . When the Revolution broke out , Bonaparte was only twenty . The afternoon light had all but faded into the murkiness of premature October darkness . Eddie had switched on the station lights , inside and outside , including the overhead Rawlinson sign at the edge of the driveway by 43rd Street . The rain had slackened into a slow , pitiless , steady , silent drizzle . The day seemed to be ending without even having begun . It was not night , but rather night had escaped the day , robbed it with a lack of concern , as cold as the rain had been ; it had come too soon , and squashed day with a relentlessness that was like the extreme of unrelenting conquest . Darkness , ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of its qualities of being time , as death robbed men of the qualities of time . It was about seven minutes after four . It was unacceptably early . Lights went on in more windows along Michigan Avenue , not only to see by , but also to give brightness where a glow of life was sought . Eddie was studying , but with his mind resistant to full concentration . After Napoleon , after la gloire , Eddie had believed that the next phase of European history , the Holy Alliance and Era of Metternich would sag in interest , and be too dull to ap/peal to him . He 'd expected that his will power would be tested , and he had n't been sure that he 'd come through the test with his colors flying at their highest . The Old Man had affected him because Eddie could n't understand why Jameson had started lighting into him . You could n't say it had been fair . He had been ready to stand up to Jameson , and yes , he had stood up , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that . But the unfairness of the old guy , the way Jameson had snapped at him , kept cropping up in his mind . Not only did n't he like to admit being hurt , but he feared that if you let anyone hurt you , that was a weakness in your armor . And Jameson had seemed to bother him . The way he behaved , he was letting the Old Man run him , lay out rules and instructions , boss him . To let someone order you around was n't a sign of strong character , and Eddie Ryan , Edward Arthur Ryan , must have , he had to have a strong character . For a long time , weeks , since September , and perhaps even earlier , he 'd had the feeling that there 'd have to be a showdown . It was like fear , like weakness , his disinclination for the showdown . Thoughts like these , when he came to think of it , had come pretty often to his mind , and they kept coming back , and coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to happen , and something would have to be done about it . Putting thoughts like these out of his mind was only postponement . And what he was postponing was the assertion of his own independence . Napoleon Bonaparte probably had n't been any taller than Jameson . Jameson was acting like a Little Napoleon with him . Eddie lowered his eyes to his book . And Napoleon Bonaparte lingered in his mind , a name , and an image more vague than a ghost , a ghostly hero who should have won . When the Battle of Waterloo had been reached in Professor Carleton 's course , Eddie had found himself wishing and hoping that Napoleon would be the victor . Then , for a moment , it was as though history had ended . He 'd walked out of the classroom full of a brooding sadness , a sadness that was like a fog . Then he'dP144told himself that Napoleon had lost the Battle of Waterloo and had died in lonely far-off exile on St. Helena , but his glory was imperishable . Napoleon had won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon than he thought , and he was still learning , and had much more to learn before he could think about Napoleon , or about many other historical figures , questions , theories , and issues before he could know many answers . And Napoleon was one of the figures in history about whom he wanted to learn more . You gave up hearing about Napoleon , and if you wanted to say that somebody was crazy , you could say that he thought he was Napoleon . That was how great Napoleon was . Of course , he believed that Napoleon had been maybe the greatest man who 'd ever lived . And he liked Napoleonthe way you like some characters in history , and do n't like others . But he wanted to know why . The rise and even the fall of Napoleon absorbed and compelled his interest because it was so dramatic . It was a story of so much greatness and glory , of such a meteoric rise and sudden fall . Napoleon was Emperor of the French , and you liked the French , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Germans . It was that , and fighting against odds , and it was a fame and glory so far beyond what you could ever attain for yourself . Napoleon had just been Napoleon . Eddie wished he could be like that , that he could have energy and coldness , could work the way Napoleon could , and carve for himself a name as Napoleon had done . He wished that he could be a great man . Behind the ghost of Napoleon 's image lingering in his mind , there was the ghost of Eddie 's secret hopes and wishes of what he wanted to be . The last faintness of daylight had gone . It was dark like night and the cold drizzle continued , filling the dark air with dots and falling lines of gray . The cars went humming , honking , swishing by ; some had skid chains , and left the echo of a monotonously ringing sound repeating itself with irregular frequency . The chains ding-ding-dinged in Eddie 's mind , and he was meaning/lessly conscious of them as he continued to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the world where he was physically present at these moments , was , like the friction of chains on the cement street , meaninglessly present in his consciousness . The real present was Europe of the Holy Alliance and the Restoration , and St. Helena where the once Emperor Napoleon lived on in guarded exile while his glory and his power were no more . Eddie was grasping at this past , at charactersand events , and the meaning which it embodied . What had gone could not be brought back , Napoleon 's eve of glory , or the Europe which had been , before the Bastille was stormed on July 14 , 1789 . The illusion grew upon him that all of those years from 1789 to the death of Napoleon in 1821 had not vanished , totally and completely ; they could be regained , awakenedfor him , as though he were and had been a spectator of the actual events of history which he was studying . There had been few cars to interrupt him . He had shaken the ashes in the stove and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed it down with water . Soon , a black Ford two-seater coupe was driven into the station and parked.  --  What the hell 's he coming around for now ? Eddie exclaimed to himself . Deacon , one of the two supervisors , had driven into the station . Looking up from the book on the desk , Eddie waited , but Deacon took his time  --  his usual delay before getting out of his car . He always seemed to fumble with something or other . Eddie believed that Deacon had taken a correspondence school course in psychology and leadership . But Deacon 's psychological monkey business did make you nervous ; the guy was a boss . He came from somewhere on the North Side , had started in pumping gas , and had been promoted to an inspector , a supervisorearning two hundred dollars a month , who visited a regular territory of stations daily , made up the money bag to be picked up by the armored truck , checked over the daily audit , jacked up the attendants , gave orders about keeping the stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pro/motion had been the consequence of drag , or so went the rumor , and Pat Keefe had n't had any use for him . Neither did some of the attendants . His manner was often snotty , and he ragged and kept on the tail of some of the men , but he did n't turn in bad reports unless he believed positively that he had to do it . He was certain that all attendants sometimes pulled the pumps , that is , gave short measures of gasoline , but if this was kept within limits , he was like the three dumb monkeys . He himself had pulled the pumps , to make up shortages , or for a meal or an extra buck once in a while , and that was only human . But robbing , going root-tootin ' wild and gypping damned near every customer who came into a station , that was being a hog , and hogs belonged in the stockyards , not in a Rawlinson Service Station . He regarded himself as regular , as regular a fellow as his job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coupe , finally getting out of it , and walking the very short distance to the front door . " Hello , Ryan . " " Hello , Mr. Deacon . " The greetings were spoken as though with much cordiality , but were instinct with a lack of it . The supervisor was dressed to get a baggy stylish effect , and his dark gray suit and light gray top coat were loose-fitting . His gray hat was slanted to the right , with the brim turned down , and enhanced Deacon 's plain , angular and homely features with an air of personality ; the rakish hat took away the sissy effect of his big , horn-rimmed glasses . Deacon was a young man who wore his clothes as part of his character and personality . He carried his conceit in these clothes as much as he did in himself . He was slender , taller than he seemed , and his gestures , carriage and walk were all singularly graceless . When he looked at some people , and definitely at Eddie Ryan , he appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greeting , Deacon stood for a short moment , as though powerful in the silence of his authority and position . Eddie waited , wondering what Deacon had on him , or was goingp147to gripe over and show himself to be a boss about . Deacon glanced about the station . It was clean and orderly . The Old Man always would have made sure to that , and Eddie did n't have much to do in keeping the station in the proper condition . " Lousy night , ai n't it , Ryan . " " Yes , it is , Mr. Deacon , " Eddie said.  --  Why in hell are you out in it , snooping . " Excuse me , I got to take a good crap badly . " Deacon said this as though he and Ryan were quite intimate , and the toilet were a common source of that intimacy . He crossed over to the toilet , and went inside . Eddie was almost disconcerted . While Deacon remained in the station , he must wait in suspended time , on guard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape the feeling that he was or might be under scrutiny as an accused or suspected employee . His movements seemed unnatural , and he felt a caution and a guilt which was waiting about within him . The station , in one instant , became like foreign soil , and he like an alien who was there on sufferance . His dignity shrank into a dwarfed monstrosity of ugliness in his spirit . For an instant , he felt small , close to nothing . Through the window , he saw the dreary night , the dark buildingsacross the street , like shadows heavy with weight and material substance , broken by the rectangles of lighted windows , and a reflected play of moving shadowy light from a few passing automobiles . And with a slight adjustment of his glasses , he saw the visible side of Michigan Avenue . His sense of loneliness was a disconnectedness , a sense of separation of everything before and about him . It was a feeling related to where he was and what he was . He was a stranger in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed . But he resented its waste , even though it was only a minute . Eddie went back to his study , and stood over the desk , with a fountain pen in his hand , ready in case he wished to make any notes . Napoleon and Metternich , Talleyrand and Tsar Alexander , Louis XVIII , and Stein , he knew them better than he did Deacon . And Paris , Vienna , London , Berlin , St. Petersburg , thesep148were more understandable to him than the corner of 43rd and Michigan . The minutes of life here on the corner were falling into the rainy night . But the minutes of life of all the men in the history he was studying had fallen away , too , as in a night . Only their minutes had fallen into history . What were these living minutes falling into ? Napoleon , the minutes of his life had fallen , but not into darkness . The toilet door opened . A moment before , Eddie had heard the flushing sound of water . But he had heard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoing from a wall on the far side of his concentration . His nervousness and anger had quickly subsided , he feared that they would rise again , come upon him and beset him . " Ryan , " he heard , and the tone of Deacon 's voice was a snotty one . Eddie turned from the desk , hoping that Deacon would have little to say , and would leave quickly . " You do a lot of reading here in the station while you 're on duty , do n't you ? " " Studying , it 's study for my courses at the University . Mr. Wood gave me permission to . " At the moment , Deacon did n't like Ryan . The sight of Ryan reading had hit him when he 'd opened the toilet door , and dislike had flared up , as paper will when a match is put to it . But Deacon knew that he must keep the controls on himself and stay in low gear.  --  I wish I had more men like Ryan in my stations , Mr. Wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that Mr. Wood never said anything like that about him , and he was doing a good job , while this kid Ryan had n't been with Rawlinson six months yet , or anyway no longer than that . Deacon did n't see where in Hell Ryan was all that smart . What was he , Whirlwind Ryan ? But he was uncertain about his attitude toward Ryan because of Mr. Wood . Deacon 's respect and admiration for Mr. Wood were most genuine , and since last June , when Mr. Wood had come in to replace Pat Keefe , the new boss had shownp149plenty of times that he had a lot of stuff on the ball . And he was a pretty keen judge of men . Deacon himself owed his promotionto Mr. Wood . There was a man to look up to , and be guided by , the first in Joe Deacon 's life . His own father was a Presbyterian minister , and he smarted and burned with shame because of his father 's profession and name . To be known as " the minister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Four Eyes . " Deacon had cause for suffering such silent humiliation . Boys whose fathers were businessmen , or lawyers or doctorscould more easily be popular than he . Four-Eyed Deacon had two eyes to see with for himself and two more to see for his father and for God . So some of the boys spoke of him in Ravenswood and in various North Side neighborhoods . He had to prove over and over again that he was a regular kid , and not a goody-goody snitcher , but proof and demonstration did not always win him a place equal to that of many of the other boys . For the mere fact that he was a minister 's son could frighten many kids . He was a remote reminder of Hell 's fire , punishment , a walking inspiration to fear . He was Bad News from the Bible . None of the kids , who made of him a walking stigmatic , grasped the cruel unfairness heaped upon him . Joe was a threat , a warning , and reminder of the burning fires in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your old man , I mean Reverend Deacon , to pray you out of Hell and where 'll we be , gettin ' our asses burned all to blisters ? Tommy Hope , undersized at twelve , told this to Joe in an alley when Joe was urging that a group of boys get three girls who would show what they had if the boys would do the same . Two days later , Joe Deacon had been told by a ten-year-old kid , who 'd seen everything through a window , that Tommy Hope had arranged for the exposure party with the three girls in a basement , and had sworn everyone not to tell a word of it to Joe Deacon . He 'd cursed Tommy Hope with every blasphemous and obscene word he knew , but retained a measure of control ; he had n't announced that he would drop-kick , punt-kick , and double-kick the living shit out of Tommy Hope , and then gone looking for him instantly . That was what he wanted to do.  | " They just looked at each other , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little dingle , " Young Newcastle , the kid , said . Joe Deacon laughed meaningfully . Young Newcastle gawked at Joe in slow-growing awe . " You mean , you , you ... " " Weinie . I 've put my weinie where a weinie goes . " The awe became admiration . Joe Deacon crossed his legs , leaned against a strong wire fence , a homely boy with a mop of blond hair , and with the glasses he hated on his big nose . Joe could see , all right , that Young Newcastle , not a bad little goof , believed him , and did n't at all suspect any bull or crap . How easy some kids could be fooled , and not only Young Newcastle , either , Tommy Hope would fall , hook , line , and sinker , and he 'd be the biggest fish that Joe Deacon had hooked . Deacon 's uneven teeth showed momentarily in a harsh grin , the best he could do for a smile at that moment . Trying again , he could n't smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distorted in a grimace that lasted no longer than a breath . " Yah gon na kick it outta him , Joe ? " " Maybe . If he 's worth it . " If he busted Tommy on the jaw , that would be the end of it , and he 'd be respected . He was half-tempted , no , tempted to do it , bust the hope and hell out of Tommy Hope , but he knew he would n't . Joe was n't afraid of Hope , but he was of his old man , and the Reverend John S. Deacon had administered three whalings to Joe , one per fight about which the Reverend had heard . Each whaling had been successively more severe than the previous one , and , as his father put it , he could decide which cheek he 'd turn , the Lord 's cheek , or the Devil 's cheek , which was a back-end one . And Joe Deacon did n't think he wanted those cheeks at the back end to burn any more . Not even the Devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the fear of a burning backside alone that kept Tommy Hope from getting a poke on the nosep151that would n't be anything to hope for . Joe wanted to do things differently.  --  The Lord 's way , he gagged to himself . Not the Lord 's way , really and truly , but the lording-it-over way , that was what he meant . He , Joe Deacon , did n't want to be the lone wolf , the kid all by himself because his father was the Lord 's man , and once he made the kids understand that his father 's being a minister did n't make him an advance J.C. , the Lord , and that he had a harder time of it than they did , then everything would be different , the way he wanted things to be . Then Tommy Hope would say he was sorry and apologize . And it would be Joe Deacon , not Tommy Hope . They would n't know , none of the kids , that he 'd batted an eyelash with any green-eyed jealousy . They 'd see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing to Joe Deacon , a kid more important than they were , and not afraid , one hell of a hell of a hell of a minister 's son . Joe refrained from taking a solid poke at Tommy Hope , and Mrs. Hope , Tommy 's pain-in-the-neck , **52;4432;TOOLONG , would n't be coming to see his old man to find out , oh , dear , what had been done to her precious hope , Tommy . With a boy 's quickness to forget , Joe Deacon 's thoughts were all chortles . The joke was his ; he owned it , all of it . The chortles came up out of him and he was loudly horselaughing , all the way down the alley . So he was " the minister 's son ? " What was Tommy Hope ? He horselaughed louder down the alley . Tommy Hope was " Mrs. Hope 's son . " He walked off , hands in pockets , peering with contempt at the street and the stones and rough-edged bricks of the buildings , walking with no destination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tommy Hope pretty sad and weary , hopeless , and then , he was dreaming of growing up , his mind pushing time aside like a snowplow cleaning a street after a storm , and he was on a clean , clear street , walking along just like he owned it , and he did own it , because it was the street of his manhood.  |p152He  was striding now , and watch his smoke . He 'd fart it out of his ass , smoke blown bull's-eye into the nose of Tommy Hope . Before Joe Deacon reached that manhood , which he had been so impatient for in his growing years , there were many more hard and hurting experiences . Not until he was crowding his nineteenthbirthday did Joe Deacon lose the stigmata of " the minister'sson . " This was success , big success for him . He gained acceptanceamong many of his own age . It was what he had been impatiently waiting for , his goal , and his achievement . And overnight his father changed like a tire going flat , and Reverend Deacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red now . He was a man gone meek in the **25;4486;TOOLONG of God , fussy , always repeating himself with the same jokes , the same sermons , the same conversation at the table , a minister gone bald and slack of muscle , and exuding failure in life as though it were an odor of stale food . And he had , in short pants , sometimes been terrified by his father , and for reasons other than the whalings on the cheeks ; his father had spoken as Joe imagined God would have ; his father had spoken God 's words of doom , of that awful last Day of Judgment , and of the burning punishment that the sinner would suffer , forever and forever and forever always , which was eternity . While still young , Joe heard too many sermons of his father , and then the Reverend John S. Deacon was brimful of hell-fire and the damnation of predestination . At that time , Reverend John S. Deacon was in possession of brown hair so dark that it looked black ; he was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleshy body and a face which was slack and frequently set in frowns . When he stood before the lectern , the frowns and scowls were as though they had become solidified grimness , and a number of the brethren and sisters felt from warm to hot at the sight of him . The usual attendance ranged from seventyfiveto three-fifty , and an occasional four hundred , and the proportionof those who were pre-affected by the sight of the man of cloth , even before he began his sermon , was correspondingly changing . The sermons of that time had the brethren and sisters feeling " the everlasting bonfire . " Joe Deacon 's soul burned every Sunday , and it burned when the Reverend talked about hisp153sermons and practiced them . Joe felt as did the boys and girls who called him " the minister 's son . " In Chicago and its suburbs , the Devil took advantage of Reverend John S. Deacon 's fiery thunder of words about the heat in the nether geography of eternity . Satan pulled the brethrenand sisters away from Sunday morning church services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell . And the Reverend stoked the fires with more sticks , and more sticks , until one could have wondered if God were creating sufficient sticks to supply the timber wood for the roaring flames of the Reverend John S. Deacon 's holocaust in Hell . He complainedand lamented the abandonment of God as exemplified in the decline of his Sunday church attendance . The Reverend 's ambitions were lofty . In order to fulfill their loftiness , he would have to loft himself . He would be the kind of man who lofted himself to loftiness.  --  Oh , I say , my brothers , and I say to you , my sisters , look up , look up to God . This was one of his favorite means of making his sermons an inspiration , of imbuing them with the loftiness which he saw as his mission , his vocation , his role , his dedication , and the essenceof all that he was preaching and all for which he lived . When he would utter this sentence in a sermon , as he did so often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were seeing through it , and his vision extended to the throne of the Maker of men and the Dispenser of their fates and destinies . And his fleshy face would shine , too , with the benignity of a man who was shining in the divine grace of God . His voice would quaver and the very words seemed to shake with gratitude to the God who would save the soul of Reverend Deacon himself , the stoker of souls for the blazing blisters of Hell . He would become more of this earth as he lofted himself through the process of time that was moving as mercilessly as Hell 's fires were burning , moving mercilessly to the Day of Judgment , when the lofty would be in loftiness and the rest would be but the timber for flames the like of which had never been seen by human eyes on the earth that God had given for manp154during his life of sinning and strutting where vanity was vanity and all was that same , sure , selfsure vanity . He would loft to a better church , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bank account would loft as would his home and the black suits which he wore . But the Reverend Deacon did not loft himself from these lesser loftings to higher loftiness ; he brooded , and he worried , and fell into long depths of silence . The brethren and sisters became fewer , and the collections at Sunday services jingled in deadly muted monotony . The Reverend Deacon 's home did not become Hell , or like Hell , under the circumstances of diminishing returns , but neither was it Heaven . It was the home of a minister who was growing poorer . In addition to his own , there were four other mouths to feed , appearances to be kept up , and Reverend Deacon found life unloftily annoying . Duty was duty and man had his duty , just as woman had her duties . That was God 's will and God 's way . The wife who did n't look after home and hearth and kith and kin , could surely look forward to that coming day of burning days , and the wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those ways and that Will of God , and thus , she must obey and serve Reverend Deacon and not complain . He told her that before she ever complained , she should think of the Armenians.  --  They are starving , dear Martha . Mrs. Deacon spoke of this subject , the starving Armenians , to several of the ladies at a church social , but one of them , Mrs. Haggershrift , said that her sister 's sister-in-law , Gladys Bell Mansonby , was married to an Armenian and he owned three six-flat apartment buildings . And he was n't starving and if you saw Gladys Bell , you would n't say that an Armenian starves his wife . Mrs. Deacon told the family of this at the dinner table , the Reverend , Joe , his kid brother Calvin , and the snot-nose kid sister , Hester , but the Reverend did n't approve of a woman of good American background and heritage marrying an Armenian . " Why are they starving the Armenians ? " Hester asked . " I suppose God wants them to starve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starve . " " Then why does n't He give the starving Armenians something to eat , Papa ? " Calvin asked . " When you die maybe you can ask God , " the father said . " I 'll ask Him , " Hester said . Reverend Deacon , who was in his shirt sleeves , looked at the dark-haired little girl with the shiny , fine , saucy eyes ; obviously wanting to say something authoritative and reprimanding , he did n't speak and almost smiled . They were eating fried hamburger steak and fried potatoes ; it was food , and probably good for the soul of every member of the family , because it was n't very appetizing , and when eaten , it was not the source of any pleasure . Hamburger was cheap , and that was why it was on their plain table . And they ate it , falling into a dreary silence , as so often they did while partaking of God 's victuals . Mrs. Deacon was a dreary woman sitting at the dreary family table . She had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same round of domestic chores to be attended to , and church tasks which her husband assigned to her . She did one thing after another , as she always said , and that was more or less her life , one thing after another . Mrs. Deacon was not an unhappy woman , precisely , nor was she a happy one either . On her round face there sat an expression of dull contentment . However , this was but a mask , and the feeling which it vaguely reflected , was a deception . A woman can not live without either joy or sorrow , except at the price of her nature going dry . She must feel , have feeling in her life , or else she becomes a woman whose nature is full of dry sand where there could have been bubblingsprings . And although her features were placidly resting in a cast of dull contentment , the dry sand in her was suggested by the pouting tenseness of her closed lips , and the lackluster of her eyes . She had married because of her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old maid , as much as for any other reason , and she had never come to know what she wanted in life , or what she might be like . Reverend Deacontreated her as a servant more than a wife , and the children were not close to her . She could n't be close to herself.  |p156As  circumstances worsened , and the Reverend drove away his Christian sheep with words of fire and brimstone , his wife would whine and complain , and then subside into meekness . He would blame his wife and family , and take out on them his disappointment , but this did not improve his lot , and a crisis was upon him . If he continued as he had been doing , he would burn into ashes his means of livelihood , and then what chance had he to loft himself ? He had to stoke the fires of Hell or else become a seedy minister , blistered by the flames of the fire he made and kept ablaze with the souls of others . He was in danger of burning himself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted itself , and he gradually shifted from the agonies of damnation to the God of service and success and the gospel of Jesus Christ , our Lord . The gradual change of the minister-father was a bane and a boon to the family . Hell hissed less , and he practiced unctuous smiles more frequently . He talked more of service and success , and less of the souls burned like black , destroyed flesh in flame . Economic circumstances slowly improved in a new church , and Reverend Deacon was away from home more often , doing his duty by trying to associate with businessmen , speaking , usually for fees of $25 to $50 , and trying his new , modern , up-todatemeans of lofting himself . Joe Deacon worked at odd jobs after school while attending high school on the North Side , almost was drafted to fight in the war , got a job in a Rawlinson service station when he was twenty , and at twenty-eight he was the Deacon who came out of the toilet while Eddie was studying history , and the October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was uncomfortableto human beings . He lived in his own apartment , and his family had moved to Aurora , Illinois , where his bald-headed father was still striving to loft himself , increased weight and all . Joe finally found it useful to be a " minister 's son . " This had helped him get his job with Rawlinson and to advance from the ranks . In Mr. Wood , he had met a man whom he could admire and look up to as he 'd been unable to look up to his own father . He was no longer ashamed of his father , especially since theP157Reverend Deacon was in Aurora , Illinois , and the old man had , at last , made a little headway in becoming somebody more than just average . The twist of Deacon 's thick lips was derisive , but not quite the sneer it could be taken for . And it was defensive derision . Deacon scarcely knew Eddie , and the general impression of the latter , in the main office , suggested that he was a good , clean young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy scouts were ambitious , eager to succeed , and accepting most of boy scouting except for notions of purity , temperance , and sexual continence , was afraid that Eddie would be what he himself secretly might want to be , and become what he should become . " What 's in the book , Ryan ? " " History . " The derision became a sneer , but Deacon changed this quickly to an insipid grin which was not without contempt . History , the idea of history vaguely aggravated Deacon , as it often does those who are lacking in sufficient education , and especially when they are coming up in the world . Deacon was such a one . A high school graduate only , who had wasted his natural brightnessand protected himself from being considered a goof or a sissy , he harbored a hidden rancor against history and many other subjects of knowledge which excited the highbrows , because they were n't regular fellows . Of what use was history , and would it help you get ahead in the world ? His attitude was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of confidence in himself . History was linked with his boyhood days and the Bible , as his father had spoken of and preached about the Old and the New Testaments , and in history where there were so many famous and brave men that he felt small merely thinking of it . These attitudes were very vague , and thus more than half lost from his mind , but his fear of history became derision of and antipathy to Eddie , and he walked across the service station to look at Eddie 's opened book and notebook in a mood of disdain which had no foundation other than sunken fear . Eddie wished that Deacon would leave , and apprehensively wondered what was coming . " Metternich , " Deacon exclaimed in a loud dismissal of thep158Austrian statesman and diplomat , or of history , or of study , or of Eddie , or of something . " He dominated the period after the downfall and abdication of Napoleon , and you ca n't understand what happened to Europe in the nineteenth century unless you know something about Metternich , " Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell ? " Deacon asked , each word a slicing cut . Eddie was gripped with a hard silence . He could n't answer and he could feel himself rising to a fighting mood . " Nobody in our outfit is against you getting your education , Ryan , " Deacon said , falling into an easy insincere smile while his dark eyes were searching . " But be sure you tend to business here on the job . Do that and we 'll get along and have no trouble . " " I tend to business , " Eddie said , flustered . " I did n't say you did n't . I 'm just saying to be sure and keep on doing it . We want to take first place here in the city . It 's good for all of us if we do . You can see that ? " " Yes : " Well , so long . " Deacon slouched out of the station and slowly went the short distance to his car . Eddie had mumbled a " Goodbye , " and stood still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he wanted to let go with it . Before Deacon stepped on the starter to drive out of the station Eddie went back to the desk and bent over the textbook , as though resuming his studying . He read words , but their meaning did n't register . Deacon drove out of the station . Eddie heard the engine . Eddie glanced up the moment he thought that Deacon 's car was gone . He saw the slanting rain , grayish in the station lights . Deacon was gone . Eddie drew a nickel out of his money changer , and went to the telephone by the side door . It was n't a dial phone . He dropped his nickel in , gave the number , heard the sound of the ringing , and a cheery masculine voice answered :  | " Brennan , Station io8 ... " " Ryan , " Eddie cut in . " Oh , hello , how are you , Ryan ? " " All right , Brennan . Deacon 's out snooping . He left here , going south . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ryan . So long . " " So long . " Eddie went back to his history textbook to study . The cold drizzle dried and ceased in a rough wind that made the cold a blowing force and banged the Rawlinson Oil and Refining sign . There were very few customers , and the volume of traffic on Michigan Avenue was small . At moments , Eddie , bent over his book , heard only the wind and the banging of the sign . Two or three of the girls came out , but quickly disappeared . Eddie caught the loneliness of the scene made desolate by wind and cold . Time scarcely moved while the wind roared with unsubduedfury until its force was spent and silenced against bush and stone . And Eddie studied . Napoleon had died in bitter exile on St. Helena . Waves must have smashed against the stones of that island lost in an ocean of water and an ocean of history ; and the winds must have screamed across St. Helena as though in literal mockery . Napoleon had heard many winds loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shattering roar had only been the shame of the silence of history . That was defeat , a silence full of shame that had no noise , no blast , no screech or scream from the depths of the world , no hording humans , a silence no explosion of the spheres could penetrate . Defeat was death with the heart pumping , blood flowing , eyes open and all of the senses , organs , functions , muscles , all of a man functioning in life . On St. Helena , Napoleon must have heard the wind , andp160heard the ocean waves rushing and breaking on rocky shores , and he must have heard the silence of history . Eddie thought of the phrase , " the silence of history . " And he heard the clang-banging of the Rawlinson sign , and the hard blowing and whizzing of the mass of wind . He was in the silence of history . And so was Deacon and old man Jameson , and his family , his grandmother , and uncles and aunt , and his dead father , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deacon is n't Napoleon , Eddie told himself as a Packard drove into the station . Rushing out to service the customer , a fancily dressed Negro , Eddie felt the cold prongs of the wind . He pumped ten gallons of gasoline into the car . He was far away from history . Maybe he was only a gas station attendant . Eddie could n't sell any oil , collected , walked back into the station , while the sign still slammed and rattled and the wind whined inhumanly . Why did he think he could break the thick silence of history ?  |p161Eddie  was fed up . He could n't go on as he had been doing . He must have a change . When he would wake up , his head still thick with the tiredness of sleep , this was how he thought . His grandmother had been saying to him , and often :  --  Son , you 're studying too hard to be a scholar . Sure , and you do n't want to be getting yourself sick . Eddie 's Uncle Larry had gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eddie did n't know what he was earning , but it seemed to be a good job with a shoe factory in Racine , Wisconsin , and he covered a number of Midwestern states , Wisconsin , Michigan , Illinois , Indiana , and Ohio . He had a larger territory , and he was due at the Hotel Muehlebach , in Kansas City . Eddie had n't forwarded his mail for several days , and knew that he must do it . His Aunt Jenny was supposed to , but she had been careless about this for years . Eddie promised he 'd do it , and was prompt , but for the past few days it had been as though he lacked the will to take the six or seven letters off the mail rack on the wall , near the front door , write the forwarding addresses on them , and drop them in the mailbox at the corner . At the filling station , he had the same feeling about several chores which were his to do , which he more or less liked because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time passed easily and pleasantly . But suddenly , he had become resentfulabout his cleaning , and several times , the decision to dop162necessary chores had been almost beyond his will . And he 'd become more careless , also , about collecting from customers , and screwing on the caps of gas tanks after pumping in gasoline . He ran shortages four or five times during each of the two weeks previous to the October morning on which he awakened so fed up and so strongly feeling the need for change . Eddie was getting more careless and forgetful of little details . His education depended on his job , and his having a good record , because it would have been utterly impossible to study as he did if he lost the privilege of reading while on duty . Eddie 's record was important beyond this necessity , for one of his plans was to stay with the company after completing his education , and to try to work his way up as close to the top as possible . But it seemed that he might be slipping . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected him , perhaps more than was warranted ; he took them as warnings of more to come . And , more important , Eddie was living with no let-up ; even on his day off , Monday , he studied and drove himself . These were small matters , but trifles which expressed the pressure of conflicts that were developing in himself and in his life . He wanted much and got but little . Day by day , Eddie was giving his youth , and , taking his third successive course of history , he had begun to absorb a poignant sense of the cruel speed of time . Was he giving up his youth , or losing it ? He was gambling , risking days and years for success and a place in the world , and all his sacrifices were for a hope and an ambition which was pushed far ahead in the uncertainty of the uncertain future . Was it all worth the cost ? Would he be able to go on paying such a price as he was paying , and survive ? Something was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie washed while his grandmother was preparing his breakfast . He found another dark day with the likelihood of gloomy , depressing weather . Hell , he ought to give up . He was fighting a losing battle . He was trying to do too much . His eyes could n't take it . Maybe his health could n't . Eddie 's mood was sinking downward , falling lower andp163lower . It was a bad mood , and through it he was giving himself release , discharging a surplus of feelings and expressing to himselfthe pangs of a great loneliness of spirit which he did n't want to admit to himself . Breakfast was ready when he went out into the kitchen , and his grandmother , such a little thing of a woman , said : " Oh , this weather , son . It gets in the marrow of me bones . " " Yes , " Eddie said . " You dress warm today for your work , son . " " I will . " The early morning was dark and heavy . It was too cheerless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brightness , as though it could feed all the hungers of his heart . Eating breakfast , Eddie thought of Deacon . Deacon did n't like him , he was sure of that . But why ? He had n't done anything , had he , which should cause Deacon 's dislike ? But neither did Eddie take to him . Fair is fair enough . That 's what his grandmother often said . And the Old Man , Eddie was irked by him , and his airs of being the boss . That would have to be stopped . But Eddie did n't want to say anything to him . It was as though he were afraid . He was afraid of him , was n't he ? Yes , he must be . That was his reluctant answer to his own question . It had to be fear when he was reluctant to put his foot down and tell Jameson to cut out his preposterous bossiness . And what kind of character did he have if he was afraid ? But Eddie did n't want a row , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make ? He was going in his own direction , and that was all that counted . " You 're quiet this mornin ' , son . " " What ? " " Are you well ? " " Oh , sure . I was thinking about my lessons , " Eddie told his grandmother . " You should n't be doin ' so much as you do . You do n't get your good sleep , son . " " I 'm all right , I 'm healthy . " But was he , and would he remain so if he kept up his pace ?  |p164That  was bothering Eddie . What could his constitution stand ? And his eyes ? Sometimes he 'd thought he might die young and in vain , before he had done all that he wanted to do , and learned and seen enough of the world ; he would die a failure , an unknown . His father , he had never had a chance . Had he ? Eddie finished breakfast , and felt better physically and quite awake . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on South Park Avenue . He thought of reading a few short poems while waiting , but he was restless and very troubled in mind . He got his briefcase ready , put his coat on , and looked out of the front window at the slowly lifting dark gray thickness of the drab new dawn across the street in Washington Park . The morning looked as lonely as he felt . Eddie thought of Napoleon on St. Helena , as he had done the night before , while on duty at his station . His soul was somewhere , seeing and watching the world , was n't it ? If he were in Heaven , he should be happy in the fame of Napoleon on this earth . And should n't he be in Heaven , not in Purgatory ? He had received the last rites of the Church . Would he know that a boy in Chicago , on a day massive with gray sadness , was thinking of him ? Boy ? He was a young man , twenty-one , one who had reached man 's estate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? For him , that was , as well as for others . He was about to puzzle over this question , when he heard the whistle of Peter Moore , and he rushed out of the apartment , yelling a " goodbye " to his grandmother . " It 's unpleasant , is n't it , Ed ? " Peter said . " Lousy . " They set out as usual , and in a moment were inside WashingtonPark , and could hear their feet crunching on the gravel walk . Eddie wanted to talk with Peter , but he did n't know precisely about what . His problems had become lost in a mood that was like a dense , obscuring fog . He was unhappy . That was somethingEddie did n't like to admit , even to Peter . Why should he be unhappy , if it were n't his own fault ? Admitting his unhappiness , complaining about it , that was confessing to a lack ofp165stiffness of his upper lip . It was more , of course . One of the many reasons for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have a girl , was n't that because he could n't get one ? There was much Eddie would n't admit . He did n't want to be seen as he was , but as an illusion which he was n't . They talked about Professor Carleton 's history course , and Peter said that he had n't done too well in the course , getting only a C. Eddie 's pleasure and sense of superiority were a little cheap , for he was expecting to get an A , and he 'd no sooner felt superior than he was a little ashamed of himself . " You 're doing wonderfully , Eddie  --  I admire you . " " That 's all I do  --  it 's my whole life , Peter . " " Yes , " Peter said thoughtfully , after a pause . " It must be hard on you . It is on me , and I 'm not working . Men are n't equal in life , are they , Eddie ? " " No , " he answered quickly , before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he thought of his father . All men are born equal  --  but are they ? It was a sentence from the Declaration of Independence ; he 'd never questioned it . " Some can run faster than others ; some are richer ; some can learn better ; the boys on 58th Street in my cousin 's bunch seem to be able to climb better . Equal to what ? " " I do n't know , " Eddie said reflectively , trying to think about that sentence , and Peter 's quick , almost nervous comments . " How much is true of what we were told and grew up believing ? " Peter asked . He had asked a question that was ripe within Eddie 's mind , yet he had n't thought of it . Instantaneously , he became angry and excited . But he did n't speak . He did n't know much . He 'd have to think . There were Babbitt , Babbittry , suspicion of books and ideas , suspicion and hatred of the University , and much else . " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They ca n't help it . How could Pop ever learn much , I ask myself ? " " And my old man . " " You and I are the first in our families to go to college . "  | " I was first to graduate from high school . " " My older brother , he went to Armour Tech . I 'm second . " They were walking on across the damp ground , and taking an irregular course to avoid some puddles . " And on campus , what are we ? Almost like the Jews , I guess , Eddie . Irish  --  from where ? They do n't know . " It was getting lighter all the time , but the weather remained cold and damp . When they got to the drive near Cottage Grove and the park exit , their mood had changed . They went on , saying little . Eddie 's old man , who spent so many years of his life as a teamster , had never failed to smile with gratified pleasure when he said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant work . Eddie sometimes thought of this remark of his father 's . There were plenty of times when he wished that he could turn his back on it , for good . But he was back at work now , after having had three days off . He did n't want to hurt Old Man Jameson , but his need for a change had become so urgent that he had asked Mr. Wood for a transfer to another station ; the reason he gave was that because of his heavy schedule he 'd like to work at a station which closed earlier . He had also asked for the three days ' rest , and Mr. Wood had agreed to both . Now his three days were memories without any particular significance . They must have done him some good , for he got more sleep than he 'd usually been getting , but not so much more that he had wallowed in bed . Eddie had asked for a few days off because he had sensed that he must not go beyond his limits . But unless he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men he knew , the Old Man , and many at the Express Company , there was the thought of his father , who went to his death in the spiritual anguish of a proud man , poor and knowing that he was beaten , defeated , and living out the final days of his defeat . He sufferedp167as Eddie had never seen anyone suffer . That was failure lived to the final apoplectic moment in a world that was pitiless and indifferent , and that talked of success and happiness while it pronounced , in contempt , the judgment that any man who failed had only himself to blame . Tragedy became shame . Eddie had been ashamed of his father . He could n't allow himself to fail . Knowledge was his great hope , and he was starved to know and to learn , far beyond his needs for the knowledge that could make him a success , save him from failure . He had given himself to the task of studying . But sometimes , Eddie thought of fellows he knew . They had good times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days : they did not feel , as Eddie did , that each minute must be a sum of " sixty seconds ' worth of distance run . " He had tried to be as they were . He still made the pretense that he was . And he desiredto make that pretense real . There had been Saturday nights when he had stood over the books laid on the station desk , and couples would pass outside , or a car would stop by one of the station pump islands , and a fellow and a girl , or two or three couples would be in the automobile . And he was working and studying . He had no date . He had no girl . He would walk back into the station and to his books , slowly . Eddie could only be sad and want to complain and cry out against the stars and the moon , and all of space , and all of time . Eddie had taken the big risk for a big try . At that time , that is , in October of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total risk . But he was . And his conduct , his actions were those of a young man whose choice in the game of life and destiny was the biggest of all choices . Actually , it was not merely success in life which Eddie was seeking ; it was destiny . He was not simply trying to get on in the world and up the ladder , to become a Mr. Wood , or someone above Mr. Wood , or a Jack McGlynn , his father 's first cousin , the lawyer and politician . He was n't even trying to be another Walter C. Rawlinson . He was embarked on the road of destiny of Eddie A. Ryan . It would be a long road , and it led far , far beyond the range of his vision . The strain Eddie suffered from day to day was that of destiny ,  |p168not  of overwork and restriction of impulse and pleasure . This he did n't know . He was not conscious of the full weight of his emotions . He had not separated success and destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he asked for his destiny , and he gave every minute , and every incident and episode , the meaning of destiny . However , Eddie had his three days . They were a truce between himself and the meaning of the minutes of time . He could spend them on campus , and he did . He could be like almost every other student , and he tried to be just that . The campus could be his world , the place through which his time flowed , and it was measured , hour after hour , by the cadences of the chimes . He was free to use his days as he decided , three of them in succession . Then , he must go to the new station on Wabash Avenue , and have a new partner . He 'd have to put in seven hours a day , seven days a week , but he 'd be through at nine o'clock every evening . And he 'd be away from Old Man Jameson , and that had to be , or he 'd either have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry because he saw , fixed in his mind , a clear image of a little man , broad and browned , gray , a little tight-lipped , meaning more than he said , speaking curtly , almost angrily , but intending kindness and friendship , givinghimself the airs of bossy importance because he was not important and was only the equal of twenty-one-year-old kids like Eddie , living for little pleasures and many duties , and bravely pretending that the years were not pitiless and pregnant with the seeds of death . But Eddie kept pushing this sorriness , the hurt of pity , out of his mind for those three days . Old age and death were remote , when he spent his entire days on campus and saw so many who were young , students , and he was still young . Now and then , he would discover himself thinking that neither the other studentsnor he could grow old , or , at least , not for so long a period that it would be virtually forever . The campus grew larger for him , and became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the world that he knew . By the end of the second day , he was serene , and knew a kind of happiness , evenp169in loneliness . The only pressure he felt was what he put on himself , the pace he set for study . Peter Moore did not take his lunch and they ate at the Commonsin the Reynolds Club for men . The room was big , the walls were paneled , and paintings of eminent University men of the past were substantial ghost images on the wall . Abe Lustig joined them , and a few acquaintances of theirs . They talked casually , of whatever subject occurred to someone , high-jumping and flaws in Peter 's style when he left the ground to go over the bar , and the way Abe sliced his legs in a scissors , going over the bar , and Professor Donald J. Lenner whom Peter Moore was having in his Poly Sci. course , and the football season , in which the Maroons were n't doing too well , and Abe saying that he 'd been reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite dubious of Stossen 's contention that the atom was as far beyond our reach as the moon . Rutherford , the British scientist , had spoken of " the bewildering rapidity " with which fundamental discoveries were being made , and Peter Moore asked him " for instance . " Abe said that Rutherford had changed a few atoms of nitrogen into hydrogen , and gave a few other examples of scientific discoveries , and then he said that if the energy of the atom could ever be used it would be tremendous , more so than a high jumper over the roof of Bartlett Gym . Ed did n't talk much . He could n't have on scientific questions , and furthermore , he did n't believe that he expressed himselfwell about ideas . He was looking forward to taking a course in public speaking . Peter Moore had classes , study , track work in the gym ; he also played intramural touch football . Eddie was alone much of the time during his three days . He saw many coeds who were well above the minimum beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what to say , or how to get acquainted . He was shy , but shyness did not fully explain how he was . There was his pride . He did n't want to be turned down . Nor did he want to be hurt any more , because he had been hurt too much already . This was bound up with pride , but was more than pride . And unlike George Raymond , he did n't have a line . He could n't give himself a fictitious personality.  |p170Eddie  looked at all the girls worth looking at , and the campus was pretty full of them . Many of them were so beautiful to him . And he liked to look at their legs , slender and shiny in silk stockings . He looked a lot . In Harper Library , there were also girls when Eddie went to read and study . For his term paper in English class , he had chosen Wordsworth 's poetry , and he read poems and dipped into a few books about Wordsworth . Miss Patrick had stressed nature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preface to Lyrical Ballads . Eddie read it for the third time , and he gained from it a sense of poetry being related closely to life , reflecting it , and distilling some of the concentrated values , the essences , as it were , of thought and feeling . And that taste in the arts was an acquired feeling , developed by long intercourse with them , and that poems were written for men , not for poets . Accepting these ideas , Eddie was able to read with more confidence , and not be afraid that he 'd be wrong , or that he would n't be able to write his term paper without fearing that he might be all off unless he gave back to Miss Patrick what she had said in class . He could do his own thinking . Reading in Harper Library , taking some notes , trying to think as he read so that he should have ideas , enough of them , to put down when he came to writing his term paper , his mind sometimeswandered , and he had many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to be bent over books in a librarybut that he could be off having tea with a pretty girl . He wished that his term paper were already written and that he 'd been given an A for it . He wished that his family were rich , and that he did n't have to work his way through college . He wished that he could travel , go to the " back country " where Wordsworth had lived , walk as he had walked , in country woods , and along country lanes , see fields and trees as he had , think as he thought , and then write as he had . These and many wishes came and went as he read , and he thought of himself , and related to himselfand to his life one or another line that he was reading . It seemed to Eddie that by reading poetry then , when young , he was giving himself the notes for melodies of his spirit in the future , and preparing for the way he would live and what hep171would be like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper . If he could read and understand Wordsworth well , he could feel more of the quality of passing minutes . ... For I have learnedTo look on nature , not as in the hourOf thoughtless youth ; but hearing oftentimes The still , sad music of humanity .. . That was sadness , and , yes , " Thoughtless youth , " did n't feel and carry such sadness within itself . Did he ? Yes and no ! Yes . Before he had known many or really any " aching joys " of " thoughtless youth " he had heardThe still , sad music of humanity This music grew sublime in nature . One impulse from a vernal wood May teach you more of man , Of moral evil and of good , Than all the sages can . That did n't seem true to Eddie , but Wordsworth knew much of vernal woods , and of the surrounding Mystery of Nature and of life and their capacity to heal and restore your spirit : was n't this something of what Wordsworth had meant ? He 'd written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to Egypt . Napoleon had probably never heard of Wordsworth , and had not seemed to care for poetry , except for Homer . Eddie could n't be serene like Wordsworth . The serenity he felt , while reading him , possessed the sad music of pathos rather than of humanity . It was his pathos . And Eddie went home with the day gone dark ; the wind was sweeping the wide Midway as he walked halfway across it to wait for a bus . A dark scene that was sad , merely sad , rather than " the sad music of humanity . " His day had been a day well used , with much happiness , or at least forgetfulness which was n't unhap/piness . It had gone . The night had come , lonely and cold , and in a tired sinking of spirits , he had become depressed . What was he out to win ? Eddie did n't want to go home . He wanted to stay at the University . A big , lit-up bus appeared , looking clumsy and ancient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park appearedgrim and deserted in the darkness . It was the bare , gravelikememento of a day gone by . South Park Avenue was forsaken , and full of ghosts of memories from his boyhood . Tomorrow is another day , his grandmother was always saying , as were many others , millions of others . Eddie 's three fine days passed and he went to his new station . Old Man Jameson was n't at all unfriendly as Eddie had feared he might be when he stopped at the 43rd Street station to get old shoes , trousers , and other personal articles which he had left there . His manner was one of disappointment and great regret . He seemed hurt , injured in spirit when he told Eddie that he should n't have done what he had , it was a mistake , and all Jamesonhoped was that Eddie watched what he was doing and watched himself at his new station . He spoke as though he were accusing Eddie but , at the same time , he forgave , and would bear the sadness of his great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain that he had not asked for the transfer because of him , or of any gripes he had , but simply on account of the hours . He could n't have gone on , working the same hours and studying , Eddie told him , or rather tried to tell him , because Jameson was not interested , and did not really listen to him . He interrupted to tell Eddie that he had made a big mistake , and only hoped that he would n't come to regret it . Eddie felt a little sorry , but what could he do ? And even though he wished , or half-wished that he had not gotten the transfer , he was sure that he had acted in his own best interest . It was embarrassing for Eddie , and he sensed that it was forp173the Old Man . He stood , moving his lips slightly , as though he wanted to talk to Eddie and could n't . Between them there was some of the unspoken sadness of the world . They shook hands and Eddie left . Eddie 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five or twenty-six , married and the father of a tenmonth-oldboy . He and Eddie were both feeling nervous suspensewhen they met . Quite obviously , the wrong partner could foul a guy up , and Corlin had as much need for the job as Eddie had , if not more . He had come to Chicago from a small town near Columbia , Missouri , in about 1920 , and had worked at various random jobs , but none had suited him as well as that of filling station attendant . He liked his hours , even though he worked a seven-day week , and prior to Eddie 's coming , he and his partner had usually worked two successive shifts , afternoon and the next morning , and had then had twenty-four hours off . But Corlin liked the idea of working the morning shift and being home every night . However , the fact that Eddie was a student had worried Corlin , he later said . They quickly took to one another . And Corlin agreed to a plan of Eddie 's for him to work both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , when business was slow and it was dull and boring , waiting around the station until time was up . It did n't look at all as though Eddie had made the mistake which Old Man Jameson had spoken of with a solemn regret that covered the wound he felt because he believed that Eddie had deserted him . From the beginning , things moved smoothly at the new station . Eddie was always prompt in reporting , and occasionally he 'd get to the station a little ahead of time , permitting Corlin to leave early . Corlin liked that , and it actually was to Eddie 's advantage , because he could get his chores done and sit down to study . And Eddie was rapidly learning to read and pick up where he left off when interrupted as well as to concentrate and yet keep himself in instant readiness to jump up and rush out when a customer drove in . He had read that Julius Caesar could do more than one thing almost simultaneously , and one of his reasons for interest in and admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his ability to sleep for only a few moments or hours , then rise and pitch into his work , whatever it was . Eddie would have to develop habits of this kind successfullyif he was ever to achieve his ambitions . This desire , he knew , had , in itself , become an ambition , an end , and he was trying to make himself a storehouse of knowledge . He did n't think of the separation of knowledge into departments and , already , in term papers , reports , themes , and tests , he would use the material of one class in what he wrote for another . He quoted poetry in history papers , and cited history , the French Revolution or Bonaparte , for Miss Patrick . He did this , perhaps , to impress . But this was only superficial , and Eddie was actually revealing the way in which his mind worked . He had been the same in sports . What he learned in football , he had used , on occasion , in basketball , and he had used his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward passes . Peter Moore had seen him play a game of basketball in his senior year , when Eddie was captain of St. Basil 's heavyweight team , and he 'd said afterward : " Eddie , you play half the game with your feet off the floor . " The footwork Eddie had picked up in basketball had also helped in football . His athletic reputation at high school , which was the stuff of which legends are woven , was based on his socalleddogged fighting spirit , but the fact was that it was also a result of his using his head , and of learning fast . Corlin and Eddie got along from the beginning . They talked naturally , called one another by their first name , and Eddie never , from his first night on , checked up and made an audit before closing up , unless he feared that he was seriously short . Trust and confidence in Corlin 's honesty worked a counterresponseof trust , and this was psychologically good for Corlin because , after all , he was a small-town boy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keenly suspicious , and protective of his self-esteem . Corlin had come to Chicago with cautious distrust because of all that he had heard about big cities , and he had never completely lost his suspicion nor had he come to feel that he was a Chicagoan , although he tried to be and believed that that was what he had become . Even his home life was affected ,  |p175because  besides being a Chicago girl , Mrs. Corlin had graduatedfrom high school , and her father was a minor official in a large corporation , with twenty girls under him . Corlin would have liked to have gotten a better job , a white-collar job , but he could n't have earned as much money , and they were saving up to buy a Ford . Bill Corlin seemed to Eddie to be a decent guy , and there was no reason why he should n't have trusted him . Corlin trusted Eddie in turn . There was less business than at the 43rd Street station , especially after six P.M. To Bill , it was a relief not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , but to Eddie the dullness was opportunity . He was beginning to believe that boredom was a weakness of character , a lack of interest , energy , ambition , and curiosity . It was a waste of that which was most precious of all the possible benefits of life  --  time . About a year had passed since Eddie had read , in a wonder of excitement , the " Conclusion " of Walter Pater 's The Renaissance , and what he then felt and thought was expressed in a beauty of style he never hoped to equal . No moment should pass in boredom . No minute should escape from a human being 's life wasted and unused . Each moment should have value and quality : To be dull and bored was to squander God 's greatest gift . Eddie got off to a good start , and forgot the immediately past months , and Old Man Jameson , who probably let memories of Eddie go dry and turn to the dust of his own past . Eddie could now study in conditions of less disturbance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more concentrated , pulled together , with less waiting time in which he had to make an effort of will to study or otherwise to use every minute profitably . Eddie gained other opportunities , also . On Saturday afternoon , he no longer needed to hurry from Stagg Field and the football games to work . The opportunity to have a Saturday night date was given him , if he should be able to get one . He could and did go to the dances at the Reynolds Club , held immediately after the games , but few girls danced with him , and he did n't know what to say to those who did . Eddie continued setting his own pace of study , and not onep176day passed but that he did not learn and absorb . He was learning from books , and from life . The job he had was teaching him more about business , and thus about economics , than he realizedat the time . In order to keep their jobs , Bill and Eddie had to sell , and the more they sold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company , but there was , nevertheless , no feelingof really solid security for either of them . They did n't know when there would be a change in policy , bosses , plans of the company , which would affect them and their jobs . While they were on duty , they did not know when they were being watched and by whom . Any customer could be a spotter . At any unexpected minute , a boss could come in and take them by surprise . They worked alone , but with the possibility of unseen eyes upon them at any moment of their working time . One slip and they might be fired , and they could even be discharged without their knowing the reason why . They did n't know what reports about them went into the main office , and were never certain of their status . From day to day , they came to and went from the station with suppressed uncertainty about their jobs , and while they had learned to forget this , it hung within them as part of their daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poised over them , and it affected their inmost feelings . The contant handling of money had many unrealizedeffects upon them , and how they acted about money was one of the measures of their character . Neither of them was totally honest . They " pulled the pumps " to make up shortages and bought their meals from the restaurant across the street , owned by Jimmy the Greek , out of the company cash which they handled . This required them to cheat customers out of a few cents here , a few cents there , to give four for five gallons of gasolineto some customers who did not watch carefully while they were being serviced . If they made a personal telephone call , they used a company nickel and that five cents , also , had to be made up at the expense of customers . They contributed , thus , to their own fear , and were , in part , the agents of their own anxieties . They increased their actual income by from about five top177twenty-five or thirty dollars a month in this manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie was , perhaps , more troubled by guilt than most attendants , because stealing was a sin , and he knew that there could be no excuse for this in the eyes of God . The small amounts he stole made his sin only a venial one , or so he believed . And he sometimes had to cheat because he would grow absent-minded in his studying , would service customers while his mind was on his books , and he 'd forget to collect . Two or three times , Eddie was gypped by professional short-change artists who went around to stores and gasoline stations , asked for change for twentydollarbills , and so befuddled you that they managed to go off with ten or twenty dollars clear . About three weeks after Eddie had started working with Bill Corlin , he came to work one weekdayafternoon , and found Bill upset and defensive . " We 're twenty bucks short , " Corlin said . " How in Christ 's name did that happen ? " " I do n't know . I know I did n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were about four bits over . " " Did you check up this morning when you opened up ? " " No , I did n't . There was a rush of trucks and before I had any time to think of checking up , I must have pumped fifty , seventyfivegallons . Then I thought what the hell , we always run pretty even . " They looked at each other . Bill was a wiry little fellow , tanned and skinny , but very strong . His eyes were fixed on Eddie with uncertainty , suspicion , and he was very tense . Then Eddie remembered the guy who 'd driven in when he had a run of customers and a crankcase drain on the previous afternoon . The man had been dressed like a sport , and talked fast , in a way to set you back before you opened your mouth . He 'd gotten change for twenty , and then for two tens , and had talked to Eddie all during the exchange . " Jesus Christ ! " Eddie exclaimed to Bill . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a short-change artist  --  the goddamn sonofabitch  --  ifI ever get near that fast-talking bastard . . Eddie described the incident quickly , and recalled that im/mediately after the guy had driven out of the station , he 'd told himself that he must have been cheated . He did n't seem to have as much money as he should have had . But Eddie had been too busy to make a check-up at the time , and when he 'd handled the succession of customers , he wanted to get at his books . " Are you sure you was taken ? " " Yes , Bill , I am . That 's the second time . I got screwed the same way last summer . That time , it was ten bucks . " Bill relaxed , and a smile of sympathetic friendliness came on his face . " Tell the auditor to go drown himself , Bill , and let me make up the audit today and throw in the petty cash . I 'll have to make it up , and if anything happens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come around and find us short , I 'll say I was rooked and to take it out of my hide . " " We 're partners , Ed , and we stand together , do n't we ? " " Yes , Bill  --  but I was dumb , and you 've got a wife and kid tosupport . I would n't want you to pay for my being a goof . " " I got taken once the same way . " " The next short-change artist who comes around here gets slugged , if I catch the bastard pulling that game . Right between the eyes with a right , that 's what that bastard will get . " Bill smiled . " It 's a tough break , but the world wo n't end , and we can make it up . Some of the drivers who come in in the morning and sign for gas will help me if I tell ' em , and we 're due for a new load of gas in Tank A. We always get three or five gallons over on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dough in fifty-fifty , and take it out when it 's made up . I 'll put up ten and you throw in ten and we 'll be safe if the auditor comes around . We 're due for an audit . Tilson told me to expect the auditor when he came this morning to make up the money bag . " Tilson was a " blind " collector , a close-mouthed and quiet young fellow of about twenty-five , who always told them when to watch their step and what they had to do to save him from sendingin a report on them . " I have n't got ten on me , Bill ; let 's chance the thing and use the petty cash . If anything suddenly happens and you try top179pull your ten out , you can be misunderstood . And I 'll say it 's my responsibility . " The petty cash fund was twenty-five dollars . Bill was impressed and touched . " But what 'll we do ? We wo n't have any dough to speak of when we make up the audit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to check it over again with me . " " We 'll check , and hold back some gas sales for my shift , and use our petty cash . " They did this . They were almost twenty-two dollars short . " I 'll make up some of it this afternoon , Bill , and if we get audited , then I 'll say I was fooled by a short-change artist . I 'll say it happened just before the audit . " Bill agreed to do as Eddie suggested . They were held responsiblefor every cent , and no shortages were allowed . Eddie 's quick admission of responsibility for the twenty-dollar shortage won Bill 's respect to the degree that after that day , it was as though Eddie were manager , deciding how to run the station , and all of his suggestions on business were followed by Bill . Eddie had gained by leaving the Old Man , and was , in fact , managing the new station , and building up its business and Corlin 's record as well as his own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew him realized the strain of his effort , the intensity of his life , the physical and social limitations which bound his days , the wideningof mental horizons and the feel and depth of time for him . When he reported to work , he was often smiling , joked with Bill Corlin , and was at ease as he had not been when Old Man Jameson was his partner . The Old Man had acted almost as though he were his guardian ; he could not help doing this , but it was depressing , and put unseen weights upon Eddie . He had not reported for duty at the 43rd Street station smiling or joking , accepting his job as part of his life , of his normal routine which he could accept and handle with a feeling of any pride or dignity . He could have neither pride nor dignity , working with the OldP180Man , because Jameson needed to add to his own and he had only Eddie as the object for his self-enhancement . This Eddie felt through his own reduced sense of himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days at his new station . He was studying more than he had been , and he would leave work , sometimes stopping for coffee and pie in the restaurant near the elevated station at 58th Street , and sometimes going straight home to continue his studying . Eddie thought that he was unhappy , more than actually being unhappy . And he was more unhappy for others than for himself . He had been unhappy for the Old Man , and he was unhappy for some of the members of his family ; for his grandmother , who was an old woman and illiterate , and often very lonely ; for his mother , a widow , whose greatest pleasure was church and wakes , and whose children were growing up and away from her ; for his Uncle Dick , who seemed to be going downhill in his career as a salesman ; and his Uncle Larry , who could be like an old woman in his nagging of Eddie for always having his " nose in a book " ; for his Aunt Jenny , who could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fits of hysteria as well as to an incurable habit of borrowing and wasting money ; for two of his brothers , who seemed to Eddie to be destined to spend their lives working at the Express Company where a man had little hope of going far ; for the Negroes who lived in run-down wooden houses near his station and some of whom would come to buy four and six and ten cents ' worth of kerosene for the lamps they used to light their homes instead of the electricity they could n't afford ; and for many , many others . And the days passed , each one full of all of the excitements you feel when your mind , your feelings , your nerves are awakened . But , also these were days of a growing , sense of separation for Eddie , separation from family and from his whole past life . He saw his former friends less and less , and his childhood and adolescence were becoming a source of poignant , nostalgic memories , of regrets , of sad dreams that had once been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but were dreamed again with sorrow because they had not come true and neverP181would . Eddie was learning that there was a hardness of time upon minds and emotions , upon nerve and muscle , and that some grew in time while others stood still as though yesterday could never die . This was a hardness that was like part of the nature of the world , of the way things were ; it was something in the coming and passing of dawn and night , of the torn pages of the calendar , of the ticking of clocks which measured the minutes away , one by one ; this was destiny and the destinies of people . Everybody did n't get ahead in the world . Everyone was n't going to get ahead . And Eddie was fighting to be one of those who would . He was a young man going somewhere . He was living a destiny , not merely a life . This set him in a vast loneliness , which he did not understand , and which would sometimes come over him like a sadness born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast extent of far-off spaces . He would feel himself then to be utterly and only Eddie Ryan , forever , as long as he lived , Eddie Ryan , looking at the unapproachableand beautifully shining stars , looking , looking , and lonely with the miles and the light distance of years between himself and those far away planets of celestial beauty . And Eddie was still but twenty-one.  |p182Eddie  was unaware of how fast a mind could grow , and he did not fully appreciate his own pace and change . As in the summer term , he received A in both of the courses which he 'd taken in the fall quarter , and he was ready to take a full schedule of three classes a quarter , starting in January of 1926 . The history course of Professor Carleton had been one of quivering excitement , not only because of the Prof , but , also because of the subject matter . The course had brought him close to the present , that is to contemporary history . The class had gone on from the Metternich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second Empire , the rise of Germany , the role of Bismarck , the FrancoPrussianWar , and the evolution into modern twentieth-century Europe , and the events leading to the unchaining of the World War . One day in November , Eddie had come home after class , and sat down at the typewriter in the parlor and written a diary note . The first sentence read : Socialism is inevitable . Another day , as he walked out of Cobb Hall , following ProfessorCarleton 's spirited description of the Agadir crisis , Eddie told himself :  --  There will be a second World War . These thoughts came to Eddie like illuminations and he did not immediately work out his reasons for holding to them . YetP183they rang in his own mind with a conviction of truth , and he believed them . My God , how much he had n't known ! And how much he did n't know ! It would take him years to acquire even a small portion of the knowledge you must have , if you wanted to have any glimmering of an idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been about , and of the way so much of it had happened . He had n't known , for instance , the great importance of economics in the career of Napoleon , and why , because of economics , the Emperor Napoleon had had to establish a " Continental System " or else lose to England , as he 'd lost . One of Professor Carleton 's best lectures had been his exposition of Napoleon 's " Continental System , " as the only way of bringing England to her knees , and he could see that the Napoleonic wars had really been between France and England , and the whole continent of Europe , or almost all of it , might in the end have benefited if Napoleon had been the winning general at the Battle of Waterloo . ProfessorCarleton had worn a powder blue suit on the morning when he 'd lectured the class on why the " Continental System " had been Napoleon 's most powerful and necessary means of fighting England . Professor Bertram Carleton was more proud of his powder blue suit that morning than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased downtown at Rothschild 's , and had been delivered the previous afternoon , after Professor Carleton had spent two impatient days waiting for it . His impatience grew out of fear that it would n't come , and that he would not have his so-important new suit for his date with Ramona Hilford . She was plump and in her mid-twenties , the daughter of Professor Hilford , who taught European and American history , and who could have been a big man but for his big family . When Bertram Carleton had first come to Chicago , after taking his doctorate at Harvard on the French Revolution , and making a Grand Tour of Europe , he 'd rented an upstairs room at the Hilford home on Harper Avenue , where he had both enjoyed and been distracted by the Hilford home life . There were kids from ten to twenty-five , the house was always in commotion , andP184he was n't able to give the time he needed to study and reading . Also he and Professor Hilford were chess enthusiasts ; they were guiltily falling into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this waste of time , lack of sociability and conversation , and the extra burden which was placed on her . ProfessorCarleton might well have been given his walking papers but for Ramona , who intervened in his behalf . At first Ramona annoyed and angered her mother , but quite soon , Mrs. Hilford , weighted down as she was with kids and duties , as well as out of the socially natural attitudes of a mother , saw opportunity beginning to beckon . Ramona was neither pretty nor homely . She was , in consonancewith American conditions , well-fed and plumply developed . Her mother had anticipated later health attitudes and health foods , and Ramona had been brought up on fruit juices , salads , and vegetables . Failing to agree with and share her mother 's enthusiasm for the orange , the tomato , the cucumber , the carrot , and other such edibles , Ramona became an unhappy child , but this was modified by the pleasures of candy , ice cream sodas , banana splits , and other sweets . She was bright , quick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed an interest in history because of her father , and besidesliking to read books on the subject , she helped him with the writing of his papers and books , and occasionally did research for him . She was a grammar school teacher in a school out in the Grand Crossing District . She 'd begun with much hope of doing good , but was gradually surrendering to routine and habit , and she had begun to worry about her own future . Was she going to spend all her life teaching kids and become an old maid ? Her father had influenced her . He was an outstanding man of vast erudition , and almost a perfectionist in his conception of historiography . There was always more to be learned about a subjectbefore it should be written about , and too many academic men , he was fond of saying , rushed into print with a haste that was indecent for scholarship . If she married , and she wanted to , Ramona thought she 'd like a man in academic life , but she had never found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always bringing young graduate students home for con/ferences or inviting them to dinner , not for Ramona 's sake , but as part of his own role . Her mother thought in more practical terms . Ramona had been growing bored when Bertram Carleton came as a boarder in the fall of 1924 . He was young , only about twenty-nine , and , at times , he looked much younger ; he had a fine sensitive face , and a falling blond curl that any girl would like to touch . Her father considered Bertram Carleton to be a young fellow of brilliant promise , and although shy , Carleton spoke with intelligence , and such fine diction . Already he was an assistant professor at the University . There were no serious obstacles in Ramona 's way , nor was there any reason why she should n't find Bertram a young man of interest and attractiveness . And she so found him . Bertram Carleton was slow in responding . But finally he did respond . He wanted love , and feared what he wanted . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he could not allow any tendency of the heart to interfere with the future that he was so eagerly wishing for himself . He was afraid of marriage but , also , he was a very lonesome young professor . This , perhaps more than any other phrase , suggested how Bertram Carleton frequently regarded himself.  --  A lonesome young professor . He told himself that this was not only what he was , but it was what he must be , and what he must remain for years and years . Otherwise , the ambition which was the bread and butter , the love and hope , the faith , the all , the be-all and end-all of his character , that quiet ambition which had come to possess him , could never be achieved . It was an ambition which had taken hold of him as an undergraduate student at Harvard , and which was responsible for his switch from Literature to History . He was to become one of the greatest , if not the greatest , Napoleonic scholar of his time , and to rank with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon Bonaparte ? Bertram Carleton never asked himself this question , even when he was in a dangerously probing mood ; he never sought any personal reason within himself and his own character . That he admiredp186Napoleon , the energy , will , capacity for decision and courage of the Corsican , he knew fully , and he believed that there was much in Napoleon to admire . But it seemed to be the unity of will and reason over emotion which Bertram Carleton regarded as the essential source of Napoleon 's greatness . Napoleon possessedthese traits to such a degree that he was not merely a commander of soldiers in an army , in the sense that a general was ; he had been a commander of life , and of history . Napoleon 's capacity to command was perhaps , Bertram Carletonoften reflected , the answer to what Plato had written of the war in the name of the human soul . Perhaps this might strike some as curious , and especially so if it were seen as growing out of the ideas of his great teacher , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of the two planes of man , spirit and matter , upper and lower , and of the age of romanticism . To all who had followed to imitate him , Napoleon had been the man of unified will and nerve , combining old and new , and thereby representing and revealing intellectual force of such strength that it became fate , changed quantity into quality and , as it were , to moral force . This was one of Bertram Carleton 's ideas , and he had many more . His nature rebelled against the moody belief that his plan for the future would only be fulfilled in a successful and brilliant manner if he pursued it step by step , with controlled patience , and as a lonely scholar . He thought of classmates and colleagues , of the younger men on the University faculty , and observed how many of them were married , or engaged and planning marriage . Among them were a number whom he respected , and who he believed would become big men making their contribution to the growth of knowledge . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit their careers , and among them were those who gave evidence of a happiness which he did not know . Some were buying homes . Families were being raised . He was invited to dinner , and found a cheerful colleague , sitting back , often servingbooze which was illegally bought , and almost radiating contentment . Sid Ehrman , in the Department of Political Economy , hadP187spoken of the subject one spring day when they sat having lunch at the Quadrangle Club , which was the faculty club on the campus . Sid Ehrman was interested in economic history , and was planning to make a serious study of both mercantilism and the physiocrats . At lunch , he and Bertram Carleton had talked of the economic problems of France during the days of Napoleonic rule , and especially in 1804 , when Bonaparte became Napoleon I. Ehrman was a thin , small , aggressive fellow with a deep black mustache , restlessly roving eyes , a very quick mind and varied interests . He was married , and did n't complain about it . Sid had serious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of this fact , rather than of their talk about economics and economic history . He left the Quadrangle Club alone , and walked slowly across campus , toward Harper 's ; he had a few hours . But it was springtime , and the air was full of sun and the sap of love and of life . The girls , the youths , the grass , the bright living air , all were innocent of time and of the past . In the springtime , young girls walked as though they never could grow old , and youth laughed as though death were but a false rumor , and the sun shone as though it were forever pressing soft colors upon the world . Thus did Bertram feel , and he strolled along , the lonely scholar who had become the lonely man . He planned to do a massive work of from five to six , or even nine volumes , on Napoleon and the period of Napoleonic Glory . It would be more than a biography of Napoleon I ; it would be a biography of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the roots of the twentieth century . But to achieve this great work , he would be forced to live out his life as a lonely scholar . His eyes turned to a blond , blue-eyed girl whose body was slender under a clean pink dress and whose eyes were like the happy laughter of a world where even the blue skies were a laughing brightness . Maybe he was a fool ? Bertram bore the suffering emptiness of a lonely life as he walked across campus . But he was not in love , except with the day , the weather , the springtime ; his suffering emptiness wasP188the greater because of this fact . There was a vacuum within him , and he feared , with the varying conviction of inner certainty , that no achievement of scholarship , no intellectual and academic distinction , would ever fill that emptiness . The pangs of personal love and living had not been many for him in recent years , just as in his studies , his readings , his classroom lectures , and the papers he had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on personal life . Even Napoleon 's private life was public and open , the object of study and of public discourse as and when historians wished to discuss it . His aching emptiness was all the more distressing and disturbing because it was almost as new as the smiles and the bright faces and tender skin , and the healthy bodies of passing coeds which were revealedprovokingly beneath spring dresses . Historic objectivity , the fascination of ideas and their priority over anything human , that was contrary to pleasure , below the neck . Yet the absorption of traits and attitudes from Napoleon as a result of much reading , study , reflection , testing , produced a defenselessness before the quick onslaughts of physical desire ; the spring day had dropped Bertram below the neck , and Napoleonwas above his neck . There had been spring days during the time of the First Empire , and the women had gone out to Longchamps , he guessed , in their carriages , and Napoleon Bonaparte had not lacked life or love , nor had the Emperor Napoleon been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing out a dream of being the Emperor Napoleon , and he suddenly felt a little foolish as he strolled on past the crowd in the center of campus , and turned south toward Harper 's . Bertram went up in the elevator and became the lonely but also dissatisfied scholar , sitting in a leather chair , with the windowopen upon the spreading sun across the grass of the Midway . He sat in a swivel chair with four-by-six note cards before him , and with a monotonous regularity , he wrote on these cards , but he could not have fully explained why , other than to say that it was habit , a trick of the trade , the way he had learned to study . Bertram could think like Napoleon but he could n't act likeP189Napoleon , and quite obviously he was n't like Napoleon . His saturated study of Bonaparte had affected him in the sense of having a divided mind , and of not , therefore truly knowing himselfand his own thoughts . Bertram Carleton was increasingly beginning to regard his own career and future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had absorbed was that of Bonaparte toward women . Perhaps Napoleon had loved Josephine , and in a way , Marie Louise , and Countess Walewska . But none of his women had deterred him from his course , influenced his mind and judgments , interfered with the coldly intelligent methods in which he pursued his star of destiny and glory . And this concentration of purpose , cold and reasonable , was one of the features of the Emperor Napoleon which attracted Professor Carleton . It was a day on which he did n't want to study , but then , the whole idea of study to Bertram was one of perseverance and sacrifice , and he always encountered seductive , through the opened window , and Bertram 's thoughts were tempted to stray , again and again , with the result that his study took on the features of a struggle with himself . Bertram Carleton had had more than one such experience during the years when he was launching himself as an erudite young historian . By October , when Eddie was taking his course , Professor Carleton was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquered without much trouble , and Ramona was conquering by quick inches . On the morning when he wore his new powder blue suit , he did not know whether he would or would n't propose to Ramona , and he wanted both . He was full of fear that he would propose , and he was joyfully hopeful that he would , and there was an intense play of joy and fear , of hope and despair lest she should or should not accept him . Professor Carleton 's nervousness in class , of which Peter Moore had spoken , was not only related to but had been intensified by his personal conflicts , especially those which involved Ramona . It was a smoky morning , with nothing suggesting variance inp190the fuliginous universe . It was another morning , another day . Professor Carleton had gone to bed wishing for different weather , but the best laid schemes of men and lovers , as well as mice , and as well as Napoleon Bonaparte 's , " gang aft a-gley . " There were his classes . Romance gave way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps he should wait until another day when the context and arrangement of the world was like love 's old sweet song . So he thought . But had Napoleon ever waited to seize the right moment ? Of course , Ramona was not Wagsam , nor Austerlitz , and God forbid that she be Waterloo . Walking to campus , he carried a briefcase and looked quite well dressed and distinguished . His gait was nervous , too quick , too much that of a man in an almost frantic hurry , as though by the speed of his walk he could hasten the passage of time , advancing it more quickly to that moment when he would see Ramona . But he became very conscious of his running walk , and deliberately slowed down . He 'd only be ahead of time for his eight-o'clock class unless he did , and he 'd have to sit at the classroom desk in Cobb Hall or find some way of passing the time until the bell rang . The atmosphere was still a rather thick gray , a dawn fog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw people on the sidewalk , bound for work . Most of them would go to the Illinois Central to catch an I.C. train for the Loop , and , as usual , he was quite glad that he did n't have to do the same , and go to an office . What a bore an office would be ! But offices were essential . How could life , civilization , continue without them ? He knew all this full well . And nevertheless , he could not but think  --  what a horror ! To spend the best days of your life in an office . Some of those whom he saw bound for offices must think similarly about his life , or they would if their attention were to be called to it . And even though he thought it so horrible for men and women to have to spend their days in offices , the early morning , duringp191which the host of office workers were to be seen on their way  --  the early morning was possessed of its peculiar , its singular interest , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascination . Among many unknown people , there was an unexpressed sense of unity , an unmentioned recognition that they were all going forth to the same kind of work which helped to keep the world , the social world , going along through the minutes and hours and days , and it was this which made history possible . Many of those whom he 'd notice would seem new , but others were becoming familiar , and he was developing curiosity about them  --  who and what they were , and what they did and what they were like . There was a tallish , well-built woman , not more than twenty-five or twenty-six , he 'd guess , although he was not very reliable at guessing a woman 's age , and she had a vigorous manner about her , as well as a handsome face . She usually wore a tan suit , of good material and quality , and every second or third morning , she wore a different hat . She carried several differentpocketbooks , also . Bertram Carleton was proud of his keen observation because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of this woman , he guessed , with quite a decided certainty , that she would like him to speak with her , and if he should , she 'd certainly answer him cordially . That was his distinct impression of the young woman , and he was of the inclination to make her acquaintance , and satisfy his curiosity as to what she was like as a person , and , perhaps , take her out occasionally . She had a look of intelligence about her , she dressed well , and on some mornings , he had observed that she was carrying a book . On several different mornings , he had been on the verge of speaking to her , but had been held back by some shyness or restraint which he did n't quite understand , and he had resolved that he would speak , greet her with a " good morning , " and make an effort to get to know her . But he had not done so up to the morning when he was wearing his new powder blue suit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Ramona . And on that morning , he walked like a man in a great hurry , and she like a young woman in equal haste . He did notp192catch the smile she gave him , but passed on his way , and she went her way . He had gone on about a half-block before he knew that he had seen her smile . Yes , he had , but he 'd failed to notice it at the moment . He turned about to look back but she was not in sight , and he went on his way , trying to still a rising excitement within himself . There was Ramona , and she was no stranger . That young woman who had smiled at him was a stranger . But stranger ? We are all strangers to one another , and he knew the dead better than the living . He knew Madame Recamier much better than he knew Ramona , and he knew Napoleon better than he did President Coolidge . He had seen a few other familiar faces on his walk , and the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on toward 57th Street . There was almost a stream of people pouring toward the I.C. station , walking with methodical haste , as though their movements were part of a ritual . He fancied that he perceived something grim about the way they moved , a grimness in their bodies as well as in the expression of their faces . He did not see many smiles on the faces of those people . He failed to catch suggestions of joyfulness in movements . Collectively , they created an atmosphere of disciplined grimness of which they were undoubtedly unaware . He would think of these people in contrast with men and women of past times and periods , and he would think more of differences and contrasts than of better and worse , and of the ideas and conceptions of progress . What was better or worse ? And what did it mean to speak of the judgment of history ? He was a historian , and was his judgment supreme ? These people came and went , lived and died , and the work of the world went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much could history say ? He had put much of himself into these and other problems , and he 'd abandoned personal feeling in order to understand and describe what had been the meanings and fears beneath the superficial daily flow of life . And these people he saw and passed , they were part of that daily superficial flow , and they were swimming in itp193in a quest for happiness to which they gave various names  --  love , power , home , success , wealth . When he 'd told Ramona of such thoughts , she 'd nodded as though she understood perfectly and agreed fully with him . But some doubt had hung in his mind , and he had retained it . He was not at all convinced that she did understand him and did agree . But how many would ? A number of his colleagues could n't . The historian must do what Napoleon had almost done , and what Balzac had aimed to achieve . Coming to 57th Street , and swinging right to walk westward to the campus , he thought of Balzac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pu achever par l'epee , le l'accomplirai par la plume . Bertram had thoughts of Ramona , and she was on his mind rather than the lectures he would give in his classes that day , one on " the Continental System , " and in another course , a continuation of his lecture on the Enlightenment and the men of the Enlightenment . He walked on , slowing his pace , principally because he did not wish that colleagues think him excessively nervous and restless . Balzac and Napoleon  --  who was he to compare himself with them ? But he was not doing that . As for his lectures , these he would manage . There were plenty of four-by-six note cards in his briefcase , and he lectured best when he spoke extemporaneously , for he was daily thinking anew about these problems and these points , and there was no doubt of his having material at his command . It was Ramona . Bertram knew more surely that he would propose today , and he was sad and glad . He was walking at a good clip again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cheering him up , like light faces of students who listened and even doted on his words , and the few , such as Ryan in his eight-o'clock class , to whom he talked ; the day would pass , as he engaged in his professional activity , and settled the destiny of his heart . And he looked well in the new suit . He knew that.  |p195Bertram  Carleton was not unduly vain , but he had his full quarter of vanity , and when he appeared at the eight-o'clock class in his new seventy-five dollar suit , with a linen handerchief in the upper side pocket , he was anything but modest and displeased . He felt that his appearance was quite impressive . Bertram Carleton had often been anxious before a class or lecture , but once he was with a group of students , his anxiety was dissipated , and he was confident and sure of himself . He was extraordinarily erudite , had a quick command of words , facts , and ideas ; he could close out any personal difficulties and wishes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject of the lecture , with full command of what he knew . His nervousness , his clownish antics , his undue pacing of the aisles and front of the room , his sprawling sitting on the desk , his ungainly getting on and off it , his minor contortions as he lectured , constituted an undisciplined and but partly controlled use of his body as a means of calling attention to it , especially on the part of the young girls . He failed to realize that he did this , or rather , he but partially knew it , with the result that he found small outlets in petty and seemingly motiveless movements of hands , arms , and body , as well as in groans , sighs , grimaces , frowns , and a senseless play of eyes and eyebrows when students were as students so often are  --  stupid . Bertram Carleton relaxed pleasantly , with a sense that he would forget without difficulty the problems which he had been giving the bum 's rush out of his mind on that walk to class . Bertram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan who , likewise , was able to make the world and his own problems go as into sleep while he focused and concentrated on the subject of his studies . Other problems were of less weight and moment , and Eddie knew that the world must be pushed out of mind for his own interests or the world would rule him , enter and control his mind , and , thereby , the mind of Eddie A. Ryan would belong to the world and not to its rightful owner , Eddie A. Ryan himself.  |p195Eddie  did not know that Professor Carleton possessed a trait similar to his own , nor did Professor Carleton know that Ryan , a promising kid in his class was , in that one sense , as he was . The buzzing of the bell . Professor Carleton sat at the desk and went through the formality of taking the attendance . This done , the lecture could begin . There was a shuffling of feet , movements in the seats , and small gyrations on the part of the students . A few flirted ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closed their eyes and tried to sleep soundlessly and unnoticed . Professor Carleton took a half-used piece of chalk , idly tossed it in the air , caught it , and glanced about with eyes that should have been penetrating and frightening . " We went a certain distance of history yesterday , did n't we .. Professor Carleton stared about the room . " Did n't we , Mr. Kemil ? " Kemil was the second-string tackle , but no one could call him a second-string tackle and believe in varsity . He was a broken first-string tackle , although a young man of virtuous Christian inclination , and an angelic desire to sing Onward Christian Soldiersand other songs of morbid Christianity for the soul . Kemil said " Yes " to Professor Carleton in sleepiness . " We did n't go ten yards in four downs , though ? " Kemil was dumfounded . A few students laughed openly ; others restrained their impulse or laughed into a handkerchief . " Who can tell ? No one ever invented the gridiron sport for Napoleon Bonaparte . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . He was too fat and small . " There were outbursts of laughter in various parts of the room . Professor Carleton sat on the desk , tossed the half-used piece of chalk lightly in the air , caught it , and looked at Kemil , and then randomly at others , his eyes slightly amused . " You have tackled men behind the goal line , I imagine , Mr. Kemil ? " " Yes , I tried . Them frogs is all small and I imagine I wouldP196play just a smashing game of tackle against any of ' em with Bonaparte-Napoleon at quarterback . " The question and repartee seemed funny , and the class awakenedto smiles , giggles , and laughter . Professor Carleton restrainedthe amusement on his own broad and rather handsomeface . " They did n't have no Big Ten League then , in them days , " Kemil said , provoking a fresh eruption of laughter . " I believe that 's an accurate statement , " Professor Carleton replied . The laughter rose . " Of course , if they had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd of ruined Napoleon as a quarterback , behind the lines , every time  --  unless he has some mighty good blockin ' to protect him from defensive tackles . " Kemil spoke with ponderous , professional seriousness . Almost the entire class was in uproar , and Professor Carleton expanded , almost glowing . The big oaf , Kemil , was so goodnaturedand unconsciously funny in his stupidity that he was positively charming . " Napoleon played a different kind of quarterback , " Professor Carleton said , when the class had quieted down some . " But the Duke of Wellington was a mighty good tackle , was n't he , Professor ? " Kemil asked , and the class was shaken with laughter by Kemil 's wisecrack . Professor Carleton waited for the students to subside , and finally , when the class was quiet , he cleared his throat , and began his lecture . " Was the Emperor Napoleon I , and before he acquired or usurped , if you will , that title , a mere war lord , glorying and gloating in war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice of butchery , as one may choose to characterize war ? " Professor Carleton began slowly , and with only a slight strain in his voice . For Ramona was but a dim acquaintance , shadowy , and to be seen in time more distant than the actual number of hours until he would meet her at Hyde Park Boulevard and Stony Island Avenue . However , when Professor Carleton had spoken of NapoleonP197as merely a man of war , he 'd seen recognition light up in many faces . That was what these young people thought , as their fathers thought , and as their fathers ' fathers had thought . " In a sense , it 's true . General Bonaparte , leader of the Army of Italy , the Emperor Napoleon I , was a great soldier , a military genius . This is widely accepted , by critics as well as those who admire him . We have already considered some of his military exploits and I have discussed Napoleon , the soldier , the general , in contrast with earlier great captains , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many others , JuliusCaesar , Hannibal , and Alexander the Great . Napoleonic war was a new form of war , and developed its new and great book , On War , by General Karl Von Clausewitz . Napoleon had perfectedthe war of the people , of the nation , and the French Revolution had made this possible . " Much of this , of course , had already been explained , analyzed , developed in the preceding lectures , and in the reading assignmentswhich he had given to the class , day by day . Catching the number of blank faces , Professor Carleton was able to decide that a large percentage of the class had n't read all of the assignments , if any ; this would be temptation to despair , were he not accustomed to students who did n't read enough , and , in consequence , failed to profit from his courses , and from the study of history , as they should . This was , he could not hold back in his own consciousness , the irony of Napoleon 's fame and glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , the Emperor Napoleon , and a few facts , at least proportionately few . But what glory was there in that ? When he did his work , and it would be completed , a big shelf of books , how many would read and study his work ? Professor Carleton thought of how little these young men and women knew about Napoleon , and how they would never know very much about him , nor understand him , what he was , and what his historic achievements were . That was Glory . To have your name known by many when you fell into undistinguished dust , and to be understood by few , and fewer than a few . Such thoughts rose at the edge of Professor Carleton 's mind while he continued with his lecture , and he was depressed for ap198moment . He was giving more of himself , trying harder , sacrificing more than the candle of life was worth . He continued speaking as though that candle of life were worth all . " The world of Napoleon Bonaparte and of Frederick the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences were measured by time  --  time and change , not time itself as time , or time quo time , but time as the span of duration in which events happen , new generations take the place , the position , the prestige , power , and authority of older generations , and life and progress , or progress so-called , goes on . " Napoleon was a different kind of monarch from Frederick the Great . The difference in military strategy , which I have already discussed with you ladies and gentlemen , is but one of the indices of this difference . " These many differences I have , in one way and in another , been seeking to focus in your attention . " Professor Carleton liked to see the attentive , questioning , watching young eyes , the trancelike interest on some faces and the alert intelligence on others . He was stimulatingly aware of his effect and influence upon the class , of the respect with which his words were received , of the mastery and control , the power he was gaining over these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies and gentlemen , let 's think of a general , a perennialquestion , one that is as hoary as the oldest proverb about a nervous wife , but hoary as it be , this question is an important and insoluble one . For it 's likely , and who knows but that it might even be fortunate , that some questions and problems are and will forever be  --  insoluble . " Interest had quickened as a consequence of these last words , and he stepped up onto the square platform on which the desk rested , and sat with awkward unease upon the old desk . " Napoleon was a great man , " he said with a forceful emphasis that was the stronger because he had preceded it by a pause . The class waited for more . " Great men are rare  --  as distinguished from men who think themselves great . Napoleon belonged to the first category , thep199rare one , and therein lies the reason why he has entranced many historians , scholars , poets , and novelists , why so many outstandingmen have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the very working of the mind of Napoleon Bonaparte . Lord Acton , the nineteenth-century British historian , said in a lecture : No intellectual exercise , for instance , can be more invigoratingthan to watch the working of the mind of Napoleon , the most entirely known as well as the ablest of historic men ! " Professor Carleton gave Lord Acton 's quotation from memory , and this was a source of passing pride and pleasure to him . He hoped that some of the members of the class would notice how frequently he could give a quotation from memory . And in teaching he was , in his more humble way , attempting to show the students something of what Lord Acton had said about Napoleon , to give them an example of a mind at work upon problems and periods of history , and to arouse their minds by his example as well as by the subject matter and content of his lectures . And the image of Napoleon was reawakened in his own mind with the fascination that he had so often felt in studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now he could understand why he had fallen as though under the spell of Napoleon , and greatness had more meaning and significance to him than it could have had when he had been a mere freshman , like the young people sitting before him as he lectured . The example of greatness , of the working of a great mind and personality in the affairs of history , that was , in the affairs of men , instructive , as well as captivating , fascinating . Professor Carleton had sidetracked himself from what he had planned to say in the lecture , and he was more interested in going on about the greatness and qualities of Napoleon , than in giving his exposition of why it was necessary for Napoleon to fight England by imposing a Continental System on all of Europe . But he roused himself and explained that this was essential because of England 's sea power , and the blockade which Englandcould impose on Europe . The only alternative to the Continental System would have been an invasion of England ,  |p200and  her defeat on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of reaching India and by this means bringing England to her knees . He counterposed for the class the greatness of Napoleon and the necessities imposed on a great man . " Perhaps he had to lose , " Professor Carleton said just as the class bell ended the hour . And he spoke with regret , as he had first felt regret when he had read of Napoleon as a freshman at Harvard . He spoke in the tones of a regret similar to that which Eddie Ryan felt , listening to the lecture and grasping out to absorb the full meaningand implication of every word the young professor uttered . That was on the morning of the day Professor Carleton proposed to Ramona , and was accepted . But in the midst of his joy and happiness , he wondered if that day had been his own Waterloo , and did all men meet a Waterloo ? Was Waterloo the symbol of men 's history , Waterloo and St. Helena ? And Eddie Ryan , also , during the remainder of the course , kept thinking and brooding about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last weeks of the course , the class took up Bismarck , the hero of Germany , and the development of the system of alliances which led to the World War in 1914 . Eddie began to think bitterly of the war as having been one " for steel and gold . " He came out of the course with such thoughts , Waterloo , St. Helena , " for steel and gold , " and these were the questions which he was pondering as the new year began , and he took courses in Political Economy and Political Science . What was the purpose of war in history ? And what did fame and success and glory mean ? He was developing a brooding and saddened bitterness , and a sharpened feeling about life as struggle to the last minute , struggle to the grave . And when you struggle to that last minute , and right into your grave , what would it all mean if you became famous and remembered ? He studied with greater intensity and desperation , and with a less clear conception of a goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger for some kind of future . He must do this , and he must go on doing it , he told himself , and possibly it was all only to end up at his own Waterloo and on his own St. Helena.  |p202The  winter days seemed to pass very slowly , as though time itself were bogged down in the snow . Eddie saw much more of darkness than of daylight . Usually he awakened before daylight or " at the break of day , " a phrase his grandmother was fond of using . And the darkness came fairly quickly after he had reported to work at the station , relieving Corlin . Business was sometimes a bit brisk in the afternoon , and there were chores or tasks he had to perform , cleaning to be done , and , on some days , snow to be shoveled from the drive and station grounds . Thus , it would seem that he had scarcely come to work than the day was gone , and the night had begun to set in . His spirit and morale were affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will in order to keep up his intense pace of study . He was taking two courses in Political Economy , and the reading on this subject was more difficult and slower than in history . The subject matter was not as exciting either , and he would feel more in the mood for reading and less in that of studying than he had during the two previous quarters . And once the darkness began to set in , and the day was fast waning , the corner station was very lonely . He made time pass and studied , but with an effort . He spent many intense hours alone with himself and his own mind . He was his own companion to such a degree that a seemingly permanent sense of the solitude of life was being fixed into his character , and he began to feel with growing poignancythe loneliness of living in general , and concretely and immediately , the loneliness of his own life.  |p203This  loneliness was emphasized by the nighttime scene at N dusk , the dark corner that was full of fleeting shadows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered from more eyestrain and used his eyes most under electric light , and the slowly passing quiet winter evenings were accompanied by burning pain in his eyes and an aching head . He drank more coffee and took aspirin liberally , hoping to blot out the pain , and to be able to go on studying without discomfort . In consequence , he would have a sour stomach and heartburn , and this added to his anxieties , as well as to his discomforts . Eddie did not know on what morning he 'd awaken with strained and aching eyes , or a troubled stomach , and he lived not only with this immediate worry of distress but also with the more disturbing anxiety that his health was not good , that his eyes were too weak for the burden he must place upon them , and that , perhaps , there was something wrong with his heart . If he should see a doctor , he feared that he would be told to quit or let up , and he could n't do this , and live out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialist , had frightenedhim with the fear of blindness and he had carried and fought this fear for over a year , defying it when it was flagrantly pressing upon him through the burning strain he felt in his eyes and head , and forgetting it as much as he could , assuming or hoping that the doctor 's prediction would turn out wrong , or that some new discovery would save him in time . But after a good start at the new station with Bill Corlin as a partner , the winter had set in , and it was as though cold winds were blown roughly through him to shake and shatter , if not to freeze his morale . The days came . The days went . He and Peter Moore still walked to classes whenever the weather permitted , but they had to be ready earlier in order to catch a bus and make their eight-o'clock classes if the weather was too inclement for walking . He went to classes from eight to eleven and then he would go directly home , or else spend an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would leave for work , either by bus or elevated train . At nine o'clock , he closed up the station , turned the key in the time clock as he left , and hurriedp204to an elevated train . Then , he usually studied until he could not remain awake any longer , and he 'd drop into bed and into a heavy sleep of exhaustion . He 'd hardly seem to have fallen off into sleep when the alarm clock would shrill into his ears , and he would awaken , one big lump of being , heavy with tirednessand depressed from the tiredness and the need of more sleep . He 'd drag himself out of bed , and try to wake up by sticking his face into a bowl of cold water , and then he 'd soak up coffee which his grandmother would have ready for him . At the end of the third successive class , Eddie would be weary again and he faced more work , and the long continuation of the day and most of the night . After the bell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would sag into a let-down , and would feel his full weariness , and with this , he 'd become morose with depression and an emotional feeling of hopelessness which was the outgrowth of fatigue . Eddie had passed the half-year mark as a student at the University , and the change in his hopes and attitudes was becoming more conscious on his part . He was losing his concern about social aspiration and ambition , but not about a girl , and his hankering to go out for athletics persisted . His respect for a life of the mind , and his desire to live such a life , unhampered and unrestricted , was growing upon him , and his perspective of the future was changing from the idea of success to that of the life of the mind . But he was also beginning to see with increasing clarity that the life of the mind was not separated from life , but was part of all living , and that life itself , and everything within it , was part of the field of knowledge . The life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting for the truth , and since he was pretty well convinced of this , he was n't thinking any more of success , of money , of getting rich . He might not get rich , and he might not be a worldly success if he tried to live what he had come to call the life of the mind . Learning as he hoped to learn , and studying as he was studying , was n't necessary to be a success in life , if you measured your advance merely in terms of dollars . The biographies of many successful and self-made men did n't tell of studying as he was doing , andp205of the kind of sacrifice he was enduring , and the risks that he was taking . Even though Eddie had his depressions and his flashingseconds of despondency and weariness , he was full of hope . There was so much to be done in the world , and so much , now , that could be done . With education and science , scientific method applied to life , with reason and truth brought like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more just world to be , a world that was more technical and was run by the principles of right and justice . This hope was stronger in him than the passing despairs and low moments when he thought that he did n't care , and that all he wanted was to quit , to give up , to forget , and find some kind of successful peace like a contented fattened cow . After all , he could n't be Socrates . And even though he could n't , he harbored as a shameful secret ambition the hope and the desire that he could be Socrates . He dared not tell this thought to anyone , for if he did , he 'd be laughed at more than ever in his life , and he 'd seem crazy , like someone who thought he was or could be Napoleon . His generation was the one that should go into politics and make the fight for reason and truth . This idea was growing in his thoughts , and he was beginning to think of it as one of the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this meant he must learn , learn , always learn . He 'd tell this to himself , thinking of the famous words of Danton : L'audace , tort fours l'audace , encore l'audace . And the sight of girls in fur coats , wearing black galoshes and silk stockings , their faces young and unlined , their eyes transparently shining with life that was recently born , their smiles and laughter , and the beauty which he saw in so many of them , the sight of girls on those winter days put a look of hunger into his eyes and filled his spirit with yearning and thoughts of love and poetry . He was a hungry young man , carrying a battered briefcase stuffed with books , looking at the world with weak and bloodshoteyes which sought the wonder of life . And the laughingp206girls with soft-rosy faces did not see the hunger and wonder of those bloodshot eyes cast upon them . The days were passing . Dark days . January would go into February , and he would be twenty-two years old and still so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence of his own hopes and dreams . However , he could n't accomplish much yet . He was not ready . Eddie found the first weeks of the winter quarter to be different , and there were days when he took punishment . " Son , you 're workin ' too hard , " his grandmother began to say to him with increasing frequency . " Oh , I 'll be all right , Mother . I 'm young and in pretty good health . " " Sure and when a lad is young , he does n't know how strong he is , and to hear him tell it , he 's stronger than a giant . Did n't I hear them sayin ' how strong they were in the old country ? But be careful , son , and watch your health . The Lord gave us health to watch over it , and not be abusin ' it . " " I 'll watch it . I 'm all right , Mother . " But was he ? " Eddie , are n't you going at study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . They were walking over the crusted and graying snow , beyond the lagoon and on the flat stretch which extended toward Cottage Grove , toward low knobs called hills , and toward the summer meeting place of the Bug Club . It was another dim morning , unpleasantly cold but short of rawness . The snap in the air was almost pleasantly invigorating . But the clouds were low and dark like polar dirt transplanted to hang over Chicago and give Chicagoans another depressing day . " I do n't think so , " Eddie said so quickly as to have almost snapped out his answer . But he wanted to admit to his friend that he tormented himself with worries that he was overdoing it , and he did fear for his health and his nerves , for his heart , and , most of all , for his eyes . And since all this was true , it was inevitable that he would sometimes begin to fear , and then to believe that he would live only a short life . And even if he did havep207a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could darken him with a despair that was sheer Hell . " I do n't want to sound like an apostle of dissipation , Eddie , which I am as far from as I can be , but all work and no play , Eddie , it is n't making you dull , I can see that  --  but is it good for you ? " " I look all right , do n't I ? " " Yes , I admit that . " " As long as I 'm doing it , and not suffering , I 'm sure I 'm all right , Peter . " " That 's a sensible answer . But strain creeps up on a person without his knowing it . You ought to watch yourself for any strain , Eddie . " " There 's so much to learn , " Eddie said . " You or I ca n't learn everything , or be everything . " Eddie did n't answer quickly . He agreed that there was no evidence , no grounds for assuming that either could expect to achieve big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit this . If he was n't going to try to achieve big , why achieve at all ? " We 'd better shake our hoofs . It 's getting on toward eight and if we drag along , we 'll be late for our classes , " Peter said . They hastened their pace . Peter wanted to run , but Eddie said they 'd make it to their classes merely by stepping on it . Runningwould tire him out too much . He 'd had less than six hours ' sleep the night before . They strode on , with Peter Moore , who 'd been a high school runner , getting ahead of Eddie , and then waiting a second or so for his companion to catch up with him . Eddie was glad that they had become silent . He did n't want to talk any more , much as he respected , liked , and trusted Peter Moore . The conversation depressed him , and he could be worried and fearful all day , thinking about himself and his health . Worry of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and once it started , you were in the merry-goround-goingmood , and around and around your mind could go , around and around in the same circle.  |p208As  Eddie kept pace with Peter along 57th Street , he suddenly told himself that if he did n't have hopes , strong hopes , he would n't be at the University . His depression began to lift . Eddie carried through those wintry days , sticking to his course and rebounding swiftly from each round of depression and anxiety , as well as from his periods of fatigue and eyestrain . By the end of January , he found the days easier to get through , and he had , thus , managed to come through a crisis of a kind . But Eddie was not simply acquiring more knowledge , collectingfacts , and expanding his acquisition of ideas . He was continuingas he had been since the first class day of the previous June ; he was developing , and at a pace which was becoming increasingly faster . The size of the world within his mind was continuing to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and melancholy state , that is , moods of exhilaration , of intellectual excitement and intensity of emotion about some idea , some passage in a book which he read , some idea which was new to him . Eddie had become a young man who was not still within himself . His thoughts and dreams , like his moods , were rapid , crowding upon one another , and his entire life had become , not chaotic , but thick ; it was thickening as much as it could without becoming chaos . Especially after the winter quarter had begun , and he took a course in Political Economy , Political Science ioi , and Social Control , an advanced course in PoliticalEconomy which he 'd had to get permission to take , since he had n't the necessary prerequisites , he had become more aware about life itself as the field of knowledge , the real subject of study . The filling station , and the Express Company office in which he had worked prior to coming to Rawlinson , the daily newspaper , his neighborhood and the characters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , all of these were extensions of what he was studying in his courses and readingin textbooks and other books . He also made himself the object of his own study . As a filling station attendant , he was anp209economic man , and his pay , his commissions , his petty grafting were economic facts . Eddie became both more alive and more nervous . However , he was n't heavy , pompous , solemnly seeking in his working life ; he did n't go about as though with a metaphorical net , ready to chase every butterfly of fact that he glimpsed . He saw and grasped relationships and connections . He knew that Rawlinson was buying his time with the idea of getting profit from its purchase , and of gaining good will . He practiced the principle of caveat emptor . Eddie 's going to the University did n't mean much to old friends , and if he saw any of his high school classmates , as he did occasionally , mostly by accident , they asked few questionsabout his courses and progress , and little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older neighborhood fellows , meeting him on the street , warned him that he 'd better be careful because if you read too many books , you might be locked up as a nut just the same as you might be given a bum 's rush to the booby hatch if you pulled your pudding a lot . Thus he was gradually set apart because he was a student at the University ; he was made an object of suspicion , and was even told that he had a goddamned nerve going to that atheist ANA University , thinking he could learn something , and who the hell did he think he was ? This increased especially when word got around that he was doing very well and if he continued to do as well as he had already done , he would set some kind of scholastic record . This went to show what kind of a place it was over there on the Midway , and a couple of the fellows argued that they were n't honest , them professors over there , and they were giving young Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Catholic schools , and you watch and see if they did n't get him away from the Church with them methods . " It 's ignorance . You understand it as well as I do , Eddie , " Peter said , walking to classes on a morning of February thaw when Washington Park was squashy with mud , puddles , and soiled melting snow.  | " It does n't bother me any . I should ask anybody what kind of a future I want to make for myself ? " " I do n't know what it is , but there are so many people afraid to crack a book . " " My Uncle Larry gets books out of a rental library downtown , but he has them wrapped in packages that do n't look like books so nobody will know it , " Eddie said . " We do n't have many books at home , except for my textbooks , and a few I bought , " Peter said . Eddie stepped over a puddle of water . It was depressing to know there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated and feared books and what was to be found in them . Could n't it be that he dreamed pipe dreams when he looked ahead and thought of fellows such as Peter and himself , and others like them , learning and then changing people , by convincingthem more and more of the truth , and of the method of finding out the truth , testing and correcting , changing and revising it . What he meant was saving men , and Peter would usually ask him how much can you save men , and for what ? Eddie put the same question to himself in his own thinking , and often he did n't have great hopes for the salvation of mankind . And that was God 's job , anyway , was n't it ? However , these thoughts about hope , about truth , about ignorance , occupied Eddie far beyond their importance as causes for what he was doing . For whether or not the truth could make all men , or other men , free , it would be Eddie Ryan 's means of liberation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University to have perceived this . How others acted or might say to him could not deflect him from what was becoming his direction in life . He was trying to educate himself , primarily , for himself , and not for others , and he had come to understand that he would , himself , have to be ignorant and prejudiced if he did not get an education , and he had also developed to the stage where he distinguished between success and truth . The purpose ofp211education should be to look for the truth and to learn the means of finding out the truth , and this did n't at all mean any guarantee of becoming a success in life , getting a better job than you might otherwise have gotten , and becoming rich . These thoughts had come to him as a reaction to the atmosphereof his whole life , which had been saturated with an emphasis on success and money . His father , sick and dying , had urged him to get an education , in order that he might make something out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow old with nothing in this world , you 're nothing , " his old man had said . At the Express Company , drivers and chauffeurs and the route inspectors and wagon dispatchers had all spoken the same way , and he 'd frequently heard them say that they wished they 'd had more sense when they were young fellows and had gotten themselves an education instead of running around and pissing away their time and their dough , because if they had , they could have made something out of themselves in this man 's world . This was the common idea of the meaning of an education , and it represented what Eddie had believed when he 'd determined to make something of himself by getting a college education . " What does depress me , Ed , is that fellows like you and I , we 're half cut off from our own by learning , " Peter once said . Eddie did not reply to this . Later , he thought again of Peter 's remark , sitting in his station , and looking up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big flakes in the dark night . He was changing . He was growing away from others as much as others could grow away from himself . He was becoming a different person . More than that , he wanted to become a different person , to make himself over into more than he was . Eddie watched the snow coming down more heavily , chargingthe air with life and movement and changing the aspect of the night in total silence . He was enthralled with the simple beauty of falling snow on a dreary corner . He went outside for a few moments to feel the snow wet upon his face , to smell the dampness of the enlivened air.  |p212Then  it was time to close up the station . He left , carrying his briefcase . He passed rickety wooden houses with pale lights in some of the windows . His feet , warm and dry in galoshes , crushed the wet , sticky snow . The flakes fell on his face and coated his glasses , and he felt himself to be vastly free and in touch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which came the snowstorms to crush down upon the city . He thought of himself as a child of such a storm . He rode to 58th Street in a dismally lit elevated train , thinkingthat sometime in the future he wanted to feel as free as he just had , while walking in the storm to the elevated station.  |p213The  life of those at a great University might be seemingly dull when it is dramatic , and apparently dramatic when it is banal . The dramatic , the significant , the important , even the spectacular are related to time and unfold in time , and in different sequences of time , some longer than others . Unless the living sequences of time can be filled in and revealed at their adequate pace , the dramatic and historic must be needlessly distorted in order to make false conflict and drama , and the falsity of history becomes inescapable . The life of a great Universityis full of many kinds of drama which unfold in time , and so it was in those days when Eddie Ryan was a student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University were preparing to better history , and the quiet drama of their days and their preparation grew in importance and interest through the years . Eddie Ryan had already , before the Winter quarter of 1926 , come to see himself as contending with his destiny , and he was living through the beginning of a destiny , day by day , and minute by minute , in a manner which must unfold according to its sequence of time . Eddie 's drama , then , was in himself . It was a drama of sacrificeand risk about which almost no one knew very much . Even in terms of will and physical effort and exertion , the meanings of what Eddie was doing and what others were doingfell into their respective time patterns , and stood out in contrasts.  |p214There  was Lonesome Larry Royal , who took the same course as Eddie in the winter quarter of January 1926 . At the end of the previous football season , he had been elected football captain for the next fall . His picture had been printed in the rotogravure section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome football captain in the Middle West , and one of the most handsome college gridiron stars in the nation . He was first called Lonesome Larry by a classmate in a South Side Chicago high school , where he had been a fullbackand a ball player . In his third year , when he had run seventy-five yards to make the winning touchdown in the South Side title game among public schools , Larry had been at a dance , and a fraternity brother had said :  --  Look , Larry 's lonesome , only four flappers ready to faint in his arms . " Lonesome Larry " became his nickname after that evening , and he did n't mind being kidded and was a good sport . LonesomeLarry was merely one of the brothers at his fraternity house , and everyone who knew him among the students was ready to agree with one of his fraternity brothers , who had said :  --  Lonesome Larry Royal is as regular as a straight line . He was very solidly built , of good muscle and frame , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he had the kind of face that girls wished other girls would forget , a Roman god 's head , with the most perfect and sunny head of blond marcelled hair and regular , Nordic , handsome features . Lonesome Larry would never be lonesome . Thus was he written up in the press . Larry Royal was manly , handsome , earnest , a courageous footballplayer who was technically very good but inclined to be rigidly repetitive in what he did , and who needed a good line and blockers in order to play up to his best potential . LonesomeLarry was not incapable of thinking ; that was not his difficulty . He could think , but it took him a little more time than it did others , thinking did . On the football field , beneath the marcelled blond hair that was something superior to the statue of Apollo Belvedere , something went on  --  that is in the gray matter . But what went on was n't always fast enough forp215football , nor for examinations ; it had almost caused the fatality of ineligibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day for one of the Political Economy classes which Eddie took . There were some girls , but not too many . They looked at him with the look girls have when they are that way . The next day , he appeared ; the girls looked . On the fifth class day , after the bell had rung , Lonesome Larry went to Professor Traynor and said : " Say , sir , do you know if I took this class before ? " " No , sir , I do n't , " Professor Traynor answered with an irony that was both amused and barbed . " I ca n't remember , sir , if I did , or if I did n't . " " I do n't remember that you did , sir . " " Then I must have taken another course . " He stayed in the class , and morning after morning , he showed up , and listened with an air of concentrated seriousness that was pathos , but pathos in slowed-down time . Lonesome Larry did n't make friends with any strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who said " Hello " to him . He passed with a C , thanks to the help of his fraternity brothers , and retained his eligibility . The previous fall , he 'd gone off tackle for thirty-six yards to win a conference game on Stagg Field when the shadows of autumn stretched the ghosted memories of first greats , including Walter Eckersall . More or less , thus was the drama of LonesomeLarry 's feat described in one of the downtown papers . And there were those whom Eddie met outside class . One was Henry Oldering , a small youth with large tortoise-shell glasses , whom Eddie had seen often and had come to regard as an intellectual and , probably , a brilliant student . Peter Moore brought them together for a quick lunch in Commons one chilly but sunny day in early February . Oldering was majoring in Political Economy . Eddie shrugged his shoulders at his wrong guess , for he 'd believed that this quiet , modest , but well-composedyoung man was majoring in philosophy . " Yes , I 'm majoring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieving social justice . "  | " I do n't know how far I go along with that , " Peter said . " Economics , Political Economy , ca n't he any more basic than psychology and ethics , Political Science , other subjects . " " There 's a unity of subjects . We divide them up for working purposes , but they overlap , and knowledge and study is dividedup into these subjects for purposes of , for . . . for purposes of convenience . " Eddie was pleased with his remark , because it had been intelligent , and pretty well expressed . " If you read Henry George 's Progress and Poverty ... " Henry began . " I have  --  that is , part of it  --  the beginning , " Eddie said . " You should finish it , because that 's where you get the meat , nearest the bone . But you ca n't afford to miss as much as a single word of the book , " Henry explained . Eddie was eager , but not completely certain of himself becausehe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Henry Oldering knew about Henry George . Still , he was convinced that he was right , basically , in his criticism and rejectionof the theory . For a moment he wanted to sidetrack any discussion because of his fear that he could n't talk well , but he told Henry Oldering that the theory of Henry George was one-sided . The Commons began to get noisier as the lunch hour crowd started coming . Henry and Eddie continued to disagree about Henry George 's theory of the single tax , but their voices were sometimes not clearly distinguishable to one another because of the rising roar of other voices , the clinking and clatter of glasses and crockery , and other noises . But Henry did n't mind the noises , and he persisted , quietly , with a stubbornness marked by the gentleness of his manner and the even modulation of his voice . He was too tolerant in manner , too even in temperament , too friendly , unmenacing and inoffensive to seem like a fanatic . However , he was rigid as steel , and made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reinforce the same statements about the theory of the single tax . At several moments , he appeared to have gainedp217an intellectual advantage , but Eddie was stubborn , and clung to his position . " Scientifically , no explanation is an explanation , " Eddie said over the coffee . Henry began talking of Newton 's laws of gravity and motion , but was soon back with the theory of Henry George . Neither convinced the other . They got nowhere , but liked one another , and hoped to meet again . Henry Oldering was nineteen , and suggestively lady-faced in his innocence , but his was a very intelligent face and expression . His air of a student was reinforced by his glasses and briefcase . And he could have been a better student than he was , B , and B minus , if he were interested in more subjectsand applied himself with some added diligence . But he concentrated on the theory of the single tax , and indefatigably sought converts . The fact that he failed with regularity did not discourage him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening ; his manner was sweet , tolerant , and bore what would be called the marks of sincerity . His was an importunable conviction , but without the force to win adherents by intimidation . He sought to convince , but was not convincing . Eddie went to work , unwillingly bowing to necessity , and Henry Oldering wandered off by himself , crossing and recrossing campus instead of going to Harper Library as he 'd intended . He was seeking someone to convert . Donald W. Torman was a little man , born in Cleveland , Ohio , and thirty-eight years old . He was an Assistant Professor of Political Science , a Republican , a Mason , and by intention , desire , and effort , he was a scholar . He allowed neither his Masonic membership nor his Republican sympathies and votingrecord to interfere with scholarship and scholarly truth . Thus , he always raised the question for his Political Science 101 freshmanclasses : " What difference , if any , can you people find between thep218platforms of the two parties , especially in the 1924 Presidentialelection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the conclusion that there were no significant differences . Professor Torman , however , believed that the period was a temporary and preliminary one of change for the better by growth rather than through a return to normalcy . It was but the beginning , the pre-Galileo stage of scientific politics , when the future was chartered , the course was planned , and the method was available . This was scientific method . Professor Torman believed in scientific methods more actively than he did in God . Professor Torman 's lectures were clear and simple , but full of questions , posed as such , which cut into the false sanctities of editorial-page political thinking and would dissolve the glitterof " glittering generalities " which had been sanctified as the political Biblicalism of America . Eddie Ryan caught his attention very quickly , within two weeks . He regarded him as one of the best students he 'd had in some moons , asked him many questions in class , and was pleased by the answers . Eddie got an A in the Political Science course of Donald W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the spring quarter , another full schedule for a quarter . He rereadLockesley Hall by Tennyson , and parts of In Memoriam , and he quoted many times to himself : ' T is better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all . And he read Shelley 's One Word Is Too Often Profaned , and Keats ' sonnet , When I Have Fears That I May Cease toBe , and he quoted lines from it to himself , especially the ending :  | .. then on the shoreOf the wide world I stand alone , and think Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink . And he also quoted : My name is writ on waters . He now needed an outlet within himself , because it was becoming necessary for Eddie to tell himself more of what he was thinking as a consequence of the education he had so far gained for himself ; that is , he was feeling a pressure to articulate , at least for himself , what he thought and believed . Growinghad meant changing , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been transpiring in his mind . He was internally nervous with his own growth and change . Thus was Eddie Ryan at that period , the beginning of spring 1926 , and his fourth straight quarter as a student of the University . P220Peter Moore was doing quite a lot of thinking . You could n't help it , if you went to the University in such times as the present . But why did he tell himself , or think to himself , which was the same thing , that he could n't help thinking a lot ? Should you try not to think a lot ? Peter knew what he meant when he beat around the bush like this about thinking , and not being able to help thinking a lot . It was in Hamlet , was n't it , that Shakespeare wrote that thinking " does make cowards of us all ? " And was n't it  --  thinking , or conscience ?  --  " sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought ? " Yes , it was . And yes , he was thinking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast of thought , he guessed . Peter did not want to be a coward , nor did he want to be sicklied o'er , nor did he want to think anything but the truth . But the truth , sir , forsooth sir , what is the truth ? Nor was it that the truth made a coward of you because you were afraid to face it , and accept it , and even to proclaim it in public . It was something else , in his case anyway , and he guessed it was or it would be the same in the case of others like him . That was , as far as general situation and backgroundwere concerned , cases where you were the first , or one of the first , to get an education in your family , among their friends and your friends . You find out that getting an education isp221not  --  not necessarily , anyway  --  being as you were before and merely knowing more than they did , the way in which one person knows more than another about an automobile engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whatever else you could learn about automobile engines . No , it was n't like that . As he saw it , it was n't just an education , a liberal education , so that when you finished with it , you 'd be ending up with something of a liberal mind . That was one of the benefits he hoped to take away with him from the University when he was finished . The other was his legal education . It was funny that he had n't thought of anything so simple and easy to infer : if you got an education , that did something , brought some changes in your mind , and you 'd be changed , ipso facto , because your mind had changed . But it was the simple things that were so often overlooked . He was starting to have a lot of moods , more than he knew were normal and average for him . He was becoming moody , that was what it all added up to . It added up to something else , also , and there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trouble . That was why he was getting more moody . Peter began wondering how Eddie thought , because Eddie could have the same problem as he , and judging from little things and comments which he had made , Peter imagined that Eddie was coming to these problems , just as he had . Peter decided that he 'd talk to Eddie . He laughed , and bent over the plain and much-used old kitchen table which he used as a desk . It had more surface room than most desks , and he liked it better . Peter 's sense of order and neatness with his things dated back to childhood . He chuckled , almost without making a sound . He did n't have to decide that he 'd talk to Eddie . What the hell , he 'd talk , that 's all . There was no difficulty about such a matter . But there was . What was he going to talk about , clearly , in detail ? This ques/lion was n't the basic one in his mind . What did he mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key question . And even to Eddie , revealing his doubts could be a difficult procedure . Once he thought of it , he was in a quandary . It was a pickle , then , and he was in it . He was in an intellectualpickle . Did he doubt , or did n't he ? What , and how much ? On several nights , Peter had begun exploring this question , but only so far as to realize that he was thinking his way into a pickle . Then , he 'd decided that he should study his assignments , rather than to think about what he guessed he was n't ready to think about . Perhaps he was rationalizing , one way , the other way , both ways . Ever since he 'd read James Harvey Robinson 's Mind in the Making , he 'd been on the lookout for signs of possible rationalizing in his own thinking . It could get very confusing , and sometimes it did . For instance , that book on the Historyof the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big jolt by that book , yes , quite a darned big jolt . It came as that because he had had such different ideas , or better , notions and rationalizations . There had been so much ignorance and prejudice around , so much in the circumstances of his own life , that he had not been aware of the attitudes and the ways in which many men think and try to solve problems and advance knowledge , and all the rest of it . Without realizing it , he had picked up so much more ignorance and prejudice than he could have imagined , and without your ever knowing it , prejudice and ignorance could make you conceited , making you believe that you were so right , and that right and justice were all with you , and on your side , and just that God Loves the Irish . That was the title of a book Eddie Ryan had lent him , and whenever he thought of it , Peter smiled . It was n't a good book , and probably Eddie did n't think it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must think much the same as he did about it . He guessed that they both half-wished that the book were true in the sense that God Loves the Irish . But what all his thinking amounted to at the present time wasp223that the world seemed to be all askew , out of joint , off-kilter . It was as the character Juno , of the play Juno and the Paycock , by Sean O'Casey , said when he and Eddie saw it together , one night during the last Christmas holidays :  --  And I tell you , Joxer , the world is in a terrible state of chassis . Toward the end of the winter quarter Eddie had said , with something bitter in his voice :  --  Peter , I 'm going to make a study one day of Woodrow Wilson.  --  Why Woodrow Wilson ?  --  The war of steel and gold , Eddie had said . It was a war of steel and gold , not a war to make the world safe for democracy . And I had started at the U thinking that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand , Eddie . Everything gets unsettled . That was a conversation they 'd had walking to school toward the end of the last quarter.  --  The world is in a terrible state of chassis , Peter had quoted .  --  That was a funny line , a hell of a one , Peter . And the characters , Juno and Joxer and the Paycock.  --  I could understand it  --  the people , they 're our own.  --  Yes , Eddie had said , thoughtful , and perhaps kind of hurt . His voice had sounded that way . On Saturdays , Peter helped clean the house , and did work on the building . He did n't mind it , and sometimes he kind of liked it . That kind of work left your mind free , and you could think and put a few pieces of the puzzle in the right place . At least he tried to , but the pieces he got in the right place on one Saturday , so he 'd think , would be in the wrong place in a week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the next quarter . Peter knew what he wanted to become in life , and why he was at the University . He had often told himself that he had no grandiose dreams . He was ambitious to get ahead , to be respected and to make money , enough to live comfortably , and he thought that he could help people , too , once he was educated and out in the world , as a lawyer and politician.  |p224He  'd learned enough to know that much of the trouble of this world was caused by ignorance and poverty . And if he believedthis and had come to see the need for tolerance , then he should be tolerant once he had an education and success in the outside world . One morning in January , he and Eddie had been walking across Washington Park to classes , with the snow crusted over the ground , the sun dazzling , and an invigorating zing in the cold and the wind . He loved to run , and had a strong desire to run for the mere fun of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being in good condition , of tone to his body , his muscles and his nerves . Eddie had n't wanted to run much , and wearing a long overcoat , and carrying a briefcase heavy with books , he could n't very well have . They 'd walked fast , their feet crushing the snow . Eddie spoke of the French Revolution and said of St. Just , one of the leaders who 'd been guillotined :  --  He was scarcely older than we are now , and he wrote a letter , saying " I feel  --  I could ride the crest of this century . " Eddie had told him this , hoping that he 'd like it too . He was aware of that , because he knew Eddie quite well . He had n't , however , responded as Eddie had expected and probably had hoped he would respond . Ride the crest of this century . What young fellow their age would n't want to , if he had the ability and opportunity ? But Peter did n't think it was for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theoretically , any person born in the United States could be President , and look at the case of Abraham Lincoln . But as the boys around 58th Street and Prairie Avenue said when the question of looking for work arose :  --  Jobs is scarce , and good men is plentiful . A couple of times , he had thought of this in passing in an effort to reason out why he had n't responded with enthusiasm to Eddie 's quote of St. Just . If you tried to do that , ride the crest of this present twentieth century , you stood a big chance of getting drowned . Maybe it could make him seem likep225a coward if he said what he thought , but you could n't talk indiscriminately , and you could n't even talk to many people about how you felt and what thoughts you had . You could only talk to a very few . Most people could n't understand . This was his impression , on the basis of the people he knew , and he was inclined to regard them as sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . What they could n't understand was too much of the truth , given to them too fast . And they could n't understand young fellows like himself and Eddie Ryan , getting too smart and educated in a hurry , and showing too much ambition , especially if they did n't believe , or pretended to believe , in religion , the mores , all that you were expected to believe in . Peter knew that here was the really troubling question that he had to keep wrestling with in his mind . If he should give up his faith , what would happen ? There would be hell to pay and more than that at home , and he 'd never hear the end of it . Day after day , he 'd get it from all sides , especially from his two cousins , Al and Jerry . And they 'd influence his Aunt Kate . He was living in their home , and Aunt Kate , who owned the six-flat , three-story buildings , was their mother . They both treated him all right , decently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little proud about his going to college , especially Al , who wanted to get into politics , and was the unpaid helper of Mr. Berkowitz , the precinct captain . But at the same time , they also were suspicious because he was a student of the University , which they had heard was against Catholics , and even worse , against religion.  --  Do n't be comin ' home here an atheist or anything like that , Al had said on a recent Saturday night at the dinner table . And this was a theme song of Al 's , and some of the older fellows in the neighborhood . Jerry sometimes picked up the tune.  --  Mother of God , that 's what I hear tell they do to boys like Peter at that place , his Aunt Kate had said.  --  I do n't have much confidence in Eddie Ryan next door , Al said.  --  And him with an old grandmother , and a dead father , God spare that.  |p226Aunt  Kate , he was pretty sure , had been thinking , also , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And she had brought a choke to his throat , reminding him of the sadness about which he could n't talk to anyone . She 'd been saying , too , how much she and his uncle , who died a year ago , had done for him . They had done much , which he appreciated , and when Aunt Kate said anything alluding to the years he 'd lived with them , he never took offense . The choke in his throat and the rising of sadness in him came because of his dead mother , and poor " Pop . " It was not his sadness only , but that of his family , and that was the sadness of life . He knew that he had to accept this , and he did . He could n't call back his mother and the years gone by , and now he was a man , with his twentyfirstbirthday behind him.  --  Do n't be lettin ' Eddie Ryan or anyone be takin ' your faith away , Peter , for the sake of your dear mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aunt Kate , I 'm not going to let them lock me up in any of the towers over on the University campus , and keep me there until I sign an oath to be an atheist.  --  This is n't a joking matter , Al said loudly , but then he let the subject drop , and talked about how it was n't going to be so easy for " us " to win the next election , not with the Mayor down in the Hall . Peter restrained his smiles , but he was very tolerantlyamused . Cousin Al talked a big game of politics . " Too much reform does n't get votes , that 's what I say . " " Human nature gets the votes , Al , " Jerry said . Al was twenty-five and Jerry was almost twenty-four . Jerry worked irregularly , sometimes at the Express Company , and drank with the boys on the corner . Al had used to yell at him but did n't any more , and through Berkowitz , Al was gettingJerry a political job . Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up worrying , but he was her baby . Al was steady , and caused her no worry . But she loved Peter , too , and he loved her . He could n't wound her by saying that he 'd lost his religion , but he was afraid that he was losing it . And if he did , livingp227at home might be intolerable . And all of them would feel disgracedand hurt , especially Aunt Kate and his Pop . He did n't want to be a hypocrite , but he did n't want to cause a commotion about matters which none of them understood , and to make himself the talk of the neighborhood . Maybe he was thinking of his career , and of having clients and gettingvotes some day in the future , but if he did n't think of his future , who would ? And now that he was at the University , and had begun readingand studying , he could begin to understand why they were all so lost in prejudice and how they paid for the poverty and ignorance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of Aunt Kate 's buildings was going up . It was the poverty of the past and her poverty in the old country . With most of the people in the neighborhood , especially the Irish , it was the same . They were almost all better off and the neighborhood was full of those who 'd come up in the world , a little way up , at least . Eddie Ryan had made a funny remark which applied to many of the people in the neighborhood . It had cut as sharp as a knife , and was uncharacteristic of Eddie as he 'd been a few years ago.  --  Peter , Eddie had said , they are doing one of two things . They 're either forgetting that their old man and old lady had pigs in the parlor , or else they remember it with a bitterness that even Napoleon could n't feel about Waterloo . Were n't they the victims of their background , the product of environment ? Take Aunt Kate and his uncle , Dan Nolan . She had come here the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married that year . Uncle Dan had saved up enough money to be in on a partnership in a saloon while he worked as an insurance collector , and had lived in a boardinghouse , saving his money , dollar by dollar . He sold out at a small profit , and went back to insurance collecting , and then went to school nights and learned bookkeeping , and he saved and got enough to buy stocks . He was lucky , became a contractor , and bought the buildings , which were side by side , when the neighborhood was not yet built up much . He was satisfied.  |p228His  place in society was settled , and he and Aunt Kate were fixed for life . But neither of them had come to America with any money to speak of , a few pounds each , and they were " low Irish . " That must have affected them . That world was going . That was why he was studying , acquiringan education . It was all different , a time of progress . However he was pondering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what it meant . He was wondering about many things , about Negroes , and dagoes , and Jews , and about economics and politics , about almost everything that he used to believe . What should he turn these beliefs over for ? The desire to save the world was n't in him , not strongly , because he did n't believe that the world could be saved . That was n't correct , either . He was in a period when he did n't know what he actually believed , or what he would believe in a few years . Until he knew , should he sound off ? The sensible course of action for him would be to wait until he knew what he believed and thought . However , Peter had reached such a conclusion more than once ; his doubts and questionings had been recurrent and progressive . Once you doubted and began to look about you and to think , this was how it must be , he thought . But then , if it were , where was the point at which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must you go on until you believed in nothing ? That was what many thought , others besides his cousins , or fellows like that , who did n't think but merely repeated what they had heard said by others who repeated what they had heard . But how many were there like his cousins and Aunt Kate , and the rest of his family ? And how many had lived in the same believing way ? His mother had . All of his people , back across the Atlantic in Ireland . And Eddie Ryan 's people , and hundreds , thousands , millions and more and more millions , living and dying , and had n't they ever known the truth ? And the truth shall make ye free , he thought . The sadness of seeing things from this light was too compelling for Peter to be ironical . It filled him with a hush of awe . It endowed the very idea of life , of people succeeding one another , from generation to generation , with thep229dignity of sorrows , and a scope of numbers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over so many years and generations , everything took on a different kind of meaning . This was what he had told himself on a winter Saturday night when he stood at the parlor window . The room was dark , and the apartment behind him was silent . The shade was pulled up , and he was looking out at Washington Park at night , a scene which was so familiar to him , but which had suddenly become so strange . The snow , seen in spots through the outline of the wire fencing about the courts , was bluish , and the trees behind the court were stark and bare and dark . The night was a little hazy , bluish also . Automobiles passed on the street separating his side of South Park Avenue from the park boundary , and a few people passed by on the sidewalk . Strangers in the night . The night was strange , too , with life . All of the history of man had so far led up to this moment when he , Peter Moore , was standing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue shield of the light of the moon , and trees bare as death , the shadowiness waking everything like an unfinished background of an unfinished scene . He saw in this the world and behind it was not only space and earth of which he knew every fact , but also the past , and all that was yesterday , and seven thousand yesterdays . More than seven thousand yesterdays . But they all , the total sum , all of them , were yesterday . For all of the past was the same . It was not time any more . Time was only the present . Looking both before and after , we did n't look at time . Eternity was like that . It was without time . It was like the past , except that it was the future beyond the living future . Was it like the past ? Was it only the past as it was now , except that it was the past when the last man had breathed his last , and there was no one to look , as he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no God , nor any Hereafter , then there would be no one to remember . Who remembered what Indians once did on the spot of ground across the street or on the ground on which Aunt Kate 's building here had been constructed ? He was blue . Now he was n't thinking about the truth , but brooding over what it might be , or might not be , no one knew.  |p230No  one came back . And the reason he was blue was that he was brooding about the truth he did not know , and that , maybe , no one knew . Could the same scene across the street , the moonlight on the snow , happen and happen and happen many times with no one to see it , no one on earth , and with all that man had been and done only a memory when there was no one to remember it ? His mother would be nothing , like all the dead . How many times as a boy had he gone to Confession and received Communion , prayed , been good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that he was being a good boy  --  for her . Peter had n't cried in years . He could n't cry now . He was crying without crying . He turned away from the window . " Is that you , Peter ? " Aunt Kate called from the kitchen . " Yes , Aunt Kate . " She was lonely , too . Every day it was more difficult for her to walk . He went to Mass on Sundays with her , almost every Sunday , so that he could save her from being embarrassed as a result of how slowly she walked . She weighed about two hundred and ten pounds , a lot to carry on her feet , what with her rheumatism.  --  Ah Peter , it 's the feet that will be the death of me.  --  Your feet will get better.  --  A person 's feet can get better , but the years do n't get better . Peter , you 're a good boy . Your mother 'd be the proud one if she was here to be seeing you now. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be proud of you for her.  --  I 'd like to make you proud of me , Aunt Kate.  --  Let God , Our Lord , help you , Peter . Ah , me feet , they ache like the punishment of sin . Aunt Kate wore black . She 'd worn black before Uncle Dan had passed away . She walked with strained slowness , and he remainedby her side . He did n't mind it . Going to Sunday Mass did her too much good . She did n't talk solely of her feet . She spoke of the people she saw , and always asked who anyone wasp231whom she did n't recognize or did n't know . She liked being greeted , spoken to , and she 'd remark on the looks and appearance of those she knew.  --  There 's Mrs. Dunne . She does n't look a day older than the first day I set eyes upon her . Look at her , she walks like a bird . She 's so little , Peter.  --  Yes , she 's the talk of the neighborhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lord Almighty have they to be saying about her , the old get-outs and gossips ?  --  Oh , I did n't mean that there 's gossip and backbiting about her , I mean people know her and like her , and talk about how she flits along the street.  --  I see . It 's a sin to backbite a good woman , and she 's a good woman.  --  Yes , she is.  --  She knows what trials and tribulations are , and it 's long years since she buried her man , long years . Mrs. Dunne disappeared ahead of them , turning the corner of 6oth and South Park Avenue . Slowly , they made their way to church , almost seven blocks . Could he say he did n't believe and not accompany Aunt Kate to church for Sunday Mass ? That question which Peter asked himself was of heart and sentiment , not of truth and belief . And he felt it as such . Could he hurt his Aunt Kate by proclaiming disbelief which she could not understand , and could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and of his father , and of her whole family , and the good names of Nolan and Moore ? Could he repay her love and care of him , as she looked upon his years in her home , by denying the belief which she believed to be the sustenance of her life , and the consolation of old age which brought its thoughts of death and its fears of the awful hour when death would come upon her like a thief in the night , and she would tremble before Almighty God , and might even have to answer to God , Himself , for the sin of Pride and the sin of his becoming a heathen atheist ? Could he leave a wound in her heart which might never heal ? Could he hurt her so ? And could he hurt his father , too ? And throw the family into bitter angerp232and a violence of indignation that would be lifelong ? For he was sure that this would happen if he were to become a black sheep . And what would he gain ? What would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow man , and for himself ? Peter did not need to ask himself these questions . They were all like seeds covered by the shell of the big question he had asked himself . Once , on their way to church , while Aunt Kate labored across every sidewalk square , Peter was seduced into a spell of illusion and a trapping net of guilt . He believed that he had done it , said it , crossed the Rubicon from his past to a future as a heretic , and that the reactions to this deed would be thrust upon him at any second.  --  It was better that you was dead . He could hear Aunt Kate saying that in anger and on the verge of tears . But she would n't cry . There was as much hardness as kindness in her character , and if she cried , she cried alone . Aunt Kate was not a woman to be demonstrative.  --  Look good and long ' pon this sleeve , she often said , holding up her left arm as she spoke . Look long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart there upon it ? There would be the flash of conquering pride in her gray eyes , and her round face , which had grown massive with the years , would hide her sadness in a look of flint . But she 'd cry alone . When he 'd had these thoughts about Aunt Kate , they 'd been on their way to High Mass , at eleven o'clock . She liked going to High Mass . It took longer , and he 'd get restless , but would usually be able to maintain sufficient self-control so as not to make it too apparent . He tried not to be bored at Mass , but that was a long-standing problem in his religious life . During all his years of going to Mass on Sunday , the struggle with boredom had interfered with his concentration on the symbolic meanings of the Mass , on his prayers , on Heavenly things and scenes , on what was religious and relevant instead of mundane and irrelevant . Of late , he had not been helping souls in Purgatory , or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions.  |p233That  Sunday morning , in particular , he mused over the mundane while Father McGee , a man of somewhat plump proportions , bald on top but with fringes of gray hair on the sides of the large head which featured a very ruddy face , took his time saying High Mass . Peter and his aunt followed the Mass , kneeling , sitting , rising in the crowded church which was so familiar and full of memory and nostalgia for them because they had been coming to it for so many years of their lives . Aunt Kate had grown old during these years , while Peter had grown from boy to young man . The sadness of years lived and lost was upon Aunt Kate . Mrs. Nolan felt the years in her feet and ankles and " in my heart . " And now , the years had passed , swift as a bird on the wing . Her man was gone , and others were gone , too , and her family was raised , and her nephew beside her here in church , Peter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . She was praying for him after all she had heard tell of that Universitywhere he went . She prayed , bowing her head , but , now and then , looked up to gaze at the altar in the front of the church , with the candles lit in three rows on both sides of the Tabernacle , and Father McGee and the three altar boys in their black cassocks , and the Holy Mass going on . Father McGee wore green vestments , and it meant something , the color of the vestments the priest could be after wearing when he said Mass , but she did n't know the meaning of the colors , except for gold and black , and there were parts of the Mass she did n't know what could be their meaning , or she 'd forgotten , but she loved the Holy Mass , with the singing , the Latin , with her knowing hardly a word of what it was meaning , except for a few that had been told her , but it was n't the knowing the Latin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most she knew . But she had long been accustomed to hearing Latin in church , and it was both familiar and mysterious ; it was soothing and a comfort and a solace to the heart . She was always thinking that the angels sang in Latin . Oh , God , have mercy on her poor soul , Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . . . She whispered Hail Marys with her head slightly bowed , andP234the singing made sadness like happiness , and fear like hope . It was like gold , flowing through the church and pouring into her . Father McGee singsonged more than he sang , and with a recognizable touch of brogue . The chorus consisted of three men , and that pretty Peg Lawlor played the organ so lovely and sang so pure , just like innocence . She should be married , and a pity it was , what a pity , that she was n't , Peg Lawlor . You 'd think the men would be at her doorbell and hoping to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " Ma , I 'm engaged to Peg Lawlor , " there 'd be nothing out of her to oppose the wedding . But she could n't be thinking like that , not in church at Holy Mass . Our Father Who art in Heaven .. . She said Our Fathers and listened to Peg Lawlor sing the Credo . And Peter heard mumbled sounds coming from her lips . He knelt , now and then moving his lips as though in silent prayer , or in actual prayer . His ruddy face was a blank of solemnity . His eyes moved with the smallest movements of his head , and he took within his stare , one of masked curiosity , as many people as he could . So many he knew . He could say , though , that there were more he could n't recognize than there were he knew , including parishioners known only by sight . But how did it come that he was having such dull thoughts ? Eeny-meeny-miney-mo . Aunt Kate was puffing , breathing a little heavy . And he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements . Where had his thoughts been ? There was a mental pause before he recalled his thoughts about doubt and belief and himself , and the sadness that had come upon him here in church when Father McGee had begun to say this High Mass . A depression of new sadness was coming back . But he did n't feel it as much as he had before . He did n't actually feel it . It could n't , therefore , be sadness . He was dull , that is , he was feeling dull to himself , and the thoughts he 'd had , and dull about the people around him . It was almost a strange feeling ; it was strange , but not
