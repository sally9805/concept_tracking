By the numbers , the churches are holding their own in the U.S. According to the newly published Yearbook of American Churches for 1964 , the increase in church membership since the 1963 Yearbook was 1.6% , equaling the rate of national population growth . The report says that 117,946,002 Americans claim an affiliation with some religious organization ; this figure represents 63.4% of the population , just .2% less than the record of 1960 . <P> Yearbook statistics , which are compiled by the mostly Protestant National Council of Churches , show that Roman Catholicism continues to make the greatest gains . The U.S. now has 43,847,938 Catholics , an increase of 2.3% . The largest Protestant denomination is the Southern Baptist Convention ( 10,191,303 ) , which took the lead for the first time since the organization of the present Methodist Church ( now 10,153,003 ) in 1939 . But in relationship to the total U.S. population , Protestant affiliation declined by .3% since the previous year .                   @ @
