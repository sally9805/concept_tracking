 | The Winds of Freedom Stir a Continent : Africa AT A TIME in the long ago , while Europe plodded forward , Mother Africa lay down to sleep in her incomparable sunshine . She sighed in her sleep ; the wind of her breath buried the works of the Pharaohs in sand . She stirred , making the earth shake , and the Roman temples of Tunisia fell . Beyond the Bight of Benin , in the jungles of Nigeria , the artists yawned and closed their eyes and never woke again , and only the bronze heads dug from the rubble of If e bear witness they lived at all . Forest vines ' green tongues licked at the walls of Zimbabwe , Rhodesian city of mystery . For thousands of years ships brought slavers to her coasts . Finding Mother Africa drugged with sleep , they seized her children and hurried them away . In 1800 Africa on maps was a narrow coastline encircling a great white blank . Intrepid explorers filled it : Mungo Park , a young Scottish surgeon ; David Livingstone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Henry M. Stanley , British journalist . Hosts of missionaries , traders , engineers , doctors , and teachers followed them . Devoted scientists came to fight the tsetse fly that devastated half a continent . Mother Africa awakened . Many things had changed , she saw , while she lay sleeping . Guns mocked the spears of her sons . A thing called a wheel carried the white man 's loads . And the big-bellied drums of the forest tribes spoke new words . " The man Livingstone defies the hunters of slaves , " they boomed from along the Zambezi . " He marches boldly into their camps and cuts the bonds of their cap-@#  | tives . He speaks a word that intoxicates like palm wine . The word is freedom . ' " " Freedom , " breathed Mother Africa , rising to her feet . " Free-DOM ! " The children of Africa took the word and made of it a litany . " Independance ! " What matter the shape of the word ? For the children only the concept counts . " Uhuru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shake the world . " Free-DOM ! " Speed , the incredible speed of fire on the veld . Of the leopard 's pounce . And of freedom 's march across Africa . For almost half of 1960 I watched one of the great human upheavals of my time . I saw beauty and ugliness , happiness and misery , hope and.despair . Men lived and men died before my eyes . I saw meanness , nobility , comedy . And tragedy . At first the blazing vitality and power of Africa in ferment frightened me . Amid insistent elbows I knew claustrophobia . But faces go with elbows , and many faces smiled and spoke kind words . These are my fellow humans , yearning for health , education , a place in the sun for  | their children , the entrancing gadgets of the modern world , respect , peace , and ? " Free-DOM ! " Freedom is a many-sided thing . It can bless the strong and the wise , but it carries with it responsibility as well as privilege . New Africa has had freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks the question : What will she do with it ? MONROVIA , capital of Liberia , has a Water Street beside a sluggish river . a street of Lebanese stores that sell the rainbow in cheap cotton cloth . I walked this street one night at the flood of its human tide . Percy Borde and his partner Pearl Primus walked by my side . Percy and Pearl are professional dancers from New York . They teach arts at the University of Liberia . Pearl , seeking a doctorate of philosophy from New York University . plans to present , in support of her thesis , a recital of African dances . " We will start you at the beginning , " Percy said to me . " Hear the folk songs and the drums , the oldest human sounds in Africa . " And I heard them above the babel of the crowd ? dee ! male voices , the thunder of the  | painted drums , the chunking of strange boxlike instruments . We turned into a side street , coursing the sound . We entered a warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throb ceased , and the singing died away . Quietly the singers and the drummers watched me , 40 men with skins the purple black of midnight and the shoulders of trained athletes , side by side on rude benches . " The Fanti men of the Ghana coast , " Pearl said . " They sing to gods who were old when Ghana was a mighty empire . " The Fanti men , the roving fishermen of all the Atlantic shore from Senegal to Angola . They live on the lonely beaches beside their magnificent high-prowed canoes , and of the world beyond the breakers they ask only the cotton cloth of the Lebanese shops , which they wear like the togas of Roman statesmen to leave a shoulder bare . " Do not stop , " Pearl said to them . " This man comes from my country . He has crossed an ocean to hear you . " And that was all the Fanti asked to know , and they squeezed together on their benches to make room . The drums regained their voices . The singers picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish spirit , half fish and half bird , " Pearl breathed in my ear as tempo and volume soared . " Oh , fish spirit , lead the fishes to the nets . Lead only the big ones , let the little ones go away unharmed , make the nets strong so they will hold the fishes .... " But already she was moving away , to the open space before the throbbing drums , and she was dancing ( below ) as no one can dance whose ancestral home is not Africa . Then the Fanti families came from the dark huts , moving to the beat of the music until all the African world around me was rhythmic motion . The women glided from the shadows , and the children with them , some barely big enough to walk but all moving their small hands and shoulders and legs with untaught grace , as dark flowers move in a night breeze . " Join them , move with them , " I heard Pearl @#  | call , and I did , trying to dance as they danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also by some atavistic fear of being still and alone in a world that danced . Across the street a man in a ragged white robe paused on the sidewalk . He listened a moment to the drums , I should think . Then he collapsed to the ground . A small coin rolled from his pocket , a parcel from his hand . The drums growled . The singers sang a song of birth . A policeman looked at the man on the sidewalk . " He is dead , " the policeman said , and moved the coin and parcel close to the body , out of the way of passers-by . The birth song went on . One or two of the Fanti came out and looked at the dead man and then went back to their benches . " MOVE OR DIE , " said William V. S. Tubman , President of Liberia , thumping the speakers ' rostrum . Liberia and its President certainly moved while I was there . Mr. Tubman broke ground for the Law Courts Building . He switched shovels and broke ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told the audience , perspiring in their heavy Western suits . He celebrated his 64th birthday ; he staged a glittering state reception for Ahmadou Ahidjo , Prime Minister of the French Cameroons : he opened a night club call &d; The Pepperbird ; he inspected the elegant new Ducor Palace Hotel on a hill above the sea . To help him dedicate Monrovia 's new City  | Hall , Lord Mayor Zewde Gabre Selassie flew in from Addis Ababa , and Mayor Rodger Ferguson came from Monrovia , California . " We move or we die , " Mr. Tubman told me in his office . " That goes for all Africa . " I wish , " he went on , " you could see my place upcountry and my pygmy hippos , a kind native to Liberia . But I do n't have time to take you ? I have to meet a trade delegation . " So I went on away with Reggie Hodge , one of his Information Service people , and looked at Liberia in motion . We watched the rich iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belts to the holds of ships berthed in Monrovia 's brisk new port . We backtracked the heavy stuff along a new railroad to Bomi Hills . The " Hills " will disappear , for they are almost solid ore , and the Liberia Mining Company , allied with Republic Steel Corporation , already has transformed several into a vast red pit . I slipped away to the mellow Harbel Planta-@#  | tion of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company ( opposite ) . For years the parklike groves , almost 100,000 acres , have sparked the Liberian economy. * One day they will yield place to Bomi Hills and other iron deposits deeper in the interior . Reggie and I had dinner in a fine hotel on the outskirts of Monrovia . " The cash register was robbed , " said Reggie . " The manager called the police . They could not find the thief . " So the manager called the sassywood , the medicine man . He set palm oil to boiling in an iron kettle and dropped in a pin . " Take the pin out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The innocent ones felt only a cool , damp sensation as they reached in their arms . The guilty one did not dare try . He would have been badly burned . The manager got his money back . " " Reg , do you truly believe that ? " I asked . " Nat , " he said quietly , " you forget that I am an African . " Sometimes a veil descends over the eyes of Africa , and behind it I can not go . It is not that I am forbidden , it is only that I do not know the way . The man behind the veil can die of as enemy 's curse , if he knows he is cursed . can find his path across the trackless desert time of blowing sand , when even the ra fails ships in the Suez . He can not see , sm or hear the leopard in the thornbush , but knows it is there .

" Ghana fishermen knew tuna came here , but it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single big one . Their government asked our employer , Star-Kist Foods of Terminal Island , California , to teach new methods . So we are here , and everything is half and half , profits and expenses . " The fishermen too . Half of ours are Ghanaians. "  | The tuna boiled in Columbia 's wake , following the chum line of little fishes the men dipped from the live wells and threw into the ocean . In their fishing harness and hard aluminum hats , the men climbed over the rail into the metal racks hung over the stern and sides close to the sea ( page 309 ) . Ghanaians Learn to Hook Tuna The Americans had been doing this all their lives . Teamed two men to a fish these are " two-pole " tuna of 50 , 60 , or 75 pounds ? they swing the blue-and-silver torpedoes out of the sea in a steady stream , into the fish boxes , and the ship vibrates to the frantic poundings of the smooth , powerful bodies . The Ghanaians do not work as expertly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baits away in time . They do not always pull together , so that the tuna wins , and slips the barbless hook . " But , " Ed said , " they are the best beginners I 've ever seen . Soon they will know the business . The government is ordering boats from Europe and the United States for them . They will have a fine fishery here . " This is the pattern of progress in Ghana . The country won its freedom three years ago , but remained within the British Commonwealth . Key British administrators and technicians keep their posts , and Ghana welcomes people like Ed Madruga who can teach her the skills she must have for survival in the complex world she chose to enter . With our load of tuna , we put in to Tema , the nation 's nearly completed port of dreams . Already the cacao , economic mainstay of the nation , sails out of Tema to the world . And one day , when the roaring Volta River is harnessed and the power plants hum , aluminum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region lie some of the world 's greatest deposits of bauxite , the aluminum ore . Beside the deep-sea wharves and warehouses is a section built especially for fishermen . Gay in their bright prints , empty 313  | baskets on their heads , the women of Ghana came in swarms to meet us . They stared at the great tuna . Then they begged to buy ? not the tuna , but the little bait fishes in the live wells . " They 'd rather have the little fish that are easy to smoke , " said the Englishman Geof Harrison , Chief of the Ghana Fisheries Division . " We are now teaching these women to eat tuna . " English With a Ghana Flavor I took the hard road to Accra , the capital . Traffic fairly flew , symbol of Ghana 's hurry . Pixies , I think , paint the names on the buses . The words are English , the national language , but the flavor is pure Gold Coast . " All Is Well , " reads the ornate sign on one battered conveyance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for they are jammed together in desperate discomfort . " Love Is Nice " likes the middle of the road ; so " Life Is War " meekly takes the ditch . " The Life ? What You Have Done " blows its horn , but " All Shall Pass " suffers nothing to pass . In Accra there is a night club called " Kalamazoo Sake Your Head . " Kwame Nkrumah 's secretaries shook their heads . " The Prime Minister has been shying away from interviews lately , " they told me . " But why do n't you take a look at the interior of the country ? You could meet some extremely interesting people . " Maybe it was a test of the strength of my 314  | wish to meet Dr. Nkrumah , indisputably one of the most powerful of Africa 's home-grown leaders . I went inland , and ' one of the first " interesting people " I met was the Prime Minister , who has since been elected President ( page 305 ) . " One of those small-world things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania and I in New Jersey , only 50 miles away . " " And I know your NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , " he grinned. * " Come along with me to the durbar , if you want something colorful to write about . You 'll see the chiefs of Western Ashanti in all their ancient splendor . " The Ashanti . Yesterday 's fierce warriors of the voodoo-ridden jungle , men who dared pit spears against firearms . Today they prosperous cacao growers , but still proud a not too happy about the new form of dem s . racy . The Ashanti chiefs came to the durbar ti in blazing robes of state . Bearers cam their carved wooden stools , symbols of th power . The soft yellow gold of Ghana . for which the Portuguese came to the Gold Coast before Columbus sailed for America , gleamed in their headdresses and in the warp of the robes . Huge umbrellas bounced and swayed as i  | their followers milled about . Hard hands pounded giant drums . From long trumpets came shattering blasts . Women shrilled ululating calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chiefs swept down the durbar field in the midst of their retinues to greet the Prime Minister , who had arrived in a large automobile preceded by the sirens of a police escort . The Omanhene ( paramount chief ) Nana Akuamoah Boateng II jiggled by in a palanquin carried by his people ( page 312 ) . This powerfully big man looked familiar . Where had I seen him before ? Then I remembered . The night before , at a dance in the open courtyard of a hotel at Sunyani , a big man in a tuxedo had been he master of ceremonies who announced the music the saxophones would play . He had danced the " High Life , " a sort of cakewalk , none too sedate . " I go for this jazz , " he had told me . It was the Omanhene . DARK ROCK from the heart of Africa helped to end World War II . The Belgian Congo was the birthplace of the Hiroshima atom bomb . Even today , 15 years later , few people know the story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first outside writer and photographer ever to go into the mine of Shinkolobwe. * A prospector stumbled upon the Shinkolobwe pitchblende in 1915 . Union Miniere du Haut-Katanga , a Belgian company that has played a leading part in bringing industry to the Congo , picked up the property and mined the ore quietly until the 1930 's . But nobody wanted large quantities of pitchblende in those days , and the Union Miniere 's main preoccupation then as now was copper ( page 319 ) . The company closed the deep diggings . Water filled the gloomy galleries . In 1938 , a year before World War II began , a British scientist warned the Union 's then president , Edgar Edouard Sengier , against the danger of an atomic bomb possessed exclusively by a possible enemy . M. Sengier , who is now Sir Edgar Sengier , K.B.E. , made a fateful , lonely . @#  | decision . He ordered Shinkolobwe pumped out . Quietly he sent more than 1,000 tons of uranium ore to a New York warehouse . In 1941 the United States began its frantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon M. Sengier in New York . " The fate of the world may depend upon your uranium ore , " he said . " How soon can you get it here ? " " Would tomorrow do ? " asked M. Sengier . Descent to a Dark Inferno The Brussels office of Union Minier authorized our unprecedented visit . Astonished officials met us at Elisabethville and drove us to Shinkolobwe . The Belgian captain of a police unit guarding the mine stared at our military passes . " Incroyable ! I had better keep my eye on you , " he said , donning hard hat and coveralls to accompany us into the depths . Andre Noel , director of the mine , came too . The mine cage dropped us to a gallery where ore cars rumbled on slippery rails ( opposite ) . Heavy dark rock filled the cars . I recoiled from the sinister stuff . " It is not strong enough to harm you , " said Andre . " Switch on your lights , and we shall go to the place it came from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath low jagged ceilings , we stumbled ever downward . Sometimes we half climbed , half fell down wooden ladders . Once I coasted , as on a sled , atop a slithery mass of loose rock . Everywhere were the shadowy figures of the  | miners , ebony men whose eyes and teeth alone reflected the light of our electric lamps . We came to the working face . In the din of jackhammers , conversation became impossible . They handed me one of the chattering monsters . I drove it at the cold rock . Air hoses writhed about my legs like Stygian serpents . Vibrating bodies of miners on either side squeezed me into my appointed niche . I lasted perhaps a minute . " Pas op ! " said a voice behind me , and a grinning African took the tool from my nerveless hands . " Pas op " is " watch out : " in both Afrikaans and Flemish . You will hear it in many isolated places south of the Equator , carried homr by the roving African miner from the diamond mines at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled back to the waiting cage , I saw the pitchblende vein . Such an  | insignificant thing ? a black streak barely two inches wide , slanting ever downward . A miner said something to me in a tribal language . I asked a supervisor to translate . " He says it comes up from hell . " I was in the Belgian Congo before , during , and after the sessions in Brussels that resulted in Belgium 's surprise decision to grant immediate independence to the colony . Emotions boiled , and overwhelmed reason . African groups fell upon each other , struggling for leadership in the new government . A few days later I happened to ride a plane into a smaller Congo town where a crowd awaited another chief . I joined the crowd , and , next thing I knew , an African in feathers and leopardskin had shoved a drum at me . " Spell me while I light the cigarette you are about to present me , " he grinned . " I am fatigluC . " So I beat the drum , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Please put the chief 's name in the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , " he said . " Write it in my notebook , " I said . " I have to beat this drum . " The drum was shaking the very earth , and the handwriting came up wobbly . I make it out as " Ndjoku Eugene . " If that is not right , I apologize to the young man . I think he was the chief 's secretary . But what had seemed merely animal spirits while I was in the Congo turned suddenly to violence and tragedy . Back in Washington , as I write this , newspapers tell of Congolese troops turning on the terrified European community , murdering and pillaging in excesses that threatened the precious new democracy . The government of Premier Patrice Lumumba , but a few days old , faces civil war . What of my smiling friend with the drum and leopardskin ? Will he and his people find the way of free men ? I TRIED to stay apart from the human strife in the Union of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the brave new buildings rising in bustling Johannesburg , and sampled its sophisticated restaurants , Leopoldville Women Throng a Sunny Mart Here , as in all Negro Africa , women hold a market monopoly . Barefoot bandannaed wives draped in flashy calico prints squat behind ground-level " counters " of raffia , banana ' leaves , skins , sheets , and wrapping paper . From 6 a.m. opening until noon closing , the women gossip with one another and haggle with customers over a cup of manioc flour , a handful of peanuts , a few- hot peppers , rice , spinach , lettuce leaves , dried grasshoppers , fish or a sott drink . Before the Belgians granted independence to their central African colony , they built other market places with sanitary covered stalls and redeveloped the African market section . 321  | and joined friends in their homes in peaceful city suburbs . On a Sunday morning I went to the compounds of the City Deep Mine , which is a city-beneath-a -- city , a goldstrewn catacomb a mile below the downtown streets . I went to watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the rippling dance of the Xosa men ; the step dance of the Bacas , who wore gum boots ; and the fierce stamping of the Zulus , which made the earth of the stadium thunder . The Shangaans made humorously derogatory speeches about their compound managers . Another tribe performed a hilarious parody of the white man 's ballroom dancing . From the European sections of the stands came genuine laughter and applause . As each dancing group finished its turn it snaked out of the arena , but the beat of its drums did not falter , and would rock the compound all night . These men danced not for an audience , but for sheer pleasure . Baboons Prowl the Cape In luxurious comfort I took the Blue Train to Cape Town . In one of the world 's most beautiful cities I saw Table Mountain under its racing , swirling clouds , and I rode the cable car to the top ( page 305 ) and watched the moon rise beyond the sparkling city . Then I drove to the Cape of Good Hope , locking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lighthouse that overlooks the famed promontory . The sun shone warmly ; a breeze rippled grassy fields ; everywhere was beauty . On the Garden Route that skirts the coast from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth I twisted through gorgeous mountain passes , watched graceful springbok peacefully grazing beside the road , dipped to golden beaches washed by the warm Indian Ocean . I went into the diamond mines of Kimberley . Not the Big Hole that is only a tourist attraction now , a vast pit with a lake at the bottom . Between 1888 and 1914 , 25 millic. tons of blue ground came out of this volcanic pipe ? containing three tons of diamonds . From the Big Hole , and other Kimberley mines owned by Cecil John Rhodes 's De Beers Consolidated Mines , Ltd. , came the fortune with which Rhodes opened the gold fields of the Witwatersrand and the farmlands of the Rhodesias. * I went into two of the three active De Beers Kimberley mines , the Bultfontein and the Dutoitspan , which connect underground . The galleries are big and clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland Tunnel . In a building in Kimberley they sort and grade the diamonds from all three mines . A beautiful girl smiled at me from the head of a staircase and held open a grillwork door . Just like that I walked into a suite of rooms where $7,500,000 worth of diamonds lay scattered about ( page 340 ) . Fred Borgstrom , De Beers public relations man , told me they had sold $260,000,000 worth last year , and that this would likely be a good year too . One month 's South African production , he said , lay on the tables before a score of sorters or were around the place somewhere . I heard a steely click behind me and turned . The grill was closed , and the girl was pocketing a key . She smiled sweetly at me . We wandered around taking pictures , moving mounds of diamonds as we chose . I was tempted to flip one twice the size of my thumb up my sleeve in a trick I knew as a boy . Just as a joke , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do dazzle one , do n't they ? " the girl said , smiling at me . We packed our cameras and left . She opened the door and smiled goodbye . And as far as I ever discovered , only the @#  | . beautiful girl had given us more than a casual glance the entire time . Unrest Haunts South African Veld Diamonds , gold , beauty and doubt . Three conversations came back to memory when , after my return to Washington , I read newspaper accounts of violence in the suburbs of Johannesburg and Durban . " I do not understand why you can sit where you like in the pretty park , you who are not even of this country . and I can not , " said the Zulu porter at the airport , his face a study in perplexity . " One day , when the policeman tells me to go away , I will find a stone in my hand , and I will throw it at him . Then I will be in trouble . " Over the dark eyes the veil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went away . " My grandfather made this farm on empty 325  | veld , " said the Boer in the Transvaal . " It is my home now , the only one I have . " The house is strong . If the time comes , I shall take my wife and my children and my rifle inside . The last of us to live will burn our home , so they can not have it . " I spoke of the Zulu and the Afrikaner to a warm friend in Cape Town , a cultured man , a quiet man who knows every corner of his native land , and loves it . " God help us , " he said . " They are two decent men , two men who would like and respect each other if they could sit together in the pretty park and talk . " There is no solution to our problem . " But I think he was wrong , for I have been to Lambarene and seen what human wisdom and understanding can do in Africa . DR . ALBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nobel Peace Prize , has been running a jungle hospital at Lambarene , in what is now Gabon , for more than 45 years ( page 324 ) . You have to poke around a bit before you are really sure this is a hospital . It looks like an African village ? cooking fires smoking in the bare earth runways between the buildings , dogs and sheep and goats and chickens and ducks everywhere underfoot . But doctors and nurses in white gowns walk through the chattering throngs of African men , women , and children , and in the throngs you see the hideous swollen limbs of elephantiasis and the clubbed hands of leprosy . " This is understanding , " said Dr. Rolf Adler of the small Schweitzer staff . " Suppose Dr. Schweitzer had built a hospital of marble and glass and shiny metal . " The people of the forest would not come to such a place . Carried there , they would die . Always they must have their families about them , cooking at the doors , living all together in the huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but by theirs . That is understanding . " " But sanitation ? " " Again , understand . They have immunities we do not have . The operating rooms , of course , are sterile , and the drugs are the latest . The staff knows its business . " The sluggish Ogooue River is the bathroom . It is best to bathe in daylight hours . Crocodiles pay nocturnal visits sometimes , or perhaps a roaming hippo . And electric eels . A woman walked by with a load of firewood on her head . She wore only a loincloth , and that was unusual : These days more African women than ever wear dresses , with necklines rounded and low so that one brown shoulder shows .  | " Who on earth is she ? " I asked . " We do n't know , " said Dr. Adler . " She wandered in from Lord knows where a year or two ago . Nobody here can speak her language . She is a marvelous wood gatherer . " Dr. Schweitzer , although he bustles about like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rain drips on heaps of letters he has not time to answer . The jungle mold dulls the voice of his piano . He must know that what he does is little , when measured against the need . Cured , his patients go back to their villages , but soon they return to Lambarene , reinfected ; the maladies live in the villages of this nation newly carved from French Equatorial Africa , and Dr. Schweitzer can not reach them there . I am sure the man of Lambarene knows despair , and yet he does not give in to it , or to age or the slimy things that lurk in the jungle . He goes on saving lives and alleviating pain , and he weighs his results only against his own capabilities . I think I puzzled him because I did not ask him questions and write his answers in a notebook . " Are n't you going to interview me ? " he said in his accented French . " All the writers who come up here work that way . " But I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed to ask him . His hospital , founded on compassion and understanding , spoke for itself . It was enough to see a man give his best . MANY PEOPLE go to Lambarene . But Cabinda has no Dr. Schweitzer , and few go there . I flew in via Luanda , capital of Angola . This is Portuguese country . Cabinda is a part of Angola , although separated from it by the mouth of the Congo River and a thin slice of Congo territory . Customs officials and police greeted me like an old and trusted friend . " Bemvindo , " they said . " You are Hopalong Cassidy ? " This with a glance at my Texas hat . " Flattery will get you nowhere , " I said . " Oho , " they said , winking at each other , " no matter , welcome anyway . " And they waved me on , scarcely glancing at passport and baggage , leaning back in their chairs and smiling dazzling smiles .

I was no pioneer ; the oilmen , restless geographers of the modern world , had beaten me to Cabinda . Pete Keck of Nocona , Texas , met me at the airport on behalf of Gulf Oil Company . From my hotel balcony I could see a flame tree so violently crimson it left a red mist before my eyes when I turned away . In the evenings , fruit bats darkened the western sky as they poured silently from the baobab trees beside the sea and headed jungleward for dinner . We headed jungleward ourselves . Pete drove a cross-country car with four-wheel drive . We stopped often to chat with his friends . " Every one a rascal , too , " growled Pete . " This one sells gold . " The African had a matchbox full of it . " Sample , " he grinned . " More in my hut . " Another offered to produce a baby gorilla . " Likely a chimp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the death . This fellow 's old smoothbore gun might just kill a chicken , if he could hit it . " Land of Monkeys and Talking Drums Portuguese laws , of course , forbid all this informal traffic in minerals and animals . But the drillers and the geologists and the seismographic crews had young chimpanzees in their camps ( page 310 ) , wonderful animals that clung affectionately around my neck . " We have to buy these , " complained Pete . " They bring them in so thin and weak we must take them to save their lives . The police come . We say , Look , they 're not chained up , they just hang around . ' And that 's so , too . " Cabinda 's roads are jungle trails widened by the wheels of jeeps and loggers ' ramshackle trucks .

Struck with the thick drumsticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals are peaceful in Cabinda . The buffalo is small and hides in the forest . The elephant , also small as elephants go , leaves tracks in the roads by night , but you rarely see him . Monkeys cross the road , and sometimes a pangolin , a scaly anteater . A six-foot snake lay in the dust , its head severed from the body . This was a spitting @#  | cobra , a deadly thing that can kill , or , from eight feet away , destroy sight . Who had courage to kill him with a jungle knife ? We saw the drilling rig towering higher even than the mighty , fluted kapok trees . We watched the seismographic crews probing for the oil strata with small blasts of dynamite . We followed the road until it ended in a savage erosion gully on a hillside . We left the jeep and went on afoot , careful not to tread on maneuvering columns of army ants . At the bottom of this dreadful hill ran a swampy stream . A small African boy played in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitude , and soon he slipped away . " We 'll bring the rig through here in a couple of weeks , " Pete said . And they would too , and likely the small boy would get a proud job carrying a water bucket , and would wear a tattered undershirt and somebody 's castoff kll.aki trousers . ACROSS THE CONTINENT in Kenya and Tanganyika the " old Masai , " as the British settlers call him with mingled admiration and exasperation , wears nobody 's trousers , although he paints stockings on his long legs . Around him the safari wagons race about and the tourist cameras click , and he could have this new civilization if he wanted it . But he wants none of it , except maybe the shillings he condescends to accept for posh : for his picture . " The old Masai has it made , " a settler sair . " He does n't hunt , he does n't grow mealier. he lives on the blood and milk of his cattle . He 's tough , and he 's independent , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ringlets , like a woman . " " Also he does n't believe a thing you tell him , " said Warden Stephen Ellis , whose famous " unfenced zoo , " Nairobi Royal National Park , depends for migratory range upon Masai land that may soon be denied to wildlife by the ever-increasing herds of tribal cattle ( page 344 ) . " I bring their chiefs to the park gates and show them the streams of visitors paying their admissions . Forget the cattle , keep the wild animals , and you can have this kind of business yourselves , ' I tell them . " But they think there 's a trick in it somewhere , and I guess one day they 'll bring in their cattle and ruin the park . " I was on safari when I met the Masai for myself . East Africa overworks the word " safari . " It can mean anything from an hour 's drive to six months in the bush with a white hunter , 15 African " boys , " and a fleet of cross-country safari cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oversized Land-Rover with empty gun racks , Harry Reeves of Arusha , Tanganyika , @#  | to drive , and Xaver Njovu Xaver to make me ashamed of my helplessness with a can and no opener . As we crossed the yellow plain , togalike crimson robes appeared . Burnished steel flashed in the sun . " Masai morani ? warriors , " said Njovu . " Wild boys , not civilized . Keep going , bwana . " But we stopped , and the six young morani came gravely to meet us . They had been watching bush pilots landing on a near-by airstrip . They watched without envy . Flying was for the birds , not Masai . Tight necklaces of multicolored beads encircled their throats . Red ocher colored their girlish ringlets ( page 332 ) . Each youth had a spear , a beautiful thing with a four-foot blade , sharp as a razor , on a perfect shaft of polished hardwood . Once the Masai scourged East Africa with these weapons . Even today , when the game warden is looking the other way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * The young men shook hands with us . One said " jambo , " and that was unusual . Masai rarely bother to learn Swahili , the one language East Africa has in common . They shook hands firmly , they looked us straight in the eye , they were quietly friendly . I felt that they liked me , and I know that I lik them . But when they took polite leave and walked away side by side toward their long bachelor house in the distance , they did not look back Curiosity is for white men , not the Masai . Climber Dies on Kilimanjaro We circumnavigated Kilimanjaro , whose base alone covers 1,300 square miles and whose tallest peak , Kibo , thrusts a snowcovered head more than three miles into the African sky . " Ma " Bruehl , who emigrated years ago from Berlin , runs the Kibo Hotel , high on the mountain 's cool and misty flank . She easily talked me out of attempting the summit climb . " Ach , look what the people write , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the successful ones . have been cursing the wet and the cold of the long summit trail for many years . " Also , a man much younger than you died a week ago on the mountain , of only fatigue and despair . The Africans say the spirit of Kibo killed him . " @# @#  | So we went up only as far as the Land-Rover could go , through the verdant coffee plantations that march up the mountainside . Africans own most of these thriving shambas , selling their crops through a cooperative . In the late afternoon , as we passed through the Amboseli National Reserve , a leopard flashed across the road . Harry jerked the wheel sharply , and we bounced into the bush . The leopard vanished into a tangle of acacias and thorny scrub . We went on . but the radiator now leaked badly . We stopped to fetch water from jungle streams in utter darkness . Hyena eyes gleamed like fireflies from the roadside . L Njovu sensed my uneasiness and spoke words of comfort . " Fisi is harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " A few years ago this was Mau Mau country . It occurred to me suddenly that I did n't know a thing about Njovu , with whom l had huddled beneath a single blanket in the chilly back of the open car . But he did n't know anything about me either . I had a letter from Njovu a few days ago . " I am very much worried with your journey , " he said , " but I think that you arrived in America safely ; if so , I thank God . . . . Grateful send me your photograph , and in turn 1 will bring you mine . " Lion Prowls the Suburbs We entered Nairobi . I took a shower in the New Stanley Hotel , then drifted over to the Equator Club , which is frequented by air hostesses and white hunters . " My vacation 's almost over , and I have n't shot my lion yet , " said an American , " You know the big apartments toward the edge of town , on the airport road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , get your gun and poke around between the buildings . There 's a lion there now. , , It was true . Njovu had pointed him out under the street lights as we came into town . E THIOPIA is the Tibet of Africa , an inertial land of ancient mystery only recently come to realize there is a world worth knowing beyond its jagged mountains . You sense the moon-world quality of Haile Selassie 's 3,000-year-old kingdom before ever you cross its borders . Your Ethiopian Airlines plane waiting on the Nairobi airport runway is of familiar American make , but the fuselage is a striking orange and green . and marked in the age-old Amharic script . The Lion of Judah , rampant and dragonlike. is drawn large upon its nose . Chances are five to one that no ordinary business takes your seatmate to Addis Ababa . " I 'm going up for black leopard pelts , " said the man next to me . " One of the few places  | in the world you can still hope to find more than an occasional one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where do you hunt them ? " I asked , my imagination on fire . " Hunting 's not for me , old boy , " my friend said . " I deal with a German in Addis . He makes safaris into wild places the government does n't even know it owns , and he trades for the skins with people who 'd likely spear you or me on sight . " My daughter Louise runs the fur shop in the New Stanley at Nairobi . I buy the furs . and she makes them into coats that sell for large prices . " The plane crossed over the Kenya frontier and climbed steadily toward the mile-high Abyssinian plateau . Beneath the wings passed the Great Rift Valley , the high blue Ethiopian lakes , and mountain country so savage the thought of engine trouble caused chills . What giants men were in days of old : Ethiop kings led entire armies over this bitter @#  | land to ravage what is now Sudan . Portuguese adventurers in heavy armor passed this way in the 15th century , seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not many more roads today than there were in those stirring times . The tax collector rides Ethiopian Airlines , but from the isolated airstrips he takes a mule , if he can get one ; if not , he walks . We touched down smoothly on the Addis airport . A cab took me through the hilly streets to my hotel . Donkeys and horses complicate Addis traffic . Squatty shops built of corrugated iron sheets dwell in the shadows of concrete office buildings . Mansions share cool hillsides with thatched huts . Hyenas prowl the city at night . They scavenge well : they will eat anything that was ever alive . Of all cities I know , I like best the smell of Addis Ababa . It is the haunting smell of burning eucalyptus . The Emperor Menelik II , who united the nation , everywhere planted eucalyptus . Now there are so many the people may cut them , as Menelik intended , for firewood . The phone shrilled at midnight . " Come down at once , " said an anxious voice . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bathtub , " I protested . " He must only put on his clothes ; the night is warm . I beg you to come at once . " We tumbled into a shining @#  | car and rushed through the streets . In a small steep street jammed with other shining cars , we stopped . Imperial Guardsmen flung open the car doors . Servants in snowy white jodhpur breeches helped us descend . A cabinet minister in dinner jacket met us . The Princess Tenagne Worq Haile Selassie , ( laughter of the Emperor , is your hostess , " he said . Still tying my necktie , I walked through a heavy gate into the world of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba , from whom the King of Kings traces his descent . A vast tent of striped canvas covered an entire garden . Beneath it a thousand guests or more sat at tables set out among the flower beds , or strolled garden paths hidden beneath priceless carpets from the East . " I can not see the stage through this bush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing with hatchets to trim it . Ethiop music , strange to Western ears , wailed above the hubbub of voices . Dancers in relays did the traditional steps of the proud tribes , the men costumed as warriors , with round shields and long spears , the women in long white robes . Don C. Bliss , then United States Ambassador to Haile Selassie 's court , beckoned me . " I feel like Cinderella , " I said . " What is this party ? " " A wedding reception for His Imperial Majesty 's two granddaughters . Last week the Prin- .  | @# cess Seble Desta married Lij Kassa Woldemariam , and her sister Princess Sophia Desta married Lt. Derege Hailemariam of the Imperial Guard . There they go now . " Two dark lissome girls , chic in Paris gowns , swept by on their husbands ' arms , headed for the stage where a fresh orchestra in tuxedos now played for ballroom dancing . The orchestra had changed , but not the music . The young Ethiopians jitterbugged to it with success and refinement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a whirl with me , but I could n't fit my creaking foxtrot to the Queen of Sheba 's music , and I gave the lady her freedom . I tried the wat , the meat-and-pepper dish of the land , and thought it mostly pepper . I put out the fire with tej , the golden liquor made of honey , like the ancient mead . I joined a maelstrom of chauffeurs and maids and soldiers and cooks dancing the dances of the countryside in a smaller adjoining tent . Contrasted with them , the jitterbugs looked like statues . When I left , it was almost dawn , and the hyenas had skulked back to the hills . In leaving I committed a social error , I found out later , because I left before the royal party , which included the Crown Prince . The Emperor Obeys a Photographer But I also fumbled my bows to the Emperor a day or two later , and I was not fed to the palace 's forty lions . The fortieth lion is an old maned fellow named Tojo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wears a heavy chain , I think to slow him down a bit and give his attendant 349  | a handhold in case of emergency . Because the chain trips him on staircases , he often backs down steps , which gets him credit for good manners in the presence of the Emperor . There is nothing incongruous about a lion in the garden of the Conquering Lion of Judah . He belongs there , along with the swans and peacocks and the tiny royal dogs and the white stallions with flaring nostrils paraded daily for the Emperor 's expert inspection and to be given sugar from the imperial hands . I forgot to bow as I walked through the audience hall to meet Haile Selassie . He just smiled and got up and shook hands and handed me a bound volume of NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC . " Mine , " he said . " I 've been reading the magazine for 38 years . " The monarch is small , graceful , dignified , and friendly . He has the erect bearing of a warrior and the fine chiseled features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 352 As we discussed articles the GEOGRAPHIC has published on Ethiopia , he dispensed with the interpreter who had been translating from the Amharic , and talked to me directly in French and English . He does not often do this . He came outside and put himself under photographer 's orders ( page 349 ) . He fed Tojo for the cameras , although he said Tojo was hungry and the thing might wind up in a scramble . It did . I told His Imperial Majesty we would n't publish an undignified picture of a friend . He thanked me , smiling . New Industries Come to Ethiopia Haile Selassie ; who lived in England during the years the Italians occupied his country . wants the things of the mechanized West for Ethiopia . There is a modern sugar refinery . and the Italians are working on a new power plant for Addis Ababa as part of wartime reparations . The Emperor welcomes outside businessmen , and aid from the United States . Yet I had a feeling he does not want to  | extend his influence over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mountains . That was not always true of Ethiop kings , for once they ruled Egypt . HIGH ABOVE the Blue Nile , which rises in Ethiopia , I followed the Ethiop path of conquest to Khartoum in the Sudan , and on northward to Wadi Haifa in the blazing desert . There beside the Nile I stood where an Egyptian archer had stood when Cushite soldiers from the south advanced to the attack . He failed and likely died , this archer ; the enemy tumbled the walls of Buhen and burned the rubble and broke the wine jars , and I saw the ashes and stood on the shards myself 3,500 years later . Senusret I built the frontier fortress of Buhen about 2000 B.C. It had thick ramparts and high square tgwers for the sling platoons . Below them , just above the dry moat , the archers stood on their fire steps , and each man guarded an embrasure in the wall into which his bow fitted . " See how cleverly this was planned , " said Walter B. Emery , Edwards Professor of Egyptology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buhen for several years . " Stand on the fire step . Pretend you hold your bow in the embrasure , which opens into a little chamber inside the wall . Aim your arrow through any of the six holes in the wall from the chamber to the outside . " Using the top holes , you . deliver frontal or crossfire against the enemy as he comes across the plain to the moat . Some of them escape and scramble into the moat . Switch to the lower holes . You can pick off the men in the ditch at your leisure ? or at least that 's the way it was supposed to work . " I looked through the lower middle hole , and there was a Cushite looking up at me , but he turned out to be the Sudanese felucca skipper who had ferried me across the Nile , warning me to hurry before the wind died out . The Cushites burned Buhen . The Egyptians did not rebuild it for 200 years . After their return , Queen Hatshepshut built a temple there . Thutmose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own there instead . A later wave of Ethiopian conquerors apparently pulled the walls of Buhen down , never to be rebuilt , but they spared the tem-@# pie . It is still there , its paintings of Pharaohs and deities as fresh as ever . " They 've fought a few battles in this place , " I remarked , stooping to pick up a smooth stone , a missile from a sling that may have felled an Ethiopian so many years ago . " Yes , " said Dr. Emery , but the Nile will win the last one . After the Aswan High Darn is built , the water will cover Buhen and that will be the end , because Buhen was built of mud brick . " SADD EL-AALI , the Aswan High Darn . will be the mightiest work of man in Africa when it is finished in about ten years . It will cost a billion dollars . It will contain sixteen times as much material as there is in the Great Pyramid of Khufu , and it will create a lake 300 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cairo to somewhere near the Third Cataract , 100 miles inside Sudan . These waters will irrigate two million desert acres , adding 30 percent to the cultivable land of Egypt . They will manufacture 1C billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year , or about ten times as much as Egypt produces now . But they will also destroy Buhen and a hundred other sites of ancient civilizations beneath the Nubian sands . Worse , they may cover the sacred island of Philae , and the Great Temple of Abu Simbil with its colossal rockhewn statues ( page 359 ) . The United Nations . with Egyptian cooperation , now wages a campaign for funds with which to dike these marvels of antiquity against the flood . President Gamal Nasser began work on the High Dam in January , 1960 , by setting off 11 tons of dynamite . There is not yet much to see , however : I had to look elsewhere for the marks of progress in Egypt . Pyramids Visible From Luxury Hotels In Cairo , tall hotels and deluxe apartment houses look down on tall-masted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ropes when the Nile wind dies . You can still see the timeless Pyramids from the city , but now you must look past a striking masonry tower that houses a television enterprise . Colored lights etch the minarets of the bustling capital 's mosques on religious holidays . Some muezzins chant with metal throats . their call to prayer tape-recorded . Traffic is a swarm of bees , growing denser daily with  | the output of Egypt 's one automobile factory . Meandering through the palm-dotted oasis the Nile makes of its mighty delta , I came to the heavily guarded Suez Canal and watched the ships march past . " How does it go ? " I asked the skipper of a British tanker awaiting her canal convoy at Port Said . " Never better , " the skipper said . " They are putting more tonnage through than ever before . " IF THEY FIND enough oil in Libya , the British skipper likely will make fewer trips through the Suez and on into the Persian Gulf for the oil of Arabia ; Libya is much closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked H. W. Brown , manager of Esso Libya , how he was making out . " We 'll fly you down to Zelten , " he said . " It 's a full day by Land-Rover across the desert south of Benghazi , an hour from the Mediterranean by Beaver aircraft . " 355  | The Beaver winged across the narrow astal strip of Libya , with its scattered vilces and its rudely shaped , vaguely outlined fields of grain . After a while only sparse scrub greened an earth on which rain seldom falls , and the dry camps of the Bedouin , where water comes in sheepskins tied to camel saddles , appeared more and more rarely below . And then even the rectangular nomad tents were no more , and the land was the face of the moon ( opposite ) , across which the Bedouin moves only when he has to , but fast , and driving hard for the next oasis . " A couple of hundred miles southeast of here the American bomber Lady Be Good went down during World War II , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? they found her recently , with most of her equipment still in working order , and later , bodies of crewmen who perished in the desert . I helped in the search . " The Zelten airstrip was a patch of crusted @# reedom Stir a Continent 357 desert marked by a dozen metal fuel drums . A Land-Rover shot over a dune in a shower of sand to give us a lift to the drillers ' camp . Rows of aluminum trailers gleamed in the sun . Each had an air conditioner and a heating plant . The thermometer can hit 120 ? in summer , and on a winter night water set out beneath the pale stars may freeze . Huge motors roar day and night at Zelten , furnishing electricity and the power for the drills . Always the sand buggies move about like beetles on a yellow table , and sometimes a howling Texan amuses himself on " sand skis " behind one . But this is a bone-breaking sport , and the camp supervisor would rather his men hunt the fossil shells and sand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaps on this ancient sea floor . I went off to see the discovery well , Zelten No. 1 , that came in at 17,500 barrels a day . It is shut in now , awaiting the building of a pipeline to the coast . I saw the rig drilling yet another well ; it was almost into the oil pool a mile below .  | I had a wonderful meal and a hot shower and a comfortable bed , all of which was better than I found in Benghazi , where the damage of World War II has not all been repaired . Among my maps I had brought a chart of Africa such as the one from my school days ; as much as I hate to admit it , the map was 50 years old . I looked for Zelten and found the place all right , but it was in the middle of a dark spot marked " unexplored . " Times , it seems , had changed . T HEY have changed as well in Tunisia , and for me this was a nostalgic thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war , a man remembers best the few pleasurable things ? his hours of strength , the times of release from responsibilities , above all the comradeships with other men who bore arms . one true good that comes of the holocaust . A man goes back , but he goes alone ; his friends are not there . The land is the same . but sleek cattle and not weary riflemen cross the flaming fields of poppies . The road still runs to Qasserine from holy Qairouan , only it is smoothly paved now , and the dot in the sky is a soaring bird and not a fighter plane . The bridge across the wadi at Feriana still lies in ruins . But why the sudden chill of fear ? That is the voice of a child at play , not my own voice crying in terror as the wind devil dances the dust away and reveals the lethal mines all naked on the sand . I went upstream a hundred yards and took the new bridge of steel and concrete that leads away from the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge . 358
