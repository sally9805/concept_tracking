 | stood out sharply , thick at the base , thinner and sharply bent at the top . It teased Paul 's imagination . AFTER ONE HOUR Clarence Dodd  --  or the Little Man , as Paul still called him in his mind  --  gave Ragnarok 's leash to Doc and made another quick simplified sketch , using criss-cross lines to show the purple . He labeled it " After One Hour . " One of the cars , a red sedan , backed and took off , far ahead of any of the others . From ahead the thin woman called : " Please help us , someone . I think Wanda 's having a heart attack . " Ragnarok whimpered . Miaow hissed . Suddenly Paul realized what the yellow figure reminded him of : a dinosaur . A long jawed dinosaur rearing on its great thick hind legs . His skin prickled . Then he was trembling and there was a faint low roaring in his body . When Paul was a little boy , he had liked to stand on the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging from the ceiling by chains at the four corners . It had seemed at the time a daring feat of equilibrium . Now , all at once , he was standing on that swing again , for the ground under his feet moved , gently but solidly with a ponderous muffled thud , a few inches back , a few inches forward , and then back again , and he was swaying his body to keep balanced , just as he 'd used to do on the swing . Over inarticulate exclamations and calls , Hunter shouted with strident anxiety : " Come away from the cars ! " Margo clung to Paul . Miaow , squeezed between them , squeaked . People were whirling and running . The brown cliff appeared to  | swell ; cracks opened in it all over ; and then it sank , slowly , it looked , but with shuddering sledge strokes at the end . Gravel pattered . A grain stung Paul 's cheek . There was a puff of gritty air . Suddenly the smell of raw earth was very strong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were caught ! " But Paul first looked upward again at the uprearing yellow figure on the purple orb now perceptibly nearer the moon . Tyrannosaurus Rex ! PERSHING SQUARE is a block of little fountains and neatly manicured greenery roofing a municipal garage and atomic shelter in the heart of old Los Angeles , where the signs read " Su credito es bueno " more often than " Your credit is good . " Tonight the winos and weirdies and anonymous wayfarers who , next to the furred squirrels and feathered pigeons , are the Square 's most persistent inhabitants , had something more exciting to observe than the beards of Second Coming preachers and the manic gesticulations of threadbare lecturers . Tonight the inhabitants of Pershing Square spilled into Olive Street at the corner of Fifth , where a bronze statue of Beethoven broodingly faces the Biltmore Hotel , Bunker Hill , and the Baptist Auditorium which serves as one of the city 's chief theaters . Their lifted faces were bright with Wanderer-light as they silently stared south at the monstrous sign in the heavens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its great brow and hairmop as he peered down at his half-buttoned vest whitened with pigeon droppings . There was a momentary intensification of the awed silence , then a faint distant roaring . A woman screamed , and the watchers dropped their gaze . For a long moment it looked to them as if black ocean were coming toward them up Olive in great waves crested with yellow and violet foam  --  great black waves that had traveled all the twenty miles north from San Pedro along the Harbor and Long Beach Freeways . Then they saw that the waves were not black water but cold black asphalt , that the street itself was surging as great earthquake shocks traveled north along it . In the next instant the roaring became that of a hundred jets , and the asphalt waves tossed the watchers and broke up the walls of the buildings around them in a stone and concrete surf . For a second an infinitely sinister violet light flashed from the  | deep eyesockets of the giant metal Beethoven , as he slowly toppled over backwards . THE SAUCER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringe reverberation of the big Los Angeles-Long Beach quake . After the thin woman and two others had been half dug , half pulled out of their light entombment in the edge of the landfall , a hurried count showed three others still missing . There followed a frantic ten minutes of digging , mostly with two bright-bladed shovels that the Little Man had produced from the back of his station wagon , which was solidly buried only as far as the rear wheels and its top dented in only about a foot . Then someone remembered the red sedan that had left ahead of the rest ; and someone else , that it had been the one in which the three missing people had arrived . While the diggers caught their breath , Paul , whose convertible was hopelessly buried , explained his connection with the Moon Project and his intention of making with Margo for the beach gate of Vandenberg Two , and he offered to take anyone along with him who wanted to come and to vouch for them to the guards  --  their obvious distress in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was opposed by a thick-armed man wearing a leather windbreaker and named Rivis , who had a very low opinion of all military forces and the degree of helpfulness to be expected of them  --  and whose car had only its radiator and front wheels dirt-encumbered . Rivis , who also had four cute kids , a swell little wife , and an hysterical mother-inlaw  --  all of them in Santa Barbara  --  was for digging out and getting home . Rivis was seconded by the owners of the microbus and the white pickup truck , both only lightly buried vehicles . The truck 's people , a trimly handsome couple named Hixon wearing matching pale gray slacks and sweaters , were particularly insistent on getting out quickly . There followed a progressively more embittered argument involving such points as : Would the Pacific Coast Highway be trafficjammed and/or quake-blocked ? Was Paul what he claimed ? Would the motors of the buried cars start when dug out ? ( Rivis proved something by starting his , though his car radio got only the howlingest static . ) Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panelists and their dubious new friends a bunch of oysterbrained intellectuals scared of getting a few blisters on their hands ?  | In the end , half the saucer students , most of them with cars rather lightly buried , stuck with Rivis and the Hixons and , in a burst of hard feelings , even refused to promise to care for the fat woman who had had the heart attack until Paul could send a balloon-tired sand jeep from Vandenberg Two to pick her up . The other half set off for the beach gate . DON GUILLERMO WALKER knew the Wanderer had to be something like a planet , for it and its glaring image in black Lake Nicaragua below had followed him sixty miles southeast now without shifting position  --  except that it was nearer the western horizon and maybe nearer the moon . And now there was showing on the thing what looked like a golden cock crowing to wake Simon Bolivar . I once played in Le Coq d'Or , did n't I ? the lonely bomb-raider asked himself . No , it 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned pinkish here and there along the western horizon ; he did n't know why . Skirting the long ridgy island of Ometepe , he saw more lights at Alta Gracia than you 'd ever expect after midnight . Everybody up and gawking at it and going ape or diving into churches , he supposed . Suddenly red glare and rocks erupted from beyond the town and for an instant he thought he 'd dropped a bomb he did n't know about . Then he realized it had to be one of Ometepe 's volcanoes letting go . He banked east  --  get away , get away from the blast ! Those pink glares  --  why , the whole Pacific Coast must be in eruption , from the Gulf of Fonseca to the Gulf of Nicoya . DON MERRIAM , a battered and grievously weak-legged beetle , pushed himself up on his arms beside the Hut 's proud magnesium flagpole and saw , where the Hut should be , a raw-walled chasm twenty feet across with little waterfalls of dust trickling down its farther lip . One of the ships was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side across the chasm with two of its three shock-absorbing legs sticking up like the legs of a dead chicken , while he 'd almost crawled under the third Baba Yaga without seeing it . They called the little moon-type rocket ships " Baba Yagas " because  --  Dufresne had first thought of it  --  they suggested the witch 's hut on legs that figures in a couple of popular bits of classical Russian music and that , in the underlying folklore , runs about by night on  | those legs . It was rumored that the Soviet moonmen called their ships " Jeeps . " But now the walking-hut comparison was getting altogether too close , for the continuing vertical moonquake , which Don hardly noticed any more , was making the last Baba Yaga step about on its plate-shod legs as it rocked this way and that . One of the shoes was only a yard from the chasm and as Don watched , it tramped six inches closer . Don carefully pushed himself into a wide-based crouch . He told himself Dufresne might have taken off in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Yo might be alive or dead in the ship across the chasm . Gompert .. . The Baba Yaga took another step toward the gulf . Don took a couple of quick ones himself across the jolting surface and then straightened and grabbed the last rung of the ladder that hung down from the body of the ship midway between the three legs . He chinned himself and climbed toward the hatch , set ominously between the five trumpetlike tubes of the jet . The Baba Yaga rocked . Don told himself that his weight lowered its center of gravity a little , making its steps a little shorter . SALLY HARRIS AND JAKE LESHER were on one of the subway trains to be halted and emptied at 42nd Street . The traffic jams had been hopeless and Jake 's car was parked in Flatbush . Police helped the guards clear the subway cars and hurry the passengers topside . " But why , but why ? " Jake was demanding . " It looks bad . " " No , good , " Sally told him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , here we 're near Hugo 's penthouse . This is exciting , Jake ! " Emerging , they found Times Square more packed than they 'd ever known it to be at three A.M. Looking west on 42nd Street , they could see the Wanderer still quite high in the sky , with the moon so close they almost touched . On the south side of the street the shadow edge made a swath of  | motionless yellow people and on their side a swath of purple ones . The electric ads were all going full blast , but paled way down by the supermoonlight . The Square was quieter than they 'd ever known , too , except that just now a man emerged from behind them crying : " Extra ! Read all about it ! Read all about the new planet ! " Jake traded two bits for a Daily Orbit . Its tabloid front page was a pic of the Wanderer in wet , acrid red and yellow inks and six lines of information anyone could have got by looking at the sky and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Does n't baffle me , " Sally said in the highest spirits and then , grinning at Jake , " I created it . I put it up there . " " Do n't be blasphemous , young woman , " a lantern-jawed man admonished her sourly . " Ha , you think I did n't do it , huh ? " she demanded . " I 'll show you ! " She cleared a place around her with her elbows and tossed Jake her jacket . Then , stabbing a finger successively at Lantern Jaw and at the Wanderer , and next snapping her fingers as she swayed provocatively , she began to sing , in an electrifying contralto and a melody borrowed half-and-half from " Green Door " and " Strange Fruit " : Strange orb ! ... in the western sky .. . Strange light ! ... streaming from on high .. . DON MERRIAM had ignited the Baba Yaga 's jet before he 'd strapped down and when the aniline and nitric pumps had barely started to spin . The reason was simple enough : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd done everything he could to cut time . He 'd blown the ship , letting its air escape in a great puff to clear a direct entry for himself , rather than waiting for the airlock between the fuel and oxidizer tanks to empty and fill . He 'd barely dogged the hatches behind him and made only the most perfunctory swipe at the oxygen release lever although he knew his suit oxy was running out  --  and he 'd been almost too late at that . The cold jet fired strongly , however . Lemon-hot molecules streamed out of the Baba Yaga 's tail at almost two miles a second , and after a sticky moment she lifted , but sideways rather than up ? like an old airplane taking off . Perhaps Don 's mistake was in trying to correct at all  --  his present  | vector would likely have got him into some sort of orbit , perhaps quite efficiently . But he was flying by eye and he did n't like the way white moon crossed by cracks kept bulking so large in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less power it took , and he was n't sure how much fuel and oxidizer he had  --  in fact , he still was n't quite sure which of the three sister ships he was in  --  and , besides all that , he was probably already quite giddy and illogical from oxygen-lack . So , careless of the gravity and a half dragging at him , he reached out sideways  --  it was quite a reach : normally it would have been a robot 's or copilot 's job  --  and slapped the keys to fire three solid-fuel rockets on the side of the ship toward the moon . The sudden extra jolt they gave the Baba Yaga was enough to unseat him . Inexorably , but with agonizing slowness , the stick slipped out of his hand and he fell heavily  --  a lot more heavily than he would have on the moon  --  to the floor a dozen feet below , and his helmet smashed against the back of his head , knocking him out . Ten seconds later , the aniline-nitric jet died , as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stick . The solid-fuel rockets had burnt out a fractional second earlier . The correction had been calculated with remarkable accuracy , under the circumstances . The Baba Yaga was mounting almost straight up from Luna with nearly enough kinetic energy to kick free . But , now , Luna 's mild gravity was slowing the ship second by second , although the ship was still rising swiftly in free fall and would continue to do so for some time . Don 's helmet lay across the lightly-dogged hatch . A tiny flat jet of white vapor about the size and shape of a calling card was escaping through a fine slit in the view window . Frost formed along the crack . BARBARA KATZ said to Knolls Kettering III : " Less than a minute now until contact , Dad . " She meant by " contact " the moment the Wanderer would overlap the moon , or the moon the Wanderer , or " Excuse me , suh , " came a soft deep voice from behind them , " but what 's going to happen when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the back of the big house now . It silhouetted a big man in a chauffeur 's uniform and two women grouped tightly together . They must have come out very quietly .  | From beside her Mr. Kettering said with thin exasperation : " I told you people to go to bed hours ago . You know I do n't want you fussing over me . " " Excuse me , suh , " the voice persisted , " but everybody 's up and outside watching it . Everybody in Palm Beach . Please , suh , what 's going to happen when it hit the moon ? " Barbara wanted to speak up and tell the chauffeur and maids many things : that it was the moon that was moving toward the Wanderer , because the telescope 's electrically-driven mounting had been set to track the moon across the sky and the moon was now running five diameters ahead of its normal course ; that they still did n't know the distance of the Wanderer  --  for one thing , its surface showed no sharp details except its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnifications ; that bodies in the heavens mostly did n't hit but went into orbit around each other . But she knew that men  --  even millionaires , presumably  --  like to . do the scientific talking ; and , besides that , she disliked having to fool around with Palm Beach interracial etiquette . Then she looked up and saw that the problem had solved itself . " They 're not hitting , " she said . " The moon is passing in front of the Wanderer . " She added impulsively : " Oh , Dad , I did n't believe it was really out there until now . " There were little gasps from the women . " The Wanderer ? " the chauffeur asked softly . Knolls Kettering III took over . He said , a bit primly : " The Wanderer is the name Miss Katz and I have selected for the strange planet . Now please go to bed . " ARAB JONES called across the roof to Pepe Martinez and High Bundy , who were waltzing together free-style : " Hey , man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her like a sperm into a purple egg . " The three interracial weed-brothers had smoked four more prime reefers to celebrate the master-kick of the Wanderer 's appearance and they were now high as kites  --  high as orbital radar beacons ! But not so high , if one ever is , as to be utterly devoid of reasoning powers , for Pepe exclaimed : " How those square Mexicans must be crossing themselves south of the border , and the brownies dancing down Rio way , " while High summed it up with : " Like this , man : kicks has come into the world to stay . " Arab said , his brown face gleaming in the Wanderer 's glow : " Let  | us fold our tent and descend , my sons , and mingle with the terrified populace . " HUNTER SAID to Doc : " The moon has sure thumbtacked it down out there , " referring to the plaster-white round standing in front of the Wanderer . " In fact , I 'm beginning to wonder  --  remembering the similar triangles , Rudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million miles away and eighty thousand miles across . " " Jupiter come to call , hey ? " Doc replied with a chuckle and then immediately demanded of the others : " Well , can anyone point out Jupiter to me elsewhere in the sky right now ? Though , " he added , " I 've got to admit I never heard of a purple aspect for Jupiter or a yellow spot in the form of a giant duck . " " A penguin ! " Ann called from behind them . The two men were part of the little cortege plodding through sand and sea-grass toward the beach gate of Vandenberg Two . The cortege was led by Paul , Margo with Miaow , and Doc . Then came Hunter , the Ramrod , and two other men lugging by its four corners an aluminum cot with folded legs , on which Wanda  --  the fat woman ? reposed , groaning a little now and then . Beside the cot walked the thin woman , but without her radio , which had been lost in the slide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rama Joan , Ann , and Clarence Dodd  --  the Little Man  --  with Ragnarok on leash and nervous . The aluminum cot was another you-name-it-we-got-it item from the Little Man 's station wagon . ( Margo had asked him if he had a primus stove and fuel . He had replied , without batting an eyelash : " Yes , I do , but I see no point in taking it with us this time . " ) Just after Doc had made his not entirely frivolous suggestion about Jupiter , Rama Joan called out for them all to look at the Wanderer again . They had already noticed considerable changes in the past forty minutes . The duck ( or dinosaur ) had all its body on the lefthand side of the disk , its head sticking out to the right as if part of a north pole gold-cap . In the new purple area swinging into view there had appeared a large central yellow patch , in shape halfway between an equilateral triangle and a solid capital D. " See , just after the D , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crescent coming . The moon almost hides it . " " That 's the shadow of the moon on the new planet ! " Doc yelled excitedly after a few freezing seconds . " And if it 's any smaller than Luna I ca n't see the difference . Ross , they ca n't be more than a few  | thousand miles apart ! Now we know that planet is Earth-size , almost exactly . " " Mommy , does that mean they almost hit each other ? " Ann whispered . " Why 's Mr. Brecht so happy ? Because they missed ? " " Not exactly , dear . He 'd probably have enjoyed the spectacle . Mr. Brecht is happy because he likes to know exactly where things are , so he can put his hands on them in the dark . " " Mr. Brecht ca n't put his hands on the new planet , Mommy . " " No , dear , but now he can put his thoughts there . " OXYHELIUM MIX gradually filled the cabin of the Baba Yaga from the tank Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatch and opened two doors in Don 's helmet . Little fans went on around the cabin , keeping the new air moving in spite of it being in free fall . It pushed into Don 's helmet , replacing the foul air there . His features twitched and he shuddered a little . His breathing strengthened and he went into a deep , healthy sleep . The Baba Yaga reached the top of its trajectory , poised there , then began to fall back toward the moon . As it fell , it tumbled slowly . Every thirty seconds , about , its spacescreen looked at the moon , and fifteen seconds later at Earth . As it tumbled , the dustfilmed spacesuit with Don inside began to move across the floor , rolling very slowly . THE LPITLE MAN called ahead to Paul : " I do n't mean to impugn your veracity , Mr. Hagbolt , but the Vandenberg Two beach gate seems to be a lot farther away than you led us to believe . Easy , Ragnarok ! " " It 's right in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishing he were inwardly as sure of that as he tried to make his voice sound . He added , " I have to admit I underestimated the distance of the light . " " Do n't worry , Doddsy . Paul will get us there , " Doc pronounced confidently . The three of them were preparing to relieve Hunter , the Ramrod , and one of the two other men at the three corners of the fat woman 's stretcher . " How are you feeling , Wanda ? " the thin woman asked , kneeling by the cot in the sand . " You can have another digitalis . " " A little better , " the fat woman murmured , fluttering her eyes  | open . They rested on the Wanderer . " Oh , my God , " she groaned , turning her head away . The strange orb , inexorably rotating , presented a new aspect . The remains of the dinosaur , or penguin , made a huge yellow C around the lefthand rim of the planet , while the solid yellow D had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of D-in-C . The Little Man did another quick sketch , labeling it simply , " Two Hours . " TWO HOURS Ann said , " I think the C is a straw basket on its side and the D a piece of cake with lemon frosting . And the moon is a honeydew melon ! " " I know who 's hungry , " her mother said . " Or you can think of the D as the eye of a giant purple needle , " Ann quickly pointed out . The Golden Serpent coils around the Broken Egg , the Ramrod thought . Chaos is hatched . The moon and its shadow had moved all the way across the planet . There was a feeling of relief when a thread of night-sky appeared between the two orbs . The man at the fourth corner of the cot , a heavy-faced welder named Ignace Wojtowicz , perhaps just wanting to prolong the rest period , said : " There 's one thing I do n't get at all . If that 's a real planet out there big as Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at us  --  sort of making us feel lighter , at least . " " For the same reason we do n't feel the gravity of the moon or the sun , " Hunter answered quickly . " Then , too , although we know the size of the new planet , we have no idea of its mass . Of course , " he added , " if it did appear out of hyperspace , there must have been an  | instant when its gravity field did n't exist for us and then an instant when it did  --  I 'm assuming the front of a newly-created gravity field moves out at the speed of light  --  but apparently there were no transition effects . " " That we noticed , " Doc amended . " Incidentally , Ross , what 's this casting doubt on my **25;0;TOOLONG theory ? Where else could the thing have come from ? " " It might have approached the solar system camouflaged or somehow blacked-out , " Hunter asserted . " We should consider all the improbabilities . Your own philosophy back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commented . " No , I think what Paul told us about twist fields in the star photos tips the scales toward Brecht 's Hyperspace Hypothesis . And it would have had to have its gravity blacked out too , I 'd think , by your theory . Incidentally , I imagine we already can deduce something about the planet 's mass . It 's now seven minutes past one , Pacific Standard Time , " he said , glancing at his wrist . " About two hours since the new planet appeared . " " Two hours and five minutes , " the Little Man inserted . " You 're a pearl , Doddsy . Everybody engrave that eleven-oh-two P.S.T. on their memories  --  some day your grandchildren may ask you to tell them the exact time you saw Mrs. Monster pop out of hyperspace . But anyway , at one A.M. the full moon ought to be past her highest in the sky , an hour toward setting . I judge she 's definitely east of that point , still near her highest . About three or four degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameters . Which would mean that the gravitational pull of the emergent planet has speeded up the moon in her orbit . Ergo , the newcomer is no lightweight . " " Wow , " Wojtowicz said appreciatively . " Just how much speed-up is that , Doc , figuring like the moon 's a rocket ? " " Why , from two-thirds of a mile to a second to . . . " Doc hesitated , then said , as if incredulous of his own figures : " to four or more miles a second . " He and Hunter looked at each other . " Wow , " Wojtowicz repeated . " But now I take it , Doc , the moon keeps on in her old orbit , just speeded up a lot ? Maybe a month every week , huh ? " The black isthmus between moon and planet had widened a little while they 'd been speaking . " I think we 'd better be getting a move on , ourselves , " Doc said in an oddly distant way , stooping for his corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | GREAT ROTARY PUMPS surged , moving water to the port side of the " Prince Charles " to compensate for the weight of the passengers and crewmen lining the starboard rails and crowding the starboard portholes to watch the Wanderer and the moon set in the Atlantic , while dawn paled the sky behind them unnoticed . The thickness of Earth 's atmosphere had turned the purple of the planet red and its gold orange . Its wake across the calm sea was spectacular . The radio engineer of the atom-liner reported to Captain Sithwise a very unusual and growing amount of static . DON GUILLERMO WALKER managed to land his airplane on the south end of Lake Nicaragua near the mouth of the San Juan River , despite the broken left aileron and the half-dozen holes struck or burnt through the wings by chunks of red-hot pumice . What the devil , the big rock had missed him ! The volcano on Ometepe was now joined by its brother peak , Madera , and they were sending twin ruddy pillars skyward almost fifty miles northwest . And now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw wink on , scarcely a mile away , the twin red flares the Araiza brothers had promised would guide him to the launch . Caramba , que fidelidad ! He 'd never accuse another Latin American of frivolity or faithlessness . Suddenly the reflection of the Wanderer in the black lake shattered toward him . He saw the sinister water formations , like low wide steps , approaching him . Barely in time , he headed the plane around into them . The old Seabee mounted the first successfully , though with a great heave and splash . Earthquake or landslide waves ! Doc PUFFED OUT rapidly : " I do n't care how near we are to the gate , I got to rest . " He lowered his corner of the cot to the sand and knelt there , arm on knee and with bald head bent , panting . " Your evil life catching up with you , " Hunter jeered lightly , then  | muttered to Margo : " We better go easy on the old goat . He normally gets about as much exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again , " eagerly volunteered the one who had had Doc 's corner earlier  --  a thin-faced high school student who had ridden to the symposium from Oxnard with Wojtowicz . " Better we all have a breather , Harry , " the latter said . " Professor ? " He addressed himself to Hunter . " It looks to me the moon 's slowed down again . Like back to normal . " All of them except the fat woman studied the situation in the western sky . Even Doc raised his head while continuing to gasp . Unquestionably the black isthmus between the Wanderer and the moon had n't widened during the last short march . " I think the moon 's getting smaller , " Ann said . " So do I , " the Little Man agreed . He squatted on his hams with an arm around Ragnarok and soothingly kneaded the huge dog 's blackand-brown throat while he squinted upward . " And  --  I know this is utterly fantastic  --  but it looks to me as if the moon were becoming oblate , flattening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to side . Maybe it 's just eyestrain , but I 'll swear the moon 's becoming egg-shaped , with one end of the egg pointing at the new planet . " " Yes , " Ann told him shrilly . " And now I can see .. , oh , just the teensiest line going from the top of the moon to the bottom . " " Line ? " the Little Man asked . " Yes , like a crack , " Ann told him . The Broken Egg and the Dire Hatching , the Ramrod thought . It comes to pass as I foretold . Ispan-Serpent fecundates and the White Virgin gives birth . " I must confess I do n't see that , " the Little Man said . " You 've got to look very close , " Ann told him . " I 'll take your word for it , " Wojtowicz said . " Kids got sharp eyes . " Doc gasped excitedly , " If there 's a crack up there that any of us can see , it must be miles across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words , " I think the moon is going into orbit around the new planet . . . and way inside Roche 's limit . " He added swiftly , " Rudy , do solid satellites break up like liquid ones inside Roche 's limit ? " " I do n't think anybody really knows , " Doc answered . " They 're going to find out , " the bearded man said . Rama Joan said : " And we 're going to find out what ants feel like when someone steps on their nest . " Wojtowicz said : " The moon ... breaking up ? "  | Margo clutched Paul . " Don ! " she cried . " Oh my God , Paul , I 'd forgotten Don ! " THE WANDERER first appeared twenty-five thousand miles away from the moon , ten times closer to Luna than Earth is . Its deforming or tide-producing effects on the moon were therefore one thousand times greater than those the Earth exerts on Luna , since such effects vary inversely with the cube of the distance between bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the massive sun would exert a tidal effect on Earth many times greater than the moon , instead of being outweighed tidewise by that small body eleven to five . ) When Luna went into orbit around the Wanderer at a distance of twenty-five hundred miles , she was a hundred times closer to that planet than she is to Earth . Accordingly , her whole body , crust and core , was being wrenched by a gravitational grip one million times stronger . THE BABA YAGA 'S SPACESCREEN was swinging up toward Earth when the gentle bumping of his spacesuit against the walls of the cabin finally awoke Don Merriam , just as he himself was rolling across the inside of the spacescreen . He woke clearheaded and ready for action , refreshed by the extra oxy . Two yanks and a wriggle got him into the pilot 's seat . He strapped down . White moon , jagged with crater walls and with something else , came into view , visibly swelling in size as the screen swung . Then came a vertical precipice of glittering raw rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's core . Then a narrow ribbon of black gulf , bisected along its jet length by a gleaming thread that was mostly violet but bright yellow toward one end . Then another glittering and interminable chasm wall shooting down sheer toward Luna 's very center . His eyes told Don he was no more than fifteen miles above the moon 's surface and hurtling toward it at about a mile a second . There was nowhere near enough time to break fall by swinging ship and main jetting to cancel the mile-a-second downward velocity . As those thoughts flashed , Don 's fingers flicked the keys of the vernier jets , halting the Baba Yaga 's slow tumbling so that the spacescreen  --  and Don  --  looked straight down the chasm . There was one hope , based on nothing more than a matching of colors . There had been something violet and yellow glaring with  | tremendous brilliance behind the moon . Now there was a violetand-yellow thread gleaming in the blackness of the moon 's core . He might be looking through the moon . The moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fracture . But any other theory meant death . The walls of fresh-riven rock rushed up at him . He was too close to the righthand one . A baby solid-fuel rocket fired on that side set the Baba Yaga drifting away from it  --  and started a secondary tumbling which another ripple of the verniers neutralized almost before it manifested itself . When he was a boy , Don Merriam had read The Gods of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs . In that romance of science fantasy , John Carter , greatest swordsman of two planets , had escaped with his comrades from the vast , volcanic , subterranean cavern-world of the Black Pirates of Barsoom and their hideous Issus-cult by racing a Martian flyer straight up the miles-long narrow shaft leading to the outer world , instead of rising slowly and cautiously by the buoyancy of the flyer 's ray tanks . The latter had been the normal and only sane course , but John Carter had found salvation for himself and his companions in sheer blinding speed , steering vertically for a star visible at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the arbiters of all Don Merriam 's actions at this point . At any rate , he suddenly felt around him in the cabin of the Baba Yaga the ghostly presences , in their jeweled harness , of Xodar the Black renegade , Carthoris the mysterious Red Martian , Matai Shang the sinister Father of Holy Therns , and his brave , beautiful , love-struck , infinitely treacherous daughter Phaidor . And it is a fact that as the plummeting Baba Yaga was engulfed between blurs of raw rock touched by sunlight for the first time in billions of years , and as Don fired the G-rich main jet and was pinned by it up against his seat , where he steered by the verniers and the solid-fuel rockets to keep the glitter of the rock walls equal and the violet-and-yellow thread splitting the black ribbon into equal halves , he cried out sharply in the empty cabin : " Hold on for your lives ! I am flying straight down the chasm ! " THE SAUCER STUDENTS felt sand give way to a stretch of adobe-hard earth sloping sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plateau of Vandenberg Two . But here  --  seaward of the point where the blinking red light sat atop its mast a hundred feet behind the fence  --  and two hundred feet , at least , above it  --  a broad gully  | cut through the ridge , gentling the slope . Tire and caterpillar tracks ran up the gully . There was a big gate in the fence where it crossed the road , and beside the gate , built like it into the fence , a two-story guard tower . The gate was closed and the tower was lightless , but the small door in the outside of the tower was open . The sight cheered Paul considerably . He straightened his shoulders and his necktie . The little cortege halted fifty feet in front of the gate and he , Margo , and Doc walked forward , preceded by their inky , purple-and-yellow-edged shadows . A brazen mechanical voice came out of the box over the door , saying , " Stop where you are . You are about to trespass on restricted property of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Return the way you came . Thank you . " " Oh , my sainted aunt ! " Doc exploded . Since being relieved of cot-lugging by young Harry McHeath , he 'd got his bounce back . " Do you think we 're an advance deputation of little green men ? " he shouted at the box . " Ca n't you see we 're human beings ? " Paul touched Doc 's arm and shook his head , but continued to advance . He called out in a mellow voice : " I am Paul Hagbolt , 929-CW , JR , accredited PR captain-equivalent of Project Moon . I am asking admission for myself and eleven distressed persons known to me , and requesting transport for the latter . " A soldier stepped from the darkness of the doorway out into the light of the Wanderer . There was no mistaking he was a soldier , for he had boots on his feet and a helmet on his head ; a pistol , knife , and two grenades hung from his belt ; his right arm cradled a submachine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted incredulously  --  were jump rockets . The soldier was pokerfaced and he stood stiffly , but his right knee was jouncing up and down a little , rapidly and steadily , as if he were about to go into a stamping native dance or , more reasonably , as if he were trying to control a tic and not succeeding . " CW and JR , eh ? " he said to Paul , suspiciously but also respectfully . " Let 's see your ID cards . . . sir . " There was a faint , acid odor . Miaow , who had been remarkably calm since the landslide , lifted a little in Margo 's arms , looked straight at the soldier , and hissed like a teakettle . Handing the soldier the cards , which he had ready , Paul caught a sharp tremor . As the soldier studied the cards , tipping them forward to catch  | the Wanderer 's light , his face stayed expressionless , but Doc noticed that his eyes kept jumping away from the cards to the Wanderer . Doc asked conversationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked Doc straight in the eye and barked : " Yes , we know all about that and we 're not intimidated ! But we 're not releasing any information , see ? " " Yes , I do , " Doc told him softly . The soldier looked up from the cards . " Very well , Mr. Hagbolt , sir , I 'll phone your request to the main gate . " He backed off toward the doorway . " You 're sure you 've got it right ? " Paul asked , repeating and amplifying it and mentioning the names of several officers . " And Professor Morton Opperly , " Margo put in with strong emphasis . Paul finished : " And one of our people has had a heart attack . We 'll want to bring her in the tower , where it 's warmer . And we 'd like some water . " " No , you all stay outside , " the soldier said sharply , raising the muzzle of the submachine gun an inch as he continued to back away . " Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " From the darkness inside the tower he handed Paul first a loose blanket , next a half-gallon bottle of water . " But no paper cups ! " He added , choking off what might have become a high-pitched laugh . " Do n't ask me for paper cups ! " He drew back into the darkness , and there was the sound of dialing . Paul returned with his booty , handing the blanket to the thin woman . The water was passed around . They drank from the bottle . " I expect we 'll have to wait a bit , " Paul whispered . " I 'm sure he 's O.K. , but he 's pretty nervous . He looked all set to stand off the new planet singlehanded . " Margo said : " Miaow could smell how scared he was . " " Well , " Doc philosophized softly , " if I 'd been all alone when I first saw the thing , but with the hardware handy , I think I 'd have switched the lights off and draped myself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new planet under just about the best circumstances , I 'd say  --  peering around for saucers and talking about hyperspace and all . " Ann said : " I think if you were scared , Mr. Brecht , you 'd switch on all the lights you could . " Doc said , " My wicked idea , young lady , was that I 'd be so terrified  | I would n't want something big , black , and hairy able to see where I was , to grab me . " Ann laughed appreciatively . The Little Man said to them all in a small , almost unfeeling , faraway voice : " The moon is swinging behind the new planet . She 's . . . going away . " Eyes confirmed what the words had said . A chunk of the moon 's rim was hidden by the purple-and-gold intruder . Wojtowicz said : " My God . . . my God . " The thin woman began to sob shudderingly . Rama Joan said : " Give us courage . " Margo 's lips formed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugged Miaow to her . Paul put his arm around her shoulders , but she moved away a little , head bowed . Hunter said : " The moon 's in a very constricted orbit . There ca n't be more than three thousand miles between their surfaces . " The Ramrod thought : Her birth-pangs upon her , the White Virgin shelters in Ispan 's robes . The Little Man made a cup of his hands and Rama Joan poured a drink for Ragnarok . COLONEL MABEL WALLINGFORD said stridently : " Spike , I 've been talking with General Vandamme himself and he says that this is n't a problem . They 've been letting us handle a lot of it because we were faster on the jump . Your orders have gone out approved-and-relayed . " Spike Stevens , his eyes fixed on the twin screens showing the moon moving behind the Wanderer , bit off the end of a cigar and snarled : " O. K. , tell him to prove it . " " Jimmy , warm up the inter-HQ screen , " Colonel Mabel ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowed on , showing a smiling , distinguished-looking gentleman with a bald head . The General whipped his cigar out of his mouth and stood up . Colonel Mabel felt a surge of hot joy , watching him play the guilty , dutiful schoolboy . " Mr. President , " Spike said . " I 'm not part of a simulated crisis , Spike , " the other responded , " though it 's hard to believe that 's been bothering you , considering the masterly way your gang 's been operating . " " Not masterly at all , sir , " the General said . " I 'm afraid we 've lost Moonbase . Not a word for over an hour . "  | The face on the screen grew grave . " We must be prepared for losses . I am now leaving Space HQ to meet the Coast Guard . My word to you is : Carry on ! . . . for the duration of this . . . " You could sense him reaching for one of his famous polished phrases . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Griswold , his eyes on the astronomic screens , said : " Moonbase ? Hell , Spike , we 've lost the moon . " DON MERRIAM had been fifteen minutes in the body of the moon , doing much of it at two miles a second , and now the violet-andyellow thread , after widening to a ribbon , was staying the same width , which could n't be good , but there was nothing to do but bullet toward it through the incredible flaw that split the moon along an almost perfect plane like a diamond tapped just right , and nothing to be but one great piloting eye , and suffer what thoughts to come that would , since he could n't spare mind to control them . After the first big shove , he fired the main jet in brief bursts , aiming the Baba Yaga with the verniers . Don Merriam was making a trip through a planet 's core . He had passed through its very center , and so far the trip had been glitter and blur and blackness and a violet thread halving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aching throat and smarting eyes and the picture of himself as a glass bee with a Prince Rupert 's Drop tail buzzing through a ripple in a stack of metal sheets miles long , or an enchanted prince sprinting down a poisoned corridor wide as his elbows  --  to brush a wall , what a faux pas ! Toward midpassage there had been soot-black streaks and a flash of green fire , but no guessing what made them . The milkiness in the spacescreen , at any rate , should be erosion from the fantastic thin-armed dust swirls that at one point had almost lost him the thread . He had lost the aftward sunlight , too , sooner than he 'd hoped , and had to aim the Baba Yaga solely by the fainter purple and golden  | wall-glimmers , and that was deceptive because the yellow was intrinsically brighter than the purple and tempted him to stay too far away from it . But now the violet ribbon began to narrow and he knew it was the doom of him , worse than collision course , for there came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moon crashing together behind him , cutting off all sunlight , and then  --  in ponderous reaction and by the fierce mutual attraction of their masses moving  --  to crash together ahead of him , swinging through yards while he rocketed through miles , but swiftly enough to beat him to the impact point . Then , just as he seemed almost to reach it , just as by his rough gauging he 'd moon-traversed close to two thousand miles , the violet ribbon blacked out altogether . And then , as incredible as if he 'd found a life after death , he burst out of the blackness into light , with stars showing off to all sides and even old shock-headed Sol shooting his blinding white arrows . Only then did he take in what lay straight ahead of him . It was a great round , as big as Earth seen from a two-hour orbit . This vast , mounded disk was all radiantly violet and golden to the right , where Sol lay beyond , but to the left inky black save for three pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The unblurred night line between the radiant and the inky hemispheres was slowly drifting to the right as he watched , just as Sol was slowly drifting toward the violet horizon . He realized that back there in the moon he had lost sight of the violet ribbon , not because the jaws of the moon had clamped together , but simply because the night side of the planet ahead had moved over and looked down the chasm at him . He at once accepted the fact that it was a massive planet and that the moon had gone into a tight orbit around it , because that alone , as far as he could reason , could explain the sights and happenings of the past three hours : the light deluging Earth 's night side , the highlight in the Atlantic , and above all the shattering of Luna . And , beyond reason , there was that inside him  --  since he was out here and facing it  --  that cried out to believe it was a planet . He swung ship , and there , only fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half inky black , half glaring white with sunlight . He could see where the chasm walls had truly crashed shut behind him by the line of dust-geysers rising gleaming into sunlit vacuum almost along the moon 's night line , and by the surrealist , jagged-  | squared chessboard of lesser cracks marked by lesser geysers radiating outward from the crash line . Monstrous cross-hatching ! He was poised fifty miles  --  and receding  --  over what every moment looked more like a rock sea churning . Then , because he did n't want to plunge  --  not yet , at least  --  at a mile a second into the glow-spotted black hemisphere now beneath his jets , he fired the main jet to kill that part of his velocity  --  at last checking the tank gages and discovering that there was barely enough fuel and oxidizer for this maneuver . It should put him into an orbit around the strange planet  --  inside even the tight orbit of the moon . He knew that the sun would soon sink from view and the metamorphosing moon be blackly eclipsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow-cone  --  into the night  --  of a mystery . FRITZ SCHER sat stiffly at his desk in the long room at the Tidal Institute at Hamburg , West Germany . He was listening with amusement tending toward exasperation to the demented morning news flash from across the Atlantic . He switched it off with a twist that almost fractured the knob and said to Hans Opfel : " Those Americans ! Their presence is needful to hold the Communist swines in check , but what an intellectual degradation to the Fatherland ! " He stood up from his desk and walked over to the sleekly streamlined , room-long tide-predicting machine . Inside the machine a wire ran through many movable precision pulleys , each pulley representing a factor influencing the tide at the point on Earth 's hydrosphere for which the machine was set ; at the end of the wire a pen drew on a graph-papered drum a curve giving the exact tides at that point , hour by hour . At Delft they had a machine that did it all electronically , but those were the feckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in orbit around a planet from nowhere ? Hah ! " He tapped the shell of the machine beside him significanity . " Here we have the moon nailed down ! " THE " MACHAN LUMPUR , " her rusty prow aimed a little south of the sun sinking over North Vietnam , crossed the bar guarding the tiny inlet south of Do-Son . Bagong Bung noted , by a familiar configuration of mangrove roots and by an old gray piling that was practically a member of his family , that the high tide was perhaps a hand 's  | breadth higher than he 'd ever encountered it here . A good omen ! Tiny ripples shivered across the inlet mysteriously . A sea hawk screamed . RICHARD HILLARY watched the sunbeams slowly straighten up as the big air-suspended bus whipped smoothly on toward London . Bath was far behind and they were passing Silbury Hill . He listened idly to the solemn speculations around him about the nonsensical news items that had been coming over the wireless concerning a flying saucer big as a planet sighted by thousands over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . A coarsely attractive girl from Devizes in slacks , snood , and a sweater , who had transferred aboard at Beckhampton , now dropped into the seat ahead of him and instantly fell into small talk with the woman beside her . She was expatiating , with exactly equal enthusiasm , on the saucer reports  --  and the little earthquake that had nervously twitched parts of Scotland  --  and on the egg she 'd had for breakfast and the sausage-and-mashed she was going to have for lunch . In honor of Edward Lear , Richard offhandedly shaped a limerick about her : There was a Young Girl of Devizes Whose thoughts came in two standard sizes : While most fitted a spoon , Some were big as the moon ; That spacestruck Young Girl of Devizes . Thinking of it kept him amused all the way to Savernake Forest , where he fell into a doze . TIMES SQUARE at five A.M. was still as packed as it had been on the nights of the moon landing and of the False War With Russia . Traffic had long stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | now masking half the moon , was still visible down the crosstown streets , including 42nd , but low in the sky , its yellow mellower and its purple turning red . The advertisements were a bit brighter by contrast , especially the new sixty-foot genie bafflingly juggling the three oranges big as bushel baskets . But the streets were no longer still . While some people just stood there and stared west , the majority were rhythmically swaying : not a few had joined hands and were snaking about with a compulsive stamp , while here and there young couples danced savagely . And most of them were humming or singing or shouting a song that had several versions , but the newest of these was being sung at the source , where Sally Harris still danced , though now she had acquired a supporting team of half a dozen sharp , aggressive young men besides Jake Lesher . And the song as she sang it now , her contralto more vibrant for its hoarseness , went : Strange orb ! . . . in the western sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from on high . It 's a terrifying sight But we 're gon na live tonight , Live with a neo-bop beat ! Golden ! .. . like treasure ships . Crimson ! . . . as sinful lips .. . But there 'll be no more June ' Cause there ai n't no more moon Just a Planet ! . . on Forty-second Street ! All of a sudden the singing and dancing stopped everywhere at once  --  because the dance floor had begun to tremble . There was a brief shaking . A few tiles , not many , and other trifles of masonry fell , cracking sharply against the sidewalks . There were screams  --  not many of those , either . But when the little earthquake was over , it could be seen that the sixty-foot genie had lost his three oranges , though he still kept going through the motions of juggling . ARAB JONES and his weed-brothers walked rapidly , three abreast , along 125th Street away from Lenox , in the direction all the other dark faces were peering : west , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  bloated purple X on orange field  --  that almost covered the pale gold-piece of the moon . Soon the heavenly pair would be hidden by the General Grant Houses , which emphasized with their tall , remote bulking the small-town look of Harlem , the two- and three-story shop-fronted buildings lining 125th . The three weed-brothers were so loaded that their excitement had only been heightened by the quake , which had brought out onto the street most of those who were n't already watching the Wanderer . The east was rosy , where the sun , pausing in the horizon wings for his entrance , had washed out all the stars and brought the morning twilight to Manhattan . But no one looked that way , or gave any sign that it might be time to be off and doing or trying to get some sleep . The spires of lower Manhattan were an unwatched fairy-tale city of castles to the south . Arab and Pepe and High had long since quit trying to push through the staring , mostly silent crowd on the sidewalks and had taken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clustered and where the going was easier . It seemed to Pepe that a power came out of the planet ahead , freezing all motors and most people like some combined **28;27;TOOLONG ray out of the comic books . He crossed himself . High Bundy whispered : " Old moon really going into her this time . He circle in front of her , decide he like her , then whoosh ! " Arab said , " Maybe he hiding ' cause he scared . Like we . " " Scared of what ? " asked High . " The end of the world , " said Pepe Martinez , his voice rising in a soft , high wolf-wail . Only the rim of the Wanderer showed above the General Grant buildings , which were mounting swiftly up the sky as the weedbrothers approached them . " Come on ! " Arab said suddenly , catching hold of the upper arms of Pepe and High and digging his fingers in . " World gon na end , I gettin ' off . Get away from all these owly-eyed deaders waitin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smash , we take another . Come on , before she get away ! ? We catch her at the river and climb aboard ! " The three began to run . PAUL AND MARGO and their new friends were sitting on the sand fifty feet in front of the dark gate when the second quake jolted the  | beach . It did nothing beyond rocking them , and there was nothing they could do about it , so they just gasped and rocked there . The soldier ran out of the tower with his submachine gun , stopped , and after a minute backed inside again . He did not answer when Doc called cheerily : " Hey , was n't that a sockdolager ! " Five minutes later Ann was saying : " Mommy , I 'm really getting hungry now . " " So am I , " said Young Harry McHeath . The Little Man , diligently soothing a very upset Ragnarok , said : " Now , that 's a funny thing . We were going to serve coffee and sandwiches after the eclipse . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I brought it . It 's all still down at the beach . " Wanda sat up on her cot , despite the thin woman 's protests . " What 's all that red glow down the coast ? " she demanded crossly . Hunter started to tell her , not without a touch of sarcasm , that it was merely the light of the new planet , when he saw that there really was another light-source  --  an ugly red furnace-flaring which the other light had masked . " Could be brush fires , " Wojtowicz suggested somberly . The thin woman said : " Oh dear , that would have to happen now . As if we did n't have enough trouble . " Hunter pressed his lips together . He refused to say : " Or it could be Los Angeles burning . " The Little Man recalled their attention to the heavens , where the purple-and-yellow intruder now hid the moon completely . He said , " We ought to have a name for the new planet . You know , it 's funny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , but the next minute it 's just a patch of sky I can cover with my outstretched hand . " " What 's the word planet ' really mean , Mr. Brecht ? " Ann asked . " Wanderer , ' dear , " Rama Joan told her . The Ramrod thought : Ispan is known to man by a thousand names , yet is still Ispan . Harry McHeath , who 'd just discovered Norse mythology and the Eddas , thought : Moon-Eater would be a good name  --  but too menacing for most people today . Margo thought : They could call it Don , and she bit her lip and hugged Miaow so that the cat protested , and tears lumped hotly under her lower eyelids . " Wanderer is the right name for it , " the Little Man said . The yellow marking that was the Broken Egg to the Ramrod and  | the Needle-Eye to Ann now touched the lefthand rim of the Wanderer as they viewed it . The yellow polar patches remained and a new central yellow spot was crawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four yellow rim-spots : north , south , east and west . THREE HOURS The Little Man got out his notebook and began to sketch it . " The purple makes a big X , " Wojtowicz said . " The tilted cross , " the Ramrod said , speaking aloud at last . " The notched disk . The circle split in four . " " It 's a mandala , " said Rama Joan . " Oh yeah , " Wojtowicz said . " Professor , you was telling us about those , " he addressed himself to Hunter . " Symbols of psychic something-or-other . " " Psychic unity , " the bearded man said . " Psychic unity , " Wojtowicz repeated . " That 's good , " he said matter-of-factly . " We 're going to need it . " " For these we are grateful , " Rama Joan murmured . Two big yellow eyes peered over the hump of the big gully in Vandenberg Two . There was a growling roar . Then the jeep was careening down toward the gate , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everybody on your feet , " Paul said . " Now we 'll get some action . " DON MERRIAM could see a thick-waisted , asymmetric hourglass of stars in the spacescreen of the Baba Yaga . Some of the stars were slightly blurred by the dust-blasting the screen had suffered during his trip through the center of the moon .  | The black bulk shouldering into the hourglass from port was the moon , now totally eclipsed by the vast , newly appeared body . The Wanderer , shouldering into the starry hourglass from starboard , was not entirely black  --  Don had in view seven pale green glow spots , each looking about 300 miles across , the farther ones being ellipses , the nearest , almost circular . They were featureless , though at times there was the suggestion of a phosphorescent pit or funnel . Of what they signified , Don had no more idea than if they had been pale green spots on the black underbelly of a spider . In company with the moon , the Baba Yaga was orbiting the Wanderer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wanderer , had the faster orbit . He warmed the radar . The return signal from the moon showed a surface more irregular than craters and mountains alone could account for , and even in five minutes the patterns had greatly changed : the tidal shattering of Luna was continuing . The surprisingly strong signal from the intruding planet showed a spherical , matte surface with no indication at all of the greenish glow spots  --  as if the Wanderer were smooth as an ivory ball . Intruding planet ! ? impossible , but there it was . At the top of his mind Don tried to recall the scraps of speculation he 'd read and heard about hyperspace : the notion that a body might be able to travel from there to here without traversing the known continuum between , perhaps by blasting or slipping into some higher-dimensioned continuum of which our universe is only a surface . But where in all the immensity of stars and galaxies might the there of this intruding planet be ? Why should the there even be anywhere in our universe ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one a cosmos . At the bottom of Don 's mind there was only an uneasy voice repeating : " The earth and sun are on the other side of that greenspotted black round to starboard . They set ten minutes ago ; they 'll rise in twenty . I have not traveled through hyperspace , only through the moon . I am not in the intergalactic dark , staring at a galaxy shaped like a sheaf or an hourglass , while seven pale green nebulas glow to starboard .... " Don was still in his spacesuit , but now he removed and secured the cracked helmet . There should be a sound one in the locker . " Make and mend , " he muttered , but his throat closed at the sound of his own voice . He unstrapped himself from the pilot 's seat to push as close as he could to the spacescreen . The cabin was chilly and  | dark , but he turned on neither heat nor light he even dimmed the control panel . It seemed all-important to see as much as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his inside orbit : the sheaf of stars ahead was very slowly widening to port , as the black bulk of the eclipsed moon dropped back . Suddenly he thought he saw , against the star-studded glow of the Milky Way , wraithlike black threads joining the top of the Wanderer ? call it its north pole  --  to the leading rim or nose of the moon . Looping through space , the black strands were so nearly imperceptible that , like faint stars , he could detect them best by looking a little away from them . It was as if , having snared and maimed the moon , the Wanderer were spinning a black shroud around it , preparatory to sucking it dry . He should n't have started to think about spiders . The voice kept repeating : " The sun and Earth are beyond the green-spotted black bulge to starboard . I am Donald Barnard Merriam , Lieutenant , U.S. Space Force . . . . " BARBARA KATZ , her back to the other ocean bordering America 3,000 miles east of the saucer students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The huge wheel seemed to revolve a quarter turn as the planet touched the horizon . " Gee , Dad , it 's as if the Wanderer were lying down , " she said , all at once feeling agonized and desperate because she would n't be able to see the next face the Wanderer showed , or to see the moon come out from behind it , either . But it would all be on TV . Or would it ? Will there still be TV. ? she asked herself , looking around incredulously . Everywhere the sky was paling with the dawn that would not reach the Pacific Coast for another three hours . From beside Barbara , Knolls Kettering III said in a groggy voice she had n't heard before : " I 'm very tired . . . . Please . . . She grabbed his arm as he swayed and leaned most of his weight on her  --  which was n't a great deal . Inside the white suit his body seemed like the curved , brownish husk of an insect , while his face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Barbara was almost shocked , but then she reminded herself that he was her own private millionaire , to preserve and to cherish . She made her grip more delicate on his shoulder , as if it were a shell she might crush . The older Negro woman , dressed like the younger , in pearl gray  | with white collar and cuffs , came fussing up and took hold of him on the other side . This seemed to irritate him awake . " Hester , " he said , leaning away from her toward Barbara . " I told you and Benjy and Helen to go to bed hours ago . " " Huh ! " she laughed softly . " As if we would leave you playing around with that telescope in the dark ! You watch how you put your weight now , Mister K. Plastic in your hip get tired working all night , it break easy . " " Plastic ca n't get tired , Hester , " he argued wearily . " Huh ! it not anywhere as strong as you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked across him questioningly at Barbara , who nodded firmly . Together they walked him across the thick , weedless carpet of the lawn , up three spotless concrete steps , and through a big cool kitchen with old , nickel-heavy fixtures that seemed to Barbara huge enough for a hotel . Halfway up a wide stairway , he made them stop . Perhaps the vast , cool , dark living room next to the stairs took him back into the night , for he said : " Miss Katz , every heavenly body that seems to stand erect when it 's high in the sky , appears to lie down when it rises and sets . It 's true of constellations , too . I 've often thought ? " " Come on now , Mister K , you need your rest , " Hester said , but he fretfully shook the arm she was holding and said insistently : " I have often thought that the answer to the Sphinx 's question of what goes on four legs in the morning , two legs at midday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constellation Orion walking just ahead of the Dog Star , whose rising signaled the flooding of the Nile . " His voice wavered on the last words , and his head drooped , and he permitted himself to be led upward again . Barbara , feeling his weight on her arm  --  more than he was putting on Hester , she was pleased to note  --  thought : I guess I can see why you 're thinking of three legs at evening , Dad  --  or four . They laid him down on a big bed in a dark bedroom bigger than the kitchen . Hester whisked something from the pillow into a drawer , then changed her mind and let Barbara see it . It was a slim , black-haired fashion doll about ten inches high , dressed in black lace underwear and black stockings and long black gloves . Knolls Kettering III muttered thickly : " For midday , read midnight . "  | Hester looked up from the doll to Barbara 's long black foot-gloves and playsuit and black hair , and she grinned . Barbara could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd wanted to . PAUL HAGBOLT faced Major Buford Humphreys through the beach gate of Vandenberg Two . Margo stood beside him holding Miaow . The ten saucer students were crowded around them . The edges of all their shadows made purple and golden flecks on the silvery mesh of the gate . There were gold and purple flecks in the Pacific behind them as well , where the Wanderer , still rather high in the sky , had begun a coasting descent toward the placid ocean . It still showed the face Rama Joan had called the mandala , though now the western yellow spot was growing and the eastern one shrinking as the orb rotated . It cast a strong twilight across the scrubby coastal landscape and turned the sky a slate gray through which only five or six stars showed . The jeep that had brought Major Humphreys down the gully from the heights still growled behind him and stared with its unnecessary headlights . One of the two soldiers with him sat at the wheel , the other stood at his side . The heavily-armed soldier on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark doorway of the guard tower . His eyes were on the major . His submachine gun was in shadow except for a purple ring showing on the muzzle . Major Humphreys had the thoughtful eyes and downturned mouth of a schoolteacher , but right now his dominant expression was the same as that of the soldier on guard  --  tension masking dread . Paul , his soft , handsome face firmed a bit by the responsibility he felt , said : " I was hoping it would be you , Major . This saves a lot of trouble . " " You 're lucky , because I did n't come on your account , " Major Humphreys retorted sharply , then added in a rush : " A few others of  | the L.A. section made it before the Coast Highway went . We 're hoping the rest will arrive by the Valley  --  over Monica Mountainway or through Oxnard . Or we 'll lift them out by ' copter ? especially Cal Tech . Pasadena really got it in the second quake . " He checked himself with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulsively said that much . Then he continued loudly , speaking over the flurry of exclamations from the saucerites . " Well , Paul , I have n't got all night  --  in fact , I have n't got a minute . Why 'd you come by the beach gate ? I recognize Miss Gelhorn , of course ? " He nodded curtly toward Margo ? " But who are the others ? " His gaze flickered across the saucer students , pausing doubtfully at Ross Hunter 's full brown beard . Paul hesitated . Doc , looking like a long-faced , modem day Socrates with his hairless dome and thick glasses , cleared his throat and prepared to risk all by rumbling : " We are clerical members of Mr. Hagbolt 's section . " He suspected that this was one of those moments when a large white bluff is essential . But Doc had hesitated a fractional second too long . The Little Man , pushing to the front between him and Wojtowicz , fixed the major with a benign stare . A confident smile nestled under his brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am secretary and we are all members in good standing of the Southern California Meteor and UFO Students . We were holding an eclipse symposium at the Rodgers beach house , having signed permission from the Rodgers estate and  --  although it was not strictly needed  --  approval from your own headquarters . " Doc groaned , fringe-audibly . Major Humphreys froze . " Flying saucer bugs ? " " That 's right , " the Little Man retorted sweetly . " But please  --  not bugs  --  students . " His left arm was jerked back and he rocked onto his heels as Ragnarok , in a flurry of uneasy effacement , tugged at the leash . " Students , " Major Humphreys echoed doubtfully , looking them up and down , almost , Paul thought , as if he were going to demand to see their college registration cards . Paul said earnestly : " Their cars were buried in a landslide along with mine , Major . Miss Gelhorn and I would hardly have got here without their help . There 's nowhere for them to go now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is a child . " Major Humphreys ' gaze hesitated at Rama Joan , who was stand-  | ing behind Hunter . She stepped forward around him and showed all of herself  --  her shoulder-length , red-gold hair and her white-tie evening clothes  --  then smiled gravely and made a little bow . Ann , with her matching red-gold braids , came forward beside her . They looked as strangely beautiful and as insultingly perverse as an Aubrey Beardsley illustration for The Yellow Book . " I 'm the child , " Ann explained coolly . " I see , " Major Humphreys said , nodding rapidly as he turned away . " Look , Paul , " he said hurriedly . " I 'm sorry about this , but Vandenberg Two ca n't possibly take in quake refugees . That question 's already been explored and decided . We have our own vital work , and an emergency only tightens security regulations . " " Hey , " Wojtowicz broke in . " You 're saying the quakes were really big in L.A. County ? " " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humphreys snapped at him . " No , I ca n't answer questions . Come in through the tower , Paul . And Miss Gelhorn  --  by herself . " " But these people are n't ordinary refugees , Major , " Paul protested . " They 'll be helpful . They 've already made some interesting deductions about the Wanderer . " As soon as he spoke that last word , the gold-and-purple orb , momentarily out of mind , was once again dominating their thoughts . Major Humphreys ' fingers gripped through the mesh as he drew his face close to Paul 's . In a voice in which suspicion , curiosity , and fear were oddly mixed , he demanded : " Wanderer ? Where did you get that name ? What do you know about the . . . body ? " " Body ? " Doc cut in exasperatedly . " Any fool can see by now it 's a planet . Currently the moon 's orbiting behind it . " " We 're not responsible for it , if that 's what you 're thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't conjure it up there . " " Yes , and we do n't know where the body was buried beforehand , either , " Doc added zestfully . " Though some of us have notions about a cemetery in hyperspace . " Hunter kicked him surreptitiously . " Wanderer ' is simply a name we gave it because it means planet ' , " he interposed soothingly to the major . " Wanderer will do well enough , though the true name be Ispan . " The Ramrod 's voice boomed out hollowly from where his angular face , eye sockets and cheeks deep-shadowed , rose over Beardy 's shoulder . He added : " Belike the imperial sages have but now touched down in Washington . "  | Major Humphreys ' shoulders contracted as if he 'd been stung between them . He said curtly : " I see . " Then , to Paul : " Come on through . And Miss Gelhorn  --  without that cat . " " You mean you 're turning these people away ? " Paul demanded . " After I vouch for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Professor Opperly will have something to say about your behavior , Major , I 'm sure , " Margo put in sharply . " Where is this heart case ? " Major Humphreys demanded , his knee starting to jump as the guard 's had . Paul looked around for the cot , but just then Wanda pushed her considerable bulk forward between Hunter and Rama Joan . " I 'm she , " she announced importantly . Doc groaned again . Wojtowicz looked at the fat woman reproachfully , rubbing the shoulder that had taken the strain on the cot corner . Major Humphreys snorted . " Come on  --  the two of you , alone , " he said to Paul , and turned back toward the jeep . Hunter muttered to Margo : " Better take him up on it before he changes his mind . It 's the best thing for you and Paul . " " Without Miaow ? " Margo said . " We 'll take care of her for you , " Ann volunteered . That last did something to Paul 's churning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last straws of a cat and a child 's unthinking generosity weigh down the balance . But : " I 'm not coming ! " he heard himself shout . In a voice that tried not to be waspish , Major Humphreys called back : " Do n't be melodramatic , Paul . You have n't the choice . You ca n't desert the Project . " Margo 's free arm went around Paul and tightened encouragingly . Doc muttered in his ear : " I hope you know what you 're doing . " Paul shouted : " The hell I ca n't ! " Major Humphreys shrugged and got into the jeep . The guard shut the tower door behind him and moved out toward the twelve standing in front of the gate . " Get moving , you people , " he said edgily , wagging the muzzle of his gun . A heavy wire looped behind him from his left hand  --  the controls of his jump rockets . Except for the Little Man , everyone stepped back from the gun ? even Ragnarok , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the fence in scandalized amazement . " Major ! " the Little Man called . " Your conduct is outrageous and inhumane , and I 'll see to it that my opinion goes on record ! I 'll have  | you know that I 'm a taxpayer , sir . My money supports installations like Vandenberg Two and pays the salaries of public servants like yourself whether they 're in uniform or not , and no matter how much brass there is on that uniform ! You will please reconsider ? " The guard moved toward him . It was clear he wanted this whole problem out of sight before he was alone again . He grated : " Shut up , you , and get moving ! " And he lightly prodded the Little Man in the side with the muzzle of his gun . With a growl like clockwork going out of control , Ragnarok shot from behind the group , leash flirting behind him , and launched himself at the guard 's throat . The guard 's jump rockets blossomed  --  as if he had grown a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted into the air , up and back . As he did so , he gave a remarkable demonstration of accurate shooting on the rise , sending four slugs crashing into his attacker . The big German police dog flattened and never moved again . The group started to run , then stopped . The guard sailed over the fence and dropped inside , his rockets blossoming briefly to cushion his landing . The Little Man dropped to his knees beside the body of his dog . " Ragnarok ? " He paused , uncertain . Then , " Why , he 's dead , " and his voice was full of bewilderment . Wojtowicz picked up the aluminum cot and ran forward with it . " It 's too late for anything , " the Little Man murmured . " You ca n't leave him here , " said Wojtowicz . They heaved the dead dog onto the cot . The Wanderer was more than bright enough to show the color of blood . Margo gave Miaow to Paul and took off her jacket and laid it over Ragnarok . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little cortege moved off the way it had come , through the twilight that was flecked with purple and gold . Young Harry McHeath pointed up over the sea . " Look , " he said . " There 's a white sliver . The moon 's coming out from behind the Wanderer . " DONALD MERRIAM shivered as he saw the faint black threads joining the nose of the moon to the top of the Wanderer turn bone white  --  making them suddenly easy to see and more suggestive than ever of a spiderweb . Then the nose of the moon turned almost glaringly bone white ,  | too : a tiny white crescent that swiftly lengthened and widened . The white threads came out of the white moon-nose and then looped up . A profoundly disturbing thing about the crescent : as it grew , it seemed to become too convex , as though the moon were tending toward the shape of a football . And this too-convex leading rim was n't smooth against black , starspecked space , but just a bit jagged . The boundary between black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , there were sharp cracks in the surface of the crescent , as if it were a moon in a Byzantine mosaic . Suddenly a white glare erupted dazzlingly from starboard into the nose of the Baba Yaga . Reflection from the port rim of the spacescreen almost blinded Don . He shut his eyes and groped on the rack for a pair of polarizing goggles , put them on and set them to max . Then , with a double puff of the vernier rockets , he swung the ship a shade to starboard . There , just risen from behind the Wanderer , was the blazing round of Sol next to the dark circle of Earth  --  a whitehot dime beside a sooty dollar . Like the moon and the threads , the Baba Yaga had completed its first passage behind the Wanderer and emerged into sunlight again . Don adjusted the goggle visors to block off the sun , then cut the polarization until he could see Earth 's night side by Wanderer-light . The eastern third of North America had slipped around the righthand rim into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the globe was Pacific Ocean , except where New Zealand had started to show on the lower lefthand rim  --  it would be nightfall there . Don was startled at how much it warmed his heart to see Earth again  --  not lost on the other side of the cosmos , but a mere quarter of a million miles away ! NEW ZEALANDERS and Polynesians ran out from their suppertables and supper-mats to stare at the prodigy rising with the evening . Many of them assumed the Wanderer must be the moon , monstrously disfigured  --  most likely by American or Soviet atomic experiments gone out of control  --  the purple and the gold the aura of a moon-wide atomic blast  --  and they were hours being argued out of this conviction . But most of the inhabitants of Australia , Asia , Europe , and Africa were still going about their daytime business blissfully unaware of the Wanderer , except as a wild , newspaperreported Yankee phenomenon , to be classified with senators , movie stars , religious fundamentalism , and Coca-Cola . The shrewder souls  | thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aha  --  pretext for new demands on China and Russia . No connection was seen  --  except by a few supersubtle psychologists  --  between the crazy news stories about the moon and the real enough reports of earthquake disasters . The Atlantic Ocean was also on Earth 's day side now , but there it was a different story , since most of the craft plying its shipping lanes and airways had observed the Wanderer during the last hours of the night . These furiously searched the static-disturbed wavebands for news and tried to get off reports and requests for advice to owners and maritime authorities . A few headed for the nearest ports . Others , with a remarkably knowledgeable prudence , turned toward the open sea . The " Prince Charles " suffered a drastic transition . A group of fascistic Brazilian insurgents , with the help of two officers of Portuguese extraction , seized control of the great luxury liner . Captain Sithwise became a prisoner in his own cabin . The plans of the insurgents had been brilliantly conceived , but would probably never have been successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With a feeling almost of awe they realized that , at the expense of six men shot and three of their number wounded , they had gained control not only of a ship big as a resort hotel , but of two atomic reactors . Wolf Loner breakfasted comfortably and went about his small morning chores as the " Endurance " wested steadily beneath the overcast . His thoughts occupied themselves with the great regularities of nature , masked by modern life . Don Guillermo Walker sped in the Araizas ' launch out of Lake Nicaragua into the San Juan River , past the town of San Carlos , as dawn reddened the jungle . Now that the Wanderer was out of the sky , Don Guillermo was less inclined to think about it and about the volcanoes and earthquakes , and more inclined to dwell on his successful bombing of el presidents : stronghold in the tiny plane that now rested in the bottom of the lake . Sic sem per all leftists ! At last he had really graduated from the namby-pamby John Birch Society ! . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of it . He struck his chest and cried : " Yo soy un hombre ! " One of the Araiza brothers , squinting against the rising sun , nodded and said : " Si , " but rather unenthusiastically , as if being a man were not quite that grand a matter .  | PAUL HAGBOLT had to admit to himself that walking through sand does get tiring , even when you 're with new friends and under a sky bright with a new planet . The exhilaration of defying Major Humphreys and the Moon Project had worn off very quickly , and this backbreaking trudge across the beach seemed peculiarly purposeless and depressing . " It gets lonely , does n't it ? " Rama Joan said softly , " when you cut yourself off from the big protector and throw in your lot  --  and your girl friend 's  --  with a bunch of nuts , just to attend a dog 's funeral . " They were walking at the tail end of the procession , well behind the cot borne between Clarence Dodd and Wojtowicz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " he said . " Margo 's not my girl friend , though  --  I mean the feeling 's all on my side . We 're really just friends . " Rama Joan looked at him shrewdly . " So ? A man can waste his life on friendship , Paul . " Paul nodded unhappily . " Margo 's told me that herself , " he said . " She claims I get my satisfaction out of mother-henning her around and trying to keep other men away from her . Except for Don , of course  --  and she thinks my interest in him is more than brotherly , even if I do n't know it . " Rama Joan shrugged . " Could be , I suppose . The set-up of you and Margo and Don does seem unnatural . " " No , it 's perfectly natural in its way , " he assured her with a kind of gloomy satisfaction . " The three of us went to high school and college together . We were interested in science and things . We meshed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaceman , while I took the turn into journalism and PR work , and Margo into art . But we were determined to stick together , so when Don got into the Moon Project , we managed to , too , or at least I did . By that time Margo had decided she liked him a little better than she did me  --  or loved him , whatever that means  --  and they got engaged . So that was settled  --  maybe simply because our society  | frowns on triangular living arrangements . Then Don went to the moon . We stayed on Earth . That 's all there is to it , until this evening , when I seem to have thrown in with you people . " " Maybe because you had an explosion overdue . Well , I can tell you why I 'm here , " the red-blonde woman continued . " I could be safe in Manhattan , an advertising executive 's wife : Ann going to a fancy school , myself fitting in an occasional lecture on mysticism to a women 's club . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherited income with lecture fees , and dressing up the mysticism with all sorts of carnival hokum . " She indicated her white tie and tails with a disparaging laugh . " Masculine protest ' , my friends said . No , just human protest ' , I told them . I wanted to be able to say things I really meant and say them to the hilt  --  things that were mine alone . I wanted Ann to have a real mother , not just a well-dressed statistic . " " But do you really mean the things you say ? " Paul asked . " Buddhism , I gather  --  that sort of thing ? " " I do n't believe them as much as I 'd like to , but I do believe them as much as I can , " she told him . " Certainty 's a luxury . If you say things with gusto and color , at least you 're an individual . And even if you fake it a bit , it 's still you , and if you keep trying you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like Charlie Fulby did , when he told us he knew about his wild planets not by flying-saucer trips , as he 'd always claimed , but by pure intuition . " " He 's paranoid , " Paul muttered , gazing ahead at the Ramrod where he marched behind the cot , with Wanda to his right and the thin woman to his left . " Are those two women his disciples , or patrons , or what ? " " I 'm sure he is somewhat paranoid , " Rama Joan said , " but you surely do n't believe , do you , Paul , that sane people have a monopoly of the truth ? No , I think they 're his wives  --  he grew up in a complex-marriage sect . Oh , Paul , you do find us alarming , do n't you ? " " Not really , " he protested . " Though there 's something reassuring about moving with the majority . " " And with the money and the power , " Rama Joan agreed . " Well , cheer up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the same way : satisfying basic needs . We 're all going back to the pavilion on the beach simply because we think there 'll be coffee and sandwiches . " At the head of the procession , Hunter was telling Margo Gelhorn very much the same sort of thing . " I started going to flying-saucer  | meetings as a sociological project , " he confessed to her . " I went to all kinds : the way-out contactees like Charlie Fulby , the soberminded ones , and the in-betweeners and freewheelers , like this group . I wanted to analyze a social syndrome and write a few papers on it . But after a while I had to admit I was keeping on going because I was hooked . " " Why , Professor Hunter ? " Margo asked , hugging Miaow to her . She was cold without her jacket , and the cat was like a hot water bottle . " Does saucering make you feel bohemian and different , like wearing a beard ? " " Call me Ross . No , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He touched his beard . " No , it was simply because I 'd found people who had something to follow and be excited about , something to be disinterestedly interested in  --  and that 's not so common any more in our **26;57;TOOLONG culture , our don't-giveyourself-away yet **26;85;TOOLONG society . It got so I wanted to make a contribution of my own  --  the lecturing and panel bits . Now I do almost as much saucering as Doc , who knocks himself out selling pianos  --  he 's a whiz at that  --  so he can divide the rest of his time between saucering , chess , and living it up . " " But Doc 's a bachelor , while I believe you implied you had a family . . . Ross ? " Margo pointed out with faint malice . " Oh yes , " Hunter conceded a bit wearily . " Up in Portland there 's a Mrs. Hunter and two boys who think Daddy spends altogether too much time consorting with saucer bugs , considering the very few papers he 's got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic reputation . " He was thinking of adding : " And , right now , they 're sitting up asking why Daddy was n't home the night the heavens changed and saucers came true " ? but just then he realized they 'd reached the boarded-up beach house and the old dance floor . There was the green lantern , he saw , still burning , and beside it a chair with a little stack of unused programs , and there were the empty chairs sitting in rows , though with the first rows much disarranged ( when would Doddsy ever reclaim the deposit they 'd made on them at the Polish funeral parlor in Oxnard ? ) ? and there was a coat someone had forgotten laid over one of the chairs , and there was the panelists ' long table and under it some cardboard boxes they 'd left in their hurry . And thrust deep into the sand nearby there was even the big furled umbrella Doc had used as part of a crude astrolabe when first checking the movement of the Wanderer .  | As Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrally calm Pacific , he felt a great , unexpected surge of affection and nostalgia and relief , and he suddenly realized why , after being rebuffed by a landslide and a steel mesh fence and a red-tape major , they had trudged back to this spot . It was simply that it was home to them , the spot where they 'd been together in security and where they 'd witnessed the change in the heavens , and that each of them knew in his heart that this might be the last home any of them would ever have . Without haste Wanda and the thin woman and young Harry McHeath made for the boxes under the table . Wojtowicz and the Little Man set down the cot with Ragnarok on it , half shrouded by Margo 's jacket . Wojtowicz looked around , then pointed at the umbrella and said in a firm voice : " I somehow think that would be the right spot  --  that is , if you would n't mind ? " he added to Doc , who 'd walked silently all the way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be proud , " Doc answered gruffly . They lugged the cot up , and Doc recovered his umbrella . Then Wojtowicz took a flat-bladed spade from under the edge of the mattress on the cot and began to dig . The fat woman noticed and called down from the platform : " No wonder I felt something sticking in my side all the way . " Wojtowicz paused to call out : " You should just be damn thankful you got that free ride when you thought you was having a heart attack . " Wanda called back angrily : " Look , when I have a heart attack , it 's bad  --  and there 's no thinking about it ! But when my heart attack 's over , it 's over . " " O.K. , " Wojtowicz told her over his shoulder . The spade made a faint , clean , rasping thud as he dug . The thin woman and Harry McHeath wiped sand from some cups and set them out . The rest of them watched the moon emerging from behind the Wanderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific . Luna looked visibly conical  --  mashed . And instead of the smooth smudges of " seas " on her face , there was the faintest tracery of shadow-lines , here and there palely flashing the Wanderer 's colors . The effect was horrid , somehow suggesting a sac of spider 's eggs . A forceps birth , the Ramrod thought . The White Virgin , fecun-  | dated by Ispan , bears herself in pain  --  and must birth herself again and again in torture . I had not thought of that . Margo thought , I 'm sorry I called her a bitch . Don .. . Rama Joan whispered to Paul : " Her young man was up there , was n't he ? Then she could be your girl now , Paul . " Wojtowicz straightened up . " That 's all the deep we can have it , " he told the Little Man huskily . " Any further we 'd get water . " They turned toward the cot . Clarence Dodd unsnapped the leash from the heavy collar and lifted the jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she shook her head , and he grimaced a smile at her and let the jacket fall again . He and Wojtowicz and Doc let down the shrouded dog into his shallow grave . Miaow lifted in Margo 's arms to watch curiously . Over the Pacific the Wanderer hung as strangely as if the blind spot had acquired imperial colors , and was as perfectly spherical as the emergent moon was maimed . The western yellow spot had rotated out of sight , so that the face the orb showed had become a Three-Spot ; but the most striking impression , with the two thick eastern arms of the purple cross widening above and below the great eastern yellow spot , was of the head of a purple beast with jaws agape . Fenris Wolf thought Harry McHeath . And now it looks like it 's really eating the moon , with the moon orbiting around in front between its jaws . " It looks like a big dog getting ready to snap , " Ann said thoughtfully . " Mommy , do you suppose the gods have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek heroes and nymphs up in the stars ? " " Yes , I think that 's happened , dear , " Rama Joan told her . The Little Man pulled out his notebook and pen automatically and then looked dully at the next empty page . Margo gave Miaow to Paul to hold while she took the things out of the Little Man 's hands and sketched the Wanderer for him , imitating his diagrammatic style .  | The Serpent gorges on the Egg , thought the Ramrod . Or is it that roads divide ? Wojtowicz swiftly spaded first dry , then wet sand back into the grave . Doc took the leash out of the Little Man 's fingers and wove it tightly around the head of his furled umbrella and fastened it that way . When Wojtowicz had patted the sand flat with his spade and stepped back , Doc thrust the umbrella deep into the center of the grave . " There , Doddsy , " he said , putting an arm around the Little Man 's shoulder . " He 's got a marker now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thin woman called : " Come and get it , everybody ! The coffee stayed real hot . " DONALD MERRIAM was in darkness again . The Baba Yaga had once more been eclipsed , this time by the moon as it passed in front of the Wanderer . The tiny moonship fell free between the two bodies . It was continuing to gain on the moon , but had not yet quite outnosed it . The cabin had swiftly warmed from the direct sunlight , but before it had become uncomfortably hot , the moon had swung between the Baba Yaga and the sun . The darkness of this eclipse was not nearly as great as that of the first , being pervaded by sun-reflected violet and yellow from the Wanderer . This Wanderer-light revealed the continuing rockchurning of the moon 's surface , looking like a stormy sea seen from an airplane by brillant moonlight . At his altitude above the Wanderer-1,600 miles now by radar check  --  Don could see only about a fifth of the planet 's disk . Passing  | across the face variously named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheel , St. Andrew 's Cross , and the Mandala , he saw only the western yellow spot and a rim around it widening ahead  --  the eastern and two polar yellow spots were out of sight for him around the curve of the Wanderer . By watching the yellow spot emerge from the Wanderer 's night side across the sunrise line , Don had got confirmation that the Wanderer was rotating and that its top and bottom were indeed its poles , its axis being roughly parallel to that of Earth . By timing the speed of the spot 's emergence Don had estimated the Wanderer 's period of rotation as six hours  --  a " day " only one quarter as long as Earth 's . And it was rotating in the same direction as he and the moon were moving in their two-hour orbits  --  the planet 's surface features following , but falling swiftly behind . The greenish glow-spots on the Wanderer 's night side did not seem to show up in any way on the day side  --  perhaps they were some sort of phosphorescence visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could recall , had there been any indication of the distinction between violet and yellow areas on the night side  --  apparently it took sunlight to bring that out . A good half of the great yellow spot was occupied by the moon 's shadow  --  inky , and undeniably elliptical and growing more so . Studying it , Don noted a very ghostly pale green round beginning to intrude into its forward edge  --  apparently the green spots did carry around , though being invisible in sunlight . The plain weirdness of his situation suddenly hit him  --  a midge between a black plum and a pink grapefruit , all three careening free . He fancied himself , a little boy , in the kitchen of the Minnesota farmhouse , with the darkness of early evening pressing on the window , and he , Donnie , saying : " Ma , I found a deep black hole in the woods , and I know it has to go all the way through to the other side of the earth because I saw a star twinkling at the bottom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't believe this , but as I came running home I saw a big yellow and purple planet behind the barn ! " He shook off the pseudomemory . However weird this situation might be , it was a little less so because he had lived a month on the moon and had now driven a spaceship through it . He turned his attention to the white threads looping up from the nose of the moon . He swung ship to follow with his eyes their curving course against the stars , diverging at first and then begin-  | ping to converge again as they vanished north over the violet horizon of the Wanderer . Well , if the white threads somehow tied the moon and the Wanderer together , it made sense that they should be tied to a pole of the latter . Attached to a spot on the equator of the Wanderer they 'd get stretched and broken , or wound around the Wanderer , since the moon was orbiting three times as fast as the planet was rotating . Tied together ! Wound around ! Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the Wanderer and the moon were two Christmas tree ornaments . Still , the white threads had to be something actual . He followed them back along their course to the nose of the moon . The Baba Yaga was ahead of the moon now , but still in its shadow because they were both starting to swing behind the Wanderer again  --  its black sunset line that he had first seen through the moon-chasm was already in sight once more , chopping off the violet horizon . So the nose of the moon was in shadow , its surface bronze-dim and churning . He took from the rack a pair of binoculars with big objective lenses and carefully focused them . In the churning nose of the moon were a dozen huge , conical pits , their inner surfaces spinning rapidly clockwise , as though they were maelstroms in the fracturing rock . Each sleek white thread , turning bronze-dark as it entered the moon 's shadow , led to the bottom of one of the whirlpool pits and kept swinging around in a tiny circuit , in pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their restless roots . They resembled waterspouts or tornado-funnels . Around each pit were three or four bright violet or lemon dots . He had seen one or two other such dots along the strands . It struck Don that they might be big spaceships , presumably from the Wanderer , and possibly generating gravitational or momentum fields of some kind . For the inference to be made from the whirlpool pits and the entering strands was clear : Somehow , the substance of the moon , in the form of dust and gravel and perhaps larger rocks , was being sucked out and carried looping through space toward the north pole of the Wanderer .  | ARAB AND PEPE AND HIGH stood over the Hudson , sharing a stick , ready to shred it into the pale , oil-filmed water if anyone should come . But no one did . The city was strangely still , even for six in the morning . So High flipped away the half-inch butt , and Arab lit another reefer , and they passed it around . Their arrival at the river , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Henry Hudson Parkway , had been anticlimactic . There had been simply nothing , over to the west , but pale sky and distant piers and Edgewater and the southern end of the Palisades . " She disappear somehow , " High decided . " Maybe just set . " He laughed . His gaze switched south to Grant 's Tomb . " What you think , General ? " " River look high , Admiral , " Arab adjudged , frowning , as he lit a third reefer for them . " Sure do , " High agreed . " See it washin ' over that dock ! " " That no dock , " Arab protested scornfully . " That a sunken barge . " " Just the same , water 's ten feet higher'n when we come . " " You crazy ! " " I know where she disappear to , " Pepe cried suddenly . " That big purple'n golden thing a amphi-whamf  --  a balloon-submarine combo ! She submerge . That why river high  --  she bulk it up . She lurkin ' down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the others quivered at the delicious horror of the thought , Pepe threw up his spread-fingered hands beside his cheeks and cried again , piling it on : " No , wait ! She not that . She a frozen atomic blast . They start the blast , then freeze the fireball . She float around like a ball lightning , first over the river , then under . When she unfreeze , city go which ! Look there ! " Red sun was glinting from banks of windows across the river , so low they looked like part of the water . Suddenly the pretended horror became appallingly real to all of them  --  the sudden fear against which no weed-smoker can wholly ensure himself . " Come on ! " Arab screamed in a whisper . They turned and ran back toward Harlem . JAKE LESHER curled his lip at the thinning crowd . With the sinking of the Wanderer and the seeping in of gray morning light , the excitement had drained out of Times Square . The earthquake litter  | now looked merely untidy and gritty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were something from a musical extravaganza , he remembered Sal 's song and the stamping crowd under the vast purple-and-amber floodlight . Then his lip relaxed and his eyes widened a little but stopped watching , as he felt brushing against the edges of his imagination the first tendrils of a dream  --  or of a scheme , for the two were very close in Jake 's universe . Sally Harris suddenly snaked her arm through his from behind . As she pulled him around , she whispered rapidly in his ear : " Come on , let 's get out of here before those other wolves find me . It 's only four blocks . " " You should n't startle me that way , Sal , " Jake complained . " I was getting a money-making thought . Where to ? " " You were just saying nothing could startle you any more . Ha ! I 'm taking us to breakfast at Hugo Hasseltine 's penthouse  --  me and my little key . After that quake , the higher I get , the safer I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jake pointed out . " Yeah , but things wo n't fall on me . Come on , you 'll scheme better on a full stomach . " Way up , a little pink was showing in the sky . Doc GRUNTED HAPPILY and said , " I could do with another sandwich . " " We thought we 'd better hold back half , " the thin woman told him apologetically from the other side of the long table . " It was my idea , " young Harry McHeath said , embarrassed . " And probably a good one , " Doc allowed . " Straight out of Swiss Family Robinson . Anyone care for a taste of Scotch ? " He fished a half-pint bottle out of his lefthand coat pocket . The fat woman humphed . " Better save that for emergencies , Rudy , " Ross Hunter said quietly . Doc sighed and tucked it away . " I suppose all second cups of  | coffee have been interdicted by the Committee of Public Safety , too , " he growled . Harry McHeath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doc and then for several of the others . Rama Joan said : " Rudolf , ages ago you were wondering what makes the colors of the Wanderer . " She had had Ann stretch out on two chairs beside her , wrapped in the coat someone had left behind , with the girl 's head pillowed on her mother 's thigh . Rama Joan was looking at the Wanderer . The eastern yellow spot now had purple all around it , destroying the illusion of the jaws . The two polar yellow spots were shrinking as they rotated out of sight . In fact , the effect was almost that of a purple target with a great yellow bull 's eye . Meanwhile the faintly crack-webbed moon , perceptibly lozenge-shaped , had almost finished a second westward crossing of the Wanderer 's face . Rama Joan said : " I do n't think it 's natural features at all . I think it 's simply . . . decor . " She paused . " If beings are able to drive their planet through hyperspace , they 'd surely be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctive . Cavemen did n't paint the outside of their homes , but we do . " " You know , I like that , " Doc said , smacking his lips . " A two-tone planet . Impress the neighbors in the next galaxy . " Wojtowicz and Harry McHeath laughed uneasily . The Ramrod thought : Unwillingly they grow toward comprehension of Ispan 's glory . Hunter , his voice low but jerky with tension , said : " If you were that advanced , I do n't suppose you 'd use natural planets at all . You 'd design and build them from scratch . Gosh , this seems crazy ! " he finished rapidly . " Not at all , " Doc assured him . " Be damned efficient to use all of a planet 's volume . You could have storerooms and dormitories and field generators down to the very core . Of course that would require some pretty tremendous beams and bracing ? " " Not if you had antigravity , " said Rama Joan . " Wow , " Wojtowicz said tonelessly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hunter said : " If you cancelled the gravity of a rotating planet , you 'd have to have it pretty well tied together , or centrifugal force would tear it apart . " " Nope , " Doc told him . " Mass and momentum would disappear together . " Paul cleared his throat . He was sitting beside Margo and he 'd  | taken off his coat and put it around her . He 'd meant to put his arm around her too , if only for the practical purpose of getting some of his body-heat back , but somehow he had n't yet . He said : " If beings were that advanced , would n't they also be careful not to injure or even disturb any inhabited planets they came near ? " He added uncertainly : " I suppose I 'm assuming a benign Galactic Federation , or whatever you 'd call it . . .. " " Cosmic Welfare State , " Doc suggested in faintly sardonic tones . " No , you 're absolutely right , young man , " the fat woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth pursed . " The first law of the Saucerians is to harm no life , but to nurture and protect all . " " But is it the first law of General Motors ? " Hunter wanted to know . " Or General Mao ? " Rama Joan smiled quizzically and asked Paul : " When you make an automobile trip , what special precautions do you take against running over cats and dogs ? Are the anthills all marked in your garden ? " " Still hot on your devil-theory , are n't you ? " Doc observed . Rama Joan shrugged . " Devils may be nothing but beings intent on their purpose , which now happens to collide with yours . " " Then evil 's just an auto accident ? " " Perhaps . Remember , there are careless drivers , and even drivers who use a car to express themselves . " Paul asked : " Even if the car 's a planet ? " Rama Joan nodded . " Hmm . I just use naked me to express myself , " Doc asserted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miaow asleep on her lap , interjected sharply : " When I drive I can see a cat on the sidewalk three blocks ahead . Cats are people . That 's why I could never have gone into Vandenberg , even if they 'd been more decent about the rest of it . " " But are people always people ? " Hunter asked her with a smile . " I 'm not so sure of that , " she admitted , wrinkling her nose . The fat woman made a pshaw-sound . Rama Joan said sweetly to Margo : " I hope that when things get . . . well . . . rougher , you never regret passing up Vandenberg and throwing in with us . You had your chance , you know . " Wojtowicz jumped up . " Look at that ! " he said . He was pointing across the sand to where a pair of headlights  | were bobbing up and down . And now there came plainly to their ears the swelling growl of an engine . Hunter said : " Paul , looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetch you . " Doc said : " It 's coming from the wrong direction . " Wojtowicz said : " Yeah , it 's from the highway , come around the slide . " The headlights slewed around , hesitated , then came on bright . Their glare made it hard to see the car , despite the twilight . Margo said : " They 'll get stuck , whoever they are . " " Not if they keep up speed they wo n't , " said Wojtowicz . The car came on as if it were going to ram the platform and then careened to a stop fifty feet away and doused its headlights . " It 's Hixon 's panel truck ! " the Little Man said . " And there 's Mrs. Hixon , " Doc said , as a figure in pale slacks and sweater dropped from the back of the truck and ran toward them . Wojtowicz , Ross Hunter , and Harry McHeath hurried toward the truck . As Mrs. Hixon passed them , she cried : " Help Bill look after Ray Hanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was on the platform . Earlier in the evening Mrs. Hixon had been a handsome-looking woman , but now her hands , face , slacks , and sweater were smeared with dirt , her hair had come unpinned and hung down in strands , her lips were pulled back from her teeth , and her eyes stared . There was blood on her chin . As soon as she stopped moving she started to shake . " The highway 's blocked both ways , " she gasped . " We lost the others . I think they 're dead . I think the whole world 's smashed . My God , have you got something to drink ? " Doc said : " You called it , " to Hunter as he pulled out his half pint , poured a double shot in an empty coffee cup , and started to add water . She clutched it before he could and sucked it down greedily , then shuddered over her shaking . Doc put his arms around her shoulders , hard . " Now tell us point by point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She nodded , closed her eyes a moment . Then : " We dug out three cars . Rivis ' , our truck , Wentcher 's microbus . The rest were too deep , but that was enough to hold us easy . Just Bill and Ray and me in the truck . When we got to the highway there was no traffic . That should have warned us , but we thought it was great . Christ ! Rivis turned north . We headed for L.A. , following the microbus . The car radio got two stations through the static . Just snatches . Nothing but the  | big L.A. quake  --  do this , do that , do n't do it . We had to keep swinging around little falls and rocks . Still no cars . The microbus was way ahead . We were where there was no beach , just a drop into the sea . " The road heaved just like that , without warning , my God ! It rocked the car like a boat . The door jerked open and Ray Hanks pitched out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the back of the car seat , braking . The cliffs came down . A rock big as a room hit ahead of us and cut a slice out of the road ten feet wide . I remember I bit my tongue . Ray got the car stopped . The road stopped heaving , too . Then I was choking on dust , but then through the dust came a big splash of water where the rock hit the sea . I was tasting salt and blood and dust , and I could still feel my brains shaking . " It got awful quiet . The road ahead was all blocked , dirt piled against the bumper . I do n't know if we could have climbed the fall , but we were going to try , because we did n't know if the microbus got buried , or got away , or what . Just then an after-slide came . A boulder as big as a lion missed me by that . Another just exploded . Bill made me get back in the car , while he walked through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels as I backed it around rocks and over ridges and angles . In between , he was coughing and cursing that new planet . " Someone was screaming curses too  --  at us . It was Ray . We 'd forgot him . His leg was broken above the knee , but we got him in the back on a canvas . I stayed beside him . Bill could turn the car now , and we headed back . " The little slides were bigger but we got around them . We wanted to meet cars now , but there still were n't any . Bill stopped at a roadside phone , but it was dead , and the light in the booth died while he was trying to get a dial tone . The radio was nothing but static now . The only word that ever seemed to get through was fire ! Ray and I kept yelling at Bill to go slower and faster . " We passed the turnoff here , but after a quarter of a mile the road was blocked by another slide  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that godawful thing up there . We came back here . There was n't anywhere else . " She breathed deeply . Doc asked : " What about the little roads back across the Santa Monica mountains ? Specifically , what about Monica Mountainway ? " " Little roads ? " Mrs. Hixon looked up at him wonderingly , then started to laugh and sob together . " You goddamn fool idiot , those mountains have been stirred like stew ! " Her laughter went out of  | control . Doc clapped his hand over her mouth . She struggled wildly for a moment , then let her head slump . Wanda and the thin woman took over for Doc , walking her away down the platform . Rama Joan followed them , after asking Margo to take her place as a pillow for Ann , who was watchful as a mouse . Paul said to Doc : " I wonder why there were n't any other cars trapped in that stretch of the highway ? Seems unnatural . " " They probably got out past the first , smaller slides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have turned back any cars trying to come into that stretch . And still , despite all she says , I think some may have escaped over Monica Mountainway . " Hunter called up : " Come on down , the rest of you guys , and bring the cot . We 've got to get Ray out of the truck , so some of us can go back in it to our cars . " TREMBLING AND BREATHLESS and a little teeter-gaited from their wild run past the mausoleum-like General Grant Houses , Arab and Pepe and High started east along 125th Street with an initial feeling of reassurance at having entered the hallway to their friendly , familiar Afro-Latin home . But the sidewalks , packed two hours ago , were empty now . Only a scattering of crushed paper cups and bags , empty pop bottles , and half-pint flasks testified to the vanished multitude . No cars moved along the street , though here and there were empty ones parked higgledy-piggledy , two with their motors ' exhaust streaming blue from their tail pipes . The weed-brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as far as they could tell the same desertion prevailed all along the crosstown street that led through the heart of Harlem . The only sounds , at first , besides their own footsteps and the motor chugging , were the sepulchral mouthings of unseen radios , sounding horribly important , by their tone ; but the words were uncatchable by reason of static and distance  --  and drowned out by the excited , equally unintelligible calling to each other of distant sirens and horns . " Where 's everybody ? " High whispered . " Atomic attack , " Pepe affirmed . " Russia 's sent the superdoops . Everybody crouchin ' down below in the basements . We got ta get to ours . " Then , a ghost of the wolf-wail returning to his voice : " Fireball risin ' from the river ! "  | " No ! " Arab contradicted , softly . " While we at the river , Resurrection come and go . Old Preacher-dads right after all . Everybody snatched  --  no time to turn off their cars or their radios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of each other and tiptoed , to kill the sound of their footsteps as they went fearfully on . SALLY HARRIS AND JAKE LESHER tiptoed out of the tiny aluminumlined box that had lifted them the last three stories . Before their eyes was dimness , with gleams highlighting a grand piano . Under their feet was thick carpet , spongebased . Sally yoohooed softly . With a whispered sigh the door behind them slid sideways , but Sally caught it and blocked it with a tiny table holding a silver tray . " What are you trying to do ? " Jake asked . " I do n't know , " she said . " We 'll hear the buzzer if anybody else wants in . Come on . " " Wait a minute , " Jake said . " You 're sure Hasseltine 's not home ? " Sally shrugged . " I 'll have a look while you raid the icebox . Just leave the sterling alone . Come on , have n't you a bagelsize hole in your gut ? " Like a mouse with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVIES LISTENED with wicked amusement to the weird reports of the Wanderer coming over the wireless to the tiny Severnshore pub near Portishead , where he 'd gone after a two-hour snooze to do his late morning drinking . From time to time he embroidered the reports fancifully for the edification and jollification of his unappreciative fellow-topers : " Purple and sickly amber , eh ? ' T is a great " star-written American advertisement , lads , for grape juice and denatured beer ! " and , " It 's a saintly Soviet superballoon , boys , set to pop over lawless Chicago and strew the Yankee heartland with begemmed copies of Marx 's holy Manifesto ! " The reports were coming over an Atlantic cable , the derisive announcer said  --  extraordinary severe magnetic storms had disordered the radio sky to the west . Dai greatly wished that Dick Hillary were still with him  --  this lovely nonsense was just the thing to make that hater of spaceflight and space fiction squirm ; besides , he 'd be a better audience for a Welsh poet 's rare wit than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , the wireless reports began to  | include mention of a cracked and captured moon  --  the announcer growing still more derisive , yet now with a nervous note in his voice , almost hysterical  --  Dai 's mood changed abruptly , and there was much more drunken emotion than wit in his cry : " Steal our moon-bach , would they , those damned Yanks ! Do n't they know Mona belongs to Wales ? And they hurt her , we 'll swim across and gut Manhattan Isle from the Battery to Hellgate , will we not , my hearties ? " This met with , " Shut up , you sot , he 's saying more , " " Wild jabbering Welshman , " " Bolshy , I 'd think , " " No more for you , you 're drunk " ? this last from the host . " Cowardly Somersets ! " Dai retorted loudly , grabbing up a mug and brandishing it like a knuckleduster . " And you follow me not I 'll fight you myself , all up and down the Mendip Hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white-eyed scarecrow figure in dungarees and wide-brimmed rainhat faced them against the light fog outside . " Is there aught on the wireless or the telly of the tide ? " this apparition called to the host . " Two hours yet till low , and the Channel 's ebbing as I 've never seen it , even at the equinoctial springs with an east gale blowing . Come , look for yourselves . At this progress a man 'll be able to walk on all the Welsh Grounds by noon and an hour after that the Channel 'll be near dry ! " " Good ! " Dai cried loudly , letting the host take away the mug and leaning hunch-shouldered on the bar as the others made a tentative move toward the door . " Then I 'll walk the five miles back to Wales straight across the Severn sands and be shut of you lily-livered Somersets . By God , I will ! " " And good riddance , " someone muttered loudly , while a hairsplitting jokester pointed out : " If that 's your aim you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patch for stepping stones if you like  --  and more than twice five miles . Straight across here , man , it 's Monmouth , not Wales . " " Monmouth 's still Welsh to me and be damned to the Union of 1535 , " Dai retorted , slumping his chin onto the bar . " Oh , go gawk at this watery prodigy , all of you . It 's my guess the Yanks , having broken and chained the moon , are stealing the ocean , too . " GENERAL SPIKE STEVENS SNAPPED : " Get Christmas Relay , Jimmy ! Tell ' em their picture 's starting to swim , too . " The watchers in the underground room were grouped in front of  | the righthand screen , ignoring the other , which for more than an hour had been nothing but a churning rectangle of visual static . The picture from the satellite above Christmas Island showed the Wanderer in her target face with Luna swinging behind her , but both planet and moon were bulging and rippling as electronic distortion invaded the screen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't raise them , " Captain James Kidley responded . " Radio and shortwave are gone . Ultrashort 's going  --  every kind of communication that is n't by buried wire or wave guide . And even those ? " " But we 're a headquarters ! " " I 'm sorry , General , but ? " " Get me HQ One ! " " General , they do n't ? " There was a strong vibration from the floor and a sharp crackling sound . The lights flickered , went out , came on again . The buried room rocked . Plaster fell . Once more the lights went out  --  all except the pale glow of the Christmas Island screen . Abruptly the wavering astronomic picture on the screen was replaced by the silhouette of a large feline head with pricked ears and grinning jaws . It was as if , out on that unmanned satellite 23,000 miles above the Pacific , a black tiger had peered into the telescope . For a moment the picture held . Then it swam , and the screen blacked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the General yelled in the dark . " You saw it , too ? " Colonel Mabel Wallingford demanded . A laugh , half hysterical , half exultant , rimmed her question . " Shut up , you stupid bitch ! " the General shrilled . " Jimmy ? " " It was a chance distortion . " The younger man 's voice came shakily through the blackness . " Inkblot effect . It could n't have been ? " " Quiet ! " Colonel Willard Griswold yelled at all three of them . " Listen ! " They all heard it : the sound of water gushing and splashing . ABOARD THE " PRINCE CHARLES " they were especially conscious of the choking radioways . Both the insurgents now controlling the luxury liner , and also the loyal crew members , using a ham sender , tried unsuccessfully to get off messages of the great coup , the one group to their revolutionary leaders , the other to the British Navy . And Wolf Loner , three thou-  | sand miles north , was thinking how good it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his dory were n't reaching Boston quite so soon . THE WANDERER 'S MAGNETIC FIELD , far stronger than Earth 's , sprang out through space as swiftly as its gravitational field , almost instantly affecting instruments sensitive to it . But besides this allpervasive magnetic influence , there were stranger straight-line influences streaming down from the Wanderer and striking the side of the earth facing it . They ripped the van Allen belts and dumped a cloudburst of protons and electrons on Earth . These powerful straight-line influences were greatly intensified when Luna went into orbit around the Wanderer and began to break up . They produced ionization and other , subtler effects , the chief perceptible results of which was swiftly to unfit Earth 's stratosphere and also her lower atmosphere for any sort of electromagnetic communications . As the First Night of the Wanderer traveled west around the world , or , rather , as the world spun eastward into it , this poisoning of the radio sky spread to the whole globe , greatly contributing to the fog of catastrophe that was cutting off country from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind from mind . WHILE the oddly-assorted medical team of Doc , Rama Joan , and the Ramrod prepared to set Ray Hanks ' broken leg , Clarence Dodd led the rest of the men in an expedition back to the buried cars . With three or four of them to give the truck a running push , it got underway easily enough in the sand , but tended to stall when they all tried to pile in , so Hixon , the Little Man , and young Harry McHeath rode , while Paul , Hunter , and Wojtowicz trudged . Halfway there , McHeath came loping back past them with splints and tape from Doddsy 's first-aid stores . " Do n't strain yourself , kid , " Wojtowicz yelled after him . " Run it like the two-mile , not the four-forty !  | " The kid overdoes , " he told Paul . " I 'm responsible for him to his aunts , though they are a pair of snooty old dames . " After the little trek , they helped Doddsy and Bill Hixon unload from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a formidable assortment of practical equipment , including tins of food and near-beer , blankets , two leather jackets , a small tent , charcoal briquettes and kerosene , and a primus stove  --  and some sevenpower field glasses , which they instantly used to look at the Wanderer , but the lenses only stretched the purple and gold ; however , the cracks on the surface of the mashed and ellipsoidal moon , now disappearing on its second time around , became chillingly wide . Then from Doddsy 's car came two machetes ( Paul chuckling to himself at the romanticism of it ) , and two army-surplus rifles with ammunition . Lastly , three five-gallon cans and a length of hose which they used to siphon gas from the tanks of the buried cars to fill the truck 's tanks and make a fifteen-gallon reserve . Wojtowicz shouldered one of the rifles and announced : " Hey , look , I 'm back in the service ! Forward . . . march ! ? I got a clownish side , " he explained to Paul . The loaded truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did the return trip readily enough . Hixon even whirled it in for a landing as fancy as a speedboat 's with the tailgate abutting the raised platform . Doc 's comment , when he 'd surveyed the treasures , was , " Doddsy , I see everything here for emergencies but hard liquor ? or soft , for that matter , " he added , shaking his head incredulously at the label on a near-beer can . " I have an ample supply of barbiturates and Dexedrine , " the Little Man batted back at him . " Not the same thing , " Doc mourned . " I never was partial to goofballs . Now if it were mescaline , say , or peyote , or even a few sticks of marijuana ... " Wanda glared . Harry McHeath laughed nervously , and Wojtowicz said solemnly , with a warning glance at Doc : " He 's jokin ' , kid . " Doc grinned and said to the thin woman : " Break out the last of the hot coffee , Ida . The Hixons still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can all do with a bite and a cup . Now we know Doddsy 's got jars of the powdered , there 's no need to hoard . Besides , we 'll need the jug for water from the beach-house tank  --  I 've checked it , and it 's drinkable . Some of you may think I 'm nothing  | but a C2H5OH maniac , but actually I give an occasional thought to H2O . " Agreement on the coffee suggestion was unanimous . Everybody was tired and glad to sit or flop on the platform , up off the gritty sand . In their midst on the cot was Ray Hanks , with his leg wrapped and taped until it looked , in Wojtowicz 's words , like a section of sewer pipe . But the injured man was resting tolerably after being dosed with the rest of Doc 's whiskey  --  and with the Ramrod keeping a light " healing touch " on his hip . Ida poured first for the Hixons , who were sitting side by side now , he with his arm around her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnly . It set a tone . There was something solemn about them all as they started to sip their last scant cups of brewed coffee . As Hunter had divined earlier , each in his way felt that this place was home and dreaded the moment of departure . Here on the beach there were no hills to fall , no buildings to collapse and burn , no gas pipes to crack and flare hot yellow , or wires to fall and flash blindingly . ( True , there was the beach house , looking lopsided now with one wall knocked askew by the quake , but it was dark and low and boarded up , and so could be ignored . ) There were no strangers monitoring their actions , no victims to enjoin their aid . Static choked what messages of catastrophe , what do 's and don't 's , what police and Red Cross and Civilian Defense directives must be crowding the airwaves . It was good to dream of just staying here , a compatible little beach colony just staying here and watching the Wanderer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon again eclipsed behind it and the planet itself showing a face like that of a bull charging purple head on , the yellow target-center half out of sight and a larger , lower yellow round creeping into view . By chance , or conceivably by intention , two small yellow ovals made eyes . Doddsy set down his coffee cup to sketch it .  | " El toro , " Margo said . Rama Joan said : " The head of an octopus . The Cretans drew it just so on their vases . " " But we 're going to have to get out of here  --  and in three or four hours , " Doc said suddenly , as if aware of the general , unstated dream of staying forever on the beach . " The tide . " Hunter frowned at him warningly and Doc hastened to say : " Now , do n't anybody get me wrong  --  we 're in no danger right now , in fact , just the opposite . The high-water interval here is about ten hours , which means a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the sky . In other words , in about an hour the Udell be dead low . See how far away the edge of the surf is ? That leaves us ample time for a good rest  --  which I for one fully intend to take . " " But whaddya mean , Doc , the tide ? " Wojtowicz asked . Again Hunter frowned and shook his head slightly . Doc said to Hunter : " No , Ross , I think we better face up to it now when we 've got a breathing space . " Then , turning toward Wojtowicz : " You know of course how the moon  --  the mass of the moon  --  is the main cause of the tides ? Well , now we 've got the Wanderer out there . It 's about the same place as the moon , so we can expect the tides to have about the same general pattern as before . " " That 's good , " Wojtowicz said . " For a minute you had me scared . " But most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't smiling . He sighed and said : " However , judging from the way it 's captured the moon , the Wanderer must have a mass about as great as Earth  --  in other words , a mass eighty times that of the moon . "  | There was a rather long silence . The one word " eighty " hung in the air like a gray rock , getting bigger and solider every second . Only the Ramrod and his two women did n't seem greatly concerned . Hunter was frowning worriedly , watching reactions . Rama Joan , her lap once more a pillow for her sleeping daughter , suddenly smiled at Doc warmly . Mrs. Hixon put out her hands a little as if to say , " But . . . " Her husband drew them down to her lap and hugged her a little tighter as he nodded solemnly at Doc . Paul did the same , at last putting an arm around Margo . The Little Man pocketed his notebook and folded his arms . Doc looked back at them all with a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who finally put it into words . " You mean , Mr. Brecht , that although the tides will be coming at the same times and in the same general way as before , they 'll be .. eighty times bigger ? " " He did n't say that ! " Hunter interposed hotly . " Rudy , you 're not allowing for the age of the tides . We should have a day 's grace in any case . Besides that , tides are a resonance phenomenon  --  it should take quite a while for the oceanic tidal bands to get to vibrating in a larger amplitude . " " That may be true , " Doc said . " Also there 'll be spill-over effects to moderate the factor of eighty . However , " he went on more firmly , " that two-tone planet is out there , and thinking is n't going to change its mass . You 've seen what it 's done to the moon . Whether it 's going to take seven hours or a week , the big water 's coming , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got a couple of hills under me . That 's why I inquired about Monica Mountainway , " he explained to the Hixons . " Nevertheless ? " he continued very loudly , checking the excited flood of talk just beginning ? " before a man makes an effort , he gathers his strength  --  as I 'm going to do right now . Anyone wants to waste energy jabbering , go ahead . He wo n't bother me . " And he stretched out on four chairs , put his arm across his eyes , and , presently , gave out with a large , theatrical snore . DON MERRIAM , orbiting for a second time behind the Wanderer , suddenly thought of the menace to Earth which the mere physical presence of the strange planet constituted . Why , there would be earthquakes  --  possibly  --  and gigantic ocean tides  --  certainly , though he was n't sure how quickly they 'd build up  --  and there  | might be . . . well , he did n't think the Wanderer could crack the Earth at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at Terra right now , with his binoculars , and reassure himself . It was his duty to warn Earth , or at least to try , no matter how hopeless the attempt seemed . He warmed the radio of the Baba Yaga and began alternately to send and listen . Once he thought he heard the beginning of a reply , but it faded . He wondered if anything down on that green-spotted black hemisphere could be listening in . ARAB JONES and his weed-brothers on Manhattan Island were almost twice as far into the day as the saucer students were still in the night , since the dawn-line at this moment was sweeping west across the Rocky Mountains at its customary 700 miles an hour , also bringing rosy daybreak and the buzzards to Asa Holcomb 's mesa . Somewhere near Roosevelt Square Arab pointed up at the roofs and cried : " There they are ! " High and Pepe looked . The low roofs were lined with people , explaining in part the mystery of deserted 125th Street . Some of the people were looking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling . But it was impossible to make out the words because of the loud chugging of an abandoned taxi , skew-parked so close by that High clutched one of its open doors to steady himself . " They crazy they think they escape the bombs that way , " Pepe said , peering upward . " Bombs come from space , do n't burrow up through the rock from old Pellucidar . " " You sure of that ? " High demanded . " Maybe that fireball tunneling from the river ! " " They all awaiting the glorious fireball ! " Arab cried loudly , spreading his arms to comprehend the roofs . " They all dead already . Like Manator ! They a rooftop wax museum ! All New York ! " Abruptly the fear-kick in that last vision became absolutely real fear , and the thought of being spied upon and chittered at and lured and finally , irresistibly summoned by all those dark , wax-skinned living mummies fifty feet overhead became quite intolerable . " Let 's get out of here ! " High yelled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi . " I getting out ! " Arab and Pepe piled into the bank . The forward lurch of the taxi slammed the door shut and sent them back against the cold , slick  | leather cushions as High headed west , gathering speed as he wove around abandoned cars . THE STAMPEDE of sections of the New York City Police and Fire Departments , marring the metropolis ' relatively swift and sensible preparations for catastrophe , was due to a number of factors : exaggerated reports of the tidal bulge at Hell Gate and the quake damage to the Medical Center on upper Broadway , scrambled directives sent out by a water-shorted computer in the underground center of the new inter-departmental coordinating system , and false reports of riots around the Polo Grounds . Yet just plain nerves played their part  --  naked fear operating alongside the frantic urge to rush out and somehow play the hero . It was as if the Wanderer were finally bringing true the old lunatic superstitions about the moon pouring down rays of madness . All over the Western Hemisphere  --  in Buenos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the same wild , purposeless sorties . HIGH BUNDY was stepping on the gas three blocks west of Lenox when he and Pepe and Arab heard the sirens coming . At first they could n't tell where they were coming from , only that they were coming , because they were getting louder fast . Then the cab crossed Eighth Avenue , and as the raucous wailing crescendoed they saw charging toward them up Eighth , not a block away , two squad cars abreast and what looked like more behind them , their red busines-lights flashing . High stepped harder . The sound of the sirens should have cut down for a couple of seconds while there were buildings between the cab and the police cars . But it did n't . It got louder . There was an old jalopy abandoned smack in the middle of the next intersection . High aimed to pass it to the right . A Black Maria and a fire chief 's car hurtled out of Seventh Avenue from the south and swerved around the jalopy to either side . High stepped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tails , and got across Seventh feet ahead of a big , end-swinging firetruck following the other two cars by hardly a length . Pepe glimpsed the great red hood and the wide-eyed face of the driver and clapped his hands to his eyes , it was so close . The cab was n't halfway down the next block when the intersection ahead filled with more red and black cars , racing north on  | Lenox . The sound of the sirens from behind and ahead was brainshaking . If the weed-brothers had n't been loaded on pot , they might have realized that this stampede of police cars and firetrucks from lower Manhattan had nothing to do with them personally and that the ferocious vehicles were n't converging into 125th Street , but continuing their mad dash north . But the weed-brothers were loaded , and the master fear-kick of pursuit by police was upon them . Pepe believed they were to be scapegoats for an attempt to destroy Manhattan by suitcase bombs ? they 'd be frisked for fireballs and convicted on the evidence of a Zippo lighter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frog-march them to the nearest roof and tie them down among the grinning wax mummies . High simply thought they 'd been spotted smoking weed back at the river  --  probably by telepathy . He braked the cab to a stop just short of Lenox . They piled out . The subway entrance yawned with the dark invitation of a cave or den , promising the security all terrified animals crave . There was a white sawhorse half blocking it , but they darted past and clattered down the stairs . The token booth was empty . They scrambled over the turnstiles . There was a lighted train waiting , its doors open . But there was n't anybody in it . The station was lit , but they could n't see any people anywhere , on this platform or the one across . The empty train was purring softly and insistently , but after the sirens faded there was n't another sound . DESPITE DOG 'S SNORING for morale purposes , no one except llama Joan tried to follow his example , and after a half hour or so Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled arm , so as to get into an argument Hunter and Paul were having about the paths  | in space Earth and the Wanderer would take with respect to each other . " I 've figured it all out in my head  --  roughly , of course , " Doc told them . " Granting they 're of equal mass , they 'll revolve around a point midway between them in a month lasting about nineteen days . " " Shorter than that , surely , " Paul objected . " Why , we can see with our own eyes how fast the Wanderer 's moving . " He pointed to where the strange planet , maroon and light orange now , was dipping atilt toward the ocean , the blunt yellow spearhead of the moon striking across its front almost from below . Doc chuckled . " That movement 's just the Earth turning  --  same thing as makes the sun rise . " Then , as Paul grimaced in exasperation at his own stupidity , Doc added : " Natural enough mistake  --  I keep making it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors along with my tail bones ! Say , look how far the sea 's gone out ! Ross , I 'm afraid the tidal effects are showing up faster than we hoped . " Paul , trying to get back into the swing of the discussion , made himself visualize how tides eighty times higher would mean tides eighty times lower too  --  at six-hour intervals , at most places . " Incidentally , " Doc added , " we 'll be about ten days getting into that nineteen-day orbit , since Earth 's acceleration is only about fivehundredths of an inch a second . That of the moon , also in respect to the Wanderer , must have been about four feet a second , cumulative , of course . " A chilly land-breeze came sneaking around Paul 's neck . He pulled his coat tighter  --  he 'd got it back from Margo when the Little Man had given her one of the leather jackets . In spite of that she had Miaow inside the jacket to make her warmer as she stared out across the long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wet gravel , " she said to Paul . " Like amethysts and topazes shoveled out of trucks . " " Ssh , " said the fat woman , beside her . " He 's getting messages . " Just the other side of Wanda , the Ramrod was gazing at the Wanderer as though hypnotized by it , his chin on his fist , rather in the attitude of " The Thinker . " " The Emperor says , No harm to Terra , ' " the Ramrod droned just then in a trancelike voice . " Her turbulent waters shall be stilled , her oceans withdrawn from her shores ' . " " A planetful of King Canutes , " Doc murmured softly .  | " Your emperor ought to have got on the ball in time to stop the earthquakes , " Mrs. Hixon called tartly . Mr. Hixon laid his hand on her arm and whispered to her . She flirted her shoulders , but made no more cracks . Rama Joan opened her eyes . " How are your speculations going now , Rudolf ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He replied : " I 'll wait until one flies in close enough for me to see whether his wings are feathery or leathery . " Then , realizing that he 'd not necessarily made a joke , he looked quickly toward the Wanderer with a sardonic shudder . Then he stood up and stretched himself and surveyed the platform . " Ha , I see you loaded the truck while I snoozed , " he commented blandly . " That was considerate . Did n't even forget the water jugs ? I suppose I have you to thank for that , Doddsy . " Then , softly , to Hunter : " How 's Ray Hanks ? " " Hardly woke up when we moved the cot into the truck and guyed it to the sides . Put a blanket around him . " There was a droning in the sky . Everyone held very still . Several looked apprehensively toward the Wanderer , as if they thought something might be coming from there . Then Harry McHeath called excitedly : " It 's a ' copter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regulation enough little dragonfly of an observation ' copter as it slanted down toward the sea , then swung around and came along the beach , traveling at not much more than fifty feet . Suddenly it swerved toward them and hovered overhead . The drone became a roar . The down-blast from the vanes scattered the pile of unused programs in a white flutter . " Is the damn fool trying to land on us ? " Doc demanded , crouching and squinting upward like all the others . A great voice came down through the drone . " Get out ! Get out of here ! " " Why , the bastards ! " Doc roared , so that what the voice said next was lost . " They 're not satisfied with slamming the door in our faces . Now they order us out of the neighborhood ! " Beside him the Little Man lifted and fiercely shook his fist . " Get off the beach ! " the great voice finished as the ' copter tilted over and continued in its course down the coast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bigger man 's shoulder . " Maybe they 're trying to warn us about the tides ! " " But that wo n't be for at least six hours ? " Doc broke off , as it became apparent that the roar was n't leaving  | with the ' copter , and as water spurted upward in a dozen places through the cracks between the floorboards . All around the platform was a pale welter of foam . The wave had come in while all their eyes were on the ' copter and its roar had masked that of the wave . " But ? " Doc demanded , rather like King Canute himself . " Not tides , but tsunami ! " Hunter yelled at him . " Earthquake waves ! " Doc smote his own forehead . With a hissing of sand and a hollow clanking of gravel the water receded , leaving behind a ghostly patchwork of spume . " There 's another coming ! " Paul cried out , watching a distant pale wall with horror . " Start the truck ! " The Hixons were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and died . The starter whined by itself . Hunter , Doddsy , Doc , and Harry McHeath jumped down and prepared to heave at the truck 's sides . Rama Joan half-carried Ann across the platform , pushed her into the truck , and slapped her across the face when she tried to come back . " Stay there and hold on , " she snarled . Wanda tried to follow Ann , but Wojtowicz grabbed her in a bear-hug , telling her : " Not this time , Fatty ! " Paul lifted and tried to secure the truck 's tailgate . The motor caught . Wojtowicz swung Wanda behind him , and he and Paul pushed at the tailgate , sprawling on the boards when the truck lurched forward a foot or so . Its rear tires squealed as they spun in the wet sand . A heave from the men below , another forward lurch , a hesitation , another running heave , and suddenly the truck was going away fast , its tailgate swinging , its tail lights shining on the foam-frosted water nipping at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner of the platform and rock it a little , the cracks spouting like a sprinkler system . As it receded , Paul hustled Margo across the slippery boards . She was clutching Miaow . He paused on the back edge of the platform and looked around at the others and at the men struggling to their feet below in the shallow water . " Come on ! Quick , before the third one hits ! " he yelled and plunged off with Margo , leading the rush after the truck . ARAB AND PEPE AND HIGH expected blue floods of police to pour down after them into the Lenox and 125th Street subway station . So they hid in the can , Arab ready to shred their remaining reefers into  | the toilet and High set to flush it , while Pepe listened at the door . It was n't very smart but it was done almost instinctively . But nobody else tried to come in ; they did n't hear police tramping and shouting around , in fact they did n't hear anything . Presently they came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so for a while they just snuck around . Pepe tried to get some chocolate out of a machine but it stuck . He biffed it once but stopped at the noise . They got on the back end of the empty , waiting train , which was headed downtown , and walked through it all the way to the front . There Arab fingered a lever for a while and then swung it . The doors started to close and he swung it back quick . He moved another lever and the purring got louder , and the train seemed to strain , and he quickly reversed that one , too . " Better not mess with those , " he said with a giggle . They studied the black double tunnel through the front door , waiting for a train to come the other way , but none did . The longer the station stayed empty , the more it felt like a private world of their own . Feeling world-owner wealthy , they lit three sticks and sipped them on the engineer 's platform . Finally Arab said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " High frowned hard . Then , " Russians land at the Battery from supersubs . Defeat the fuzz at the Battle of Union Square . Fuzz retreat north , fighting a rear-guard action . Russians advance . My orders of the day : lurk below , men , and play deaf and dumb . " Arab nodded . " Pepe ? " " That fireball ! She surface at the Battery and split up without blasting , and then come flowing uptown through the streets . People think she poison gas and go for the roofs , but she really happy smoke , poppy-weed mix . Everybody but us strangle to death . Too scare ' to inhale . Arab ? " A warm breeze began to flow past them from the tunnel ahead . It was heavy with subway smell : metal , dry dirt , human staleness , a dash of electricity . " Come on , Arab , you started this , " Pepe prodded him . " O.K. , I got it now , " Arab said . " River high , we saw . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashore and come north . Flood like Noah 's ! Tell people to take to the roofs and turn to pillars of salt . Clear out the basements and the subways . Fuzz run . Firemen all set with hoses , but water one thing they ca n't fight . They run too . Water just a-coming and a-coming. "  | " Hey , that 's good , " High said . " Ree-alistic . " The breeze got stronger and so did the subway smell , but now an inappropriate odor was mixed with the latter . Far down the tunnel there was a blue flash . " Train coming , " Pepe said . There was another blue flash , and another . The breeze became a wind , and now the inappropriate odor came clear : it was the smell you got near the river . And there was a roaring growing louder . " Dark train coming on both tracks ! " Arab screeched . The blue flashes came closer , closer , became brighter , brighter . The salty , sour wind was a gale ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thousand lions . For a moment , clutching each other on the platform , they saw it clear : the foamy front dark with dirt and footed with blue flame . Then the electricity-loaded piston of salt water struck . SALLY HARRIS AND JAKE LESHER nibbled scrambled eggs and caviar from a silver platter set over a blue flame and a crystal bowl set in ice . " Gee , we 're high up , " Sally said , gazing out across the penthouse patio . " All I can see is the Empire State , RCA , the Chrysler , the Sixty Wall Tower . . . and is that bitty point the Waldorf Astoria ? " " Forty stories before we switched to Hasseltine 's private elevator , " Jake told her as he spooned caviar onto a toasted split bagel . " I counted . " Sally took her coffee cup to the tubular chrome balustrade and peered over with a reckless swoop . " Whee , people look like gumdrops , " she called back to him . " They 're running  --  I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what those little hydrants are for that they have sticking out of buildings  --  I thought they were for putting out fires in cars , remember , or holding back mobs of rioting garment workers . " " Naw , they 're for washing down the sidewalks in the morning , " Jake instructed her , pouring himself a cup of coffee from the tall slim pot with the red light at its base . She nodded . " I thought so  --  they 're using them now . " " Naw , they do it at four A.M. Now it 's eight . " His eyes grew distant . It felt to him as if the money-thought he 'd had in Times Square were at last coming back . " Well , maybe , but it looks awfully wet . " She studied a while longer . Then , " Jake ? "  | " What now ? Sal , I 'm trying to think " " You 're right . The water 's not coming out of those little hydrants . It 's coming out of the subways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that jolted him painfully . The floor had jumped , too . The building roared and lurched  --  and lurched again . He flailed the air with his arms and grabbed the chrome balustrade where Sally was rocking and squealing above the roar . Blocks down , her coffee cup and large flakes of stone made pin-point flat splashes . The lurching and roaring faded . Sally leaned over and pointed straight below at a black ribbon coming out of their building near the base . " Look ! " she yelled . " Smoke ! Oh Jake , is n't it exciting ? " she demanded as he dragged her back . " We ought to make a play out of it ! " In the chaos of the moment , Jake still was able to realize that this was the money-idea for which he had been groping . Behind them the telltale red light at the base of the coffee pot went out , and the orange glow of the toaster faded . THE SAUCER STUDENTS had outrun three more sloshing earthquake waves that were more spume than water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and halted there , most of them winded , the Ramrod and Ida half dragging his other woman between them , when the really big combers started chasing them all . Up ahead , the rounded foothills of the Santa Monica mountains loomed dark and heavy against a sky that had begun to gray with the dawn . Nearer , but already quite far , the bobbing lights of the truck continued to recede . Hixon had taken the most direct course away from the sea , a course midway between the great hump of Vandenberg and the crumbled lower palisades that had buried the cars , and the others had followed the truck . This had been wise ? any other course would have had them running slantwise to the waves across even lower beach ; the trouble was that even the midway course was nothing but sand and flat sandy ground for a long distance  --  a dry river wash . Behind them the Wanderer touched the ocean 's rim . The curving moon-lozenge was crossing its front again . The planet itself was showing once more its yin-yang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought , Why , this is where we came in . The thing 's completed one rotation  --  it 's got a six-hour day . Then something  | black and square and lace-sided reared up and blocked off the Wanderer from him . It was the platform where they 'd held their saucer symposium , upended by the second of the big combers . Then he heard the roar . SIX HOURS The others had started to run again and he pounded after them , tiny needles teasing his heart . Then . . . well , it was as if in one terrible , instantaneous swoop the Wanderer had leaped a quarter of a million miles out of the heavens and poised itself just above them , shutting off all of the sky except a circular gray horizon-border . It was enough to stop them in their tracks , despite the pale , wreckage-fisted horrors roaring at them up the beach . Hunter was the first to get distances and dimensions right , and he thought , Why , it 's simply ( my God , simply ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen feet above us and painted with a violet-gold yin-yang . Then he started running again . The first and least of the big combers plastered them with spume and surged around them knee-high . Although most of their minds and senses were still glued to the thing above them , their bodies responded to the material assault . They grabbed at each for support ; hands clutched slippery hands or wet waists or soggy coats . Wanda went under , and Wojtowicz ducked for her . Margo 's nails dug into Paul 's neck and she screamed in his ear : " Miaow ! Get Miaow ! " and she jabbed her other hand beyond him . He glimpsed a tiny cat tail and ears disappearing in the dirty spume  | and he crazily dove after them , clutching ahead . So Paul missed what happened next . A pink port five feet across flashed open in the saucer 's center , and there swung out of it , hanging just above their heads by two clawed limbs and a pointed prehensile tail , a green-and-violet-furred " Devil ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Tiger ! " yelled Harry McHeath . Doc heard and his mind threw out , as uncontrollably as a pair of honest dice , the thought : My God , the second Buck Rogers Sunday page ! The Tiger Men of Mars ! " Empress ! " the Ramrod cried , his cold knees buckling , and in his nostrils , framed by the sea 's mucky stink , the breath of a heavenly perfume . . . . Big , black-centered violet eyes scanned them all very rapidly , yet with an impression of leisurely spectator disdain . The second huge comber was n't thirty yards away , the platform riding it like a surfboard , scattered chairs bobbing all around , and behind it the half-exploded beach house coming on , too . A green paw shot out , pointed a taper-snouted gray pistol seaward , and fanned it back and forth . There was no flash or glow or sign , but the great wave sank , shriveled , dissolved . The platform slipped back over it and to the side . The broken beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished . Confused loomings and shrinkings . The water was hardly thigh-deep and it lacked the punch of the first comber when it struck them at last . The gray pistol kept on fanning back and forth over their heads . A great gust of wind whipped past them from the land . Doc , caught off balance , started to fall . Rama Joan heaved back on him . Paul 's head and shoulders emerged from the foam . He was clutching a rat-wet Miaow to his shoulder . The wind kept blowing . The being hanging from the rim of the pink port seemed to lengthen out , almost impossibly , becoming a violet-barred green curve stretching toward Paul . The gray pistol dropped , and Margo caught it . Violet-gray claws dug into Paul 's shoulder , and he and Miaow were swept up , by more than any mere human muscular force , into the pink port . Margo and Doc and Rama Joan , clinging together for support , saw that much very clearly .  | The green and violet being whipped back into the saucer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition , the saucer was hundreds of yards overhead , no bigger than the moon , the port a big , pale dot . Margo shoved the gray pistol inside her jacket . The wind from the land faded . The dot winked out , and the saucer vanished . Then they were all struggling hand in hand up the beach , through knee-deep water sucking back seawards . BAGONG BUNG , steering the " Machan Lumpur " out of the tideswollen inlet south of Do-Son after a successful though unpleasantly delayed delivery of a cargo of assorted contraband , saw the Wanderer rising out of the cloud-edged Gulf of Tonkin in the young night just as  --  almost half a planet away  --  the saucer students , escaped from the tsunami , were watching the last sliver of it sink into the Pacific . To Bagong Bung the yin-yang was a familiar Chinese symbol which he liked to think of as the Two Whales , but the deformed moon  --  at which he swiftly directed his brass spyglass ? was now , to him , like a huge bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanderer rising where the moon should have risen alone was not so much a staggering intrusion as a promise of good luck , a supernatural encouragement . Diamonds made him think of the lost treasure ships hidden under the shallow seas around him . He instantly and irrevocably decided that when tomorrow dawned , and with it the low tide came , he would spare time for at least one dive at the new location he 'd guessed for the wreck of the " Sumatra Queen " ! " Come up , Cobber-Hume , " he called through the rusty speaking tube to his Australian engineer . " Great good fortune for us . No , I must not tell you . Come up , then you 'll see . Oh , you 'll see ! "  | PAUL HAGBOLT was plunged into a breathable sea of warmth , sweet spicy odors , and gay pastel colors dominated by pink ? though here and there were bright green swatches . For a few moments he had n't been at all certain that he 'd been snatched inside a vehicle . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence , another spot in the universe  --  a jungly , bedroomy spot . He 'd hardly seen the saucer . Most of the time it was hovering , he 'd been floundering and choking in the gritty salt water clutching Miaow . When he 'd been whisked up , his first thought had been that he and Miaow had been spun aloft by the next comber and were riding its top . Then had come three fleeting yet shockingly vivid flashes : first , a huge , tapering , greenish-purplish cat face ; second , two staring eyes with incredible five-petaled irises around the black five-spiked stars of the pupils ; third , a long , slim , hand-sized paw with narrow indigo pads and four cruel curving claws of translucent , violet-gray horn ? he had the impression that they 'd just been buried in the scruff of his coat , and maybe his neck , too , hastening him . The next instant he was floating with a slow twist in the warm , sugary-flowery , green-flecked , pink sea . A dark hole in that sea swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dirty , foamed water holding something graygleaming and staring up at him , and beside her Doc , spumepatched , and Rama Joan , sand-streaked , with red-gold hair clinging wet and twisty . Then they were shrinking with incredible swiftness , as if a wrong-ended telescope had been interposed . Nevertheless , it was then that Paul began to believe that he was in the saucer he 'd disjointedly seen  --  the saucer that now must be soaring faster than any mortar shell , though with no sensation of acceleration . Then the hole closed upon jumbly pinkness  --  in fact , yes , to strange pink flowers . A word jumped up in his mind : antigravity . If this vehicle carried  | its own null-gravity field  --  possibly null-inertia too  --  that could explain the absence of any felt G-forces , and also his floating , dripping wet , surrounded by floating round drops of this wetness , in breathable perfumy air in a round , flattened room lined with live flowers . Claws stung his left hand like a dozen wasps : Miaow was terrified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she held on to him overtightly . In his sudden agony Paul flung off the soaking cat , and she shot twisting through the air and vanished with a puff of yellow-pink petals into a flowerbank . The next instant he was grabbed from behind and slammed flat on his back against a hard , satin-smooth surface that had somehow been somewhere in the omni-surrounding flowers . The thing that terrified him most was that the limb that snaked around his neck  --  a sleek , spring-strong , green-furred limb , barred with violet  --  had two elbows . With a whirling speed that did not allow his seeing it clearly , the green and violet tiger-thing worked at his out-flung wrists and ankles . Paws with claws of violet-gray pinched without stabbing ; once he felt the grip of something more like a snake . Then the thing kicked off from his side and dived into the flowerbank after Miaow . A long green violet-ringed tail , smoothly furred and tapering , vanished in a larger explosion of petals . He tried to push himself up from the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though still in null gravity , he was somehow gyved tautly to that same surface  --  as was next brought home to him most graphically when he looked straight up and saw not ten feet above him ( or below , or out to the side  --  he did n't know how to feel about it in null gravity ) a spread-eagled , wet-sand-specked , pale , wildly staring reflection of himself , backed by a dozen dimming reflections of reflections of the same ridiculous , poignant picture . The inner shape and decor of the saucer began to come clear to him . More than half the flowers he 'd seen had been reflections . Ceiling and floor were round , flat mirrors facing each other , about nine feet apart and twenty feet in diameter . He was spread-eagled near the center of one of them . The rim between the mirrors was luxuriant with exotic , thick-petaled flowers , large and small  --  pale yellow , pale blue , violet , magenta , but mostly pink and pinkish red . Seemingly live flowers , for there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were glimpses of twisting branches ?  | probably their hydroponic or whatever underpinnings filled much of the saucer 's tapered outside rim . But the triangularly cross-sectioned doughnut of the rim could n't be entirely filled with vegetation , for bowered in it beyond his fettered feet he now made out a silvery gray control panel  --  at any rate some sort of flat surface with smooth silvery excrescences and geometrical shapes limned on it . Straining his head around , he could see similar panels beyond each of his spread and outstretched arms , the three panels being situated relative to each other at the apices of an equilateral triangle incribed in the saucer , but each of them half hidden by the embowering flowers  --  very much as crassly functional objects such as heater and sink and phone and hi-fi might be masked in the small apartment of a modish and estheticallyminded woman . The whole was bathed in bright , warm , beachy light coming from . .. he could n't see where . An invisible indoor sun  --  most eerie . Eerier still and infinitely closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that his mind was being invaded and his memories and knowledge riffled through like so many decks of cards . He tritely recalled how a drowning man is supposed to relive his life in a few seconds , and he wondered if it applied when you drowned in flowers  --  or were crucified by a tiger preparatory to being torn apart and devoured . The sensations in his mind flashed so fast he could see and hear only blurs . They were his own private mental possessions , yet he was unable to note them as they flashed and faded  --  an ultimate humiliation ! A few images he was able to catch toward the end of this mental " customs search " showed an odd preoccupation with zoos and ballets . He looked around but could catch no glimpse of the tiger-thing or of Miaow . The invisible sun radiated on . The flower-banks were deathly still , exuding their perfumes . DONALD MERRIAM was midway in his third passage through the Wanderer 's shadow . To his right was the strange planet 's greenspotted night side , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahead lay the sheaf of stars , and to his left the black , everlengthening ellipsoid of the moon with the cobwebby black threads looping up from its nose against the thickly glittering background . He was beginning to feel tired and cold , and he 'd quit working the radio .  | A dim , yellowish point appeared against the Wanderer 's face , ahead , near the star-sheaf . It rapidly became a yellowish dash , horizontal to him , then a double dash with a little black stretch in the middle like the popular new fluorescent auto headlights , then two yellowish spindles that grew in size . Only then did Don realize that this was n't some sort of surface appearance on the Wanderer , but a material something  --  or two things  --  headed straight at the Baba Yaga . He flinched and blinked his eyes , and the next instant , without any gradual deceleration that he could note , the two yellow spindles had come to a dead stop to either side of the Baba Yaga and so close that the frame of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They looked to him now like two saucer-shaped spacecraft between thirty and fifty feet across and three or four yards thick . At least , he rather hoped they were spacecraft  --  and not , well , animals . His estimate of their shape was confirmed when , without any visible flash of vernier jets , they tilted toward him and became two yellow circles , one with a violet triangle inscribed in it , the other with a violet V , the legs of which stretched from center to rim . Then he felt his spacesuited body pushed gently backward as the Baba Yaga was drawn forward between its escorts  --  that was how he began to think of them  --  until only the forward edges of their rims showed in the spacescreen . They held position very precisely thereafter , as if they had locked onto his little moonship  --  and somehow onto his body too , a very strange sensation . The next thing he noticed was that the pale green spots were crawling down the Wanderer 's black rotundity as if they were so many phosphorescent sow-bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widening as the black ellipsoid of the moon dropped away . From all indications the Baba Yaga was being drawn upward by its escorts at about one hundred miles a second . Yet he had not felt an atom of the G-forces that ought to have been crushing him against his ship 's wall  --  or smashing him through it ! At no time in the past few hours , not even during his passage through the moon , had Don thought , This must be an hallucination . He thought it now . Acceleration and the price you paid for it in fuel and G-strains were the core of his professional knowledge . What was happening to his body and to the Baba Yaga now was not merely a monstrous intrusion of the unknown , it flatly contradicted everything he knew about spaceflight and its iron limitations . From  | five miles a second , Wanderer-relative , to one hundred at right angles to the first course , yet without feeling it , without even the hint of the firing of some main jet hotter than a blue star  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet the green spots continued to scuttle out of sight below and the star-sheaf to widen above , and suddenly the Baba Yaga burst into sunlight above the Wanderer . Reflected glare stabbed at his eyes from the lefthand side of the spacescreen frame and the yellow rim of his port escort . He squeezed his eyelids together , fumbled for the polarizing goggles , got them on , then opened his eyes and looked . The Baba Yaga , locked to its escorts , was still mounting up around the Wanderer at a fantastic velocity . The spacescreen swung a little to the right and , looking over the top of the planet , Don could see Earth , mostly Pacific Ocean now , and the glaring white sun which could sting his eyes even through the goggles . The planetary surface below him was night side , then a crescent of the day side , mostly yellow but with the far edge violet . Looping over and around him against star-speckled space were the white threads that came from the moon 's nose . Two of them were thicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and curved down toward the Wanderer 's north pole . There , close together but still separate , they seemed simply to join the planet 's velvet surface , some on the day side , some on the night side , a dozen or so of them in all . They looked now like weird , leafless vines sprouting from the top of the Wanderer . The Baba Yaga and its escorts were cannoning across the same spot . Then , just as it seemed that in the next second they must flash past the thickening stalks or crash into them , Don 's strongest convictions about spaceflight were once again battered as the Baba Yaga and its escorts lost most of their velocity in a tranquil instant and simultaneously headed straight down toward the black-andyellow rooting place of the stalks . Either his escorts had the inertia-less drive at which everyone but science-fiction writers scoffed , and were carrying the Baba Yaga in their null-G field , or he was hallucinating , or He turned to the control panel and tried for a radar fix on the surface below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were 320 miles above the surface and closing with it at ten miles a second . Automatically , he chorded the verniers to reverse the Baba Yaga 's  | altitude so as to be able to brake with what little main jet fuel he had left . The vernier jets did n't budge the Baba Yaga . Its spacescreen continued to face the planet below . And only now did he notice that they were plummeting down closely parallel to the day side of one of the threads that had become cords , then stalks . It looked enormous here , maybe a mile thick , its pale expanse filling a quarter of the spacescreen . But in fantastic perspective , like some exaggerated Frank Lloyd Wright pillar , thick toward the roof , thin toward the floor , it narrowed almost to a point where it met the planet 's night side very close to the daylight line . And looking at the pillar 's surface this close by , he could see that it was n't all smooth , but smooth stuff filled with jagged chunks ? surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed was being sucked up from the whirlpool-pits in the moon 's nose . The chunks moved slowly downward past him , like a train moving just a little faster along a parallel railway track . But that meant the whole pillar was hurtling downward at the same speed as the Baba Yaga  --  ten miles a second . Why was n't it exploding in a tremendous rock-spatter where it hit the Wanderer ? Suddenly the rocks in the pillar began to flash downward past him , then the whole pillar was blurred smooth  --  as if the train on the next track had become an express . Either the pillar had speeded up , or He radar-checked again . The altitude of the Baba Yaga and its escorts had shrunk to thirty miles , but now they were closing at only a mile a second . His second guess had hit it : they 'd slowed up . But they were n't slowing any more than that , the radar showed . He used the last twenty seconds in scanning the surface below for detail . There was n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemon velvet plain on the day side . The plunging rock-dust pillar kept its massive width beside them . Don was running out of seconds as they plunged into the Wanderer 's shadow . He whipped off his goggles . The leading rims of his escorts showed up with the same lemon phosphorescence they 'd shown behind the planet . For an instant he thought he saw them dully reflected in the black surface below . He nerved himself for the crash , and extinction . Then all at once the black surface was n't there , and , as if the Baba  | Yaga and its escorts had burst hurtlessly through the ceiling of a gigantic lamplit room , he was staring down at another surface far below . It had to be far below , because the down-rushing pillar of moon rock , still bulking vast to the side , narrowed almost to a point where it touched it and was changed by this fantastic foreshortening from a pillar to a moon-rock triangle . One inference seemed clear . All the surface of the Wanderer he 'd seen up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and radar so truly  --  the surface that had been yellow and violet on the day side , black with phosphorescent green spots on the night side ? was nothing more than a film , a film so thin and insubstantial that a frail spaceship like the Baba Yaga could burst through it at a mile a second without suffering the least shock or damage , a film roofing and concealing all the artificial daylight and true life of the Wanderer , a film stretched out everywhere about twenty miles above the true surface of the planet  --  if what he was gazing down at now was true surface and not some fresh illusion . It was true surface if complexity and every appearance of solidity were criteria . Below him , filling the spacescreen , stretched a vast , softly-lighted plain gleaming with lakes , or at least with smooth turquoise patches of some sort , a plain dotted with dusky , deeptwinkling circular pits a mile or more across , a plain that was otherwise crowded with all sorts of huge objects of every color and solidly geometric shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemispheres , ziggurats , multilobed rondures  --  not one object of which Don recognized except as an abstraction . Giant buildings , machines , vehicles , pure artistic forms ? They might have been any or all of those . Several comparisons flashed through his mind . The Japanese art of rock arrangement on a gigantic scale . Sciencefiction book covers of the sort that show an endless floor covered with abstract sculptures looking half alive . Then his thoughts went dipping far back into the mixed memories and pseudomemories of very early childhood , and he remembered being taken to visit his grandmother in Minneapolis , and the sour , dry smell of her great-ceilinged living room , and being lifted to look at  --  not to touch  --  the doors of a whatnot covered with what he had later assumed must have been cowrie shells , Chinese coins , paperweights , polished rock specimens , flowers in plastic  --  chaste  | knickknacks of many sorts , which had been utterly strange and meaningless though most fascinating to the baby Don Merriam . Now he was a baby again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not directly below , floated irregularly shaped , small dark clouds , each holding , as if it were a nest for rainbow eggs , a clutch of great glowing globes which shot upward light of all hues . These clouds began themselves to shoot up past him , reminding him that the Baba Yaga , its speed hardly diminished , was nearing the grandly crowded surface below . Similarly , the visible section of the plain was swiftly shrinking and the beautiful , unidentifiable shapes growing rapidly larger . But he felt no fear  --  hitting the film had exhausted all that . The Baba Yaga and its escorts were aimed at a point midway between two of the large pits , which lay so close together that at first they seemed to touch tangentially . Into one of these pits the rock pillar plunged . The other showed the dusky twinkling that seemed characteristic of all the open pits . At last the margin between the pits acquired a width , became a silvery ribbon . One of the escorts seemed to settle into the hurtling rock pillar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without the faintest shock or jar and with all the impossible feel of dream flying , the Baba Yaga came to a dead stop no more than a dozen feet above a dull silver pavement  --  so close to it , in fact , that Don could see designs etched on its surface : a whirlingly complex arabesque with bands of hieroglyphics . Still weightless , he hovered above the spacescreen and goggled down through it , feeling like a fish looking through a window in the floor of its aquarium . Then , as if a couple of verniers had been fired or a giant hand had grasped it , the Baba Yaga began to upend . Don grabbed at the pilot 's seat to steady himself . The motion stopped halfway around , when the ship 's main jet would be pointing at the pavement below . Gradually then a gravity field took hold of him and the ship . He heard three faint thumps and simultaneously felt three gentle jolts as the three legs of his ship footed themselves . He clutched the seat tighter as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a month on the moon , it was as much or almost as much as it had been on Earth . Then his weight stopped growing . But he noted these things with a lower fraction of his mind only ,  | for his main attention was absorbed by the view the spacescreen now gave him of the Wanderer 's sky  --  the underside of the film through which he had broken some forty seconds ago . Between him and it , the small dark clouds  --  darker now since he could no longer see the gleaming eggs they nested  --  sailed steadily past , much as small clouds move across the deserts of the American Southwest before a steady west wind , withholding their rain . At no time did they obscure more than an eighth of the sky , Nor did the down-rushing rock pillar , now tapering up to a point high as the sky itself , its triangle reversed , obscure more than another eighth . That sky was neither pale violet nor yellow , nor dead black anywhere , nor did it show any stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors , a dusky rainbow storm sky sweeping along in everchanging hues and curving patterns . It had the harmony and grandeur and menace of a perpetual color-symphony , yet it seemed natural , promising endless vital variations . Whether its light came mostly from itself , or from that thrown upward by the now-concealed globes on the clouds , or from some other indirect source , Don could not tell . It resembled somewhat the marbling of a film of oil on water , and somewhat Van Gogh 's wild painting , " The Starry Night , " and even more the deep , glinting hues that flow churningly past the mind 's eye in the dark . Just as he was thinking that last thought , which seemed to put him on the inside of some vast mind , he heard a tiny grating sound which chilled his blood . He looked down quickly enough to see the last of the dogs on the hatch move aside by itself and the hatch lift without visible agency , showing him the empty ladder moving down out of its housing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely sweet and cajoling , called to him in only slightly slurred English : " Come ! Unsuit yourself and come down ! " AUSTRALIA , Indonesia , the Philippines , Japan , and the eastern parts of China and Siberia had now swung into Earth 's night side . The Wanderer , often first seen as the yin-yang or the mandala , set religious and mystical strings vibrating in millions of minds . And East Asian voices were added to the American ones warning the cluster of skeptical old continents to the west  --  the world 's cultural heartland  --  of what they would see at nightfall .  | PAUL HAGBOLT had grown very tired of his bondage and peculiarly bored with his spread-eagled reflection , and the invisible sun had dried his front completely , when he spotted two cryptic cat faces peering at him from a stretch of flowerbank by the control panel beyond his feet . The one was Miaow 's , the other was large as his own . They came floating forward from the gloom , and their bodies after their faces with a sinuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spear , until they were barely emerged from the flowers  --  whereupon without further glance at him they settled themselves in the air facing each other , so that he saw them in profile . The tiger-being held out Miaow facing her , cradling the little gray cat on one spread paw and slim green secondary forearm ? Paul realized that the second elbow which had terrified him was simply the normal feline wrist above the elongated palm bones that make a secondary forearm above the paw . Miaow 's fur was now fluffy dry , and she lolled on her back , fantastically at ease , gray tail draped over violet-barred wrist , staring gravely into the great , violet-petalled eyes of her captor  --  or rather , her new friend , to judge from appearances . They looked remarkably like mother and tiny child . Paul 's feelings about the tiger-being , his very picture of her , underwent rapid changes as he watched her in repose  --  this time he thought of her from the first as " she , " an assumption bastioned by the apparent absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigo-ruddy nipples high in the green fur of her chest . For a feline , she was short-bodied , long-legged , long-armed  --  in build more like a cheetah than any other terrestrial cat , though considerably larger : human size . The general proportions , too , were more human than feline  --  he guessed that in gravity she would be at least as much biped as quadruped . The fur of her throat , chest , underbelly , and the insides of her arms and legs was green , the rest , green barred with violet .  | Her head was prick-eared as any cat 's , but with a higher and broader forehead , seeming to increase the triangularity of the whole face , which was nevertheless completely feline , even to indigo button-nose and pale whisker hairs . Here the fur was violet except for a green mask across the eyes . Despite the secondary forearms above them , the slim paws looked quite like hands now  --  three-fingered hands with an opposed thumb . The claws were invisible , presumably retracted and sheathed . The violet-barred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The total effect , he realized suddenly  --  even the tail ! ? was now very close to that of a slim , tall woman dressed in a skintight fur costume for some fantastic cat-ballet . He felt a disturbing pang as he had that thought . And just at that moment the tiger-being began to speak in English  --  clipped and exotically slurred , yet English nevertheless  --  not directing her speech toward him but to Miaow . It was all so " impossible " that Paul listened as if in a dream . " Come , little one , " the tiger-being said , poutingly parting only the two central inches of her mulberry lips . " We friends now . No need be shy . " Miaow continued to stare at her gravely , contentedly . " You me same folk , " the tiger-being continued winningly . " You easeful now , I feel . So speak . Ask question . " A pause , with Paul feeling on the verge of understanding the fantastic cross-purposes that had begun to operate . Then the tigerbeing said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know yours . Mine ? ? Tigerishka ! Name I invent especially for you . You think me terrible tiger , also beautiful toes dancer . Toes dancers call selves , - enska , - skaya , - ishka . ' Tigerishka ! " Then Paul understood . It was the super-error of a super-being . Tigerishka had been reading his thoughts to the point of learning his language in seconds , but all the while attributing those thoughts to her fellow-feline Miaow . At the same time he realized what the disturbing pang had been : plain male desire for a thrillingly attractive she-being . Tigerishka must have caught that thought , too , for she waved an indigo-padded finger at Miaow in playful reproof and said : " You have naughty feelings about me , little one . Really , you not big enough  --  and we both girls ! Come now , speak . . . Paul . . . "  | At that moment the presumably horrible truth must have occurred to her , for she slowly turned her head to stare at the real Paul , simultaneously toeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second she had sprung across the cabin and was poised above him , dagger-claws spread , mulberry lips writhed back from inchand-a-half needle canines in her upper jaw . She still held Miaow , who seemed not greatly startled by the sudden activity . Beyond her green slope-shoulder were stacked reflections of her back and of Paul 's own face grimacing madly . " You  --  ape ! " Tigerishka snarled . She thrust her great-jawed head down so that he winced his eyes three-quarters shut . Then , spacing out the words as one might to a barely literate peasant , she said : " You treat  --  little one  --  like beast  --  like pet ? " The horrified contempt in the last word was glacial-volcanic . All Paul could do in his frantic terror was snatch at something Margo was always saying , and gibber : " No ! No ! Cats are people ! " DON MERRIAM had stood on the rim of Earth 's Grand Canyon . He had also looked over the edge of the Leibnitz Cleft near the south pole of the moon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yaga through Luna  --  certainly never from a solid footing , had he peered into anything remotely as deep as the open , mile-wide circular pit that yawned only two dozen paces across the silver pavement from where the Baba Yaga stood with its ladder thrust down between its three legs . How far did the pit go down ? Five miles ? Twenty-five ? Five hundred ? It seemed to maintain its one-mile width indefinitely . The equivalent in emptiness of what the plunging pillar of moon rock was in solidity , it narrowed somewhere far below to a tiny , hazy round that was little more than a point  --  and that narrowing was only the consequence of the laws of perspective and the limitations of his visual powers . He toyed with the notion that the shaft went straight through the center of the planet to the other side , so that if he leaped off the edge now he would never hit bottom , but only fall four thousand miles or so  --  a weary fall , that , taking twenty hours at least , if terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth , almost time enough to die of thirst  --  and then , finally , perhaps after a few reverberations of reversed and re-reversed fall , come to rest in the air at the planet 's center and slowly swin to the side of the  | shaft , just as he 'd swum through the air of the Baba Yaga 's cabin in free fall . Of course the air pressure down there , four thousand miles down , would be more than enough to crush him  --  perhaps enough to drive oxygen monatomic ! ? but they would surely have ways of dealing with that , ways of making the air exactly as thin or as thick as they wanted it at every depth . Already he was doing a great deal of thinking in terms of their powers  --  powers which increased each time he turned his eyes , each time he thought , though he had yet to see a single one of them . The false memory of his childhood came again , of the pit he 'd found that went through the earth behind his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting for a star , or rather for a hint of the captive antipodean day under its section of vaulted sky-film eight thousand miles down there . But even as he hunted he knew it was a visual impossibility , and in any case it was made quite infeasible by the multitude of lights glowing , flashing , and twinkling from the sides of the shaft at every floor . For the strangest and most unnatural thing about the shaft was simply that it was unnatural , not something occurring in or driven through solid rock  --  in fact , there was no sign of rock anywhere ? but floor after floor , tiered endlessly downward , of artificial structure and habitable inner volume . The floors began after a blank hundred feet or so at the top and were never afterwards interrupted . He could count hundreds of those floors , he was sure , before they began to merge and run together , again due solely to the limitations of his vision . Yet judging by the ones toward the top , they were very tall , spacious floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scope , despite the , to him , claustrophobic feel of such a downward infinity of rooms and corridors . The only comparisons for it that he could dredge from his memory  --  and they were most inadequate comparisons  --  were the inner courts , tiered with balconies , of certain large department stores and office buildings , or perhaps a skylight shaft shooting down through the stacks of some vast unmicrofilmed old library . Far below now he thought he could see small airships winging across the shaft , and perhaps up and down it , like lazy beetles , and some of those seemed to twinkle too , like the phosphorescent beetles of the tropics . In his desire to peer deeper into the pit , he leaned out farther  | over it , gripping tightly with his bare hands the upper of two satinsmooth silver rails that fenced it . Even that simple feature of his surroundings was unnatural and indicative of their powers , for the rails had no supports . They were a pair of mile-wide , thin silver hoops hung two and a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , if there were invisible uprights , he had not yet touched or kicked into them . He could see only a couple of hundred yards of the hoops in either direction ; beyond that they vanished like telegraph wires . However , he assumed they went all the way around . But with so many signs of them down below , and evidences of their workmanship everywhere , their science and technology , so near magic , where were they ? Why had he been left alone so long ? He turned his back on the pit and peered all around him uneasily , but nowhere on the silver pavement nor about the smooth , windowless , geometric structures rising from it could he see a living figure , or any figure he judged might be living  --  humanoid , animal , or otherwise . The two violet-and-yellow , bulge-centered saucers still hung enigmatically a dozen feet above the pavement , just as when he 'd last turned his back on them , and the Baba Yaga stood midway between them , exactly as he 'd left it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice had called to him in its faintly slurred , oddly thrilling English , he had unsuited obediently , almost eagerly , and quickly climbed down out of the Baba Yaga , but there had been no one there . After waiting for minutes at the foot of the ladder , he had walked over to the pit and been enthralled . Now he began to wonder if the voice might n't have been pure illusion . It was unreasonable to think of an alien being able to speak English without any preliminary parleying . Or was it ? Their powers ... He took a deep breath . At least the air seemed real enough . The silence was profound , except that when he held still and relaxed and closed his eyes and let out his breath softly , he thought he could hear the faintest , muted , deep-throated rumbling . The blood of this strange planet , coursing ? Or only his own blood ? Or the rumbling might come from the pillar of moon rock hurtling into the other pit , no farther beyond the Baba Yaga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of them . The gray pillar , occupying a full third of his horizon but tapering swiftly almost to a point at the top of the sky , looked at first glance like a solid mountain , except that he knew it was plunging steadily  | downward at a speed great enough to make its component particles and fragments individually invisible  --  presumably the same ten miles a second at which he 'd judged it to be moving above the skyfilm that roofed the atmosphere . As he watched the pillar , he began to see slow changes in its contours  --  bulgings and channelings that formed slowly and held their shape for many seconds and then shifted into other smooth forms . It reminded him of the grotesque bulgings and groovings that a stream from a faucet will hold  --  sometimes so persistently that the shape seems to be one of solid crystal rather than rushing water . But how could the thing be moving at such a supersonic velocity ? two seconds from the sky to the floor ! ? through the palpable air ? the air he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? without creating a fierce and tumultuous dust storm of eddies in that air , without a roar like that of a dozen first-stage rockets or a score of Niagaras ? They must , somehow , perhaps using an unheard-of field , have created a wall-less vacuum channel , just as surely as they must have created  --  now he came to think of it  --  similar wall-less tubular vacua for the Baba Yaga and its escorts to travel through after they burst the sky-film . . . and , even before that , through the thin plasma and micrometeorites of space . He continued to stare up the weirdly foreshortened gray pillar . How long could this monstrous transfer go on ? How long would the moon last , even as an ellipsoid of pale gravel spreading into a ring , at this rate of depletion ? How long would there be any moon-stuff left outside the Wanderer ? From the sector of his brain schooled in engineering and solid geometry sprang almost at once the first-approximation answer , that it would take eight thousand days for one such rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon 's entire substance . He had seen only a dozen of the rock streams . But they might speed up the streams , and there might be another set at the Wanderer 's south pole , and others being brought into existence . Looking aside from the pillar , he now did see three more in the distance : they looked like great gray waterspouts twisting up toward the sky . The sky was now all dark blues and greens and browns , slowly swirling in a great edge-blended river , austere and menacing . He looked down toward the paler structures ringing the empty silver  | pavement except where the pits were ; he let his gaze travel around the pillar-broken circle of those smoothly monstrous , multiform , pastel-shaded solidities , and it seemed to him that some of the more distant ones had changed position and shape and in some cases crept closer  --  since he 'd last studied them . The idea of great buildings  --  or whatever they were  --  moving about when there were no other signs of life disturbed him greatly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scan its topmost levels , almost desperately , for indications of some smallerscale activity . He tried to look at the top floors immediately below him , or close to either side , but the silver lip on which he was standing overlapped the pit itself for several yards like a roof and cut off his view . So he peered across at the topmost windows and balconies , and after a while he began to think he could see small figures moving in them , but at a mile or even a half mile it was n't easy to be sure of that , and anyway his eyes were beginning to swim and prickle . He was wondering whether he dared return to the cabin for the binoculars  --  when a voice , sweet-toned yet commanding , spoke from behind him . " Come ! " Don turned around very slowly . Standing a little taller than himself , not twenty feet away , with the erect grace and pride of a matador , was a lean , silky , red-splotched black biped of shape midway between feline and anthropoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a mountain lion and standing as a man stands , or like a slim , black-furred , red-pied tiger wearing a black turban and a narrow red mask  --  the turban being the unfeline frontal and temporal bulge . Its tail rose like a red spear behind its back . Its ears were pointed . Its serene eyes were large , with something flowerlike about the pupils . Hardly shifting its close-set , narrow feet , yet with movements like those of a dancer , it extended a four-fingered arm in a gesture of invitation , and opened the thin lips in the black lower mask , showing the needle-tips of white fangs , and softly repeated : " Come . " Slowly , as if in a dream , Don moved toward the being . When he had come close , it nodded , and then the section of pavement on which they were both standing  --  a circular silver section about eight feet across  --  began very slowly to sink into the body of the Wanderer . The being moved its extended arm until it rested lightly across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending to Hell . Faust had wanted all knowledge . With his  | magic mirrors Mephistopheles had given Faust a glimpse of everything . But what magic device can give understanding ? They had sunk barely knee-deep in the pavement when there was a flash in the sky . Suddenly beyond the Baba Yaga there hung a third saucer , and a ship so like the Baba Yaga that Don 's throat tightened , and he thought of Dufresne . But then he saw the small differences in structure and the red Soviet star on it . His view of it was cut off by the silver curve of the pavement as the platform continued to descend . WHILE A VERY FEW HUMAN BEINGS made thrilling and terrifying direct contact with the Wanderer and its denizens , and while a number more studied it with the magnifying and mensurating eyes of science , most of mankind knew the newcome planet only by its naked-eye visage and by the destruction it did . The first installment of destruction was volcanic and diastrophic . The tides , or tidal strains , set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those in the ocean layer . Within six hours after the Wanderer 's appearance , there had been major activity all along the great earthquake belts circumscribing the Pacific Ocean and stretching along the northern shore of the Mediterranean into the heart of Asia . Land was riven ; cities were shaken and shattered . Volcanoes glowed , spouted , and gushed redly . A few exploded . Shocks originated as far apart as Alaska and the Antarctic , many of them occurring undersea . Great tsunami ranged across the oceans , monstrous long swells turning to giant , watery fists on reaching the shallows . Hundreds of thousands died . Nevertheless there were many areas , even near the sea , where all this wrecking and reaving was only a rumor or a newspaper headline , or perhaps a voice on the radio during those hours of grace before the Wanderer peered over the horizon and poisoned the radio sky .  | RICHARD HILLARY had dozed through much of Berks , with no memory of Reading at all , and was only now beginning slowly to wake as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told himself it was n't so much last night 's walking that had tired him  --  he was a great walker  --  as Dai Davies ' literary ranting . Now it was about noon , and the bus was approaching the tideway of the Thames and the dark , smoky loom of London . Richard drew up the shade at last and began a melancholy but not unpleasant rumination about the curses of industrialism , overpopulation , and overconstruction . " You 've been missing it , mate , " said a short man in a bowler hat , who had taken the seat beside him . On Richard 's polite though tepid inquiry , he gladly summarized . During the last quarter of a day there had been a considerable number of earthquakes throughout the world  --  apparently a seismologist had counted squiggles on a drum and decreed : " Utterly unprecedented ! " ? and as a result earthquake waves were a possibility even along British shores : small craft warnings had been posted and a few low coastal areas were being evacuated . Several scientists , presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prospect , but such exaggerations had been sternly repudiated by responsible authorities . People with proofreader minds joyously pointed out that to confuse tsunami with tides was an ancient popular error . At least the earthquake hullabaloo had knocked the giant American saucer out of the news . Though , to balance that gain , Russia was making bomb-rattling protestations about a mysterious assault , successfully beaten off , on her precious lunar base . Not for the first time , Richard reflected that this age 's vaunted " communications industry " had chiefly provided people and nations with the means of frightening to death and simultaneously boring to extinction themselves and each other . He did not inform his seatmate of this insight , but instead turned to the window as the bus slowed for Brentford , surveying that town with his novelist 's eyes , and was rewarded almost at once by a human phenomenon describable as " a scurry of plumbers " : he counted three small cars with the insignia of that trade and five men with toolbags or big wrenches , hurrying places . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bus stopped , not far from the market and the confluence of the canalized Brent with the Thames . Two women climbed in , the  | one saying loudly to the other : " Yes , I just rang up Mother at Kew and she 's dreadfully upset . She says the lawn is afloat . " It happened quite suddenly then : an up-pooling of brown water from the drains in the street , and a runneling of equally dirty water from the entries of several buildings . The event struck Richard with peculiar horror because , at a level almost below conscious thought , he saw it as sick , overfed houses discharging , quite independently of the human beings involved with them , the product of their sickness . Architectural diarrhea . He was n't thinking at all of how the first sign of a flood is often the backing up of the sewers . And then there was a scamper of people , and at their heels a curbto-curb rush of cleaner water , perhaps six inches deep , down the street , washing away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Thames . The tidy Thames , Spenser 's " Sweete Themmes . " THE SECOND AND LARGER installment of destruction was delivered by the Wanderer through the seas covering almost three-quarters of Earth 's surface . This watery film may be cosmically trivial , but it has always been a sort of infinity , of distance and of depth and of power , to the dwellers of Earth . And it has always had its gods : Dagon , Nun , Nodens , Ran , Rigi , Neptune , Poseidon . And the music of the seas is the tides . The harp of the seas , which Diana the moon goddess strums with rapt solemnity , is strung with bands of salt water miles thick , hundreds of miles wide , thousands of miles long . Across the great reaches of the Pacific and Indian Oceans stretch the bass strings ; from the Philippines to Chile , from Alaska to Colombia , Antarctica to California , Arabia to Australia , Basutoland to Tasmania . Here the deeper notes are sounded , some vibrations lasting a full day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tempo is quicker and more regular , and the half-day the measure : the familiar , semidaily tides of Western history . Major vibrating bands link Newfoundland to Brazil , Greenland to Spain , South Africa to the Antarctic . Where the strings cross they may damp each other out , as at the tidal nodes near Norway and the Windward Islands and at Tahiti , where the sun alone controls the little tides  --  far-distant Apollo  | plucking feebler than Diana , forever bringing highs at noon and midnight , lows at sunset and dawn . The treble of the ocean harp is provided by tidal echoes and reechoes in bays , estuaries , straits , and seas half landlocked . These shortest strings are often loudest and fiercest , as a violin will dominate a bass viol : the high-mounting tides of Fundy and the Severn Estuary , of Northern France and the Strait of Magellan , of the Arabian and Irish Seas . Touched by the soft fingers of the moon , the water bands vibrate gently  --  a foot or two up and down , five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now the harp of the seas had been torn from Diana 's and Apollo 's hands and was being twanged by fingers eighty times stronger . During the first day after the Wanderer 's appearance the tides rose and fell five to fifteen times higher and lower than normally and , during the second day , ten to twenty-five , the water 's response swiftly building to the Wanderer 's wild harping . Tides of six feet became sixty ; tides of thirty , three hundred  --  and more . The giant tides generally followed the old patterns  --  a different harpist , but the same harp . Tahiti was only one of the many areas on Earth  --  not all of them far inland  --  unruffled by the presence of the Wanderer , hardly aware of it except as a showy astronomic spectacle . The coasts contain the seas with walls which the tides themselves help bite out . In few places are the seas faced with long sweeps of flat land where the tide each day can take miles-long strides landward and back : the Netherlands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Northwest Africa . But there are many flat coasts only a few feet or a few dozen feet above the ocean . There the multiplied tides raised by the Wanderer moved ten , twenty , fifty , and more miles inland . With great heads of water behind them and with narrowing valleys ahead , some moved swiftly and destructively , fronted and topped by wreckage , filled with sand and soil , footed by clanking stones and crashing rocks . At other spots the invasion of the tide was silent as death . At points of sharp tides and sharp but not very high coastal walls ? Fundy , the Bristol Channel , the estuaries of the Seine and the Thames and the Fuchun  --  spill-overs occurred : great mushrooms of water welling out over the land in all directions . Shallow continental shelves were swept by the drain of low tides , their sands cascaded into ocean abysses . Deep-sunk reefs and is-  | lands appeared ; others were covered as deeply . Shallow seas , and gulfs like the Persian , were drained once or twice daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isthmi . Counties and countries of fertile fields were salt-poisoned . Herds and flocks were washed away . Homes and towns were scoured flat . Great ports were drowned . Despite the fog of catastrophe and the suddenness of the astronomic strike , there were prodigies of rescue performed : a thousand Dunkirks , a hundred thousand brave improvisations . Disaster-focused organizations such as coast guards and the Red Cross functioned meritoriously ; and some of the preparations for atomic and other catastrophe paid off . Yet millions died . Some saw disaster coming and were able to take flight and did . Others , even in areas most affected , did not . DAI DAVIES strode across the mucky , littered bottom-sands of the Severn Estuary through the dissipating light fog with the furious energy and concentration of a drunkard at the peak of his alcoholic powers . His clothes and hands were smeared where he 'd twice slipped and fallen , only to scramble up and pace on with hardly a check . From time to time he glanced back and corrected his course when he saw his footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a flat bottle without breaking his stride . The Somerset shore had faded long since , except for the vaguest loom through the remaining mist of maritime industrial structures upriver toward Avonmouth . Long since there had died away the insincere cheers and uncaring admonitions ? " Come back , you daft Welshman , you 'll drown ! " ? of the pub-mates he 'd met this morning . He chanted sporadically : " Five miles to Wales across the sands , from noon to two while the ebb tide stands , " occasionally varying it with such curses as " Effing loveless Somersets ! ? I 'll shame ' em ! " and " Damned moon-grabbing Yanks ! " and such snatches of his halfcomposed Farewell to Mona as , " Frore Mona in your meteor-skiff .. . Girlglowing , old as Fomalhaut . . . Trailing white fingers in my pools . . . Drawing my waters to and fro .... " There was a faint roaring ahead . A helicopter ghosted by , going downriver , but the roaring remained . Dai crossed a particularly slimy dip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be jerked plopping out . He decided it must be Severn channel and that he  | was now mounting onto the great sandy stretch of bottom known as the Welsh Grounds . But the roaring grew louder ; the going got easier because the sands were sloping down again ; a last mist-veil faded ; and suddenly his way was blocked by a rapid , turbid river more than a hundred yards wide , humping into foam-crested ridges and eating greedily at the sandy banks to either side . He stopped in stupefaction . It had simply never occurred to him that , no matter how low the tide went , the Severn was a river and would keep flowing . And now he knew he could n't have come a quarter of the way across the Channel . Upstream he could see an angry white humping and jetting where  --  to be sure ! ? the Avon came crashing into the bigger river . Far downstream loomed the canted stern of a steamer aground . The ' copter hovered over it . There were faint hootings . He leaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his feet . Nevertheless he bravely stripped off his coat , since swimming seemed in order , stopping midway to get out the bottle . Through the near water a splintered black beam with laths nailed across it went slashing downstream like a great , hook-bladed knife . He put the bottle to his lips . It was empty . He shivered and shook . Suddenly he saw himself as an ant with the ambitions of a Napoleon . Fear closed in . He looked behind him . His footprints had smoothed to barely distinguishable hollows and bumps . And there was a glisten of water all over the sands that had n't been there before . The tide had turned . He threw away the bottle and began to run back along his footprints before they faded altogether . His feet sank in deeper than they had in coming . JAKE LESHER thumbed a light switch back and forth , although he 'd had proof enough that the electricity was gone . He studied the elevator in the dimness of the living room . The cage had dropped six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its aluminum looked rippled in the shadows . He thought he saw black threads curling out of it , and he retreated from them into the murky sunshine of the patio . " There 's more smoke coming out now , and I can see some flames , " Sally Harris called to him from where she was craning over the balustrade . " The flames are coming up the building , and people  | are watching them from the windows across , but the water 's coming up faster  --  I think . It 's a race . Gee , Jake , this is a flood like in the Bible , and Hugo 's penthouse is our Noah 's Ark . That 's the idea we 'll build our play around . We 'll use the fire , too . " He grabbed and shook her . " This is all for real , you little moron ! We 're the ones that 'll be fried . " " But Jake , " she protested , " you always got to have a real situation to make a play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the senses and minds of very many people were locked against the change in the tides . Those inland were inclined to doubt or minimize what they could not see with their own eyes , and many of them had never seen an ocean . Men at sea , beyond sight of land , can not perceive the tidal bulge beneath them  --  they can hardly perceive the vastly shorter earthquake waves  --  and so they could not note if that tidal bulge in which their ship moved were a few feet or a few dozen feet higher than it should be , or the tidal hollow , correspondingly lower . The insurgents who had seized the " Prince Charles " had so much to do what with running the internal business of the great atomic liner , dealing with passengers , and heading off attempts on the part of the crew to turn the tables , that they found it necessary to elect four of themselves captain , with equal powers . It was hours before this revolutionary board of directors got the ship 's course shaped toward Cape St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have overthrown the government last night  --  something which could not be confirmed because of the choking-off of radio communication . The imprisoned Captain Sithwise 's urgent plea that they atom-steam for the tidal node by the Windward Isles was laughed at as an obvious ruse to bring them nearer ships of the British Navy . Wolf Loner watched the great cloudbank close down around the " Endurance " until the dory was almost running through fog . In that tiny , ship-centered cosmos of water and blurry whiteness , the old fancies occurred to him that all the rest of the world might have vanished except for this one spot , or that there might be an atomic war now , with cities vanishing like coals that pop in a fire , or that a plague of virulent , artificially cultured germs might be sweeping all the continents and he be the only man alive when he stepped ashore in Boston . He smiled unanxiously . " Brace yourself against your atoms , " he said . But many minds were locked to facts that came pounding at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fritz Scher explained away to his own satisfaction , and almost to that of Hans Opfel , every shockingly divergent tidal reading that came in . Either there was a precedent for the new reading  --  such a tide had occurred at the same spot forty or four hundred years ago  --  or the waters were being bulked by a storm the purblind weather men had missed ; or someone of known carelessness had misread instruments ; or someone of known instability had gone crazy ; or someone of known Communist sympathies had lied . " Just you wait , " Fritz smilingly told Hans Opfel when the latter indicated the growing pile of reports of the Wanderer and of the moon 's destruction . " Just you wait . When night comes , the jolly old moon will be up there all by himself  --  and laughing down at you ! " He leaned lightly against the smooth case of the tide-predicting machine and patted it affectionately , almost hugged it . " You know what fools they are , do n't you ? " he murmured infatuatedly . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last fragments of egg and sausage with a section of buttermilk pancake soaking in one hundred percent maple syrup , pushed her coffee cup across the big kitchen table to Hester , and sighed her appreciation and gratitude . Outside the birds were warbling in the sunlight . The big old pendulum wallclock said eight-thirty in Roman numerals . A big calendar showing a view of the Everglades hung below the clock . Hester smiled broadly at Barbara as she poured out more of the wonderfully strong coffee , and said : " Seems more natural and wholesome-like , now old KKK got himself a real fancy girl instead of that doll . " Helen , the younger colored woman , giggled and then looked away in mischief and embarrassment , but Barbara took it in her stride . " I believe those are called Barbie dolls , " she remarked . " Well , my name happens to be Barbara , too  --  Barbara Katz . " Hester laughed heartily at that , and Helen smothered more giggles . " Why do you call him old KKK ? " Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Knolls Kelsey Kettering III . You Katz the fourth K. " And she started laughing again . There was a long , soft creaking . " Shut the screen door , Benjy , " Hester said sharply out of her laughter , but the tall Negro did n't li  | move . He stood halfway through the door in his white shirt and his silver-gray trousers which had stripes of dark gray tape running down the seams . There was a big tuft of cotton in the top of the screen  --  a modern white fetish against flies . " There 's the most monstrous low tide ever , " he informed them earnestly . " People walking straight out like they could get to Grand Bahama without wetting the ankle . Picking up fresh fish by the basket , some of them ! " Barbara sat straight up , set down her coffee cup and snapped her fingers . " Other folk TV ai n't working either  --  or radio , " Benjy added , looking at her , as did Hester and Helen . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked intently . " Seven-thirty , about , " Benjy answered without hesitation . " Hour ago . It have it all on the backs of those calendar sheets . " " Tear off the top one , " she told him . " What kind of a car does Mr. K have ? " " Only the two Rolls , " he told her . " Limousine and sedan . " " Get the sedan ready for a long trip , " she told him sharply . " All the extra gas she can carry  --  take it from the limousine ! We 'll need blankets , too , and all Mister K 's medicines and lots of food and more of this coffee in thermos jugs . . . and a couple of those table-water bottles in the corner ! " They stared at her fascinatedly . Her excitement was contagious , but they were puzzled . " Why for , child ? " Hester demanded . Helen started to giggle again . Barbara looked at them impressively , then said : " Because there 's a high tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and higher ! " " That because of the  --  Wanderer ? " Benjy asked , handing her the sheet she 'd asked for . She nodded decisively as she studied its back . She said : " Mr. K has a smaller telescope . Where would that be ? " " Telescope ? " Hester asked with grinning incredulity . She said : " Now , why for  --  oh , sho , astronomy what you and Mr. K have in common . Now , I expect he put that one  --  the one he spy on the gals with  --  back in the gun room . " " Gun room ? " Barbara asked , her eyes brightening . " What about ready cash ? " " It 'd be in one of the wall safes , " Hester said , frowning at Barbara just a little .  | THE SAUCER STUDENTS were at last beginning to feel alive again after their ducking and their exhausting race with the waves . The men had built a driftwood fire beside the empty highway near the low concrete bridge at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it , which necessitated considerable comradely trading around of clothes and of the unwetted blankets and stray articles of dress from the truck . Rama Joan cut down the trousers of her salt-streaked evening clothes to Bermuda shorts , ruthlessly chopped off the tails and half the arms of the coat , replaced the ruined dicky and white tie with the green scarf of her turban , and gathered her red-gold hair in a pony tail . Ann and Doc admired her . Everybody looked pretty battered . Margo noticed that Ross Hunter appeared trimmer than the other men , then realized it was because , while most of them were getting slightly stubbly cheeks and chins , he simply still had the beard that had made him Beardy . As the sky blued and brightened , their spirits rose and it became just a bit hard to think that all of last night had actually happened , and that a violet and gold planet was at this moment terrorizing Japan , Australia , and the other islands of the half-planet-spanning Pacific Ocean . But they could see a monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Doc pointed out the wreckage of the beach house and the platform lodged against the gleaming fence of Vandenberg Two , little more than a mile away . " Still , " he said , " humanity 's skepticism about its own experiences grows like mushrooms . How about another affidavit for us all to sign , Doddsy ? " " I 'm keeping a journal of events in waterproof ink , " the Little Man retorted briskly . " It 's open to inspection at any time . " He took his notebook and slowly riffled the pages to emphasize that point . " If anyone 's memory of events differs from mine , I 'll be happy to  | make a note of that  --  providing he 'll initial the divergent recollection . " Wojtowicz , staring down over the Little Man 's shoulder , said : " Hey , Doddsy , some of those pictures you got of the Wanderer do n't look right to me . " " I smoothed out the details and made them quite diagrammatic , " the Little Man admitted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life . But if you want to make some memory pictures of the new planet  --  and initial them ! ? you 're welcome to put them in the book . " " Not me , I 'm no artist , " Wojtowicz excused himself grinningly . " You 'll be able to check up tonight , Wojtowicz , " Doc said . " Jeeze , do n't remind me ! " the other said , clapping his hand to his eyes and doing a little comedy stagger . Only the Ramrod remained miserable , sitting apart on the wide bridge-rail and staring hungrily out toward the sea 's rim where the Wanderer had set . " She chose him , " he muttered wonderingly . " I believed , yet I was passed over . He was drawn into the saucer . " " Never mind , Charlie , " said Wanda , laying her plump hand on his thin shoulder . " Maybe it was n't the Empress but only her handmaiden , and she got the orders mixed . " " You know , that was truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wojtowicz said to the others . " Just one thing about it  --  are you sure you saw Paul pulled up into it ? I do n't like to say this , but he could have been sucked out to sea , like almost happened to several of us . " Doc , Rama Joan , and Hunter averred they 'd seen it with their own eyes . " I think she was more interested in the cat than Paul , " Rama Joan added . " Why so ? " the Little Man asked . " And why ' she ' ? " Rama Joan shrugged . " Hard to say , Mr. Dodd . Except she looked like a cat herself , and I did n't notice any external sex organs . " " Neither did I , " Doc confirmed , " though I wo n't say I was peering for them at the time with lewd avidity . " " Do you think the saucer actually had an inertialess drive  --  like E. E. Smith 's bergenholms or something ? " Harry McHeath asked Doc . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was jumping around . In a situation like this , science fiction is our only guide . On the other hand ? " Margo took advantage of everyone being engrossed in the con-  | versation to fade back between the bushes in the direction the other women had taken earlier on their bathroom trips . She climbed over a small ridge beside the wash and came out on a boulder-strewn , wide earth ledge about twenty feet above the beach . She looked around her . She could n't see anyone anywhere . She took out from under her leather jacket the gray pistol that had fallen from the saucer . It was the first chance she 'd had to inspect it closely . Keeping it concealed while she 'd dried her clothes had been an irksome problem . It was unburnished gray  --  aluminum or magnesium , by its light weight  --  and smoothly streamlined . There was no apparent hole in the tapering muzzle for anything material to come out . In front of the trigger-bump was an oval button . The grip seemed shaped for two fingers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , away from her palm as she held it in her right hand , was a narrow vertical strip that shone violet five-eights of its length up , rather like a recessed thermometer . She gripped the gun experimentally . Just beyond the end of the muzzle she noted a boulder two feet wide sitting on the rim of the ledge . Her heart began to pound . She pointed the gun at the boulder and tapped the trigger . Nothing happened . She pressed it a little harder , then a little harder than that , and suddenly  --  there was no recoil , but suddenly the boulder was shooting away , and a threefoot bite of ledge with it , to fall almost soundlessly into the sand a hundred feet off , though some of the sand there whooshed up and flew on farther . A breeze blew briefly from behind her . A little gravel rattled down the slope . She took a gasping breath and a big swallow . Then she grinned . The violet column did n't look much shorter , if any . She put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notch tighter . A thoughtful frown replaced her grin . She climbed back over the top of the ridge , and there on the other side was Hunter , his whiskers showing copper hairs among the brown in the sun 's rays just topping the hills . " Professor Hunter ! " she said . " I did n't think you were that sort of man . " " What sort ? " he asked her , perhaps smiling , but the beard made that hard to tell . " Why , to follow a girl when she 's on private business . " He simply looked at her , and she smoothed her blonde hair .  | " Are n't you used to the frank interest of men ? Sexual or otherwise , " he asked blandly . Then , " Fact is , I thought I heard a little landslide . " " A rock did roll down to the beach , " she said , stepping past him , " but the noise could n't have carried far . " " It carried to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't you take that jacket off ? It 's getting hot . " " I could think of subtler approaches , " she told him a bit acidly . " So could I , " he assured her . " I guess you could , " she agreed after a moment . Then stopping at the foot of the ridge : " Ross , name a leading scientist , physicist especially , Nobel Prize caliber , who 's got real wisdom for humanity ? ... Moral integrity , but vision and compassion , too . " " That 's quite a question , " he said . " Well , there 's Drummond , there 's Stendhal  --  though he 's hardly a physicist  --  and Rosenzweig ... and of course there 's Morton Opperly . " " That 's the name I wanted you to say , " she told him . DAI DAVIES pounded on the frame of the diamond-paned door of the tiny pub near Portishead . His knees knocked together ; his face was greenish pale ; his hair , straight , plastered-down black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been covered with mud from his falls except that it had been scoured off by the swim he 'd had to make of the last hundred yards of his retreat back across Bristol Channel . And he was at the very end of his ebbing , drunken strength  --  if it had taken another dozen flailing overarm strokes and convulsive kicks , he 'd never have made it to shore , he knew , out of the wild , foamy flood tide surging up-Severn . He needed alcohol , ethanol , spirits of wine ! ? as a bleeding man in shock needs a transfusion . Yet for some reason the filthy Somersets had locked the door and hidden themselves  --  doubtless simply to thwart him , out of pure , mean , Welsh-hating , poet-despising cruelty , for these were open hours . By suffering Christ , he 'd have the law on them for locking the place ! He pressed his face to the lead-netted small panes to spy them out in their cowardly holes , but the shadowy taproom was empty , the lights were all out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest for warmth , and hoarsely screeched up and down the road : " Where are you all ? Come out ! Come out , somebody ! " But not a soul showed himself , not a single house door opened , not even one loveless white sheface peered out a window . He was all alone .  | He went trembling back to the pub door , grabbed the frame with both hands to steady himself , managed to lift a cramped leg , and kicked a short , convulsive kick with his heel . Three panes cracked and fell inside . He got his leg down , then he crouched against the door and thrust his arm through to the shoulder and reached around , found the lock , and worked it . The door opened , and he stumbled inside , retrieving his arm from the glass jagged leaden web , then took four steps toward the bar , and stood wavering in the middle of the room , almost fainting . And then as he swayed there gasping , and his eyes got used to the dimness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brimful . Suddenly it was the finest thing in the world that he should be all alone at this moment ; it was the fulfillment of an old , old dream . He did not mind the faint roar behind him or glance once over his shoulder through the broken door at the Bristol Channel filling in dirty , low , foam-edged , flotsam-studded steps . He had eyes only for the amber and greenish , charmingly labeled bottles ranged on the shelves behind the bar . They were like treasured books to him , founts of all wisdom , friends of the lonely , a lovely library to be forever sampled and savored and of which he could never tire . And as he approached them with loving deliberation , smiling a wide smile , he began softly and liltingly to read their titles from their spines : " Old Smuggler . . . by Richard Blackmore . Teachers , by C. P. Snow . The Black and the White , by Stendhal . White Horse , by G. K. Chesterton . . . GENERAL SPIKE STEVENS sloshed through cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was welling more strongly every moment , making the metal door groan . A flashlamp strapped to his chest shone on the thigh-deep water and on a wall papered with historic battle scenes . Three more flashlamps came up behind him " . . . like we were a bunch of damn musical comedy burglars , " Colonel Griswold had put it . The general felt around the wall , dug his fingers through the paper , and jerked open  --  the paper tearing  --  a light , two-footsquare door , revealing a shallow recess with nothing but a big black lever-handle in it . He faced the others . " Understand , " he said rapidly , " I only know the entrance to the escape shaft . I do n't know where it comes out any more than you do , because I 'm not supposed to know where we  | are and I do n't . We 'll hope it leads up into some sort of tower , because we know we 're about two hundred feet below ground and that somehow there 's some salt water up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open it . " He turned and dragged down on the lever . Colonel Mabel Wallingford was standing just behind him , Colonel Griswold and Captain Kidley a few feet back . The lever budged a quarter inch and stuck . He dragged down on it with both hands until he was only knee-deep in the water . Colonel Mab reached up and put her hands beside his and chinned herself . Griswold called : " Wait ! If it 's jammed , it means ? " The lever dropped eight inches . Three feet away , wallpaper tore along a right angle as a door two feet wide and five feet high opened , and a black bolster of water came out and bowled over Captain Kidley and Colonel Griswold  --  Colonel Mab saw the Tatter 's lamp pushed deeper and deeper . The solid water kept coming , a great thick ridge of it . It grabbed at the feet of Colonel Mab and the general . They clung to the lever . MARGO AND CLARENCE DODD were leaning their elbows on the upper rail of the concrete bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diluted smoke that was moving up from the south and turning the sun red , giving its light an ominous brassy cast . She 'd come here chiefly to get away from Ross Hunter . " It could be only brush fires in the canyons and mountains , " the Little Man said . " But I 'm afraid it 's more than that , Miss Gelhorn . You live in Los Angeles ? " " I rent a cottage in Santa Monica . Same thing . " " Any family there ? " " No , just myself . " " That 's good , at least . I 'm afraid , unless we get rain ? " " Look , " she said , glancing down . " There 's water in the wash now ! Does n't that mean there 's rain inland ? "  | But just then , with a triumphant tooting of horns , Hixon 's truck came rolling back from a reconnoiter down the coast , followed by a short , blocky yellow school bus . The two vehicles stopped on the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying one of the army rifles . Doc came after him , but stopped on the stepdown platform , which made a convenient rostrum . " I am pleased to announce that I 've found us transportation , " he called out loudly and jovially . " I insisted on looking into Monica Mountainway , and there , in a little vale not one hundred yards off the highway , I discovered this charming bus waiting to begin its morning chore , which today will be carrying us ! It 's all gassed up and plentifully stocked with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and irradiated , fluoridated milk . Prepare for departure in five minutes , everyone ! " He stepped down and came swinging around the yellow hood . " Doddsy , that 's not rainwater in that wash there , that 's salt tide  --  just look over the other side of the bridge and you 'll see it stretching out in one gleaming sheet to China . Times like this , things creep up on people . You 've got the other gun , Doddsy  --  you ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse Ray Hanks . I 'll command the bus . " " Mr. Brecht , " Margo said . " Are you planning to take us over Monica Mountainway to the Valley ? " " Part way at any rate . To the two-thousand-foot heights , if I can . After that . . . " He shrugged " Mr. Brecht , " she went on , " Vandenberg Three is just the other end of the Mountainway . On the slopes , in fact . Morton Opperly 's there , in charge of the pure science end of the Moon Project . I think we should try to contact him . " " Say , that 's not a bad idea , " Doc told her . " He ought to be showing more sense than the V-2 brass , and he might welcome some sane recruits . It 's a sound idea that we cluster around the top scientists in this para-reality situation . However , God knows if we 'll ever get to V-3 , or if Opperly will still be there if we do , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Margo said . " All I ask is that if there 's a chance to contact him , you help me . I 've a special reason which is extremely important but which I ca n't explain now . " Doc looked at her shrewdly , then grinned . " Sure thing , " he promised , as Hunter and some of the others closed in on him with other questions and suggestions . Margo boarded the bus at once and took the seat behind the  | driver . He was a scowly old man with a jaw so shallow she wondered if he had teeth . " It 's very good of you to help us out this way , " she remarked . " You 're telling me ? " he retorted , looking around at her incredulously and flashing some yellowed , stumpy incisors and scattered , black , amalgam-roofed molars . " He told me , " he went on , jerking a thumb at Doc just outside the door , " about this **26;113;TOOLONG tide that would drown me if I did n't get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then he told me I need n't strain myself making up my mind whether to take you folks too , because he had a guy with a gun . Good o ' me ? I just had no choice . Besides , " he added , " there was a big slide blocking off my regular route south . Might as well throw in with you crazy folks . " Margo laughed self-consciously . " You 'll get used to us , " she said . At that moment the Ramrod came shouldering into the bus , calling back to Doc : " Very well , Wanda and I will ride in this conveyance , but I categorically refuse to drink milk with fallout rays and rat poison in it ! " The driver looked at Margo . " Maybe , " he said sourly . The rest came crowding aboard . Hunter had sat down beside Margo while the driver was talking to her . She ostentatiously made extra room , but he did n't look at her . Doc stood in the door and counted noses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and shouted to the truck , " O.K. , off we go ! Reverse course and follow in line astern ! " The school bus turned around on the bridge , and the truck behind it . Margo noticed that the water in the wash was now a yard higher . A tiny roller came up it , foaming along the sides . The beach onto which she 'd shot the boulder was under water , too . Last night the road here had been over half a mile from the ocean , but now only a hundred yards separated it from the surf . Doc settled down in the strategic spot he 'd reserved for himself , opposite Hunter and behind the door . He sprawled a leg over the extra seat beside him . " On to Monica Mountainway , " he told the driver . " Keep her at an easy thirty and watch for rocks . We 've hardly four miles to go along the highway  --  ample time to dodge Mrs. Pacific as she fattens up . Remember , everybody , the Pacific Coast tides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning 's the low high . ? McHeath , " he called over his shoulder , " you 're our liaison officer . Keep an eye on the truck . Rest of you , do n't crowd the sea-side . I want this bus  | balanced when we start uphill . We 're well ahead of the tide ? there 's no danger . " " Unless we get some more ? " Margo began , but checked herself . She 'd been going to say " earthquake waves " or " tsunami . " Hunter flashed her a smile . " That 's right ; do n't say it , " he whispered to her . Then , in a not much louder voice , across to Doc : " Where did you pick up that five-sixty figure , Rudy ? " " Eighty times the L.A. tidal range of seven feet , " Doc replied . " Much too big , I devoutly hope , but we have to make some kind of estimate . Oh , a life on the ocean wave , a home on the rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice " singing for morale " ? how well consideredly was an open question  --  and wished it were Paul 's . Then she clasped her hands together and studied the back of the driver 's seat . It looked recently scrubbed , but she could make out , " Ozzie is a stinker , " " Jo-Ann wears falsies , " and " Pop has 13 teeth . " Despite Doc 's reassurances , there was considerable excited watching of the creeping waters and scanning of the misty horizon , and a mounting feeling of tension as the bus chugged south . Margo felt the tension slacken the moment they turned up the sharply mounting , two-lane black ribbon of the mountainway  --  and then , almost immediately , gather again as people scanned the road ahead for slides or bucklings .
