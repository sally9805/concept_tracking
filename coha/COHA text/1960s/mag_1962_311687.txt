Tomorrow Is My Turn ( Show Corporation ) , the work of France 's Andr Cayatte ( Justice Is Done , We Are All Murderers ) , illustrates in skillful melodrama some subtle reflections on apparent and actual freedom and bondage . The subject is discussed in terms of two Frenchmen , one an uneducated baker ( Charles Aznavour ) , the other a sophisticated journalist ( Georges Riviere ) , who go off to fight the Germans in 1939 .
