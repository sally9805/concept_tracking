As so often happens , the last days of vacation were the bittersweet best . For Jacqueline Kennedy , returning late last week to the U.S. and her place as First Lady , there were the memories of the dancing , the lilting music , the faces of friendly people , the beaches , the blue , starred nights-and of the sadness of leaving Ravello . <P> There had been the moment when Ravello 's mayor presented Jackie with a parchment scroll making her an honorary citizen . Speaking in slightly imperfect Italian , she said : " I am very happy that the only place to which I belong outside my own country is Ravello , a beautiful city in one of the countries I love most-where people are so noble and gentle , and where my daughter and I have passed days of peace and happiness . " There was a reception afterward , the band played a specially composed march , Jacqueliniana and the Marine Corps Hymn-the leader , for some reason , thought it was the U.S. <P> national anthem . <P> All this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Pantaleone . <P> There little Caroline-looking like a Sargent painting come to life-appeared in native costume and a kerchief , and kept time to the music with a little tambourine . And back at the villa , serenaders filled the night sky with their songs-Torna a Surriento , 0 sole mio , and Maria , Marl . There was even a lullaby composed just for Caroline , called Tarantella Ravellese . It lost something in translation but nothing in sentiment : A welcome like this we From Ravello must give to you , Returning to America , and happy You remember Italy . <P> Caroline , go to sleep ; Dream , my dear , and the waves and The children of all the world Send you a little kiss . <P> Do n't forget this little town , Beautiful , simple and kind , That would be grateful If you did not leave at all . <P> But leave they had to . There was one last journey to the beach , one last session at the hairdresser 's , one last ice creamcone-both for Caroline and her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends motorboated to the Isle of Capri to shop and stroll through the main square and its sea of cafe tables . Then back to Ravello-and farewell . Crowds lined the streets , from the villa to the town square , to wave addio . But for all her happiness to be home , the melody could only linger on : Do n't forget this little town Beautiful , simple and kind . . .
