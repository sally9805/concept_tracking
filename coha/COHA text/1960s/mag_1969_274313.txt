Like many other farm towns across the country , Forest City , Iowa ( pop . 2,900 ) was dying . The region 's corn and hog farms were too small to be tilled profitably , and its greatest exports were people . Youngsters grew up and moved to nearby Minneapolis - and beyond - to find work , leaving their parents behind to rock in the sun and talk over old times . <P> That was 13 years ago . Then the town 's elders decided to fight the out-migration by bringing industry to Forest City . Today Winnebago Industries , the company a town created , has become the largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles in the U.S. Last month Winnebago , which is named for the surrounding county , placed a $30 million order with the Dodge Truck Division for chassis and engines to build $120 million worth of motor homes - self- propelled dwellings that combine the mobility of a car with some of the comforts of home . Such vehicles have grown increasingly popular among affluent U.S. families as a convenient means to travel ; go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winnebago 's sales have roughly doubled in each of the past four years . The company 's revenues reached $33 million in the last fiscal year and are expected to top $67 million this year . Earnings increased 100% last year , to $2,400,000 . <P> High-Priced Toys . Although the company is called " Winnebago-a-Grow-Grow " by its corn-country boosters , its success did not come easily . The Forest City Development Committee , appointed by the town to woo industry , raised $50,000 by selling stock locally . With those funds , the committee refurbished an old pumpkin cannery and began making so-called camper coaches : portable dwellings that can be mounted on pickup trucks . The venture failed , and the factory was forced to close . Finally , John K. Hanson , a Forest City furniture-store owner , bought up the stock at a reduced price and reopened the plant . In 1964 , misfortune struck again when a fire gutted the old building . Undaunted , Hanson borrowed $360,000 from the Small Business Administration and put up a larger and more efficient plant that enabled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house on wheels , " says Hanson . " But we build it like they build autos . " <P> Soon Hanson spotted the demand among campers for extra convenience and decided to concentrate production on bigger motor homes . It was a timely switch . His line of six motor homes now accounts for 80% of the company 's sales . The smallest models , about 17 ft. long-or two feet shorter than a full-sized station wagon-sell for $6,500 . The 27-ft. model sleeps six , has a bedroom and kitchen and is priced at $11,210 . Last year Winnebago made some 4,000 of the 18,000 motor homes sold in the U.S. , and Hanson expects the market for these " high-priced toys " to grow by at least 20% each year . <P> No Quitting . Both Hanson and Forest City have prospered . The once somnolent Main Street is bustling and not one shop is vacant . The town has a new airport , several supermarkets and no unemployment . Winnebago plans to add 600 more employees to its 1,400-man work force by next summer . The population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
