Ticket to a Sinking You can guess the President 's plans sometimes outside the White House . If a couple of firetrucks wait in the rear , he will be taking off soon in his helicopter . If a TV truck is parked to the left of the portico of the floodlit Mansion , he 's holding a press conference . As you show your pass you note the noble loveliness of the edifice behind the black , leafless trees . " Gentlemen , the President of the United States , " says the attendant , and all the gilt ballroom chairs scrape , and George and Martha Washington look down , and the crystals of the three immense chandeliers twinkle in kleig lights . This is the eighth press conference in 11 months , the fewest of any President in modern times . ( FDR had two-a-week in peacetime . ) You speculate on the President , the nation and the era . Fifty million people are watching on TV ; it 's amazing . He has no notes ; he stands alone . He is poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but would you like to stand there batting back answers to quick questions ? His best defense is that there 's no follow-up ; he turns to the next questioner quickly . He makes a couple of boo-boos ? Marines have built the Vietnamese " 250,000 " pagodas ( about one to 5o people ) ; it is corrected to 25,000 next day . His figure that 35-37 percent of gross national product now goes to taxes is wrong , economists say ; it 's around 3o percent ? a difference of maybe $5o billion in a trillion dollar economy . But so what ? It 's a remarkable performance . He keeps his cool throughout . Yes , even when asked about Martha Mitchell , the talkative wife of the Attorney General . She has burst upon the national scene as suddenly as Mr. Agnew , and is giving insights into her austere husband 's presumed thinking en route . It was she who , over TV , coined the phrase , " liberal Communists " against the antiwar demonstrators . The Washington Daily News , Dec. 6 , broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Judge Haynsworth on senators ' wives . They were hopping mad , according to an amplified account by another reporter , Isabelle Shelton , next day . Vote for Haynsworth she threatened , according to one angry senator 's wife , or she would " go on national television and defeat him . " Her words were " strong and colorful , " according to the assistant of Sen. Gore ( D ) of Tenn. ; the wife of one of the senators used sharper language . Mr. Nixon shrugged off the incident wryly in a comment that will win the sympathy of many husbands , but he started trains of thought about the Administration as he went on . Mr. Mitchell , in Mary McGrory 's phrase , was the " architect of disaster " in the Haynsworth nomination campaign which showed a striking insensitivity to senatorial ritual ; the three . top Republican leaders all voted against Haynsworth . The objective Associated Press ( Dec. io ) begins a piece : " President Nixon 's troubles with Congress are being compounded by his failure to win support from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned : Haynsworth , civil rights , antipoverty legislation and a key provision of tax reform . Where is the locus of Republican uneasiness ? In Fortune ( no liberal Communist sheet , that ) James Reichley explores the Administration 's plan to capture the South , most exhaustively set forth in The Emerging Republican Majority by Kevin P. Phillips , 29 , special assistant to Mitchell : The bonds that would hold this new alliance together , Reichley says , would be 1 ) dislike elsewhere for the populous Northeast , and 2 ) " fear of urban blacks . " The President has publicly taken issue with the idea , Reichley notes , but with Phillips retaining " his position at the Attorney General 's side . . . it seems permissible to question whether the Administration leaders truthfully reject his theory ( which Republican Senator William Saxbe of Ohio calls ' a ticket on the Titanic ' ) , or merely are chagrinedthat he has spelled it out with such candid cynicism . " Has n't Phillips really done for Mr. Nixon " the same dubious service that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked words what his hero had all along been doing by instinct " ? Indeed , a lot of moderate Republicans worry about this ticket on the Titanic . The press conference zooms on . As many as 20 reporters jump up at once , trying to catch the President 's eye . Now he is talking about taxes ; threatening to veto the Senate 's Christmas Tree tax bill . The mind goes back ; how did this business of inflation start , anyway ? War and Taxes It started , we believe , because the United States was willing to fight the Vietnam war , but not pay for it . The crucial year was 1965 ; it was then that the four-year boom needed a tax increase to cool it down . But the official theory of Vietnam was that it would n't cost much , and would be over by Christmas . Mr. Johnson did n't want to ask for taxes and he was virtually certain Congress would n't give them , or the public accept them . Economists pleaded in vain ; LBJ waited more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes were too small and came too late . Vietnam cost $3o billion a year . Inflation took over . The nation has made generous sacrifices for other wars : restrictions , controls , higher taxes ; not this one . The country was willing to fight it ; not pay for it . It ducked the burden in two disastrous ways ? inflationary IOUs ( i.e. , went in debt ) to raise cash , and postponed upkeep on physical plant and human values . It 's like owning a home : you can always " save " money by not puttying windows , fixing drains , painting walls . Social structure is like that , too , we have been " saving " billions by not meeting the frightful depreciation costs of big cities , or the human costs of poverty . If it 's a home it decays ; if it 's a country it decays , too , as class and racial tensions increase . Some of these " Social IOUs " of Vietnam are already coming due . This is the worst of all possible times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mostly for the rich and middle incomes . If the unpatriotic ghetto rebels , well , there 's always repression .
