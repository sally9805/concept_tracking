" Is Bayreuth in Danger ? " The question , posed by Munich 's Abendzeitung , may have seemed strange as the little Bavarian town of Bayreuth prepared last week for its annual Wagner festival . Hotels were doubling their rates ; black marketeers were getting an all-time high of $500 for tickets ; and economically at least , the institution created by Richard Wagner in 1876 to perpetuate his works and ideals was thriving as never before . <P> In fact , Bayreuth is confronting a turning point in its history . When the composer 's innovation-minded grandson Wieland Wagner died two years ago , the festival 's postwar era of boldly symbolic , iconoclastic productions appeared to be over . Wieland was succeeded as chief artistic administrator by his younger and more conservative brother Wolfgang , who had previously concentrated on Bayreuth 's business affairs . <P> Maypoles Again . Last year , in his first season , Wolfgang appeared to be harking back to the heavily literal stagings and overly oppressive nationalism that had prevailed before Wieland 's day . Many observers , disturbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , waited anxiously for his new production this year of Die Meistersinger . The work 's chauvinism and its basis in medieval history had traditionally called forth productions that were awash with romanticist naturalism-gingerbread houses , magical forests and peasant maids . Wieland Wagner twice tried to replace all this with fresh approaches . In 1956 , he staged the work as a spare , poetically brooding vision , in 1963 , as an authentic but highly mannered recreation of Shakespearean theater . <P> Last week Wolfgang 's version proved to be , as he admitted , a " look straight into the face of the past . " Back again were the familiar Maypobs , lush backdrops and looming timbers . Once more , singers appeared in costumes that might have come from the Oberammergau Passion Play . <P> No Precedent . Within those limits , the production had its virtues . Aided by Karl Boehm 's lively and sensitive conducting , Wolfgang gave intimate poignancy to the often-slighted scene in which the knight , Von Stolzing. works out his song for the mastersinger 's competition . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the cobbler , Hans Sachs ( at which German audiences used to rise reverently to their feet ) , and closed the opera on Sachs 's more characteristic note of skepticism and resignation : " Folly , all is folly . " <P> ludging from the thunderous opening-night ovation , most of the audience agreed with the critic who hailed the return of the " real Richard Wagner " to Bayreuth . Others deplored the production . " It was , " said one reviewer , " as if Wieland had never lived . " <P> <P> Wolfgang insisted that Meistersinger was nothing more than " another experiment in our workshop " and was not necessarily a precedent for future productions . Already , he pointed out . he has signed up two of Europe 's more unorthodox young directors , Munich 's August Everding and Milan 's Giorgio Strehler , to stage works in 1969 and 1970 . " Such a program , " he said , " does n't look like a triumph for those prophets who keep predicting that Bayreuth is going to sink into a quagmire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
