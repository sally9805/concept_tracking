Eve Wants to Sleep ( Film Polski ; Edward Harrison ) begins in a dark alley ; a man is clubbed to the pavement and his briefcase stolen . So far , so bloody ; then the thief walks a few steps down the alley , a gas pipe thuds musically on a skull , and the mugger himself lies mugged . The new thief happily examines the briefcase-until a knife glints in the uncertain light . He gives the loot to the latest blackguard , when suddenly . . . <P> Suddenly the viewer realizes that it is he who has been led up an alley . These Poles are up to something . As a jingling , bezithered theme song about crime without punishment gives evidence , the film is showing a previously unmapped neighborhood of that criminally comic never-city where Mack the Knife operates . Just now it is nightfall , and a pretty , innocently mischievous girl ( Barbara Lass ) has arrived at the city 's School of Geodetics , ready to enroll . But the school can not receive her till tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She meets a sawed-off apprentice thug who wants her to buy a brick or he will conk her with it . She has no money , but takes the brick and , in innocence , offers it for the thug to a hysterical old man . A cop comes , the thug runs , she is led off to the station . There she panics , locks herself into what turns out to be the station arsenal . But the chief of police is coming for an inspection , and the door must be opened . A convict safecracker is summoned , dressed in a cop 's uniform . The chief praises him for his honest face . <P> The solemn may try to see political satire in this jape . It is true that one of a pack of thieves says , " At least we 're not nationalized yet , " and an official-looking sign in a workingwomen 's boardinghouse reads , " Chastity is the Best Policy ! Do n't See Your Husband . " But the only real politics in this film is lunatic anarchy . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat , there is another along in ten seconds . It all serves as a reminder that the early-Hollywood , dead-run comedy used to be awfully funny , and it is pretty sneaky of the Poles to rediscover this fact .
