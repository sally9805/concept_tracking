Featherbedding is a business malaise in many parts of the world , but in Latin America it is a hallowed institution enjoyed by the participants , cheered by the masses and endorsed by the politicians . Now the feather beds are getting softer than ever . <P> <P> Four Men to a Job . The problem spreads across the whole range of industry . At least 5,000 of Bolivia 's 25,000 mineworkers and 30,000 of Argentina 's 180,000 railway workers are superfluous . Chile 's creaking national railroad employs 87 men per mile of track v. 27 in Britain , where that number is considered heavy featherbedding . Brazilian 10,000-ton freighters have an average 49 crewmen each , while similar ships under other flags use only 37. * Argentina 's depressed auto manufacturers , producing at scarcely 30% of capacity , are desperately trying to thin their ranks ; but when Kaiser tried to do so , workers seized the plant and threatened to burn it along with management hostages trapped inside . Peru 's Lima-Callao tramcar company , which recently pulled out of bankruptcy , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has four workers for every real job . <P> Latin American labor unions are clamoring for still more stretching of the available work . Last week in Argentina , where payroll padding is a costly legacy from Pern 's days , 2,000,000 unionists staged a paralyzing one-day walkout in hopes of pressuring the government to create still more jobs . And in Venezuela , labor unions celebrated a new contract virtually forbidding U.S.-owned oil companies to furlough any men despite automation . <P> Votes &; Excuses . Where poverty and underemployment are everyday realities and privilege is taken for granted , self-seeking politicians underwrite featherbedding to win votes from powerful unions , and then seek out economists to provide scholarly excuses . Says Brazil 's Juvenal Osrio Gomes , a government economist : " Only a violently capitalistic regime without any social sentiment would threaten workers with the abject misery of having to look for a job and not finding it . Brazil is not violently capitalistic and never will be . " <P> But some independent economists soundly point out that costly make-work is one of the biggest barriers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would increase productivity , lower prices and expand exports . All of this , of course , would create more jobs and higher wages in the long run . <P> <P> * In another way of seeking extra benefits , the proud and potent Brazilian dockworkers , who take home close to $500 a month but let automatic loading machines do part of the work , are demanding " shame " bonuses of 30% for handling such cargo as toilet bowls and sanitary napkins .
