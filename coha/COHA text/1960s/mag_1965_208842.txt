I Saw What You Did has just got under way when a pair of youngsters wander out to a barn to visit a pony . Suddenly the door slams shut behind them . Outside , the bushes begin rustling . Can it be the wind ? An unseen enemy ? Actually , nothing at all is happening . The culprit is really Producer-Director William Castle , who seldom lets plausibility slow the pace of his grade-B shockers . <P> I Saw delivers its message by telephone , and rings in some crude but effective suspense from the mischief wrought by two nubile teen-agers ( Movie Newcomers Andi Garrett and Sarah Lane ) . With Mom and Dad away on an overnight trip , Andi invites Sarah out to her remote country mansion to help baby-sit . Crank calls are the girls ' favorite diversion . The usual ploy : " I saw what you did and I know who you are . " It is a dubious icebreaker at best , but downright troublesome when addressed to an unstable suburbanite ( John Ireland ) who that very evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried her body in the woods . To the girls he sounds " sexy ... a swinger . " They phone again . Yeh , yeh . <P> Ireland 's other problem is Joan Crawford , cast as a predatory neighbor who does n't care what a man has done so long as he is willing to remarry . Joan is given big billing but has a small role , and soon both her number and her time are up . The plot perks right along without her . Having learned Andi 's identity , Ireland closes in during the whee hours when open windows , flashing cutlery and hairbreadth escapes are apt to achieve maximum impact among teenagers . Any who are hooked on horror shows will find every reason to haunt Castle 's . Their parents may prefer to stay home and sneak in a few phone calls .
