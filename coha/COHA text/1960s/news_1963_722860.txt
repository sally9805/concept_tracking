txt In one year illness and accidents left six executives of a West Coast manufacturer disabled for life . In this predicament many companies would have been forced to decide whether to loo the stricken men from the navroll or to continue their salaries until they became eligible for retirement , at a total cost of $800,000 . But the West Coast firm was spared this dilemma . It is one of a growing number of companies taking part in long-term " salary continuance " group insurance plans . Such plans keep at least half of a disabled man 's regular pay coming until his pension begins . Many employers long have insured employes ' salaries and wages against disability for periods of a year or less . And some individuals have purchased long-term disability insurance for themselves . But the group plans make it possible for salaried employes to get long-term protection at an average cost of only 1% of their earnings , about one-fifth the averAgo premium rate on individual policies . A Growing Field Insurance companies collected about $25 million in premiums from group salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1959 only Continental Casualty Co. and a couple of smaller firms wrote such policies regularly . Now some 20 major insurance companies are in the field , including Insurance Co. of North America , American Casualty Co. , Travelers Insurance Co. and Aetna Insurance Co . The insurance men tell employers that salary continuance coverage is needed to supplement company-sponsored retirement plans , hospitalization and life insurance . They cite figures showing that one out of every 10 persons now 35 years old will be disabled for the rest of his life sometime before he reaches age 65 . " If I 'm ' disabled , I do n't want my future income to depend on how well the boss and I have been getting along , " says the insurance manager of a large dairy products concern currently considering a long-term salary plan .

These voluntary plans usually attract a high number of participants . Cooper-Bessemer Corp. , a Mount Vernon , Ohio , firm which makes gasoline and diesel engines , reports that 86% of its 700 eligible salaried . employes have signed up . Disabled employes covered by such plans get benefits ranging from 50% to 75% of their latest salary , up to a maximum of about $1,200 a month , until they retire , die or recover . They receive the benefits whether or not their . dis . ability is connected with their work , and the benefits are not subject to Federal income tax . In the case of firms that pay salary insurance premiums for their workers , ' such as Xerox Corp. , only the first $100 of weekly benefits is not subject to income tax .

These amount to as much as $254 a month for a disabled worker who has earned an average of at least $4,500 a year and sup . ports three or more dependents  --  a wife and two minor children , for example  --  eligible for Social Security . A 47-year-old corporation attorney who earned $1,038 a month before he was sidelined by a heart ailment now gets $254 a month from the Government and $675 in salary insurance benefits for a monthly total of $929 . Many companies that originally limited salary continuance plans to key executives now are expanding them to include clerks , accountants and foremen . The West Coast manufacturer that lost six executives in a year soon after broadened its plan to cover all salaried workers .
