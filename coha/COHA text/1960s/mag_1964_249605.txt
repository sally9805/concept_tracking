The U.S. Government 's cotton policy is a crazy quilt that would put even Rumpelstiltskin in stitches-and it costs the U.S. taxpayer $500 million a year . Congress has piled subsidy on top of subsidy , seems to think up a new price prop every year . <P> First the Government fixed the price of domestic cotton at 32 a lb. , which is 8 above the present world market price . Then it has been paying an 8 subsidy to exporters so that they can sell U.S. cotton competitively at the world price . But U.S. textile manufacturers have been complaining that foreign textile makers can thus buy U.S. cotton cheaper than they can-and the Government has now devised still an other subsidy to meet their complaints . Beginning Aug. 1 , it will drop the farmers ' support price 2 to 30 , automatically lowering the subsidy to exporters by 2 . At the same time it will grant U.S. manufacturers a new subsidy of 6 a lb. so that they will be able to buy U.S. cotton at the cheaper world price . The effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cotton will get 30 a lb. but buyers will only have to pay the prevailing world rate , which currently fluctuates between 23 and 24 . <P> The new system last week proved to be the last boll for the 93-year-old New Orleans Cotton Exchange , which closed its doors to trading . Because the price of cotton has been so firmly fixed , big dealers no longer have to go to the exchange to buy futures contracts to hedge against possible fluctuations . Futures trading on the New Orleans exchange dropped from 12 million bales a decade ago to only 18,000 last year . The exchange did not take its closing easily , planted full-page ads in many newspapers to attack the situation . After suggesting that Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman is either " unknowledgeable " or " a demagogue , " the ad charged that his subsidies were creating a " unique substitute for the free enterprise system . " <P> That left only one remaining cotton futures exchange-the New York exchange , whose business has dwindled from 33 million bales in 1953 to 928,000 in 1963 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes of finding a way to survive , but prospects are dim . The subsidy system has achieved stability for the nation 's No. 1 fiber , but the cost in money and market freedom is high .
