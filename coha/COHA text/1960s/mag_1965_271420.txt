For generations the BBC , known affectionately to all Britons as " Auntie BBC , " has been - first via radio , then television - the sonorous , serious , slightly stuffy voice of England 's Oxbridge-accented Establishment . Until , that is , the siren of commercial television sauntered on the scene nine years ago swinging her pocketbook in the guise of the ITV network and luring away the BBC 's viewers . Auntie retaliated by taking on in 1960 a new leading man to spruce up her image : Hugh Carleton Greene , now 54 , brother of Novelist Graham Greene , as director general . Greene brought in fresh-and often brash-young men , gave them a free hand to teach Auntie how to twist . One of the brightest results was a free-swinging satiric show called That Was the Week That Was , which lampooned everything in sight , most particularly the then ruling Tories . It proved such a dose of acid and old lace that as last year 's elections approached , Greene felt it prudent to close it down . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was roundly criticized by others . The BBC was again losing ground in the ratings race to ITV ( latest BBC surveys give rival ITV typically 55% of the British viewing audience of 48 million ) . So to help get things swinging again , the BBC went back into the satire business five months ago with an entry called Not So Much a Programme , More a Way of Life . <P> It turned out to be not so much a program as a pogrom . A skit depicting a priest lewdly opposing contraception so offended the nation 's Catholics that the BBC was forced to apologize publicly . Fortnight ago , Panelist Bernard Levin called Tory Leader Sir Alec Douglas-Home " a cretin . " When Guest Panelist and onetime Tory Cabinet Minister Iain Macleod rebuked him for such " crude , vulgar words of abuse , " a grinning Levin agreed to change " cretin " to " imbecile . " <P> <P> The BBC 's telephone switchboards were still jammed with protesting callers when the very next night Not So Much put on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windsor 's 1937 marriage to Wallis Warfield Simpson into a sentimental-silly comic operetta . Unluckily it happened to coincide with the sudden death of the Duke 's sister , the Princess Royal , and the nation was outraged . With that last straw , Sir Hugh quietly announced that Not So Much a Programme would be , as of next week , not one at all .
