When Britain 's King George III died in 1820 , he was blind , deaf and apparently mad . His physicians , limited in their medical knowledge and hindered by protocol in examining their royal patient ( they could not inquire how he felt unless he spoke to them first ) , had long since concluded that the King was " under an entire alienation of mind . " George III went down in history as the mad monarch , a judgment accepted by generations of historians and buttressed by psychiatric studies . <P> Now , however , two British psychiatrists who re-examined George 's medical records in the light of new medical knowledge are proposing a radically different interpretation . Drs . Ida Macalpine and Richard Hunter , her son , suggest in the British Medical Journal that George III suffered from porphyria , a rare hereditary metabolic disorder that can lead to severe mental disturbances . <P> George apparently inherited porphyria from Mary Queen of Scots ( 1542-87 ) , who passed the genetic disorder on to 16 generations of European aristocracy .

Porphyria was unknown in clinical jargon before the 20th century , and is still not fully understood . It is a group of diseases with many different signs and symptoms . " In some of them the only problem is the undue sensitivity of the skin to sunlight , " wrote Professor Abe Goldberg of Glasgow 's Western Infirmary in 1966 . In others , " the normal life of the patient may be shattered by devastating attacks of abdominal pain , paralysis of limbs , and profound mental upset . " <P> One sign , however , may occur in any variety of porphyria-darkening of the urine , which frequently turns the color of port wine .

Starting with acute abdominal pain , weakness of the limbs and the classic discolored urine , his symptoms progressed through insomnia , headache and restlessness to delirium , convulsions and stupor . Even after his condition improved , George suffered periods during which his doctors said " wrong ideas " took hold of him . In 1810 , he became so ill that he was incapacitated for the rest of his life , and his son , as Prince Regent , assumed the King 's duties , George died at 81 , one month after a turbulent attack during which he went 58 hours without sleep . <P> Equally Unkind .
