U.S. businessmen had rarely basked in a warmer glow . As it reached the 39th month of economic advance , the U.S. economy was in the midst of the longest peacetime expansion in modern history . First-quarter profit reports from every part of the U.S. showed that corporations were earning on the average of 20% more this year than in 1963 . General Motors ' earnings of $536 million were the highest for any company in any three-month period in business history , and huge profit gains were reported by giants as varied as Eastman Kodak ( up 25% ) , U.S. Steel ( up 72% ) and the Monsanto Co. ( up 84% ) . Retail sales marched upward , and so did construction contracts . Auto and steel production continued at record or near-record levels . <P> New Attitude . Above and beyond all this spring growth was the warm breeze from Washington . The President of the U.S. went before the annual meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ( see THE NATION ) and spent a chatty hour appealing for an end to suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Harvey Aluminum President Lawrence Harvey said : " This signals a new attitude on the part of bureaucrats-business is your friend , work with it . " Businessmen believe that Johnson thinks the way they think , point out that he is the first President since Herbert Hoover to have had successful business experience . Says Boston 's Eli Goldston , president of Eastern Gas &; Fuel Associates : " He 's a good model of today 's professional business manager . " <P> To many businessmen , one good example of professionalism was Johnson 's success in settling the long and complicated railroad labor hassle-and doing so without visibly bruising anyone . About 5,000 railroad firemen stand to lose their jobs immediately under terms of the Compulsory Arbitration law , whose constitutionality was upheld last week by the U.S. Supreme Court , but most will get severance checks or other railroad jobs . Labor chiefs applauded Johnson 's concern for the displaced workers , and businessmen generally agreed that he had not overstepped the bounds of collective bargaining by persuasively pushing the settlement . Says Santa Fe President Ernest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of credit for doing something that nobody else had been able to do . " <P> An Accountant 's Memory . The President has an accountant 's memory for economic statistics , and he delights in exploiting the bullish ones in his speeches in a way that puts them onto Page One almost every day . In his speech to the Chamber of Commerce , he managed to mention 50 different statistics . Armed with figures on profits and take-home pay , Johnson has been using every possible chance to campaign against price and wage rises-gently warning businessmen that if inflation comes to eat away prosperity , they will have only themselves to blame .
