Sculptor George Segal is a onetime New Jersey chicken farmer who flew the coop to make plaster casts of people . Last week he got a mighty nice little nest egg for all his efforts : the $5,000 first prize at the Chicago Art Institute 's 68th annual exhibition . The jurors also awarded prizes of $2,500 each to Robert Rauschenberg , Frank Stella and Larry Poons , all New Yorkers of the pop-op-geometric persuasion , and a $1,000 prize to Sculptor Robert Morris . <P> But the runaway hit of the show was easily Segal 's creation , The Truck . It consisted of the actual cab of a red panel truck that Segal had found in a junkyard . Inside , the odometer read 85,723 , the generator and oil-pressure gauges glowed red in the dashboard . In the driver 's seat was an alert , life-size white plaster driver , both hands on the wheel , right foot hovering over the accelerator . As viewers looked over his shoulders at the windshield , they shared a Cineramic ride through city streets , as lights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring off the joy ride , Segal had rigged a small film projector and mirror arrangement to the right of the cab , which beamed the movie onto the truck 's frosted windshield . Watching it , one housewife confided : " That 's the way my husband drives . " Chuckled a young executive : " I go through that every night . " Juror Martin Friedman , director of Minneapolis ' Walker Art Center , put it another way : " I found it very moving . Actually , " he said , " by treating the man almost as a ghost , as a calcified figure , Segal presents you with reality , then questions the existence of reality . " The driver ? A neighboring chicken farmer , Leon Bibel , who had got plastered - Segal-style.
