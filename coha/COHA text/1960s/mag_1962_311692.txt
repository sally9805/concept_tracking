Prayer &; the Court <P> Sir : <P> The Supreme Court decision barring prayers in public schools must be accepted as final , short of a constitutional amendment . <P> Why not have in the public schools a daily period of silence , one or two minutes in length , during which time the children would be previously instructed to think over their actions and accomplishments of the previous day , and , if they so wished , to silently say a prayer that they will act right and try to improve during the coming day . <P> Such self-examination is to be cultivated in children . No one can be perfect , but merely thinking of ways to improve oneself with the help of God ( if you believe in a God ) is a step in the right direction . <P> <P> MATHIAS R. KONDOLF Holcomb , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : <P> The New York prayer seems to be stripped of all mention of anything that could offend any Christian denomination , the Hebrew religion or , for that matter , Mohammedanism , Confucianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple recognition of the fact that there is a superior intelligence and power that governs this universe , whose blessing we ask . <P> If the Supreme Court is the ultimate repository of what is right or wrong , legal or illegal in this country , then more than ever we had better ask God 's blessing and help . HAAKON B. GROSETH <P> Chicago <P> Sir : <P> In the foamy wake of public opinion bobs a bell buoy of truth . Perhaps this decision will elucidate the obvious : 1 ) that the U.S. is not a " Christian " nation ; 2 ) that the slogan " In God We Trust " is probably also unconstitutional ; 3 ) that attempts at blanket religion are encroachments upon the freedoms of every human , Christian or nonChristian . <P> Thank the court for insight . <P> <P> CHARLEYE WRIGHT Baylor University Waco , Texas <P> Sir : <P> Regardless of the fine points of interpretation , this Supreme Court ruling abolished something fine and positive . <P> I see this as a direct accomplishment of the world Communist conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withstand the pressures has had another shattering blow . I hope the matter ' is not irreversible . <P> <P> ROBERT H. KOENIG Cambria Heights , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : <P> The Supreme Court ruling on prayers in the schools should not come as a blow to anyone . It appears to be a completely logical step in our religious demise . What is needed is not another amendment , such as that proposed by Senators Stennis and Robertson , for such an addition to the Constitution would indeed be an inadequate bandage for such a large sore . We must redefine the First Amendment and do away with all of this " separation of church and state " nonsense . <P> <P> JAMES A. PARIS <P> Cleveland <P> Sir : <P> The attacks on the First Amendment by certain members of the Congress should arouse apprehension in every responsible American . Let 's not tamper with our most precious possession amid the emotional swirl of a revival meeting . <P> S. C. WOODWORTH Ann Arbor , Mich . <P> Sir : <P> It is inspiring that Congress found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for God . Pressing legislation may be complicated and expensive , but God , like antiCommunism , is simple enough . <P> And think of the votes in November . <P> <P> MICHAEL L.
