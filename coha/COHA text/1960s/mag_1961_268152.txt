The trouble with U.S. Catholic colleges is an " abysmal mediocrity " that has made them " almost universally destitute of intellectual leadership " in U.S. life . These words were spoken neither by Paul Blanshard nor by any other Catholic baiter-though some Catholics greeted them as if they were-but by a man who cares deeply about the fate of Catholic education : the Rev. Theodore Martin Hesburgh , C.S.C. , president of the University of Notre Dame . <P> By no coincidence , young ( 43 ) Father Hesburgh has made old ( 118 ) Notre Dame a striking exception to his charges . In his nine years as president , football-famed Notre Dame , where Knute Rockne was once more revered than St. Thomas , has become a serious intellectual citadel . In the anguishing process , Father Hesburgh has become U.S. Catholic higher education 's most public and most bluntly outspoken figure . Last week , at Notre Dame alumni meetings throughout the Midwest , he hammered away at his proposed role for all Catholic colleges : " The exalted work of mediation in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than healing social schisms-between whites and Negroes , labor and management , science and humanities . Already , he has under way at Notre Dame a $2,000,000-a-year center for the necessary research . The center has launched studies on Latin America , African education and civil rights . " Here is an age crying for the light and guidance of Christian wisdom , " says Hesburgh .

The son of a plate-glass plant manager , Hesburgh spent his undergraduate years at Notre Dame and Rome 's Gregorian University , where " the classes were all in Latin , the dormitory talk in French , and the street talk in Italian . " In 1945 , after being ordained a priest in the Congregation of the Holy Cross , he joined Notre Dame 's faculty . In seven years , he was successively head of the religion department , executive vice president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president . <P> A handsome hustler , Hesburgh likes to work until 2 in the morning with Bach or Brahms humming away on his office stereo set . He speaks six languages , has a passion for fishing and flying . He and Notre Dame 's executive vice president , Father Edmund Joyce , once licked Bridge Expert Charles Goren . Nowadays his playtime is limited . He is the Vatican 's permanent representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency , a member of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission , and this year 's president of the Association of American Colleges , where his Roman collar no longer stamps him as an outsider .
