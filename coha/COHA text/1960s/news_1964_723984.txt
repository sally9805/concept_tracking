txt As good Communists should , the members of a Red Chinese economic mission visiting here dutifully make anti-American remarks whenever they can . But when it comes to pushing wares at their trade fair , currently touring Japan , the Red Chinese lean heavily on Western-style merchandising tactics . The Red salesmen have abandoned the usual colorless Communist packaging in favor of distinctive brand names and catchy slogans . Thus Japanese shoppers at the fair are being offered Great Wall canned stewed duck with chestnuts , Butterfly brand seedless raisins " from sunny Sinkiang " and " tender and honey sweet " Flying Wheel brand Bartlett pears . The jazzier-sales approach spotlights Red China 's stepped up efforts to increase exports to the capitalistic world to earn badly needed foreign exchange . The success of this drive could cause serious problems for U.S. diplomacy around the world . Many products the Chinese are offering abroad could well be used at home , where consumer goods are critically scarce . But the Chinese want the hard currency earned from overseas sales to buy more raw materials . industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rut-Ala The Chinese obtained most such commodities from the Soviet Union , until the two split over ideology . The Chinese cut their buying from Russia from an estimated $817 million in 1960 to about $240 million in 1962 , the last year for which such estimates are available . And the recent intensification of the Sino-Soviet quarrel seems to offer the Chinese no other alternative except to buy more from the West and from Japan . What worries American officials in Asia is that as U.S. allies trade more with Red China , these nations might soften their political opposition to the mainland regime . They might then stop blocking Red China 's bid for UN membership and grant diplomatic recognition to Peking . U.S. diplomats are particularly worried about Japan 's attitude , because Japanese policies are likely to influence smaller Asian countries . The Red Chinese are eager to buy more Japanese fertilizer , chemicals , steel products and even complete plants for making plastic fibers . But they make clear that they expect Japan to purchase more from them in return . Japanese purchases from the mainland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coking coal , jumped 62% last year to reach $75 million . And as the Chinese make better grades of coal and iron ore available this year , shipments to Japan are expected to climb another 20% . To help boost sales of such products the Chinese have turned this year 's traveling fair into the biggest they 've ever staged overseas . About 80 Red engineers and salesmen , most wearing identical , ill-tailored blue suits , staff the booths which display industrial products as well as foodstuffs . Red Flag Auto But not everyone who visited the fair when it set up shop at Tokyo 's Harumi Pier exhibition grounds last month was impressed . Some engineers said that the Chinese lathes , electric motors and gauges hardly matched the quality of similar Japanese products . Other visitors sniffed that the Red Flag model passenger car looked like a 1958 Dodge with Chevrolet door handles and hinges . They noted that its body was made of welded steel plates , indicating that the Chinese lacked either the technique to press out parts or the quality steel needed for ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the fair the Chinese still hope to sell to factory owners in Japan and Southeast Asia who are interested more in lower price than precision . Moreover , trade sources in Asia say that the Communists are improving the quality of some of their goods , textiles in particular . " They could unload junk when they were selling in Communist bloc countries , " says one observer . " But now that they want to sell competitively outside they realize they have to improve designs , dies and weaving or they wo n't get the orders . " From Tokyo the Chinese plan to move their fair to Osaka where it 's scheduled to open in the first week of June for a three-week run . Later , the traveling trade show may visit the southern island of Kyushu . This month the Japanese also are entertaining an economic mission from Peking , headed by Nan Han-then , chairman of Red China 's International Trade Promotion Association , and one of the highest ranking Red Chinese officials ever to visit Japan . Comrade Nan has been busy meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese to visit Peking . The conservative Japanese government of Prime Minister Ikeda recognizes the Nationalist Chinese regime on Formosa and insists User increase in trade partly inspired General de Gaulle 's decision to recognize Red China last January . // that it considers trade completely separate from politics . But there have been a growing number of Japanese trade missions to Red Ming , made up in part of inflis.rit , s1 members of the ruling Liberal-Democratic Party . The Chinese have been trying harder than ever to get buyers not only from Japan but also from other foreign countries to visit the mainland The annual trade exhibition in Canton , just concluded , was advertised in English language Red Chinese publications as " like no other fair in the world . " And Red Chinese sales agents in Hong Kong urged their customers to take the 60-mile train ride to Canton to see the exhibits . Those who do make buying trips to the mainland are likely to encounter Red salesmen who , in the best free enterprise tradition , offer attractive terms and often more than live up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they deliver ahead of schedule , " says a Canadian buyer of cotton gloves . " Besides , no one can touch their prices . " From a trial order placed with the Red Chinese two years ago , he has gone on to give the Communists 62% of his considerable business . All told , China last year exported some $780 million worth of goods , up from $640 million in 1962 . Experts say that the decline in SinoSoviet trade could make another $100 million worth of Chinese products available for export annually by next year . Red China 's biggest source of foreign exchange is Hong Kong . Last year the British colony imported $261 million worth of such Red Chinese goods as textiles , housewares , meats and fruits and vegetables , a 19% increase over 1962 . The United Kingdom remains another big Chinese customer although last year it cut its buying from the mainland by 20% to $44.8 million .
