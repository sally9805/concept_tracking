Considering the 9-1 season that Notre Dame had in 1964 , last year was practically a disaster . Quarterback John Huarte , the Heisman Trophy-winning passer , had graduated ; so had All America End Jack Snow . The Fighting Irish had nothing left except a speedy halfback in Nick Eddy , a pile-driving fullback in Larry Conjar , and a rock'em , sock-'em offense that ground out the yardage but excited nobody . Notre Dame wound up with a 7-2-1 record , losing to Purdue and Michigan State , playing Miami to a 0-0 tie . <P> That sort of grim efficiency would never do for Notre Dame 's legion of fans across the U.S. After all , what subway alumnus ever dreams of off-tackle plunges while riding the BMT home to Brooklyn ? Coach Ara Parseghian knew just what was needed . " Enthusiasm , " reads a sign on his office wall . " If we have it , we should thank God for it . If we do n't have it , we should get down on our knees and pray for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Irish opened their season against Purdue two weeks ago . " Can I say you 'll win all your games this year ? " inquired a sportswriter , and Parseghian replied happily : " Say anything you want to . " Purdue Coach Jack Mollenkopf , by contrast , seemed outrageously morose . " If you beat Notre Dame the year before , " he warned , " the next year is hell . " <P> It sure was . To the astonishment of practically everybody except Mollenkopf ( who is obviously used to this sort of thing ) , Notre Dame produced the passer it had been lacking all last year : Terry Hanratty , 18 , a sophomore quarterback from Butler , Pa. - which happens to be near the home of the New York Jets ' Joe Namath , who happens to have been Hanratty 's boyhood hero . Ahead of every good passer , of course , there is a good receiver , and the Irish have one of those too : End Jim Seymour , 19 , another sophomore , who stands 6 ft. 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cuts like a cottontail . <P> <P> Playing his first college football game ( Notre Dame has no regular freshman team ) , Hanratty threw 24 passes and completed 16 for 304 yds . Seymour caught 13 of those tosses for 276 yds. and three touchdowns-breaking just about every single-game record for a Notre Dame pass receiver . The Fighting Irish won the game 26-14 , and all poor Jack Mollenkopf could have said was " See , I told you so . " Well , if Jack thought he had it rough , imagine how Northwestern 's Alex Agase felt . Alex inherited his job from Parseghian , who moved to Notre Dame after his Wildcats had beaten the Irish four years in a row . Against Northwestern last week , Hanratty and Seymour connected nine times for 141 yds. , and the Irish romped to a 35-7 victory .
