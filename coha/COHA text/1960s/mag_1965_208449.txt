Like many other leaders of new African nations , President Jomo Kenyatta has not found it easy to steer a middle course between East and West . His job has not been made easier by the activities of his own Vice President , Oginga Odinga , who admits that " Communism is like food to me " and has been trav eling through the countryside heaping Red-tinged scorn on Kenyatta 's ties with the West . <P> <P> Last week things reached a climax of sorts when Odinga , in his first direct attack on his President , rose at a rally on the shore of Lake Victoria to de clare that Kenyatta had fallen under imperialist influence and was all but taking his orders from the U.S. and Britain . It brought an outraged response from Kenyatta 's Cabinet ministers , who called the attack " cheap politics " and " calculated to further the cause of Communism . " Five party leaders , already angered by Odinga 's role in Communist arms imports ( TIME , April 23 ) , signed a petition demanding his resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel . Then he fired Odinga as chief Kenya delegate to this month 's British Commonwealth Conference , and rose to speak about his young nation 's direction . <P> " Let me say it quite plainly today that Kenya shall not exchange one master for a new master , " Kenyatta declared . " We welcome cooperation and assistance , but we shall not be bought or blackmailed . We may be underdeveloped and our people may walk barefoot , but we are a proud people , proud of our heritage , our traditions and ancestry . <P> " Some people deliberately try to exploit the colonial hangover for their own selfish purposes , or in order to serve some external force . We must reject such people publicly . It is naive to think that there is no danger of imperialism from the East . In world power politics , the East has as many designs on us as the West . This is why we reject Communism . To us , Communism is as bad as imperialism . What we want is Kenya nationalism . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slogans . " <P> The audience on Nairobi 's Harambee Avenue broke into wild cheers , and beside Kenyatta , Oginga Odinga stared glumly ahead .
