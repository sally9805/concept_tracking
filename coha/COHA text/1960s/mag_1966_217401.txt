Like many other priests , nuns and ministers , Sister Mary Angelica , 41 , a second-grade teacher at Sacred Heart School in Melrose Park , last month joined Martin Luther King 's march for integrated housing through the streets of Chicago . In the heavily Catholic Gage Park neighborhood , an angry youth in a jeering mob yelled , " This is for you , nun ! " and threw a brick at her . The missile struck Sister Angelica on the back of her head , opened a cut that soaked her black veil and white collar with blood . Unashamed , the crowd cheered . <P> Sister Angelica may well be the first U.S. clerical figure to suffer physical injury from her coreligionists in the service of civil rights , but as one Methodist minister from Los Angeles puts it , " there are subtler kinds of stoning . " To day , as the Negroes ' just claim to equality has become all but submerged in the demand for black power , an increasing number of Christian laymen are turning cool toward unqualified stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregations that applauded when their clergy marched off last year to Selma have sometimes turned deaf and hostile ears as the main battle over integration has shifted closer to home . <P> Hangman 's Noose . Opposition to clerical involvement takes many forms - some of them crude . When Methodist Pastor Eugene Lowry of Kansas City 's College Heights Methodist Church urged his congregation to hire a Negro organist , his car was burned and he found a hangman 's noose on his mail box . More frequently , though , opposition takes a financial form . Outspoken preachers on civil rights have seen their collection-plate income drop as much as 50% after a sermon on integration ; last month All Souls Church in Washington , D.C. , drastically cut its annual contribution to the city 's Episcopal Diocese as a protest against Suffragan Bishop Paul Moore Jr . ' s advocacy of . open housing and fair employment practices . <P> Some churches make no secret of their desire to get rid of a civil-righteous pastor-and when congregational policy allows it , they sometimes do so . In the Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Congregational Church was dismissed soon after he and a visiting Negro minister sang We Shall Overcome from the pulpit . Last February , the Rev. William Youngdahl of Omaha 's Augustana Lutheran Church was forced to resign his charge after congregants protested his involvement in local civil rights work . And in Evanston , Ill. , the Rev. Emory G. Davis this month left his church , after being repeatedly urged by parishioners to stick to the work of the parish and leave civil rights to God . Ironically , Davis and the 400 parishioners of the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church are Negroes . <P> Parish pressure has forced some ministers to be less open in their advocacy of the Negro cause . In California , virtually every church leader spoke out in 1964 against a referendum to repeal the state 's " fair housing " act . The clergymen 's advice was overwhelmingly rejected by the voters . Today , even though California 's Supreme Court has declared the referendum decision unconstitutional , the law is once again being challenged - but far fewer ministers and priests are defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
