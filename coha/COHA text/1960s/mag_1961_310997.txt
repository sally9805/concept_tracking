From the start of his campaign for Governor of New Jersey , Democrat Richard J. Hughes , 52 , knew that he would have to answer one big question : " Who 's Hughes ? " A lawyer who had served ably but quietly on the New Jersey Superior Court , Hughes had never run for statewide office and was little known to the voters ; in contrast , his Republican opponent , former U.S. Labor Secretary James P. Mitchell , had a nationwide reputation as one of the ablest men of Eisenhower 's Cabinet for seven years . But by last week , almost everyone in New Jersey knew who Dick Hughes was : he was the state 's Governor-elect , having defeated Mitchell by 38,000 votes out of 2,100,000 cast . <P> " Running for God . " The Hughes victory was kind of a classic-and so was the Mitchell loss . Handicapped by a broken leg that he suffered last June in a bathroom fall , Jim Mitchell campaigned in a lackluster , above-partisan-politics fashion . " He acted , " complained a Republican bitterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As the hand-picked candidate of New Jersey 's liberal Republican Senator Clifford Case , Mitchell was also hurt on election day by the number of conservative Republicans who simply stayed home . <P> But Hughes earned his own win . Working 20 hours a day , he logged a remarkable 60,000 miles in crisscrossing New Jersey . He visited each of the state 's 21 counties at least twice , concentrating on Republican strongholds . By his own estimate , he shook some 300,000 hands ; he turned up at so many political and civic luncheons and dinners that he gained ten pounds . Backed by a Democratic kitty estimated at $800,000 , he appeared on scores of radio and television spots , made a crisp , pleasing impression . <P> " You 've Got It Made . " Hughes was helped by an end-of-campaign visit to New Jersey by John Kennedy . If nothing else , the President 's trip got Hughes a lot of publicity-and made his name better known . Hughes began to feel confident that his massive get-acquainted effort had paid off when , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to a Hudson River dock and found himself recognized by about 150 working longshoremen . Cried one : " You 've got it made . " <P> In his victory , Dick Hughes became the first Roman Catholic ever to be elected Governor of New Jersey ( Mitchell likewise would have been ) . Hughes suffered a bitter personal loss two days before the election : his father , who as a small-town mayor had schooled him in politics , died of a heart attack . But the day after the election , his wife Betty announced that the Hugheses are expecting a tenth child in May . Said she : " It will keep me busy . I was afraid of being bored , now that the campaign is over . " As Governor of New Jersey , Dick Hughes will have plenty of problems . But at least he will no longer have to answer that question about " Who 's Hughes ? " He is a who.
