She has the face and figure of a Courbet bather ( " I look kinda round , not lean and lanky " ) , a home in Palm Beach , three handsome children , and a minor legend of a husband-Herbert ( " Peter " ) Pulitzer Jr. , 32 , a grandson of the publisher , who quit the easy , moneyed life to pick and pack oranges . It would be enough for almost any girl . But to her own mild astonishment , Lilly Pulitzer , 30 , finds herself hailed as a fashion designer . <P> Her fame rests on a single dress , unsurprisingly called " the Lilly . " Originally , she designed it as a uniform for herself to wear while selling fruits and juices in her husband 's Pulitzer Groves Fruit Shop . <P> But customers liked it , literally tried to buy the dress off her back . Lilly hired 18 seamstresses , and the store soon became a chaos of ladies sipping orange juice between fittings . <P> Somewhere between a chemise and a muumuu , the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dart at the bosom , costs anywhere from $25 to $45 . <P> There are six variations ; five of them have mandarin side slits , and one is floor-length .

" And if she had her way , shoes as well as underwear would be outlawed as accessories .

Her customers include Jackie Kennedy ( " She has quite a few of them , but I hate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season alone . 1,600 Lillies were grabbed up in Palm Beach . With her fame spreading , Lilly Pulitzer journeyed last week to Manhattan to sign contracts for nationwide distribution of her dresses , got firm orders from Magnin and Henri Bendel . Using her new-found business aplomb , she announced plans to market other designs : " the Minnie , " a children 's version of the Lilly , and " the Sneaky Pete , " a nightshirt for men .
