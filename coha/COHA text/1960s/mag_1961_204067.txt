THE KEY ( 183 pp. ) - Junichiro Tanizaki-Knopf ( $3.50 ) . <P> In the Japanese fiction brought to the U.S. since World War II , sex has usually been treated with discretion bordering on propriety-at least by Western standards . Now Junichiro ( The Makioka Sisters ) Tanizaki , 74 , Japan 's leading novelist and author of 119 books , has written a story about sex and marriage that is as explicit as any novel on the theme since Lady Chatterley 's Lover . <P> The Key is short , tense and psychologically sound . Its cast of four is so outwardly respectable that the story 's shock is absorbed in the commonplace aspect of their lives . Papa is a mild teacher of 55 who does his work , takes walks , spends hours in his study . He is nearsighted and , to his wife Ikuko , at least , physically unappealing . She is 44 and still most attractive , with " gently swelling lines . " What pains Papa is that in 20 years of marriage he has never seen her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no obvious enthusiasm . Now , as middle age slows him down , he fears that his inadequacy will destroy their marriage , for he suspects that Ikuko , even though she is undemonstrative about sex , is really avid for it . Papa adopts a program that may well offend readers who have never before thought of themselves as prim . He takes to French brandy and encourages his wife to get drunk with him . What is more , he encourages Kimura , a young friend of his marriageable daughter , to join them . When Ikuko succumbs to brandy and occasional fainting fits , Papa takes her to bed , throws powerful lights on her nude body , and photographs her in unconventional poses . To the young friend he allots the task of developing the film . <P> What happens is just what the husband expected . Young Kimura becomes interested in the wife and she in him . This in turn makes Papa jealous to the point where he performs sexual feats that astonish even his wife . The daughter , of course , catches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother has made them enemies . When the mother begins to rendezvous with her daughter 's young man , the four are catastrophically enmeshed in feelings of lust , outrage and jealousy that swiftly reach a point of no return . <P> When The Key was published in Japan , the obvious question was : Is it pornography or literature ? A little of both , perhaps . What gives it distinction is the author 's astuteness in observing a human crisis , his grave , almost solemn tone , and his simple , carefully considered prose . Author Tanizaki has created his effect without employing even a hint of the D. H. Lawrence vocabulary .
