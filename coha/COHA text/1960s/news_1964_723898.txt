txt In a big-city neighborhood , a small merchant watches resignedly as an unarmed , neatly dressed man scoops all the money out of his cash register ; if it is n't enough to satisfy the intruder , the merchant knows the man may well return for his automobile . On the outskirts , a bigger businessman sees his plush suburban house being stripped of possessions ranging from prized antique furniture to his wife 's kitchen utensils . Such episodes do not reflect any insidious new crime wave . They 're part of the Government 's crackdown on businessmen who dutifully withhold income and Social Security taxes from their employes ' paychecks , but then fail to fork over the funds to Uncle Sam . When they ca n't or wo n't come up with the money , the Internal Revenue Service is increasingly unsheathing its potent and quite legal weapon of seizing any of their goods its agents can lay hands on . While the weapon is still used quite sparingly , officials assure , it is frequently threatened and " unquestionably " being put to increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often its local offices take the step , but headquarters men here estimate that property seizures number in the thousands in a single year . Mostly , the offenders involved 1 ' 4 . Some small retailers and manufacturers who think they can gain by stalling on forwarding more taxes or are so hard-pressed that they spent the money they withheld and ca n't replace it . But in some cases , agents say , they have to seize homes , cars , furniture and other belongings to clear up arrears on individual income taxes , too . Delinquent Accounts Cut For the last two years the IRS has been using " accelerated procedures , " including letters , phone calls and visits by agents as well as actual seizures , to bring in the withheld tax money , and Internal Revenue Commissioner Mortimer Caplin has credited them with helping decrease the number of accounts newly becoming delinquent . The IRS applied these procedures in seeking $329 million in delinquent withheld taxes from 147,000 taxpayers in the fiscal year ended last June 30. up from $237 million from only 50,000 accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June , the tax collectors say , this more vigorous pursuit brought in nearly $188 million from 81,000 taxpayers before the funds were more than 10 days overdue . That was a jump of over 80 ' from the $103 million collected similarly from 18,000 accounts the year before . Of the delinquent dollars that do n't come in within the first 10 days . the bulk are dragged in later through the taxpayer 's eventual grudging surrender or seizure of his bank account . These ? approaches do n't work , though , when the taxpayer 's liquid assets simply are n't enough to meet the tax bill . And after 10 days , the IRS can take just about anything else that it can then auction off to raise the required money . " There are n't any debtors ' prisons , " an official notes , so seizing physical property is the Government 's last resort in such cases . Generally , this is n't done when there 's any dispute about the amount owed , but only when the taxpayer " neglects or refuses " to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... Actually , if the IRS suspects such a taxpriyer is deliberately trying to cheat the Government of its money , it can go farther , hauling an offender into court on criminal charges . But officials seldom find that either necessary or justified . Most of the people failing to pay up freely admit their obligation to Uncle Sam but just do n't have the cash to meet it . Seizure of their property , or the threat thereof suffices to get the Government its money . All but the most adamant relent at the sight of a revenue agent arriving with a fistful of tags with which to mark their goods as Government property , officials say . " Often , it 's the fear of embarrassment in front of customers and neighbors as much as anything " that causes them to give in , one official theorizes . That 's what happened , he recalls , with the owner of a plant nursery in an Eastern city of about 25,000 , " small enough so that all the prominent citizens knew each other . " Instead of depositing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is generally required , the nurseryman was holding onto them until he got a special notice from the IRS . " It gradually got worse  --  he 'd wait until the second notice before he 'd pay , then the third and the fourth , and the revenue officers would have to go out personally to collect , " the official relates . When the nurseryman showed no sign of willingness to pay sonic $8,000 he owed , tax agents came with their property tags and an ominous-looking sign that says " Warning " in big black letters and explains that no one had better tamper with the property since it has been seized " for non-payment of Internal Revenue taxes . " The nurseryman was from " one of the old families in the area and he apparently felt it could n't happen to him " until that point , an official says , but then lie " begged us not to do it " and quickly sold enough of his , property to raise the $8,000 . Spreading the Word Such an instance , if the taxpayer survives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ways but to encourage others not to risk similar trouble . " After that , he would come in to our office waving his returns and pay them in person , " the revenue-official smiles , " and he helped us a lot , too , by telling other fellows at his club that they 'd all better pay . " Even the notice stuck on his door did n't convince the proprietor of a Southern saloon that the Federal men could close him up , another official recalls . It was only after they warned him he could lose his cherished state liquor license , and he confirmed this with the state , that he decided they were n't bluffing anti came up with the money in 24 hours . When the amount due from a small merchant is small enough , agents frequently levy their Net htll'e order only on the contents Of the lot cash register .

There 's : 41 .. 0 the consideration that the revenue lost through cutting off the incomes of the employ 's , : or throwing their boss into bankruptcy may outweigh that gained through the set Z111% , . Hut even aside from the basic duty to enforce the law , officials reason that it is unfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without paying taxes , and that many businesses they seize are on the brink of bankruptcy anyhow or the bosses would n't rashly hold onto tax money . The increasing seizures and the publicity about them are " helping get the message across " and delinquencies in his area are declining , reports Irving Machiz , Baltimore District Director of the IRS . His men have made 20 seizures of physical goods in withholding cases so far this fiscal year , as many as in the whole past fiscal year . Sales of the properties since last July 1 , including a cocktail lounge , have yielded about $20,000 . In unloading seized property , the IRS men strive to get the highest possible price for their merchandise . By law , they must sell the goods publicly . Sometimes it 's by sealed bids , but usually by auction . Where the goods are specialized , officials often go beyond the usually legally required local newspaper advertising to place notices in appropriate trade magazines . That 's what they did with an Eastern lumber mill not long ago . Attracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auctioneering revenuers first put the property on the block in groups of related equipment , lumber , and the like . The initial bids totaled about $22,000 . In hopes of getting more , they gave would-be buyers the option of seeking the entire property in one chunk . " Finally we got the bid up to S33.000. or $2,000 more than we needed , so we could give some money back to the former owne ? . " the revenue man recalls . Those who run afoul of the revenuers are n't always so fortunate , of course , but the law does at least require that tax seizures can not leave a citizen hungry , naked and defenseless . The Internal Revenue Code says the agents have to leave " such items of wearing apparel and such school books as are necessary for the taxpayer or for members of his family , " and $500 worth of his fuel , provisions , furniture , livestock , poultry and " arms for personal use . " Those who have books and other things necessary for their work must be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to keep all of such property . What goodwill the IRS loses from the victims , it may possibly gain from auction fans who watch closely for announcements of the local sales , especially those involving goods of once well-to-do families . But the auctioneering agents do n't leave all the buyers happy . In a crowded auction in a shopping center near Washington , D.C. , one housewife eagerly paid $5 for an item listed as a " rotisserie . " When she found it was a broken-down portable barbecue grill without a spit , her complaint that it was deceptively labeled drew only the agent 's retort , " You bought it , lady .
