" YEARS ago , when William Somerset Maugham was a young man of 64 , he turned his thoughts to a subject of considerable importance to him : a fitting end to his own story . " Having held a certain place in the world for a long time , " Maugham wrote in The Summing Up , " I am content that others soon should occupy it . When nothing can be added without spoiling the design the artist leaves it . " <P> But the end was too long in coming : 27 years . The design was spoiled and it sorely strained the patience of the man who was dedicated to the idea that a well-constructed narrative should draw to a swift and orderly close . At his seaside villa on Cap Ferrat , going deaf and blind , Maugham complained bitterly at the way time 's slow hand was writing his last chapter . " I am sick of this way of life , " he said . " I want to die . " Earlier this month , he sank into a coma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer in a hospital outside Nice . And then last week it stopped . <P> His death committed to posterity the work of one of the most productive , most popular , most successful and most versatile authors of the century . This year alone , some 2,000,000 copies of his books will be added to the 80 million already in print . The Razor 's Edge has sold more than 5,000,000 copies since its appearance in 1944 . Of Human Bondage , published in 1915 when Maugham was 41 , has entered literature courses and has been adapted three times to film . At least two Maugham characters-Mildred Rogers in Bondage and Sadie Thompson in Rain-belong to that distinctive fictional company that the world will not forget . <P> Characters in Action <P> Rich beyond most writers ' dreams , Maugham became a kind of semipublic personage , a figure of Edwardian origin and habits , projecting an Ed wardian image on modern scenes . He looked like a character from one of his own novels : heavily lined patrician features , thin lips turned down at the corners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he napped after lunch wherever he happened to be-aboard a tramp ship plowing the South Seas , in a Burmese hut or an outrigger canoe . Churchill , Wells , Cocteau , the Duke and Duchess of Windsor , the Kings of Sweden and Siam called on him at Villa Mauresque , his Moorish retreat on the Riviera where , working never more and never less than four hours a morning , he set down most of his books . <P> Though he got away from common men as soon as he could and avoided them when possible , it was from common men that his invention took flight . " The great man is too often all of a piece ; it is the little man that is a bundle of contradictory elements , " he once said . His boast was that " I could not spend an hour in anyone 's company without getting the material to write at least a readable story about him . " <P> For this , he was often described as a mere storyteller . Today , after Joyce and Freud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and critics may reasonably question the depth of Maugham 's insights . But he was able to do supremely well what storytellers are supposed to do-to dramatize character by putting that character into action , a specific action that displays in kinetic terms his or her faults and virtues . <P> Measles and Rain
