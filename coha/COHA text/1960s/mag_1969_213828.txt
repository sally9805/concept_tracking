House Speaker John McCormack is known for his almost puritanical probity . He lives simply , drives a 14-year-old car , has amassed few worldly goods . Thus he sounds in character when he professes ignorance about the influence peddling that has emanated from his Capitol Hill office for years . What plagues McCormack-and threatens his winning another term as Speaker-is that the serial revelations about Martin Sweig , McCormack 's now suspended aide , and Nathan Voloshen , the Speaker 's longtime friend , make it increasingly incredible that McCormack could have overlooked their activities . <P> McCormack has attempted to pass Voloshen off as simply a personal friend with no special access to the Speaker 's official or political world . Investigations by the Justice Department , the FBI , federal grand juries in New York and Baltimore and journalists have found dozens of conspiracies involving Voloshen , including attempts to get favors for convicted mobsters , to profiteer in land schemes , to get Congressmen and executive agencies to do favors for Voloshen 's clients . Investigating Voloshen 's activities and his association with McCormack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voloshen has been close to McCormack for at least 24 years . Last week McCormack said that he had been introduced to Voloshen by an unremembered Congressman " some years ago , more than ten years ago , maybe more than that . " Sweig has said privately : " Voloshen was here when I came in " - and that was in 1945 . An even closer associate of McCormack 's recalls that " the Speaker looked upon Nat Voloshen as his friend and as a member of his family-his political family . " <P> &gt; A real member of Speaker McCormack 's family is Nephew Edward McCormack . The Speaker regards Edward almost as his own son and surely as a protege . In 1966 , Voloshen brokered political and financial labor union support for Edward McCormack 's unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Massachusetts . <P> &gt; In 1963 , Voloshen joined forces with Bobby Baker , then secretary to the Senate Democratic majority , who was later convicted of theft , conspiracy and tax evasion . Their scheme was to buy the Bank of Miami Beach . Baker promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Labor Racketeer Jack McCarthy agreed to pour union money into the vaults . Voloshen was to put together a syndicate to buy the bank . The deal collapsed when Voloshen was unable to meet his part of the bargain . <P> &gt;According to Herbert Itkin , an FBI informant , Voloshen worked both for and against the Haitian government of Franois ( " Papa Doc " ) Duvalier . In 1963 , Voloshen offered to persuade Congressmen to speak against continuance of U.S. aid to Haiti , for a fee of $5,000 per legislator . A year later , for a retainer from the Haitian government , Voloshen said he would invoke his influence to speed $4,500,000 in U.S. funds to build a Haitian airport . Itkin reported the scheme to U.S. officials , and the funds were immediately frozen , depriving Voloshen of his fee .
