LA VIE PASSIONNE OF RODNEY BUCKTHORNE by R. V. Cassill. 243 pages . Bernard Geis. $5.95 . <P> <P> The combination of Bernard Geis 's gamy publishing imprint and a hero who copulates to excess ( in fact , he suspects that he may die of it ) should summon from every throat the cry of ecch . But softly , softly . R. V. Cassill , author of The President , is one of those happy few novelists who see sex as a vehicle rather than a destination and have the wit to take off something more than the heroine 's clothes . Rodney Buckthorne is that ever popular fantasy figure , the artist in goat 's clothing , who prances irresistibly through several marriages ( his own and other men 's ) , countless boudoirs , the stodgy academic community and the massed roadblocks of commercial hypocrisy . Buckthorne 's mortal fatigue may be the result of amorous overindulgence . Then again it may just stem from the fact that he seems to have starred in so many recent comic novels . But Cassill 's prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of it Rodney may be worth one final evening 's visit before he is turned out to pasture .
