txt The St. Lawrence Seaway is 10 years old June 26  --  and so far a financial flop . Tolls cover operating and maintenance costs . But they are n't even enough to pay all the interest charges on capital costs of the huge project . Late this year and early next year , Canada and the United States will both be considering the need to raise tolls when this is next possible  --  in 1971 . Canada sought a 10 percent toll increase in 1967 on the Montreal-Lake Ontario secg tion . But Washington refused to go along , though granting Canada 73 rather than 71 percent of revenues collected on that international section of the seaway . In 1971 , Canada ( or the United States ) could set the tolls unilaterally on the locks it operates . But both countries have powerful opponents to hikes in the toll rates . Right now , seaway traffic has been impaired by a three-week strike of iron-ore handlers . If it is settled fairly soon , seaway officials look forward to record traffic of perhaps 50 million tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welland Canal section . It 's doubtful , though , that even this amount of traffic will solve the financial problem . Transportation policymakers are thinking seriously about proposing a new law that would allow various modes of transportation to own other modes . A railroad , for example , could own a freight forwarder . A trucking company could own a railroad . A barge line could own a trucking company . Currently , federal law prohibits one mode of transportation from owning another . To change the law , the Interstate Commerce . Act would have to be changed . For years railroads have tried to get permission to operate in other transport fields . But every time truckers have blocked them in Congress . . Now the same fight is shaping up again . But this time the balance of power may shift . Department of Transportation Assistant Secretary Paul Cherington , the agency 's top policymaker , says he favors a change in transportation-ownership laws . He told transportation executives that the cost-profit squeeze many of them will face over the next decade could force them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 there wo n't be ' single rail , truck , or air companies , but " intermodal companies operating by all means .

The American-style shopping center is going abroad . - A new company , recently formed in Ulster , plans to pump ? 3 million ( $7.2 million ) into Northern Ireland over the next two years . There it will build five 20-unit modern shopping centers , complete with stores , restaurant , gas station , and parking facilities . The first will go up in Bangor . How and why .. . Some " big-city " bankers are getting hot under the collar over the Federal Reserve System 's tight-money policy . It 's not that the bankers are opposed to the Fed 's goal  --  cooling off the economy 's inflationary tempo . But the bankers object to the uneven impact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks , they argue , is bearing the brunt of antiinflationary attack . These banks are finding it increasingly expensive to raise funds to accommodate borrowers . The vast majority of smaller banks are n't being squeezed nearly as hard . So far , the Fed has ignored the complaints . It wants to see the , big banks trim credit lines , especially to large corporate borrowers . These lines are still expanding . Private induStry has long hoped to gain ownership of the Atomic Energy Commission 's three gaseous-diffusion plants which produce enriched uranium . But their hopes have been dealt a major setback by the General Accounting Office . GAO argues that transfer of the plants at Oak Ridge , Tenn. , Paducah , Ky. , and Portsmouth , Ohio , to private owners would be " less favorable " than continued ownership by Washington . The government , says GAO , could expand the plants more easily than private industry . However , GAO thinks government ownership should be changed to possibly an independent government corporation .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
