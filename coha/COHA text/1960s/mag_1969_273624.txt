Representing the White House , Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird refuses to settle for anything less than Safeguard , arguing that it is the " minimal step necessary at this time to ensure the security of the American people . " But on Capitol Hill the Nixon ABM proposal is faced with diminished backing and is undermining Republican solidarity . There is concern among Nixon advisers that the President could suffer his first defeat this month when ABM comes to a vote in the Senate . Opponents now claim to have a majority . <P> Ignoring pressure to compromise , Laird took to the road last week with a hard line ABM argument . He told a group of newspaper editors in Florida that , " based on the best information available to me , " the Soviets will have 2,500 long-range missiles by 1975 . By contrast , he said , the U.S. now has 1,054 iCBMs and at present no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norfolk , Va. , Laird dismissed reports that the Administration is considering the face-saving compromise of proposing another year of research and development . Senate Republicans who oppose Nixon 's ABM plan want the Administration to begin strategic arms talks with the Russians , then use this as an excuse to delay construction of ABM sites . <P> Skeptical Mood . On Capitol Hill , opponents of ABM claimed last week that their mail was running heavily against Safeguard . There was a growing mood of skepticism about military spending in general , and a fear that the $7 billion ABM system might lead to further acceleration of the arms race . <P> The Senate Armed Services Committee held an opening hearing-in itself an extraordinary event-in which eight scientists presented now familiar supporting and opposing views on ABM . <P> Proponents argued that in an attack the ABM umbrella would protect enough ICBMs from destruction to allow the U.S. to retaliate . <P> But those against Safeguard countered that in seven years , by the time it is fully developed , the system may well be obsolete . Moreover , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty . They argued further that if Russia ever launched a massive saturation strike on U.S. second-strike missile sites , the proposed Safeguard system would be capable of stopping only an insignificant number of incoming ICBMs . <P> Faced with defections in his own party , including at least half of the normally loyal freshman Republican Senators , Nixon must now decide on a future course . If he chooses to press the fight , he may take the issue to the people via prime-time television .
