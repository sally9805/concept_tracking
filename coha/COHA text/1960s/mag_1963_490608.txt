Notes and Comment THE grand march of automation , which has already begun to make human existence unnecessary , and may well end by making it impossible , lately received a small but heartening check in its career . This snuh to the machine was administered by a doctor we know , who was on the verge of yielding to the siren hum of the inhuman . For years , our friend had subscribed to a telephone-answering service , but recently , in an access of modernity , he decided to employ a recording gadget instead , and so informed the answering service . By return mail , he received a letter of dissuasion and supplication from the company . Many people ( the letter reasonably pointed out I will be confused and annoyed by having a machine answer their call , and still hang up without leaving any message at all . Patients look for personal interest in their calls , and the cold and mechanical approach of a machine destroys personal confidence . Moreover : If the caller is difficult to understand , the machine can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not come over clearly . And , further : Callers have only 28 seconds to leave a message , An excited person can leave an incoherent message . On long-distance calls the machine message is terminated in 28 seconds , but the caller is charged full fee for a 3 minute call . He may resent the machine strongly . An appeal is made to the doctor 's professional loyalties and to his selfinte rest : Our service is handled by secretaries who when ill become patients of doctors . Machines ' ills are handled by mechanics . At last , setting argument aside , the letter closes with a plaintive cry from the heart : Please do n't lose faith in the human factor . Live secretaries can still do a wonderful job when given a chance . Our friend decided to retain the answering service , partly because of the arguments advanced , partly because of the appeal to his humanity , but chiefly because the letter was written in longhand , with a real pen . Italian Blood ADRESSING an Italo-American audience last Columbus Day , President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother 's family , the Fitzgeralds . The White House subsequently announced that the President was " merely having some fun " ( a statement apparently designed to insure that he did n't lose a substantial block of Irish votes in the course of picking up a few Italian ones ) , but the fact is that Mr. Kennedy was repeating , in slightly garbled form , a curious genealogical notion that has been in circulation for well over five hundred years . Briefly put , the notion  --  which , though some reputable historians have accepted it , has yet to be accepted by that stern bible of revealed genealogical truth , Burke 's Peerage  --  is that the Fitzgeralds of Ireland are descended from one or more members of the Gherardini family of Florence , who supposedly reached England in 1066 , with William the Conqueror 's army . Granted lands by William and his successors , the story goes on , the Gherardinis were absorbed into the Norman aristocracy ruling England ; a century later a younger son of the family took part in the Norman invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts by a large gift of land in what is now County Kildare ; and from him and his numerous descendants developed the famous family of the Fitzgeralds , or Geraldines , which dominated southern Ireland for several hundred years . As is the case with most agreeable genealogical leaps through time and space , the earliest leap is the hardest ; there 's no documentary proof whatever that the Gherardini who is said to have left Florence early in the eleventh century is connected with the Fitzgeralds who turned up in England in the twelfth . It 's possible : that the connection is merely verbal and coincidental , depending on the resemblance between " Gherardini " and " Geraldine . " " Fitz " is , of course , the Norman version of " fils , " and the first Fitzgeralds to he noted in English records were literally " sons of Gerald , " a Norman nobleman who lived during the reign of Henry I ( 1100-35 ) , but how the Fitzgeralds came to call themselves Geraldines is unknown ; it 's certainly remarkable that no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar variation on their names . That first Gerald married a Welsh princess named Nesta , who had been one of King Henry 's many mistresses and was the mother of one of his twenty-one illegitimate children . Nesta  --  known as the Helen of Vales , because of her great beauty  --  had several children by Gerald , their second son , Maurice , being the founder of the Irish branch of the family . It was Maurice who built Maynooth Castle , the oldest surviving Norman castle in Ireland , and from his sons sprang two illustrious lines  --  the Monster line , headed by the Earls of Desmond ( 1329-1601 ) , who died off during the wars of the sixteenth century , and the Leinster line , headed by the more durable Earls of Kildare ( 1316 to date ) . Today , Edward FitzGerald ( as Ins family spells the name ) , the seventh Duke of Leinster and the twenty-sixth Earl of Kildare , is the premier peer of Ireland and the nominal head of the Fitzgerald clan , which is currently estimated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first mention of the Gherardini-Geraldine connection dates hack only to 1413 , when an Irish priest named Maurice visited Florence and identified himself as a member of the Gherardini family in Ireland . Both families appear to have been flattered by this hitherto unsuspected relationship , for they took to corresponding with each other . During the Tudor period , Italian connections were especial ) fashionable ; when the Earl of Surrey fell in love with the thirteen-year-old Lady Elizabeth FitzGerald , he celebrated her virtues in a sonnet that began , " From Tuscane came my lady 's worthy race ; Fair Florence was sometime her ancient seat . " By the end of the sixteenth century , the link between the two families had been well forged , and several historians of the time , not content with stopping at the Gherardinis , carried the Fitzgerald ancestry in a straight line back to Troy . Our President is , by this reckoning , a descendant of Aeneas , and we 're only sorry that there are n't any Trojan votes to he gained by his coming out and saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eight publications included in the latest Library of Congress Publications in Print , sixteen are listed as " out of print . " Scientists Galore WE have lately looked in on three annual scientific conventions : the American Meteorological Society 's ea invention , attended by three hundred weathermen , at the Henry Hudson Hotel ; the joint meeting of the American Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teachers , attended by two thousand physicists , at the Statler Hilton ; and the meeting of the Institute of Aerospace Sciences , attended by two thousand aerospacemen , at the Astor . Forty-three hundred scientific gentlemen in all . We went first to the Astor , where we arrived in time for a late lunch with the aerospacemen and a speech prepared by Major General Ben I. Funk , of the United States Air Force , and delivered for him , in his absence , by Brigadier General Norman L. Peterson , also of the Air Force . It inti mated that while the peaceful exploration of space is very nice , the assembled scientists ought to consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we had a chat with Dr. Lloyd Mutz and Dr. R. H. Wilson , Jr. , who had both delivered papers that morning on the likelihood that intelligent life may exist elsewhere in the universe . It is the contention of Dr. Motz , who is a professor of astronomy at Columbia , that the Milky Way alone contains at least two hundred million planets where life much like ours exists . " If a star looks like the sun , and is of the same size and luminosity , it follows that it has the same attributes as the sun , " Dr. Motz told us . " It is therefore bound to have a retinue of planets , and , according to Bode 's law , planets in similar systems will be at similar distances from their stars , which means that there will probably he up to three planets per system capable of supporting lift . There are two or three hundred million stars like the sun in our own galaxy alone ! And there are a hundred billion galaxies ! So there are probably billions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , the right nucleic acids and the right nucleotides , which are the basic molecules of life , will occur . It 's as simple as that . " " The main deterrent to life as we know it that is , life based on the carbon atom  --  is that the universe is ninety-nine per cent hydrogen , " put in Dr.I , Vilson , a big walrus of a man who is with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . " In our solar system , only the planets nearer the sun have the necessary amount of heavier elements to support life , and so far there is no evidence to show that life based on a chemical other than carbon could exist . The planets of double stars probably can not support life , either , as in most cases their orbits would be too wobbly . Or take a star with one-third again the diameter of our sun ; its life would he only half as lung  --  too short a time for intelligent civilization to develop on any of its planets . But still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Drake , of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory , thinks that there are less than a thousand light-years between intelligent civilizations , and that if we can develop the right radio equipment we may be able to hear signals from other civilizations within thirty years . " WE thanked Dr. Motz and Dr. Wilson , and hurried out of the Astor , lest we miss the physicists at the Stotler Hilton . There we fell in with a tall , gaunt man , who proved to be Dr. Owen Chamberlain , a nuclear physicist from the University of California at Berkeley who , with Dr. Emilio Segrt , won a Nohcl Prize in 1959 . We asked him how he 'd done it . " I discovered the anti-proton , the mirror image of the proton , " he began , leaning against a desk in the hotel lobby while hundreds of other physicists swirled , eleetronlike , about . " The antiproton has the same weight as the proton but the opposite charge , and the two eat each other up like the gingham dog and the calico cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , because it had been postulated twenty-five years before , by Dr. Paul A. M. Dirac , another Nobel Prize-winner , and his theory was m danger of being considered dead . " Next , we chatted with Dr. Maurice M. Goldliaher , director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory and thus proprietor of the largest alternating-gradient synchrotron in the country half a mile in diameter and capable of mustering thirty-three billion electron volts  --  and then we talked briefly with Dr. William W. Watson , who was chairman of the Physics Department of Yale until recently , and who said he is most pleased with Yale 's latest acquisition , to be delivered in about a year . This is an Emperor Tandem Van de Graaff , the biggest electrostatic machine ever made , which is capable of accelerating atomic particles continuously , instead of in pulses , as Dr. Goldhaher 's synchrotron does . FROM the Statler Hilton , we made for the meteorologists ' meeting at the Henry Hudson . On the way , it began to rain , and the doorman at the Hudson , after si @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a hunch of had-weather men . The meteorologists , we soon learned , did n't give a rap about the weather outside , not only because they were in the middle of a cocktail party just then but because they , ton , had hitched their science to the stars . Right off , we ran into Brigadier General Peterson , whom we had heard that noon at the meeting of the Institute of Aerospace Sciences . " I 'm really a weatherman , " explained the General , who is commander of the Air Weather Service , U.S.A.F. " The Air Force is already training men to evaluate conditions in space . The Air Weather Service may be called upon to give temperature or density readings in space , or predictions nn proton showers caused by solar flares . The Air Weather Service will support the Air Force wherever it goes . If the Air Force establishes a lunar base , we will have a weatherman on the moon . " We turned next to Dr. William W. Kellogg , of the Rand Corporation , who had earlier delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can tell you only two things about the weather on Venus , " said Dr. Kellogg , a muscular young man . " First , it 's hot  --  around six hundred degrees Fahrenheit  --  and , second , it 's foggy . We have much more feeling for the conditions on Mars . We can sec white clouds hovering around the mountaintops , and dust storms , too . The dust storms  --  far more severe than any storms on earth  --  are at their worst during the Martian equinox , and in 1956 there was a celebrated dust storm that obliterated the entire surface of Mars for two weeks . From the dust storms , we can plot highs and lows on Mars . For a time , one meteorologist made up weather maps and forecasts for Mars . " Dr. Kellogg introduced us to Dr. David S. Johnson , who is deputy director of the meteorological-satellite laboratory of the United States Weather Bureau . He told us of plans for a new weather satellite , Nimbus , which will survey the whole earth once a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty per cent of the earth in a day ) and will radio weather pictures to anyone below who has the necessary equipment ; he added that the equipment will be inexpensive . Finally , we joined a solitary meteorologist , who identified himself as a specialist in forest meteorology . When we asked him what , exactly , forest meteorology is , he replied , " Ever notice that it 's cooler in a forest ? That 's forest meteorology . It 's a nice , quiet science , which does n't cost anything , and do you think anybody else is interested in it ? No ! " ? OVERHEARD in Harvard Square , one youth to another : " I 've never read it , but I took an exam on it once . " Solo MAURICE CHEVALIER , who will he seventy-five in September and is currently romping through a warmly acclaimed one-man show of songs , skits , and dances ( including the Twist ) seven nights a week at the Ziegfeld Theatre , as as wearing a double-breasted blue pinstriped suit , a white shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he welcomed us one afternoon last week to his suite at the Drake Hotel and graciously addressed himself to the question we had come to ask : " How do you do it ? " " The most important thing is not what you eat or drink , or anything like that , you see , " he said , speaking with the old magical accent . " The most important thing is something inside . I feel that it has always been my hick to have something in me that was sunny . From the beginning  --  you know , I started to make a living out of singing songs and trying to be funny and all that when I was very young , you see , when I was nut even twelve  --  and always I have been doing on the stage things that were gay , that were popular but at the same time were in a way healthy . I mean to say , I believe in the rosy side of life . I know that life has many , many dark sides for everybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . But I believe in bringing to the people the encouragement of living , and I think I 'm lasting so long in the interest of the people through something that comes out of my personality and out of my work , which is just to he sort of a sunshine person , you see . " I think also my ancestry has helped Inc very , very much . My mother was Flemish , and my father was from the north of France , which is a part of the country where the people are also solid and sort of strong , you see . But I put that sort of energy and tenacity and courage that I have had all my lift down to my mother 's Flemish blood in me . I think so . She died when she was seventy-seven . I was lucky enough to make her outside of need during all the second half of her life . My father  --  it is an old story . He left us when we were very young . I do n't know whether he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No . All en ) . lift , I have had the gift of energy , you see , so that I have never thought of sparing myself or trying to economize my strength , or anything like that . But I have got to he in accord with myself , you see . I have got to feel that I 'm doing the best I can , and if I have that sort of harmony with myself , then I feel that is about the best I can ask . Of course , I get angry with myself . There are times when I am not very proud of myself , the same as anybody , because I am not Jesus Christ , but I 'm always trying to do the best I can , to behave as a nice Christian in every cir cumstance . Religion does not play an enormous part in my life . I believe . I believe , but I very seldom go to Mass . No . I like now and then to go into a church when it 's empty , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm a very simple fellow , you see  --  a fellow who wants to help and who wants to bring , to bring the nice , warm side of life , you see . And I think that I give that on the stage when sometimes myself I 've been sort of worried or anguished , or things like that . But I feel that that 's sort of a flame that keeps on burning in me and which allows me to keep a real , absolutely honest enthusiasm about life . And now I want to try to really become the best an old man can become , because I believe that is the hardest of all the fights that you can have during your life . The most difficult victory is to age gracefully and intelligently , and that is what I 'm trying to do . " Of course , when you get to my age  --  I am already saying I am seventy-five , because I feel it is a nicer number and more round than seventy-four and a half  --  then you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a perforraer . All my life , I have been a good cater . I have been a good drinker . I have been a good everything . But when you get to seventy-five and want to go on doing a one-man show , a real one-man show , you have to drink less , you have to eat less , you have to do a lot of things less , so that you can be in the best possible condition to do what you like best , which is in my case performing for a friendly audience . I 've only been thinking about that sort of moderation since a very few years . Now I watch what I eat , but not too seriously , you see . For breakfast this morning I had a small orange juice and but coffee with hot milk . That 's all . For lunch , we had an invitation with the French consul . My friend Charles Boyer was there , and some other people . We had caviar , we had ( it was a light lunch ) ? we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how you call that ; little peas ) , and I had yoghurt . It is very good and nourishing . And I drank water and coffee . It 's always the best pos sible food , but always on a very simple side . Before the performance , I have just a cup or two of tea . After the performance , I have supper , and then I may not he quite so reasonable , you see , because at that time I 've done my job . My stomach is all relaxed because I have no more responsibility until the following night , so I can eat . Sometimes , I cat some pretty heavy things  --  maybe a big omelette and a big pack of French-fried potatoes , which arc all right for me if I do n't take too many , but in a case like that I may eat as much as I feel . When I eat a little too much , I feel during the night that I 've been eating a little too much , and that makes me a hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet . No . It 's only that I try to he moderate , because I have to : se moderate . I now weigh ( I do n't know how many pounds it makes ) ? I am now eighty-four or eighty-five kilos , and I think I ahould be eighty . " Sometimes I may eat more than I should , but I 've stopped drinking , thank God , and I do n't smoke . I do n't remember w hat it is to smoke . That was thirty years ago , and I was a very heavy smoker . I was not a very heavy drinker . No . But a good drinker . Two years ago , my doctor insisted that I should stop entirely drinking , and I must say since then I 've been in a much better health and much gayer , because , you see , at the moment I drink , I feel sort of lift up , I feel full of enthusiasm and of happiness , but when I start digesting , and the drink passes somewhere around the liver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of depressed , sort of sad . Now I do n't drink a drop , but I have a trick  --  a sart of comprom'se , you see . sniff . You call it sniffing , no ? For example , at lunch today I sniffed vodka at the beginning . Vodka does n't sniff . It 's almost like water . Then some white wine and some good Bordeaux , which I sniffed very , very seriously . I sniff right on through the courses , and I have the impression that I have had some drink , you see . Funny enough , it 's good . " At my time of life , I prefer to go to bed early at night . I have seen all the night clubs in the whole world hundreds of times , so I 'm happier to have a short supper , whether in a restaurant or in my own apartment , and then go to bed . When I sleep seven hours , Pm making a big success . When I sleep six hours , I 'm satisfied . Very often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with between four and five hours . It is no trouble to go to sleep . I start reading a little hit , but not very far . In fact , last night 1 fell asleep with my glasses on , so that shows that I do not fight sleeping . Oh , some nights , when I 'm too worried about something , when I 'm too anguished about something that I feel might disturb my sleep , then I may take one sleeping pill , but as a rule I try not to . I am not too much for pills . I am less frightened of a light tranquillizer than I would he of a pep pill . If I 'm tranquil , I think I can get in me the energy to have the pep . I would n't like to force that , because I would think I 'm cheating a hit . I take vitamins . I have a very good doctor , a French doctor , here in New York , and when I feel a bit tired , or anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key , you see . On the way to New York , I went first to Hollywood to make a cameo part in a picture , and I developed a terrible cold and laryngitis , and all that , so I had to take a lot of antibiotics , you see . You have to be careful , because they say those antibiotics help you on one side and sort of hit you on the other side . So when I arrived in New York , I told my doctor about the antibiotics , and he said , ' All right , I am going to help you , ' and I must say that what he has given me is very , very light but surely very , very good , because up to now I 've been doing my job without feeling tired at all and always very happy . " I like to wake up early in the morning , because the morning has always been very important for me . I awaken between seven and eight , but I stay in bed . In the morning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . I have my breakfast , and then I read and write and telephone , and all that , and then I get up around ten-thirt ? or eleven and do a little exercise . Not very much  --  only a few movements that my masseur told me to do every morning to try to keep supple , you know . In Marnes-la-Coquette , my home , which is just outside of Paris , I have a wonderful masseur , but I 'm not rich enough to have him travel with me . I wait until I 'm back home to put my old body in his hands . If it was n't for that man , I 'm sure I would have had trouble with arthritis , because five or six years ago I began to feel that it was getting me , you see . And that man , in less than a few hours , changed everything , and since I 've had massage from that man , I 've never thought of arthritis . In ? Marnes-la-Coquette , I have the massage three times a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ABC kind of exercise  --  not more than five minutes  --  and then I get ready for the stroll before lunch . I like to walk very , very much . I like to look at the shops and see what is new and what can tempt me , and things like that . I know every shop in Fifth Avenue . I know every shop in Madison Avenue . First of all , I am a great lover of New York . I can stroll very well two hours , two hours and a half , and never feel even a little hit tired . " When I work , as I am going to work tonight , then I have to take a little rest between four-thirty and seven-thirty , which is the time I go to the theatre to do my show , you see . During that time , I read a hit and I write and do the same as I do in the morning , except that I try to nap . Sometimes , when I 'm a hit tired , maybe I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only lose a little hit of consciousness , maybe only fifteen minutes , it does me a lot of good. ? I feel all fresh and new and ready to do my work . I enter on the stage to give the very best I can , to give the very best I have in me , because that is my moment of the day . The rest is only filling in . That is my great reason for living .
