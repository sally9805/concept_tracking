When meprobamate , best known by one of its trade names as Miltown , hit the tranquilizer market in 1955 , it became a runaway bestseller because it seemed to do its work with a minimum of undesirable side effects . Now , Miltown ( also marketed as Equanil ) is in for a letdown . It is dropped from the U.S. Pharmacopeia new edition , which becomes effective Sept. 1 . <P> Behind this action lies a growing disillusionment with Miltown on the part of many doctors . Some doubt that it has any more tranquilizing effect than a dummy sugar pill ; others think that it is really a mild sedative that works no better than older and cheaper drugs , such as the barbiturates . A few physicians have reported that in some patients Miltown may cause a true addiction , followed by withdrawal symptoms like those of narcotics users " kicking the habit . " <P> Miltown will still be available for doctors to prescribe as they see fit . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is contemplating no action against it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians and pharmacists , is the most prestigious of the doctor 's reference books on drugs .
