THE PREMIER ; THE TRAIN by Georges Simenon. 248 pages . Harcourt , Brace &; World . $4.95 . <P> Belgian-born Georges Simenon is a great tattletale . His endless series of novels now total about 500 , include a mound of pulpy romances , scores of Inspector Maigret mysteries , and dozens of gritty , graceful character studies such as The Premier and The Train . These were first published separately in France some years ago . Both are typical , tidy iterations of an old Simenon thesis : escape in any real sense is impossible . <P> In The Premier , the intended escape is from oblivion . An aged ex-Premier of France , part petty household tyrant , part national monument , lives in impatient retirement , awaiting his chance to settle old scores and topple old foes . When he discovers that his servants are all government spies , that his secret papers are no longer secret , and that his power is nil , he decides that since he has been politically dead for years , he may as well relax and die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initially from invading Nazis . A diffident , dutiful French shopkeeper hustles his pregnant wife and daughter into the first-class carriage of a refugee train , himself crawls into an overcrowded freight car , and settles down contentedly to escape his dull , daily round . Contentment is compounded when a forlorn Jewish girl beds down with him . When his family gets lost in the wartime shuffle , the lovers happily play house in a refugee reception center until the missing wife and child are found . Then the lovers part . Many months later , fleeing the Gestapo , the girl timidly hunts up the shopkeeper at his home . Comfortably captured in the good old daily round , he refuses the risk of hiding her , and she is caught , tried , shot . <P> Simenon 's prose rejoices in the virtues of his virtuosity : it is economical , supple , precise . The stories tend to go on too long , as though Simenon were afraid that he had not really gotten to the heart of his characters . But he writes entertainingly about corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without judging them .
