For three fruitful decades Archaeologist Walter Emery of the University of London has been exploring the inexhaustible sands of Egypt . Much of his work was done near the great Step Pyramid at Saqqara , 15 miles from Cairo , where he excavated nine mastabas ( tombs capping burial shafts ) of the earliest Pharaohs . This season he picked a low-lying stretch of desert north of the pyramid , where the soil was colored by pottery fragments . Somehow , the archaeologists who have worked over the area year after year had all missed the promising spot . <P> Father of Medicine . Playing his educated hunch , Professor Emery dug into the desert and discovered another buried mastaba . When he uncovered its southern burial shaft , he found it filled with thousands of mummified ibises . The bodies of the long-legged birds were wrapped in cloth , stuffed into pottery jars , and piled up like bricks . Digging deeper in the ground , Emery found an amazing network of ancient tunnels , most of them piled to their roofs with ibis mummies . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated to Emery that somewhere near by had stood the long-lost shrine of Imhotep , the Egyptian father of medicine , who was probably the first intellectual to impress his name on history . <P> The Step Pyramid itself is a monument to Imhotep . It was built as the tomb of Pharaoh Zoser , who reigned about 2980 B.C. , but Imhotep was its architect . And because it is the oldest stone pyramid , the Egyptians have credited Imhotep with inventing the art of building with cut stone . He was also Zoser 's prime minister , a magician , sage , proverb maker , and patron of the scribes who ran the Egyptian bureaucracy . Century by century through Egypt 's long history his reputation grew . During the Ptolemaic dynasty ( 323-30 B.C. ) , when Greeks ruled Egypt , he was identified with Asclepius , their mythical source of the healing arts ; sick people limped to his shrines by the thousands to pray for miraculous cures . <P> Healing Ibises . The most magnificent of these shrines , or Asclepieions , was somewhere near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the healer himself was believed to be buried near by . The pilgrims who came to Saqqara sacrificed ibises , which were sacred to Imhotep . Their carcasses were mummified and tucked away underground so that their souls would journey to the god and ask his healing favor . The shrine was deserted many centuries ago , and desert storms erased all surface traces of it . Not until Emery broke into its catacombs did anyone know what had become of the mum mies of all those ibises . <P> The professor , however , is bored with the embalmed birds . They are , after all , of Ptolemaic age , distressingly young for Egypt . But the network of tunnels apparently covers more than a square mile , and Emery intends to explore them thoroughly , no matter how many mummies he must disturb . His goal is the hidden tomb of history 's first intellectual , and the mummy of the great Imhotep himself .
