Broadcasting is the least discussed , most misunderstood and under-reported facet of our modern life . Certainly the news of broadcasting , the people in and around broadcasting and the problems of broadcasting need a broadcast forum . <P> - John Kiermaier , President , Educational Broadcasting , Inc . <P> The subject up for discussion on the TV panel show was television news , and one of the guests weighed in with a surprising suggestion . " I heartily believe , " said CBS Newscaster Walter Cronkite , " that in 1968 , the political parties ought to ban television from the floor of the convention hall . It certainly makes a mockery of the fact that this is a convention of delegates who are supposed to be listening to the speeches and tending to some sort of business on the floor . " Cronkite added wryly : " I 'll probably be read out of every honorary journalism society in the world . " <P> On New York 's educational Channel 13 last week , ABCs Howard K. Smith and NBC 's Edwin Newman joined Cronkite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and open discussion that can be a credit to television . Boldly , they put their own medium on the firing line-and fired at will . <P> <P> Passing the Buck . Neither Smith nor Newman endorsed Cronkite 's view on changing convention coverage , but on other scores both were as outspoken as he . " I think American TV documentaries are in a rut , " observed Smith . " We 've carried the concept of balance too far . We 've got to the point where we 're almost afraid to make a point . " Cronkite demurred : " If the intention is to illuminate , you should illuminate both sides of the issue because the issue has two sides . " Smith overruled him : " Truth is not necessarily halfway between any two points . " <P> Not all the comment was self-critical . In re-examining the press 's performance in Dallas after President Kennedy 's assassination , Cronkite felt inclined to pass the buck . " We turned the cameras on the kind of confusion that the press has always created in similar circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the public was able to see how all of the press operates . What we did was show the confusion , and therefore we got the blame . " <P> Newman upheld TV 's right to Milquetoast programming , even on newscasts : " I do n't think it 's realistic to expect organizations that live by advertising to pioneer in fields that may offend people . " With some justice , he made news brevity on TV a virtue : " One reason we have such a great impact is that we edit . We edit to a degree that I think it is fair to say the New York Times does not . It does n't edit very often ; it compiles . " <P> <P> Footnote . At one point , Howard Smith insisted unblinkingly that " the civil rights bill would have passed into obscurity if television had not existed " -a statement that went strangely unchallenged by Colleagues Cronkite and Newman , or by Moderator William A. Wood , director of the Office of Radio and Television at Columbia University . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cronkite . " But do we cover all the news ? I think we cover as much news as many of the bad newspapers in this country . " Said Newman : " I think we cover as much news as it is possible for people to take in. "
