" His own classic answer to the problem , " Go West , young man , " was no lasting remedy-unless one can ignore Los Angeles . Though Editor Greeley disapproved of the country 's rapid urbanization , he nonetheless divined accurately one of the American 's most deep-rooted traits : his hankering for city lights . <P> In 1966 , 67% of the nation 's population is jammed into 9% of its acreage . In all , 130 million people inhabit the 224 U.S. communities that are officially classified as metropolitan. * By A.D. 2000 , 80% of all Americans-more than today 's entire population-will be city dwellers . In those 35 years , as Lyndon Johnson has warned , " we will have to build in our cities as much as we have built since the first colonist arrived on these shores .

Indeed , the President himself , as James MacGregor Burns points out , has become the " Chief Executive of Metropolis .

At the same time , the " oceanic amplitude of these great cities , " as Walt Whitman rhapsodized in 1870 , has cast up a titanic tide of troubles . <P> If no U.S. metropolis even approaches the appalling anarchy of far-off cities such as Calcutta , Hong Kong , Rio or Tokyo , the worst areas of urban America have in varying degrees almost every ill to which the industrial society has fallen heir : unemployment , disease , crime , drug addiction , poor education , family disintegration-and slums . The middle class , the bulwark of good government in any community , continues as a result to migrate to the suburbs , helping to create the problem of proliferating racial ghettos . Almost every major U.S. city must fight advancing physical decay and increasing squalor , particularly for Negro populations , which within 15 years may outnumber whites in at least half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
