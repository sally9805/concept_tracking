The more I slept near her , the more we bathed in the same tub , the more we ate from the same plate , the more like her I became . Our clothes were even in the same closet and drawers . It drove me insane to look for my shirts among her underpants . The children could n't tell us apart . There was only one thing to do . Kill myself , or kill my female self . With her gone my potency returned , my hair stopped falling out , my muscles can push again against my skin and leap from my bones when I walk . With her gone , I 've succeeded in pressing my breasts back inside my chest where they belong . There is only one figure for my boys to look up and see now .
