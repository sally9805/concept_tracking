This year , the day of the Lord 's Resurrection coincides with the anniversary of our people 's crucifixion . <P> - Former Premier George Papandreou <P> As the Greeks observed their Orthodox Easter , which the Julian calendar places a week later than in the West this year , they also marked the end of their first year under military rule . To celebrate the occasion , the junta planned military parades , ordered flags flown from every building and issued new gold and silver coins bearing its symbol : the shadow of a soldier against the background of a phoenix rising from the ashes . The regime of Colonel-turned-Premier George Papadopoulos hinted that it would make some surprise announcements , perhaps including an amnesty for many of its 2,500 political prisoners , 100 of whom were released just before Easter . And , in an effort to ensure that the celebra tions would not be marred by dissident voice , it placed under house arrest two of its bitterest critics , George Papandreou , 80 , the leader of the big and now banned Center Union Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed Premier . <P> <P> In Papandreou 's case , the precaution did no good . Anticipating a crackdown , " the Old Fox " - as he is widely known in Greece-slipped out before his arrest a recording of a ringing anti-junta speech to Britain , where the BBC 's Greek-language broadcast beamed his defiant words into sets all over Greece . <P> In the eight-minute speech , Papandreou , who was Premier in 1963-65 , called on the free world to boycott the junta so that " it will be worthy of the name . " At home , he called on the Greek army to reassess its own support of the junta in light of the fact that the ruling colonels had produced no proof of a planned Communist takeover , their rationalization for seizing power . Under Greece 's stern martial law , Papandreou 's blast was tantamount to treason , but the junta took no further action against him for the time being , ridiculing his statement as a play for a return to power . <P> Economic Slump . Though the junta has brought stability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has little to celebrate on its first an niversary except its own dogged determination to hold onto power . The country is still ruled by decree , and the press remains under tight censorship . Because of the period of political uncertainty that preceded the coup , the Greek economy , which had been growing nearly as fast as Japan 's , was headed into a recession even before the colonels seized power . Despite all sorts of pump-priming measures , such as the cancellation of $260 million in farmers ' debts to the state bank , Greece 's economy remains in low gear . <P> Tourism fell 14% in 1967 , and is off badly this year . The construction trade , Greece 's second biggest industry after agriculture , has experienced a slump . Foreign investment has declined some 30% below the 1966 level .
