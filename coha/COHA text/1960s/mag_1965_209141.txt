The Great Race is the most expensive comedy ever filmed ; but there the superlatives end : it is not exactly the worst . <P> The movie 's main handicap is that Director Blake Edwards ( The Pink Panther , A Shot in the Dark ) has put it together like a hobbyist assembling a model kit into an authentic reproduction of a 1908 Hupmobile , " Comedy is a science , " he says . " The only way to learn a science is to study , and the only way to study is to look at what the old masters did and take from them . Race is an accumulation of dozens of the great comedy clichs . " <P> Tony Curtis is the spoof hero . As a turn-of-the-century daredevil called The Great Leslie , he wears nothing but white , performs death-defying feats with never a hair misplaced nor a dirty fingernail . From time to time his teeth literally sparkle . Jack Lemmon , reading his lines at a steady 130 decibels , is the spoof villain . As black-clad Professor Fate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gnomish assistant ( Peter Falk ) , he is forever launching devilish devices against Leslie and forever being Foiled Again . Natalie Wood is a pert , cigar-puffing suffragette who goes along as girl reporter on the great automobile race from New York tp Paris , via Siberia . <P> With a wham and a bam , a sock and a pow , Director Edwards ' accumulation of cliches explodes around the world , pausing for Curtis to demonstrate his torso and his skill with the epee , and for Lemmon to do a tedious bit as a faggish Mittel-European prince . No pastiche of the old masters would be complete without a pie fight . This one is the Ben-Hur of pie fights-it splatters more than 2,000 real cream pies of assorted flavors , and took five days to shoot . The scene even has a plot : Will Tony Curtis get one in the snoot or wo n't he ? Or would it be a waste of perfectly good pie ? It would be a shame to divulge the answer . This is about the most interesting development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
