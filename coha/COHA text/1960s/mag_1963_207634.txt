Criticism by Republicans of President Kennedy 's tax cut bill was predictable . So was that of such a fiscal conservative as Democrat Harry Byrd . The bill can probably pass over their opposition , but it will need down-the-line support from liberals . And for that reason the man whom White House strategists are most worried about is Tennessee 's Albert Arnold Gore , 55 , a liberal member of the Senate Finance Committee whose dislike of the bill may influence other liberals . <P> A farm boy from Possum Hollow , near Granville , Tenn. , Gore worked his way through a state teachers college at Murfreesboro by teaching country school . Later , after taking courses offered by the Y.M.C.A. , he got a law degree , decided to enter politics , campaigned with a fiddle that scraped out lively hillbilly tunes , and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1938 , when he was 30 . Gore earned a reputation among colleagues as a remarkably diligent worker-in his first year , during a House economy drive , he was the Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $800 million to federal housing funds . <P> He Was Bitten . After 14 years in the House , Gore handily won the Senate seat of aging Kenneth McKellar in 1952 , soon won choice assignments on the Finance , Foreign Relations and Joint Atomic Energy committees . He was the Senate 's chief sponsor of the 1956 bill creating the interstate highway system , then killed Eisenhower 's plan for bond financing and substituted his own pay-as-you-go tax system . In 1958 , he was the first Senator to propose a treaty with Russia banning atmospheric nuclear testing . <P> Twice , Gore came within hailing distance of the Democratic nomination for Vice President . The first time was in 1956 , when Adlai Stevenson was looking for a running mate . Recalls Wife Pauline : " I had been picking vice-presidential bugs off Albert for a year , but when Governor Stevenson announced the nomination was open , I looked at Albert and discovered I had missed one and it already had bitten him . " On the first ballot Gore , with 178 votes , trailed Fellow Tennessean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the handwriting , withdrew , and supported Kefauver , who won . Again in 1960 Gore thought he had a chance , was disappointed when Kennedy picked Lyndon Johnson . <P> He Was Opposed . A meticulously groomed man with a handsome head of silver hair , Gore neither smokes nor drinks , is one of the Senate 's more accomplished speakers and an authority on fiscal policy . His money views were forged under a courthouse maple in Carthage , Tenn. , where , as a youth , he talked with then-Representative Cordell Hull about foreign trade , taxation , public debt . At its simplest , Gore 's fiscal philosophy is that the national economy should be stimulated by increased public works , not by tax cutting .
