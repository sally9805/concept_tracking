PASSAGE OF ARMS ( 246 pp. ) - Eric Ambler-Knopf ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> The typical Eric Ambler reader-a man who , in his own fancy , wears a belted raincoat and knows an automatic from a revolver-places himself in the author 's hands as he would commit himself to those of a trusted bartender . He is entirely confident of the craftsman 's skill and gratefully aware that such competence is increasingly rare . The latest Ambler amble ( his first in four years ) is less umbrous than such cloak-and-Luger exercises as A Coffin for Dimitrios and The Schirmer Inheritance , but it should be no disappointment . <P> The locale is that intrigue-ridden region that the Orient Express never quite reached-the Orient . As he is so fond of doing , British Author Ambler begins with a fragile seed of evil : a cache of arms established in Malaya by Communist terrorists after World War II . The terrorists are killed in an ambush , and the arms dump is lost . But a thoughtful Indian plantation clerk deduces that it must exist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Months later the clerk finds the weapons , still unrusted , and he feels that it would be a pity to turn such a windfall over to the police . <P> Eventually , a middle-aged American engineer named Greg Nilson , sightseeing in Hong Kong with his wife , is suckered into smuggling the weapons to anti-Communist rebels in Indonesia . The amateur gunrunner winds up in an Indonesian prison that is not at all sanitary , and when rebels begin to ventilate the building with antitank guns , Nilson is hardly consoled by the thought that the affair will make dandy cocktail conversation back in Wilmington-if he ever gets back . <P> Before his fate is settled , a sharp-witted U.S. vice consul takes a hand , and this plot twist may cause flutters of optimism at the Department of State . Novelist Ambler 's consular chap , a quiet American but no chump , may well be the U.S. 's first foreign representative to receive polite fictional treatment since Upton Sinclair 's Lanny Budd .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
