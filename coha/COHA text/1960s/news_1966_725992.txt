txt BY H. R. II . EDWARD , DUKE OF WINDSOR AS TO THE EVENTS IN LISBON which supplied a sudden new turn in our lives , I have these three points to make : FIRST : Winston Churchill had become prime minis ' ter , and wanted us to return to Britain . Ile sent a flying boat to Lisbon to take us back for the second time . His personal advice to me was not to quibble about terms , but to come home and wait patiently while he " worked things out . " But I could not in honor take this line . The year before , while we had been in England , the presence of the duchess at my side had never been acknowledged , even perfunctorily . Before going back , I wanted an assurance that simple courtesies would be forthcoming . Winston could not manage this . From a distance , Wharf Insisted on may look to be of small value . But the perspective of my life had changed , and the matter loomed mighty large for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bahamas . It might not have been my choice of an appointment but I had to leave Europe and was anyway anxious for further development . No Dealings with Germans or Spaniards THIRD : There was never any dealing by me with German or Spanish agents in Lisbon . Tales of the most dubious origins keep bubbling up that Hitler 's agents tried to get me to desert in exchange for great sums of gold and even a promise to put me back on the throne after they had won the war . Only the other clay I read an announcement of a forthcoming book by a minor nazi burocrat , wholly unknown to me , which promises to reveal a scheme for kidnaping anu wnistung us oil to Germany before we started across the Atlantic . I can only hope that the tale is more plausible as fiction than the plot itself ever was . These observations aside , I shall add now that I look back with pleasure and satisfaction to my five years in the Bahamas . I worked hard and tried to do a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend-lease base for the anti-submarine forces operating in the western Atlantic , and staging air fields were built for the fleets of war planes being fed into the African and European theaters . And once the United States entered the war , about 16 months after I took up my post , the islands fairly hummed . Yet , for sheer excitement and mystery combined , the most continuously engrossing episode to occur during my terms as governor was the one that stemmed from the only murder case I 've ever been caught up in : the killing by bludgeon strokes of Sir Harry Oakes , the wealthy mining magnate , in his bed during the night of July 8 , 1943 , while the skies poured rain . By then , having been in the Bahamas nearly three years , I had come to know Harry Oakes quite well . Ile was a bluff , rough sort , too proud to give up in his wealth WS plain prospector 's ways . His murderer is , or murderers are , yet to be identified . Enlarges Circle of American Friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r experience was the enlargement of my circle of American friends and the widening of my view of American life . I made several trips up and down the east coast of the United States and stopped off several times in Washington on the colony 's business . These stops usually brought me into President Frank lin D. Roosevelt 's company . He was not exactly a stranger to me . More than two decades before , in 1919 , when as prince of Wales I was in America for the first time , he had been my gay and vitty companion , as assistant secretary of the navy , when I visited the naval academy at Annapolis . Barely two months after my own arrival in the Bahamas , he turned up aboard the cruiser Tuscaloosa , I quickly discovered in conversing lightly with him that , as a fisherman , he knew a lot more about the other islands than I had had time to learn . In 1942 , I saw him again , this time in Washington . lie had me for lunch at the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President became the soul of affability . After the coffee , and not wishing to overstay my welcome , I made to bid good-by to the President , saying that I had several other appointments that afternoon . To my surprise , he asked what they were , and jotting the names on a slip of paper , he called in an aid , gave him the slip ; and directed him to inform the individuals that I would not be coming because the President wanted to spend more time with me . F. D. R. Talks and Talks For two hours , I listened while he talked on about all manner of things  --  from his experiments in integrating Negroes into the armed forces , thru his familiarity with the French countryside over which he had cycled in his youth , to the military reasoning behind the American decision to mass and train troops in Britain for the invasion of the continent . He talked and talked . To this day , I have n't a clew as to what he really wanted of me . But from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king , I rather suspect it was because he , a man who had achieved on his own the highest summit of political power in a man 's reach , was curious about the motives and reasoning of a man who could give up an inherited position of comparable renown . The last time I saw F. D.R. was in the fall of 1944 , right after lie returned with Winston Churchill from the second Quebec conference where great decisions were taken for conducting the war strategy thru its final stages . Asked to Join Them , I happened to be in New York , and a message came saying that the President wished me to join him at Hyde Park where Winston was his guest . When F. D. R. was wheeled into the entrance ball to greet me was shocked by his appearance . He had grown very thin since our last meeting and the skin of his face had taken on a strange transparency . I must have made an involuntary gesture of surprise which the President was quick to notice . " Ah , " he exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors wanted me to lose some weight and I feel all the better for that , " His View on Condition On being conducted to another room where Winston was working on some papers , I asked him what he thought about the President 's condition . " What do you think ? " Winston countered . " He looks to me like a very sick man . " Winston spoke up . " 0 , no , " he insisted . " It is only that he is tired , very tired . " At luncheon later on , when I sat next to Mrs. Roosevelt , there was Winston in great form , growling clever things while at the other end of the table our host sat In silence , a frail , almost feeble figure . It was in that condition that F. D. won and was reelected for b is f our t 11 Presidential term , and went off presently for the meeting with Stalin at Yalta  --  that ghastly piece of folly , by my view , which had the effect of sanctioning the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would n't Say After the war , I used to see Winston Churchill fairly often . Several times I tried to lure h im into speculating upon whether Roosevelt 's f ailing health left him incapable of perceiving the menace that he was agreeing to let Into Europe . Winston refused to be smoked out . With war 's end in 1945 , I found myself headed back to where I was when it started ? without a job . And once again there rose for me the nagging question of where we would settle for good . That summer , while the duchess and I were packing our things at Nassau in preparation for our return to Europe , the American press was raising difficult questions . Was the king going to give Windsor another job ? If not , what will the duke do ? I had thought that my performance as a colonial governor and the spirit in which I had gone about my duties , would have persuaded the skepInes in Britain that my desire to stay on in my country 's service was a genuine one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resolves on One More Try I was resolved , in any case , to make one more hard try at drumming up interest in the palace and in Whitehall for putting me to work somewhere in the British diplomatic service , in the absence of any marked enthusiasm for making a place for me in Britain . Some of my American friends had meanwhile come forward with a novel idea . It was that I become a specialist in AngloAmerican relations . The idea was that I would function as an ambassador-at-large , or roving ambassador . I would have no specific or formal responsibility for the conduct of diplomacy . That would naturally remain the province of the professional head of the mission in Washington . I would concentrate Instead on what nowadays would be called , I suppose , the public relations aspects of British diplomacy in the United States . To Bring People Together Such a job would require my bringing Americans and visiting Britons together , providing a good table and a comfortable library for informal talks , and helping along what Winston Churchill ' called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done for so many years as a prince of Wales . I liked the idea and , after returning to France at the end of the summer , I broached it to my brother , the king . There was no thought in my mind , I assured him , of inventing a job that would infringe on the ambassador 's delicate , traditional operations with the United States government . To make sure there would be no encroachment on the ambassadorial prerogatives , I would make no speeches or public appearances . My assignment would be to promote British products in the American market , and report on such American industrial and social innovations as came under my view . This work would be done within the " ambit " of the British embassy , but I would not necessarily live in Washington . Approach to Laborites To my satisfaction , my brother replied that the idea was an interesting one , and he would try it on the government . In that quarter , however , I was no longer sure of an entirely sympathetic hearing . The Torymanaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August . Winston had retired to Chartwell , his country place in Surrey , and two Socialists ( Laborites Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin  --  were prime minister and foreign minister respectively . These men I hardly knew , but Winston was on intimate terms with both , having worked closely with them thru the war . So I asked him to put in a good word with them on behalf of my projects , and this he did with his usual enthusiasm . For several months , my project seemed to prosper . I made several trips to London for talks with my brother , Mr. Attlee and Mr. Bevin . Later that winter , when Winston went back to the United States to deliver his famous " Iron Curtain " speech at Fulton , Mo. , he mentioned the idea to President Truman who thought it , as Winston told me , " a good plan . " Project Melts Away Then the project , like , the earlier one in Wales , melted away . The British government concluded that it might not be so desirable at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to the embassy in Washington . That at least was the excuse my brother gave 20 years ago for turning me down . In that sense of the language , a particular time meant never , forever . In May , 1946 , I fired off a bitter letter to Winston , " As it is now evident that the British government has no need of my services , " I said , " and as I have no interest in remaining idle , I must look for a post in whatever sphere and country I can find suitable for my qualifications . " Churchill Worse Off From Chartweil the reply was consoling . Terming the impostlion a " foolish obstruction " and spying that he wished he " had the power to overcome the obstruction , " Winston philosphized , " but we are all living under the harrow , and our position in the east is clattering down in full conformity with our financial situation at home . " From the language , I took it that he was linking my setback with the deterioration of the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nevertheless was of little comfort to me . Later , when we met , Winston told me that he had been a good deal worse off than I when he lost the premiership : " When I left Downing street , I did n't even have a ration card . " That episode just about ended for good my efforts to find another place in official life . And the hint in my letter to Winston about taking any job that came my way was a hollow threat . True , I did flirt for a while with the notion of going into business  --  under the most honorable management . But on longer thought , however , I realized that I had never been trained for business and that I was too old to try to learn .
