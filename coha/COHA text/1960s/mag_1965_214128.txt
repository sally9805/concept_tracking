Although the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and press , the Supreme Court has held that certain kinds of expression , such as obscenity , are unworthy of protection . But if this makes some censorship permissible , what limits should the court place on the censor 's power ? <P> The court has long protected books and newspapers from " prior restraint " - from any censorship that would affect them before they reach the public . But the court puts movies in a special category because of their graphic nature and " capacity for evil . " Thus in 1961 , the court narrowly upheld the power of Chicago 's police commissioner to precensor all movies and check them for obscenity . That decision , however , failed to answer crucial questions : Are even nonobscene movies subject to precensorship ? How long can censors delay decisions and thus make exhibitors knuckle under ? <P> Sharp Challenge . To get the answers , Baltimore Theater Owner Ronald L. Freedman challenged a Maryland law making it illegal to show any film not approved and licensed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the censors screen a non-obscene movie : Revenge at Daybreak , a French film about the Irish Rebellion that the board admittedly would have licensed had Freedman submitted it . Freedman was fined $25 , and Maryland 's highest court upheld the conviction . When Freedman appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court , Maryland argued that precensorship of movies is necessary to prevent commercial exploitation of obscenity . <P> Last week the court reaffirmed the constitutionality of movie precensorship . But it unanimously reversed Freedman 's conviction and voided the Maryland law on the ground that it lacked procedural safeguards and judicial participation . The trouble with Maryland 's setup was that it provided no time limit or court appeal while the censors made up their minds . Nor did the law provide any rapid relief in the courts even after the board did act . <P> Short Tether . Significantly shifting the burden of proof to censors , Justice William J. Brennan ruled that " the exhibitor must be assured by statute or authoritative judicial construction that the censor will , within a specified brief period , either issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film . " As for the judicial part of the process , Brennan suggested that it should take no more than three or four days . <P> Justices William O. Douglas and Hugo Black concurred , but they wanted to go much further . " I would put an end to all forms and types of censorship and give full literal meaning to the command of the First Amendment , " insisted Douglas . His brethren thought it was enough simply to put the censor on a shorter tether.
