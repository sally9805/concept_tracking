On the 18th green at Louisiana 's Oakbourne Country Club , Gay Brewer marked his ball and turned to Jack Nicklaus . " What 's it worth to you , " he asked , " if I miss this putt ? " Nicklaus solemnly reached into his pocket , pulled out a money clip crammed with bills , and held it out to Brewer . Brewer chuckled impishly , lined up his putt-a straight-in 15-footer-and missed . It was a fitting climax to pro golf 's 1964 season , a wacky eleven months in which a reformed rake named Tony Lema won four tournaments in six incredible weeks ; in which Old ( 35 ) Master Arnold Palmer won his fourth Masters and still lost the money-winning title to burly Wunderkind Nicklaus , 24-by the margin of Brewer 's bungled putt and $81.13 in cash . <P> Nicklaus did not win the Cajun Classic ; Louisiana 's Miller Barber did . <P> Jack and Arnie were having their own contest : there was Palmer , in the clubhouse , with fourth money ( $1,500 ) already in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than third - and , by the skinny-skin-skin , he did . <P> The missed putt cost Brewer second place , dropped him into a tie with Nicklaus worth $1,900 to both players . <P> Which brought the official P.G.A . totals for 41 tournaments to $113,284.50 for Nicklaus , $113,203.37 for Palmer. - Yet for Nicklaus , playing his third season as a pro , 1964 was full of disappointments . True , he won four tournaments . But he failed to win a major championship , though he finished second three times-to Palmer in the Masters , to Lema in the British Ooen to Nichols in the P.G.A . In the U.S. <P> Open , he wound up with a dismal tie for 23rd . He thus did not qualify for the four-man World Series of Golf , an unofficial " exhibition " that used to be his private preserve : two years running , he had tak'en home the winner 's purse of $50,000-biggest check in golf . His money came mostly in dribs and drabs , ranging from a low of $475 in the U.S. Open to $24,042 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a pretty penny-but it was a tough way to make 100 grand . <P> <P> The next three : Billy Casper , $90,65308-Tony Lema , $74,130.37 ; Bobby Nichols ! $74,012.26.
