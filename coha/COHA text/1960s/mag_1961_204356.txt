SHADING their eyes against the sun , two men talked in the empty schoolyard in the crossroads village of San Manuel , Chile , 60 miles south of Santiago . In the distance loomed the snowcapped Andes ; near by , a quacking duck led five grey ducklings in and out of an irrigation ditch . " We had a community meeting last night . " said Sandoval Crdoba , the school 's headmaster . " It went better than last time . Six men are going to build the chicken house . Five others are interested in the brooder . " Replied Emory Tomor , 24 , of Reseda , Calif. , a member of the U.S. Peace Corps : " I 'm very happy it went well . " <P> A high school French and German instructor back home in California , Tomor now spends his weekdays teaching carpentry to 50 boys at the Institute De Educacin in Malloco . Chile . On weekends , he boards a wheezing bus and rides 30 miles to San Manuel , where 70 peasant families work a landowner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holdings . Tomor is trying to help the campesinos raise poultry . He has shown them how to build a chicken house of wire , wood and burlap and a brooder of wood slats , wire and an old barrel . Formerly , only one of every two San Manuel chicks survived ; 49 of 50 chicks that Tomor is raising in a brooder have thrived . Now Tomor hopes to crossbreed good-laying Leghorns with the Rhode Island Reds that lay the brown eggs preferred by Chilean wives . Says Schoolmaster Sandoval Crdoba : " Do you believe what he has done in three weekends ? It is the best thing that ever happened here . For the first time the people are beginning to work together as a community . " <P> Missing Link . California 's Tomor is one of 484 Peace Corpsmen now on station in underdeveloped nations around the world . Peace Corps Director Sargent Shriver , who is President Kennedy 's brother-in-law , explains his organization 's mission in broad terms : " The process of education in a new society is long and slow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can produce enough trained people . The missing link in these newly developing nations is often for middle-manpower-men and women to do jobs until local people can be trained to take on this work themselves . " <P> To fill that need , Peace Corps contingents so far have been sent to the new African nations of Ghana , Nigeria and Tanganyika , to the older but still struggling South American countries of Colombia and Chile , to Pakistan and neighboring India . The largest group ( 128 ) is in the Philippines , the smallest ( 15 ) on the tiny , pear-shaped West Indian island of St. Lucia . <P> In each case , the corpsmen were invited by the host country-which also specified the skills it needed in the volunteers . Primarily , the demand was for teachers . All the corps members in the Philippines will teach mathematics , science and English in elementary schools . All 50 volunteers in Ghana are teaching in secondary schools . Of the 66 corps members in Nigeria , 36 are secondary-school teachers , and the rest will help staff the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
