SOMETIMES a subject is both too wide-ranging and too nebulous to be told around one man . In such cases we now turn with greater frequency to such devices as this week 's cover by one of Britain 's top cartoonists , Illingworth . " My cover wo n't be a happy one , " said Leslie Illingworth , a jolly , 60-year-old Welshman with a John Bullish face , who draws for Punch and London 's Daily Mail . He meant his Britannia to be looking a little aghast toward America , not Europe . " We 're not anti-American in this country , and we understand the breakaway of the American Revolution , but when the kid comes and belts the old girl across the backside it 's a bit much , " he says . " We are due for a shakeup . It 's salutary and good for us . But it 's hard too . It 's like a successful son saying , ' Open the windows , mother-God , all that fug . ' " <P> For the story , London Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of Britain 's life . Parliamentary Correspondent Honor Balfour concentrated on the politicians . Monica Dehn , with two children to educate , had a lively interest in British education . Charles Champlin worked his way through the young satirists and playwrights , and others who are now angry at being called Angry Young Men . His interviews ranged from the Savile Club to Colin MacInnes ' bare flat , where they drank scotch-laced coffee and listened to Billie Holiday records to take the chill off a freezing morning . Donald Connery , fresh from the cooler precincts of Moscow , rode the train north to such unemployment spots as Liverpool and Newcastle-on-Tyne . Though Connery 's mother was born on the Tyne , he reports , " I have heard more understandable English in Calcutta and Katmandu than in some stretches of North England . " Robert Ball , who did the major economic reporting of Britain , had previously reported for many years in postwar Germany . " Most of what I have read about Britain in recent years emphasized the changes taking place here , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having come from a country of almost total change , to find so little here . " To Ball , the rebuilt Germany has an airport-terminal newness and sameness ; Britain impresses more by its age and continuity and settled ways ( " Where else would a Dickensian wine dealer advise about a ' 57 Burgundy in kindly but firm tones : ' No news from that one at all yet , I 'm afraid ' ? " ) . <P> The overall impression of our London staff , providing a theme for our cover story , is of a nation in trouble , but vigorous in its self-examination . In New York , the story was written by Michael Demarest and edited by Edward Hughes . <P> SO far , 1963 has had an auspicious beginning for TIME . Our worldwide circulation topped 3,600,000 , and the Jan. 11 issue reached a new circulation high in the U.S. : 2,920,000 . <P> Right now , the newspaper strikes in New York and Cleveland have whetted the demand for TIME , and in the New York City area alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME 's newsstand circulation-always a useful index of a magazine 's vitality-has been extraordinarily healthy right along . The December average sale was 28% ahead of December 1961 , and each weekly issue since last June has outsold the corresponding issue of the year before .
