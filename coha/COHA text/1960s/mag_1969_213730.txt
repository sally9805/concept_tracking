Almost every American has his personal tale of woe about an encounter with a physician or hospital . Many , of course , also have tales of triumph-and those are usually the people whose lives have been saved by medical skill . Whether an American falls into one or the other category is often a matter of luck . These case histories , gathered from a sampling made this month by TIME reporters , sum up the experiences of three fairly typical patients . <P> <P> JEWELL WHELAN , now 38 , has had as much trouble with her doctors as with her gall bladder over a span of 16 years . Wife of a factory inspector in Compton , Calif. , she complained of frequent chest pains in 1953 , soon after the birth of her second child . The pains came after meals , but each time they were gone by the time she got to the doctor 's . " Indigestion , " said he , and prescribed a bland diet . So it went until 1957 .

First came an office visit at $7 , with a blood count and urinalysis for $9.90 . A second office visit included X rays of the upper gastrointestinal tract and gall bladder , for $60.50 , and a second gallbladder series cost $22 . Of the $106.40 total , her comprehensive John Hancock insurance paid all but $12.88 . Mrs. Whelan had put her foot down just in time . The X rays disclosed an inflamed gall bladder with numerous stones . <P> Lacking confidence in her third doctor , Mrs. Whelan sought a good general surgeon . He could not schedule an examination for two days . During the second night , Mrs. Whelan vomited green bile . The surgeon could not be reached , so James Whelan had to call in the last physician . He sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a shot to kill her pain and sent home . Next morning , with week-old X rays in hand , she finally saw her surgeon . One look at the films and he rushed her to Long Beach Memorial Hospital . <P> Next morning , out came her gall bladder , with two large stones and a quantity of floating " gravel , " which may have explained her persistent chest pain . " The interns told me mine was the hottest gall bladder they had ever seen , " says Jewell Whelan . But after eight days , she went home and is now well .

Leah was taken to Tidelands General Hospital , where a week of tests showed that over a period of years her kidneys had been deteriorating and one was almost useless .

A specialist recommended palliative medication for an indefinite period at $35 a week as an alternative to surgery .
