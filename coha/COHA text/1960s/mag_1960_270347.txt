In a basement at the College of Medicine of State University of Iowa , a centrifuge whirligigs at 95 r.p.m . From 14 cages spinning about on the centrifuge come the squeaks of mice and hamsters that have spent most or all of their lives under conditions of high gravitation . Last week Physiology Professor Charles C. Wunder , who conducts the experiments , announced that his centrifuged mice have conceived , delivered and raised nine litters at up to 2Gs ( the gravitational force at the earth 's surface is figured at 1G ; at more than 1G. earth 's creatures feel heavier ; at less than 1G , lighter ) . Neither parents nor offspring were seriously bothered by the twice-normal weight of their bodies . " We were n't really studying breeding , " said Dr. Wunder . " It just happened . For some reason , every spring there seems to be an upsurge in the centrifuge . " <P> An obvious problem of the space age is how humans will exist under high or low gravitation conditions . Men have been tested on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods . For experiments extending over months and years , laboratory animals must be used , and some of the results have been fascinating . <P> Elephant Walk . " Under increased gravity , " says Wunder , after studying motion pictures of his high-G hamsters , " the hamsters walk around and seem to adapt very nicely , but their walking pattern is more like an elephant than a hamster . They 're a bit perturbed about having to carry a bigger load . " When young mice or hamsters are put on a centrifuge , they usually lose considerable weight for three or four days . " Apparently they have trouble digesting their food , " says Dr. Wunder . " They level off and gain back their original weight , but they never get as big as ordinary mice . " <P> After as little as one week , the femurs ( leg bones ) of young mice get rounder in cross section than normal femurs . Dr. Wunder believes that this change is an adaptation to strengthen the bone and allow it to support the abnormal weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way : Dr. Alfred Smith of the University of California has found that when they are centrifuged , the anti-gravity muscles of their drumsticks grow to as much as seven times normal . But chickens are not so successful as mice at high-G reproduction . They try-but tend to lay flat , infertile eggs . <P> Elephant Legs ? California 's Smith has also noticed that when his chickens have got used to living at 4Gs , they have a good deal of trouble when taken off the centrifuge and forced to live like other chickens in the earth 's normal 1-G field . " It looks as if they get a stoppage of the gut , " he says . " After all , at 4-Gs their hearts were pumping fluid with the normal density of molten iron . " At the present point in their experiments , neither Wunder nor Smith cares to predict the effect on the human body of space-age gravitational changes . But the logical extension of the test results so far would indicate that a child growing up on the moon , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs of a lady on Jupiter , with its 2.65-G surface , might be as thick as an elephant's.
