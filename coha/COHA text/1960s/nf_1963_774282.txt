txt  | engine was the Ackroyd-Stuart , first produced in England in 1890 and manufactured in large numbers by Ruston &; Hornsby of Lincoln . The Diesel engine , first patented by Rudolf Diesel in Britain in 1892 , and first successfully manufactured in 1897 , is notable for the very careful attention given to thermodynamic principles in its design : these principles Diesel set forth in detail in 1893 in his Theorie find Konstruktion eines Rationellen Warme-motors . His object , eventually shown to be not wholly practicable , was to prevent the engine temperature rising above that of the compressed gas in the cylinders , so making cooling unnecessary ; he sought also to increase efficiency by lowering the temperature of the exhaust gases . Diesel 's thermodynamic ideals were never fully achieved in practice , and after a few years the main , but exceedingly important , distinction of the Diesel engine from other oil engines was its exceptionally high compression ratio , which favors high thermal efficiency . The essential principles of the petrol engine are the same as those of the gas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the systems of fuel injection and ignition and in the fact that it is essentially a high-speed engine . Although an Austrian engineer , Siegfried Markus , is reputed to have built in the period of 1864 ? 1874 several vehicles propelled by petrol-engines , the acknowledged pioneer was the German engineer , Gottlieb Daimler , who had for some years been interested in the design and construction of gas engines . His first petrol engine , patented in 1885 , was a single-cylinder vertical machine , air cooled , working on the Otto cycle . The explosive mixture was prepared by sucking air through petrol in a float-chamber , and it was ignited by an externally heated tube inserted into the cylinder head . In the following year this engine was successfully applied to a bicycle , then to a carriage . Within three years Daimler had constructed a two-cylinder engine , in which the two pistons drove one crank : originally it was proposed to fit valves in both pistons , but this intention was never realized in practice . This engine was built in con-  | siderable numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for small boats and as a stationary engine . Simultaneously with Daimler , another German engineer , Karl Benz , was building engines that were specifically for motor cars . His single-cylinder engine of 1885 differed from Daimler 's in being horizontal , in having electrical ignition , and in being relatively slow running . Applied first to a three-wheeled car , the engine proved conspicuously successful when it was used , as a 3 ? h.p. unit , in a four-wheeled vehicle in 1893 ; production of this continued up to 1901 . Its system of ignition by an electrical induction coil ? powered by an accumulator and fitted with a rotary contactbreaker , driven from the engine , to ensure that sparking occurred at the right point in the four-stroke cycle ? was soon widely adopted by other manufacturers . The spark itself was produced in a removable plug , of essentially modern design , fitted into the cylinder-head . The carburetor was of the surface type , similar in principle to that of Daimler 's engine , except that volatilization was assisted by the heat of the exhaust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the admixture of air . After 1893 Daimler , and subsequently other manufacturers , used the modern float-feed carburetor invented by Wilhelm Maybach . The petrol level in the chamber of this carburetor is kept constant by a float working a needle valve . The float-chamber communicates , through a very fine jet , with the inlet of the cylinder : the suction from the cylinder causes an exceedingly fine spray of petrol to be injected into the air-intake . Up to the First World War the only other alternative to the original surface-type and the float-feed carburetor was the Lanchester wick carburetor fitted to Lanchester engines , which we shall consider later , from 1897 . In this , air was drawn over a series of wicks dipping into a small chamber constantly replenished from the main fuel tank . Within the period now under consideration , only singleor twin-cylindered petrol engines were in use ; multiplecylindered engines came into general use much later . Although , as we have seen , Daimler introduced a twin-cylin-  | dered engine in 1889 , the design of such engines presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a four-stroke engine there is only one power stroke for every two revolutions of the crankshaft . From the point of view of engine balance it is desirable , supposing that the cylinders are arranged alongside each other , that one piston should be rising as the other falls . The effect of this , however , is that the crankshaft receives power impulses in two successive half turns , but receives no power impulses at all during the next full turn . This can be overcome if the pistons rise and fall together ? one making the first stroke of the cycle while the other makes the third ? but this throws the engine out of balance and imposes excessive strain . A solution , but one not widely adopted because it has attendant difficulties , is to use horizontally opposed cylinders . Within the period in question , other ingenious devices were used by a number of manufacturers , of whom perhaps the most successful was F. W. Lanchester . His engine applied the principle of horizontally opposed cylinders , but instead of one crankshaft there were two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both crankshafts , which carried separate flywheels , but which were geared together so that they turned in opposite directions ; the chain-drive to the rear axle was , of course , taken from only one crankshaft . Most early engines were air cooled : Diesel , as we have seen , paid particular attention to keeping the engine temperature low in order , among other things , to obviate the need for a cooling system . The cooling effect of the air can be increased by increasing the external surface area of the cylinder by means of fins , and the draught resulting from the vehicle 's own motion also assists , and can if necessary be increased by a fan , as in the Lanchester engine . The circulation of the lubricating oil ? effected by hand pumping on many early cars but already mechanized in the first Lanchester ? also promotes cooling . Additional cooling by means of a water-circulating system had , however , also appeared before 1900 : it was a feature of Henry Ford 's first motor-  | car of 1896 and also of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in brief , was the main line of evolution of the internal combustion engine up to 1900 , by which time many tens of thousands had been constructed . Although its full social impact was not felt until the twentieth century , it is to be noted that all the fundamental problems had been solved : it is fair to say that a modern motorcar engine contains no feature that would surprise a nineteenth-century engineer . The greatest change has been from custom building to mass production , and even the latter lies only just beyond our period , for the Ford Motor Company was founded in 1903 . A very significant feature of the evolution of the internal combustion engine in general , and of the petrol engine in particular , is the relatively small contribution made by British engineers ; Lanchester is a conspicuous exception . This becomes all the more striking if comparison is made with the history of the steam engine . The way in which Continental and American inventors outnumbered British supports the general thesis that the Great Exhibition of 1851 marked the climax of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties and delays , a pamphlet entitled " A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes " was finally published by the Smithsonian Institution and its author , Dr. Robert Hutchings Goddard , given $5000 to continue his researches in rocketry . The report , which stated that rockets that would hit the moon could be constructed , was considered by most thinking people the work of a madman , and there were outcries against the dangerous experiments he was conducting . But the paper has proved to be an important engineering document of the twentieth century and the work of Goddard has served as a basis for the development of rocket engines and travel in space . Goddard was born in Worcester , Massachusetts , on October  | 5 , 1882 , studied at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute , and later became an instructor at Clark University . He was testing small rockets while still in his twenties , and at thirty made the computations which indicated that reaching extreme altitudes through rocket power was within the realm of practicality . On March 16 , 1926 , after several previous experiments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled 184 feet at an average speed of sixty miles per hour . Although Goddard 's rocket was the first to employ liquid fuel , the use of reaction motors , as G. Edward Pendray points out , is as old as the skyrocket , and the theoretical understanding of them as old as Isaac Newton 's laws of motion . It is likely that in the thirteenth century the Chinese used rockets as engines of war . The English engineer , Sir William Congreve , employed them with success against the French and the Danes at the beginning of the nineteenth century , and inspired the phrase " the rocket 's red glare " in " The Star Spangled Banner . " But he could not compete with the rifled cannon for accuracy and his experiments fell into limbo . The Russians claim that the original modern pioneer in rocketry was an obscure schoolmaster named Konstantin Tsiolkovsky , whose first article on the subject appeared in 1903 . The Germans , with such students as Hermann Oberth , who published a short mathematical analysis of rocketry and space travel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments were the first to bear practical fruit in the form of the V-2 rockets of World War II . Since World War II the development of reaction motors has been staggering . An attempt to land men on the moon will almost certainly be made during the 196o 's . Any article on contemporary aspects of the subject is outdated almost before it appears . For this reason , one of the classic nontechnical studies of reaction motors is here reprinted . While speeds , horsepowers , ranges , and fuels may change , the basic theory remains the same . C. Edward Pendray , who was one of the founders of the American Rocket Society , explains it lucidly.  | HOW THEY WORK AND SOME EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM G. EDWARD PENDRAY THE SKYROCKET , which aside from Heron 's toylike contrivance ? was the first artificial device to make use of jet propulsion , was invented more than seven hundred years ago . But neither Heron nor the hundreds of generations of fireworks makers . . . had any real understanding of the principle of jet propulsion . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton , some 265 years ago , to give us the basis for understanding what rocket power really is , and the unique things it can do . Newton , formulating in simple language the three Laws of Motion his mathematics and observation had helped him to discover , wrote out in Latin this observation : " To every action there is always an equal and contrary reaction ; the mutual actions of any two bodies are always equal and oppositely directed . " Thus , the hand that pushes a cradle is itself pushed by the cradle , to exactly the same degree and in the opposite direction . The foot that thrusts downward on the earth is thrust upward by the earth in precisely the same amount . The bullet that is ejected by a gun causes the gun to recoil ? and the two actions are not only opposite in direction , but are equal in amount . This is the statement of Newton 's Third Law of Motion . Although it describes a phenomenon we daily experience throughout our lives , few people consider or even recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every object . It is important that we recognize it now , for the Third Law is a complete statement of the principle upon which the reaction motor operates . *See pp. 14-15-Eds. 105  | In most human activities the action is what is wanted ; the reaction is thrown away or ignored . In jet propulsion , the " action " is thrown away . The reaction is the particular harvest we are seeking . The simplest form of reaction motor ? and the best known ? is the one that drives an ordinary skyrocket . Here is a cross-section drawing of a skyrocket . At the tip is a cone-shaped cap which provides rudimentary streamlining to aid the rapid upward flight of the projectile . Immediately under the cap usually are nested the combustible pellets , the " stars " that cascade brilliantly into the sky at the top of the flight . These are the payload of the skyrocket ; they are not a basic part of the rocket itself . Into the main body of the rocket , usually contained in a heavy paper tube , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fuel or propellant charge , ( A ) . The material is usually a form of ordinary gunpowder , often mixed with extra charcoal or some other material to slow down the rate of combustion . It is squeezed into the rocket under high pressure , thus packed tightly into a solid cake . Because it is solid , the flame can not permeate the cake , so combustion takes place only at the exposed surface of the cone-shaped blast chamber , ( B ) . The simple thrust mechanism ? or motor ? of the rocket is completed by constricting the walls of the case below the blast chamber to form a nozzle . Sometimes the throat of the nozzle is reinforced with clay or other hard material to prevent its burning out . A fuse ( D ) and a long stick ? a crude balancing device ? complete the rocket . On firing , what happens is this : Heat from the fuse ignites the surface of the powder on the walls of the cone-shaped blast chamber . The powder does not explode , but a continuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas at high temperature . Considerable pressure builds up instantly in the chamber , since the hot gas is formed at a much faster rate than it can easily escape through the restriction at the nozzle . The net effect is to eject a stream of gas at great  | figure velocity , directed backward . This thrusts the rocket forcibly in the opposite direction . As the fuel burns , the blast chamber rapidly enlarges , but the restriction at the nozzle continues to keep the pressure high and guides the escaping jet . The rocket takes off with a tremendous swish , emitting a stream of sparks and fire , and flies until the fuel is completely consumed . Then an  | arrangement at the top of the tube fires the " stars " and the bursting charge in which they are packed . In a jet motor such as that of the skyrocket there are no moving parts ? except the stream of escaping gas . It is by no means easy to grasp just how this jet , with nothing to push against , exerts the surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently toward the sky . The common notion is that the jet does its work by pushing against the air . Superficially this seems reasonable . The air is certainly a resisting medium . But a stream of gas , no matter how rapidly it is moving , or how dense it may be , is no solid connecting rod , capable of pushing against something and transmitting the push back against whatever is adjacent to its starting end . It is something else that drives the rocket  --  and this brings us back to Newton and his Law of Motion : " To every action there is always an equal and contrary reaction ; the mutual actions of any two bodies are always equal and oppositely directed . " Consider the ejected gas as one " body " ; the rocket as the other . The rocket , forcing the gas to escape , pushes it violently toward the earth . The gas , escaping , pushes the rocket as violently toward the sky . This is jet propulsion , or rocket power , the simple principle of the reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how this mysterious reaction occurs . Here is another drawing that may help in the further understanding of it . Imagine a hollow box , filled with gas under pressure . For convenience , let us say the pressure is 100 pounds per square inch . This means , of course , that every square inch on the inside of the box will be pushed upon by gas with a steady pressure of 100 pounds . Under these conditions the box itself will not move in any direction , for the total pressure on each side will exactly balance the total pressure on the opposite side . Now , suppose a hole were to be cut in side B , exactly  | ( for convenience in doing our mental arithmetic ) one square inch in area . At once we have a new condition in the box , as shown in the second diagram . Note that the pressure exerted by the gas on side B is now no longer exactly equal to that on side A. It is , in fact 100 pounds less . The box will therefore be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a force of 100 pounds . The push will continue as long as we bring in fresh supplies of gas or fuel , as at D , to keep the pressure in the box at the established level .  | In essentials , this is how things go in the reaction motor . An important refinement is the addition of a nozzle at C , to direct the escaping gas and control its expansion . This facilitates the movement of the stream and adds to the thrust , often as much as 35 to 50 percent or more . The approximate thrust or push of any reaction motor may be calculated by multiplying the area of the orifice of the throat ( C ) by the pressure of the gas in the chamber , and adding about 50 percent for the additional contribution of the nozzle . The exact value of the thrust will , of course , vary according to several factors , including the fuel used , the pressure of the gas , completeness of combustion and an experimentally determined item rocket engineers call " the constant of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape , and other factors . ' So far as the basic principles are concerned , all jet-propulsion motors obey the same laws , and in that sense are identical . When it comes to practical application of these laws , it is soon seen that a bewildering number and variety of motors can be contrived , ranging all the way from lowpowered water , steam or compressed-air jets to motors that produce a high-speed blast by burning gasoline , alcohol , benzol , hydrogen , or other fuels . Moreover , there is at least one broad line of division among all the various types of reaction motors , according to the way in which oxygen is obtained for the combustion . If the oxygen is taken from the surrounding atmosphere , by compression of the air or other means , we have the class appropriately called the airstream engines . ' If oxygen is supplied in the form of liquid oxygen or some oxygen-yielding compound , the motor is designated as a true rocket or chemical fuel motor . Each of these major groups is further subdivided . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of 1 . The thrust can also be calculated , of course , by applying the formula T MV , where T is thrust , M is the mass ejected per second , and V is the velocity of the jet in feet per second . 2 . Also called airjet engines , etc.  | the true rocket motors , and at least three types , so far , of the airstream engines . TYPES AND CLASSES OF REACTION MOTORS I. The true rocket , or chemical fuel motors : A. The solid-fuel rocket motor ( burns solid fuels such as gunpowder or smokeless powder ) . B. The liquid-fuel motor ( burns fuels such as liquid oxygen and gasoline , or liquid oxygen and alcohol ) . II . The airstream engines : A. The thermal jet engine ( burns a variety of possible fuels , including gasoline and kerosene , with air delivered into the combustion chamber by means of a rotary compressor ) . B. The intermittent duct engine ( burns gasoline or similar fuels with air , compressed into the blast chamber by the ram effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous duct engine ( burns the same fuels as the intermittent engine ; also depends on atmospheric oxygen compressed by ram effect , but its action is continuous ) . From this table we see that there is first of all the simple solid-fuel rocket motor , the kind that drives skyrockets and many types of military rockets such as the bazooka , the airplane rockets , and the British " Z-gun " anti-aircraft rocket . Second , there is the liquid-fuel rocket motor , which provides power for many types of thrusters , catapults , and some types of military rockets , also for such long-range rockets as the German " V-2 " rocket weapon . Among the airstream engines , the best known is the thermal jet engine , also called the " turbo-jet engine , " the " turbo-jet " or the " swish . " . . . The other types of airstream engines are duct engines , much simpler than the jet engine in that they require almost io moving parts , and get along without either air compressors or turbine wheels . They do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are attached be given a rapid preliminary start . Duct engines , having no air compressor of their own , depend at least partly on the compression or " ram effect " of the air during flight to provide them with oxygen to burn their fuels . figure The earliest successful duct engine was the " buzz-bomb engine , " used by the Germans to propel their robot bombs in 1944 against London and southern England . It does not operate with a continuous blast , as does the thermal jet engine and the generally used types of rocket motors , ' but proceeds by a series of pulses or intermittent explosions , hence the name . Still under development is the continuous duct engine , more usually called the ramjet . In principle it is similar to the intermittent type , depending on the ram effect of the air 3 . It should be noted that the true rocket motors may also operate intermittently . An intermittent type of dry-fuel motor was developed by Dr. Robert H. Goddard as early as 1916.  | for compression , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Historically , of course , the solid-fuel rocket motors were the earliest to appear . if we look once more at the skyrocket , the most familiar of the true rocket motors , we will perceive that the motor and the fuel supply are there most ingeniously combined . The fuel is made to provide its own motor , in the form of the cone-shaped blast cavity which rapidly enlarges as the fuel burns away . This form of rocket motor offers no problems to metallurgy , because there is no metal . There is no problem about the burning out of the walls , for so long as they consist of fuel , burning is what is desired . This rocket motor obviously does very well the job it is designed to do . Unfortunately it does not provide us with a good pattern for rocket motors of more power and utility . For one thing , the gas pressure is necessarily low , whereas good efficiency requires a relatively high pressure . Why is the pressure low ? Because if it were higher , it would burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or blow out the flimsy nozzle ? or more likely still , cause the flame to permeate the powder charge , no matter how tightly packed . This might set the whole fuel supply off at once , resulting in an explosion instead of a flight . Another problem with the skyrocket motor is that the combustion chamber changes shape and size continually throughout the run . At the beginning it is small . During the burning it rapidly enlarges . But since its enlargement depends both upon the rate and uniformity of the combustion of the fuel , the shape changes , too , along with the size . If for a given fuel , gas pressure , nozzle , and other conditions there is only one best shape , the skyrocket can have it , at most , for only a fraction of a second . During the rest of its operation it is bound to be doing a less satisfactory job . The first considerable improvement was the application of it metal nozzle , properly shaped to give maximum aid to the escaping gases . Such a nozzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can then be increased by substituting smokeless powder or cordite for the fuel , and  | exchanging metal or strong laminated plastic containers for the paper ones . This , however , may introduce a new problem : the new containers may weigh more than the paper , and if the chamber pressure is to be increased a great deal , we must be careful to see that the extra weight of the stronger jacket does not nullify the gain obtained from a more powerful fuel . Dr. Goddard , whose pioneer work established the modern period of rocket research , gave considerable study at one time to the problem of improving the performance of the solid-fuel motor . He discovered that the average velocity of ejection in an ordinary skyrocket was only about 1,000 feet a second , but when he fired charges of dense smokeless powder in strong steel chambers , with properly shaped , smooth tapered nozzles , he obtained velocities of ejection up to nearly 8,000 feet per second . Assuming the masses ejected to be the same , the impulse of the later rocket motor would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fuel , arid thus would theoretically drive a rocket not eight but sixty-four times as far ? a very considerable reward for thus increasing the jet velocity . However , it is not possible to add a steel jacket and metal nozzle without adding weight ; so as a practical matter the skyrocket and the smokeless powder rocket could hardly start with weights , fuel charges and other factors even . The smokeless powder rocket would have to weigh more , or else carry less fuel or payload at the start . To get around this it was early suggested by Dr. Goddard that the blast chamber should not be merely a cavity in the fuel supply , but a separate contrivance , into which the fuel could be inserted as needed . Several ingenious ways were suggested for doing this . Dr. Goddard 's proposal was to shoot pellets of fuel into the chamber intermittently , like machinegun bullets . Similar ideas offered by other experimenters include thrusting a solid stick of fuel rapidly into the chamber 4 . Dr. Goddard patented such an intermittent rocket apparatus in 1914 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the First World War . He later gave up this line of experiment , however , in favor of liquid-fuel motors .  | through an orifice , the speed of insertion being equal to the rate of burning , or powdering the fuel and blowing it in by air or gas , through suitable inlet ports . If one or another of these ideas were adopted , only the motor chamber ( which could be relatively small ) would need to be strong enough to withstand the high gas pressure of the blast ; the fuel container could be light and flimsy , and thus add very little to the weight . Unfortunately , any apparatus for shooting pellets into the chamber is likely to be heavy , expensive and cantankerous , full of personal little kinks and problems of its own . Blowing the powder into the chamber with gas pressure is no easy one to handle , either . Likewise , the idea of thrusting a stick of fuel into the chamber through some sort of opening runs into very special headaches , including the difficulty of sealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it too hard to push the fuel in . Too , there is the matter of judging to a high degree of accuracy just how fast the fuel will burn ? solid fuels being particularly variable in this respect . The upshot is that while the application of one or another of these ideas might possibly further improve the performance of solid-fuel rockets , experimenters and military experts have preferred to continue using solid-fuel rockets of the simpler sort ? taking the disadvantages in exchange for the convenience and general freedom from worry that solid-fuel rockets without internal mechanism can have at the site of battle . This should not be taken to mean that great advances have not been made , however . The demand for powerful , simple , dependable war rockets of many kinds has put great pressure on technical rocket men . The improvements have been almost countless , and include better metal and plastic jackets , proper metal nozzles ? and above all , better fuels . Practically all of the new fuels are related to cordite , of course . ' There are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer true . By 1958 solid fuels of many different types and bases were being employed , and in many instances solid-fuel rockets were competing actively with their liquidfuel counterparts for long-range-missile and space-flight uses .  | pellants , but the charges are being made in a variety of ways , one of the most interesting being extrusion . In this process the material is made in plastic form and pushed through dies ? usually in factories operated by remote control ? to produce long rods or tubes of the fuel material of just the right size and shape to fit into the rocket bodies . These need only cutting to proper length and final insertion . In most modern military rockets the fuel is burned with great rapidity . In the bazooka , for example , the whole charge goes off in a fraction of a second , while the rocket is traversing the length of the eight-foot launching tube . The quick-burning effect is produced by a process just the reverse of that used in the skyrocket , where the powder is tightly packed to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the charge is specially prepared to encourage the flame to get almost everywhere at once . If gunpowder or smokeless powder is used , the load may be in the form of " doughnuts " or pressed fuel , packed with loose powder to propagate the flame . If it is cordite or some other of the more powerful explosives , the charge may be fluted , hollowed , or drilled full of holes , so the flame can eat it quickly , over a large surface . The effect of this quick burning is to produce a takeoff almost like a cannon shot . The rocket gets away with a quick " ffff-tt . " The flame is hardly more than a brilliant flash and then gone . The projectile flies almost all of the way to its target on momentum , obeying the same laws of ballistics as an artillery shell . For such short-range devices as military rockets , the dryfuel motor does very well ; in fact it is the only practical type . But this kind of motor will never give the power and sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or long-range military or trajectory rockets . ' For these , we must turn to the liquid-fuel motor . The solid-fuel rocket has obvious limitations which the liquid-fuel motor appears to overcome readily ? but in so doing it introduces a host of new problems all its own . 6 . See footnote 5 . Solid fuels have undergone very considerable development since this statement was first written in 1944.  | To begin with , it is a device that functions only in the presence of intense heat . The temperature within a liquidfuel rocket motor is almost always at or above the melting point of the materials of which it is constructed . Moreover , there is an enormous contrast in temperatures from one part of the motor to another . At the point where the fuel enters , the thermometer may register as low as the boiling point of liquid oxygen , - 297 degrees Fahrenheit . At the hottest point , the temperature may be at least half that of the surface of the sun . The burden which these conditions put upon a simple , small and necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liquid-fuel motor made of metals can operate at all . Yet motors have been developed in this country to give sustained performance for indefinite periods , to provide thrusts from a few pounds to 6,000 pounds or morel and weighing , for the largest sizes , about 200 pounds , or about 1 ounce per pound of thrust . Smaller ones , capable of yielding thrusts up to 100 pounds , may be nested in the hand , and weigh less than a pound . The high temperature at which the liquid-fuel motor must be operated to produce suitable results is no mere temporary obstacle which some ingenious trick or discovery may some day solve . Rather , it is inherent in the nature of fuels and jet velocities . It is the principal limiting factor on the operation of any jet motor . To obtain a jet velocity of between 6,000 and 7,000 feet per second with fuels of the type in general use , the temperature inside the combustion chamber must be around 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit . To obtain a jet velocity of 8,000 feet per second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A jet velocity of 10,000 feet per second will need a temperature of 12,200 degrees , and a 12,000 foot-per-second jet can be generated only by operating at a temperature of some 17,300 degrees . No ordinary con  --  . The thrust developed by the German " V-2 " rocket motor , a liquid-fuel type , is more than 26 tons . Motors used in long-range missiles and for space flight may have thrusts of one million pounds ? r more .  | structional metals , of course , will stand any of these temperatures , except for very brief periods . The melting point of aluminum , the most commonly used material for rockets because of its lightness , is 1218 degrees Fahrenheit , or only about a fourth of the temperature required to produce a 6,000 to 7,000 foot-per-second jet . The melting point of steel , which is often used in motor construction , is around 2,200 degrees ; still well below the temperature of the 6,000 to 7,000 foot motor . Almost every rocket experimenter has seen motors of the finest steel burn out in less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not so much a matter of melting as of erosion . The metal behaves somewhat like an icicle in the flame of a blowtorch . The surface melts or softens . Then the furious blast of the escaping jet carries the softened part away , exposing new material underneath . Almost before the metal of the motor has become hot clear through , it has been cut to pieces by this process . Under such circumstances all ordinary ideas of cooling are futile . Dr. Robert H. Goddard was the first experimenter on record to tackle the liquid-fuel motor problem , and was also the first to shoot a rocket powered by a liquid-fuel motor . The German experimenters of the Verein fur Raumschiffahrt ( German Rocket Society ) , however , were quicker than Goddard to report their experiences . Consequently , the history of their early attempts to harness liquid fuels is a wellknown and highly instructive tale . Their first idea was to place the blast chamber of the motor directly in the liquid oxygen tank , thus allowing the cold oxygen itself to cool the metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial design the intense heat of the motor raised such sudden pressure that the oxygen tank ultimately exploded . The motor was cone-shaped ; a direct descendant of the cavity in the skyrocket 's fuel load . The nozzle , which projected out of the bottom of the oxygen tank , was about three inches long . Blast chamber , nozzle , and oxygen tank were made of an aluminum alloy , chosen for its lightness and the rapidity with which it conducted heat . In their next attempt , the experimenters produced an  | oxygen tank which had a larger safety valve , and the motor also was larger . Its performance , however , was very much like the first . In both of these motors the fuels were introduced through separate inlet ports near the throat of the nozzle , and were forcibly injected upward by gas pressure . The tests taught several lessons , not the least of which was that liquid oxygen is not a very satisfactory coolant . It also became clear that a cone-shaped chamber is not an effective design . The volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its surface , and the sharp corners where the nozzle joins obstruct the rapid flow of the gases . A later motor developed by these experimenters and demonstrated in 1931 to Mrs. Pendray and me as representatives of the American Rocket Society had many improvements . The motor was cooled by running water . The'material was aluminum alloy , and the blast chamber was what the experimenters called " egg shaped , " though inspection showed it to be cylindrical , with each end finished off in a hemisphere . The propellants came in through two ports near the throat , directed upward so the streams of liquid oxygen and gasoline would meet near the radius of the upper hemisphere . This motor was small , weighing about a pound . It produced a thrust of about 20 pounds , at a calculated jet velocity of about 6,000 feet per second . Perhaps the best known pioneer series of motor experiments ever reported were those made under the auspices of the American Rocket Society between 1932 and the beginning of the Second World War . The society 's first motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country with the ideas on which it was constructed following the Verein fur Raumschiffahrt demonstration in 1931 . The motor was not merely a duplication of the German work . Made of cast aluminum alloy , it was considerably heavier than the German motor . The blast chamber was cylindrical , with hemispheric ends , and measured two inches in diameter and three inches in length . The nozzle was three inches long , with a half-inch throat and a taper of about ten degrees .  | The inside of the nozzle was carefully machined and the inner surface finished to mirrorlike smoothness . The fuel inlets were bored ? after the German fashion ? in such a way as to introduce the fuel near the nozzle , in streams directed toward the back of the motor . The theory of this was , simply , that such a position for the inlets would make the fuel travel substantially twice the length of the motor , and thus provide for some cooling effect along the walls as well as better mixing and combustion . It was an excellent theory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in practice , and it was later abandoned . The first test took place at a proving ground near Stockton , New Jersey , on November 12 , 1932 . The motor was mounted for the test between two pipelike cylindrical tanks , one of which contained liquid oxygen , the other gasoline under nitrogen gas pressure of 300 pounds per square inch . A water jacket surrounded the motor for cooling . The whole contrivance was fastened between two parallel upright wooden bars , on which it was free to slide against the tension of a spring . Previously the spring had been calibrated so that by measuring the distance traveled against its tension , the experimenters would be able to determine the thrust of the motor . The report ' on the first test , as published in Astronautics for November 1932 , read in part as follows : We had previously decided that the fuels should be turned on almost simultaneously , the oxygen first , the gasoline close behind . I judged that the fuse was going properly to light the fuels . About three minutes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enough pressure should have been built up to start the firing ... . Mr. Pierce ( H. F. Pierce , later president of the society ) threw his switches rapidly . The fuse apparatus worked to perfection . For an instant there was a great fire , as the pure oxygen struck the burning fuse . In an instant the gasoline was also pouring into the 8 . " The History of the First A.I.S. Rocket . "  | figure rocket . The fuse , the flare , and the uncertainty about the performance of our rocket motor all disappeared at once , as , with a furious hissing roar , a bluish white sword of flame shot downward from the nozzle of the combustion chamber , and the rocket lunged upward against the retaining spring ... . But most important ? the marks made by the rocket on the soaped guides indicated that it had registered a lift of sixty pounds . . . . Our fifteen-pound rocket would , in a vacuum , have ascended to a height of sixteen miles . Discounting liberally for air resistance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much power to reach an altitude in air of five to eight miles .  | These enthusiastic comments about the motor turned out , however , to be too optimistic . In subsequent tests it scored badly , and a whole sequence of motors like it , both with and without water jackets , burned out with disheartening regularity when tested against standard conditions on a proving stand especially constructed for the purpose . The society had phenomenal luck with its first test . It is not known to this day why the motor stood up so well for that first shot or so , and later showed its weakness all too plainly . It was that kindly Providence , no doubt , which is traditionally said to watch over rocket experimenters . A rocket motor produces so much quick power , and speeds on its way so fast in flight that it does not have to burn very long in any one shot to go a long distance . But more than a few seconds are usually necessary , and the need , except for military rockets , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whatever length of time might be desired , without danger of burning out . Pursuing this objective , the experimental group of the American Rocket Society subsequently gave almost five years ( working weekends and evenings principally , since this was an amateur occupation ) toward the development of successful motors capable of firing for indefinite periods , and developing high thermal efficiency . The first step was the construction of a suitable proving stand . To provide a cheap and easy method of getting data on many types and shapes of motors without building completely new models each time , a sectional motor was developed which made it possible to exchange some parts ? for example nozzles ? without any more trouble than the undoing of a few clamps . With this proving stand , followed subsequently by bigger ones and additional refinements , it was possible to try a great many types of motors and motor parts . It was possible , too , to prove to the satisfaction of all concerned that simple cooling schemes , such as water jackets , ice bags , dry-ice packs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last  | figure Turning next to metals and materials which it was believed would withstand the heat without special cooling , the experimenters performed tests with ceramics and fire clays of various types , with hard metals such as Stellite , with Nichrome and other heat-resistant metals , and with blocks of pure carbon serving as nozzles . The ceramics and fire clays cracked rapidly under the change in temperatures in the motor . The heat-resistant metals soon proved to lack sufficient heat resistance . The carbon had too little strength ; motors made of it burst promptly . All other materials likewise failed with disheartening certainty . By the end of the first series of tests , it was clear that none of these schemes would produce a permanent non-melting motor . The experimenters next turned to studies of ways in which the incoming fuel or the liquid oxygen could be made to do the cooling . The experiences of the Germans with liquid oxygen as a coolant brought this suggestion into early disrepute . Using the oxygen in this way simply caused it to boil furiously and vaporize before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , offered a source of cooling that had possibilities . Most of the suggestions for ways to introduce 2 IN . DIA . ASRESTO$ INSIDE GASKETS  | the fuel around the nozzle ? the place of most serious burning ? were complex and cumbersome , and had to be discarded . Then James Wyld , a member of the society 's experimental committee and later its president , came forth with a simple , practical " self-cooled tubular regenerative motor " and the problem began to be solved . The Wyld motor was simplicity itself . The blast chamber of the first model consisted of an aluminum tube two inches in diameter and six inches long , to the lower end of which was attached a short , stubby Monel metal nozzle of very thin wall section ? one eighth of an inch or less in thickness . The blast chamber was encased in a second tube , just a trifle larger , so as to leave a cylindrical space about an eighth of an inch in thickness for the passage of the fuel . This double jacketing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickness of the liquid layer was greater . In such a motor the fuel comes in near the tip of the nozzle and goes into the coolant chamber surrounding the nozzle with a swirling motion . From there it passes rapidly through the passage surrounding the blast chamber , and thence to a mixing device at the head of the motor . From the mixer it is sprayed through a series of inlet ports , intimately mingled with liquid oxygen which is brought in at the motor head . When the walls of the motor are thin enough , heat imparted by the escaping jet can readily pass through the metal and into the incoming fuel . The motor is called  | " regenerative " because it saves heat that would otherwise be wasted through the nozzle and the blast-chamber body , and brings it back inside the motor ... . In basic principle , the Wyld type of regenerative motor is the motor in use today in many an operation making use of liquid fuels . It works almost equally well with liquid oxygen , nitric acid , or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need be altered to take account of the relative corrosiveness of some of these chemical combinations . To use nitric acid , for example , the inner part of the motor and its connections must be made of stainless steel . The regenerative motor has a quite pleasing by-product , which arises from its regenerative features , the length of the blast chamber and the general design : its thermal efficiency is excellent . The efficiencies are now of the order of 40 to 45 percent in larger motors of this type , corresponding to jet velocities of 6,000 to 7,500 feet per second or better with liquid oxygen and gasoline . This efficiency is still far from the theoretical maximum , but compared with the efficiency of the skyrocket , at 2 percent , or the early motors of American experimenters , which were only about 5 percent efficient , this is enormous . Edition of 1949 Revised by the author , 1958 The search for new sources of energy continues . One of the most promising is the utilization of solar power . The amount of energy reaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kinds of energy now in use , but as yet the problems of harnessing it profitably have eluded man 's ingenuity . At present the most stupendous source of useful ? or destructive ? power is released in atomic fission or fusion . The historical background is brief in span . The scientific study of atomic disintegration can be traced  | back only as far as Roentgen 's discovery of X-rays in 1895 ; the equivalence of mass and energy to Einstein 's theory of 1905 . The feverish activity attendant on experimental disintegration of the atom just before World War II , the engineering miracles accomplished by the Manhattan Project , the bomb which finally brought the Japanese to their knees , and the race for ever more destructive bombs which has taken place since 1945 are parts of one of the most dramatic and important stories in the history of the human race . Less spectacular but , it is to be hoped , of greater eventual importance is the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes . The British have been among the leaders in such applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority , who designed and built the first British atomic energy factories , here describes the principles and practices followed . THE A.B.C . OF ATOMIC ENERGY SIR CHRISTOPHER HINTON IN A CONVENTIONAL power station we burn coal or oil to boil water which produces steam : the steam turns the blades of a turbine rather like the wind turns the sails of a windmill : the turbine drives large dynamos which in turn produce electricity . In an atomic power station exactly the same thing happens except that instead of boiling water by burning coal or oil we boil it by using some of the energy locked up inside the atom . This is the only difference . Instead of the conventional furnace in which coal is burnt we have an atomic furnace , called a reactor , in which we generate heat by splitting atoms . Of all the different types of atom which occur in nature , there is only one with which we can carry out the fission process , and this one is an isotope of uranium . Like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it also contains 143 neutrons making a total of 235 particles . So it is called , in scientists ' shorthand , uranium 235 . This is a very big and complex nucleus and if a stray neutron succeeds in penetrating the barrier of the circling electrons the nucleus is so unstable that it breaks into two pieces ? two smaller nuclei . Their combined energy content is much less than the energy content of the original uranium atom , and the surplus energy is given off as heat . This surplus energy drives the fission products apart at enormous speeds . They very quickly lose their speed by colliding with the surrounding atoms , and their energy of movement is converted to heat . There is one other important effect of this fission reaction . Besides the big pieces , the fission products , separate neutrons shoot out of the splitting nucleus . On the average we get about two and a half neutrons from every fission . Remember we started all this off with one neutron and we now have two or three new ones . The importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 235 they can split still more atoms thereby releasing more heat and producing still more neutrons , and so on in an ever expanding chain reaction . In this way the number of fissions builds up very rapidly and each one produces heat . The whole thing happens so quickly that in a fraction of a second so much heat will be produced that there will be an explosion . In fact , this is what happens in an atomic bomb . But this fission process ? this splitting and release of heat ? only takes place with one kind of uranium atom and this kind is comparatively rare . When we extract uranium ore from the earth and purify it , we get a heavy metal which is a mixture of two kinds of uranium atoms , two isotopes , which we call uranium 235 and uranium 238 . Uranium 235 we have just considered ? it splits when its nucleus is struck by a neutron . Uranium 238 behaves very differently . If a neutron strikes its nucleus the neutron is captured and eventually that atom is converted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaves like uranium 235 ? when struck by a neutron its nucleus splits , produces fission  | products and heat , and releases more neutrons . It is , in fact , an artificial nuclear fuel . We can now see how we should like our nuclear reactions to carry on inside our reactor . Let us suppose we have a lump of natural uranium and we expose it to neutrons ? never mind where the neutrons come from at the moment , I shall deal with that later . The reaction starts when one of these neutrons strikes an atom of uranium 235 . The atom splits , fission products are formed , heat is given off , and two or three neutrons shoot out . Let us suppose it is two neutrons from each fission , as I did say that on average 2% neutrons appear but some are inevitably lost . To keep our reaction going one of these two neutrons must hit another atom of uranium 235 but the other can hit an atom of uranium 238 . This does not produce heat , but the uranium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel . If we can carry on like this , using one neutron from each fission to cause a further fission , and the other neutron to convert uranium 238 to plutonium , we get a steady production of heat and a steady production of plutonium . The steady flow of heat is really what we are after as it is this heat which we can use to boil water to raise steam in our nuclear power station . The simultaneous production of plutonium is a fortunate bonus or by-product as we call it . But for every atom of uranium that will split and give off heat there are 139 atoms that will not . We must improve the chances of the neutrons striking the rare atoms of uranium 235 , and fortunately there is an easy way of doing this . When the neutrons first shoot out from the splitting atom they are traveling at tremendous speeds , and it has been found that if they can be slowed down sufficiently they are then much more likely to split other atoms of uranium 235 and less likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do we slow them down ? We do it by making them bounce about amongst atoms of a substance which is unlikely to capture them . We call the substance a moderator , because it moderates the speed of the neutrons . There are various possible moderators , but the one we have used in most of our reactors in Britain is carbon in  | the form of very pure graphite . The essential structure of a reactor is a mass of graphite with lumps of uranium spaced regularly in it . In fact the first reactor ever built in 1942 was just that . If the reactor is going to produce heat , we must also provide some means of collecting the heat . We can do this by forcing a gas through the graphite and uranium structure , where it picks up heat from the hot lumps of uranium and we can then use this heated gas to boil water . Let us now consider what happens to the neutrons . We start with two and a half from each fission , and one of these must cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of the rest , some will be captured by atoms of uranium 238 , and others by the materials of the reactor . Some will escape altogether . If the graphite and uranium structure , which we call the core , is small , so many neutrons will escape that there will not be enough left to keep the chain reaction going . As the size of the core increases the proportion of neutrons which escapes gets less . When this proportion is low enough to leave just enough neutrons to carry on the chain reaction , we say the core has reached the critical size . Anything smaller , and the reactor will not work at all . Anything bigger will leave us with neutrons to spare . A practical reactor must be bigger than the critical size so that there are spare neutrons to enable the fission reaction to build up . But we must not let it build up too far , or the release of heat will be too great ? our reactor will get too hot . So we must have some means of controlling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare neutrons when the number of fissions has reached the level we want . Certain substances absorb neutrons very readily , and one of these is boron . Boron can be made into an alloy with steel and if we push rods of boron steel into the core the rods will absorb some of the neutrons and prevent them from splitting uranium 235 atoms . The further we push them in , the more neutrons they will absorb , and in this way we can control the level of the reaction , just as we can control the rate at which an ordinary fire burns by pushing a damper into the chimney . If we push the rods in far enough , we can stop the reaction altogether .  | It is always wise to have a reliable safety device , like a fuse in an electric circuit , to prevent an accident if something goes wrong . In the same way we want to be sure of being able to shut down our reactor in case of need , even if something goes wrong with the control rods . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rods hung above the reactor core , and in an emergency they will fall into the reactor under their own weight and shut it down . One final problem has to be faced . If our reactor is producing heat it will inevitably produce fission products and these are highly radioactive . Something must therefore be done to protect the men who operate the reactor from too much exposure to this radioactivity . This we do by building a concrete box several feet thick round the reactor . The concrete will absorb sufficient radioactivity to make it biologically safe , and for this reason we call it a biological shield .  | Let us now summarize the basic features of a reactor ( Figure II-17 ) . On the outside we have the massive concrete box to absorb the radioactivity . Inside this concrete box is our graphite moderator which slows down the neutrons . At regular intervals in the graphite are the lumps of uranium , our nuclear fuel . Now for a variety of reasons you can not put lumps of uranium into a reactor like you can throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the uranium up into bars and seal the bars in metal containers . This assembly we call the fuel element . As the atoms split in the fuel element the container gets very hot . This is the heat we are after and we collect it by pumping gas past the hot containers and then use the heated gas to boil water . Finally we have our control and safety rods , the control rods to absorb any excess neutrons and so regulate our atomic furnace , and the safety rods to shut it down completely if the need arises . Now to deal with a point I mentioned earlier . Where do the neutrons come from to start the whole reaction ? Well , they could come from anywhere . Wherever you may be at this moment there are a few stray neutrons flying about you . We could rely on such stray neutrons to start off our reactor , but in addition to these we sometimes put inside the reactor what we call a neutron source , which will give us a steady supply . The first large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plutonium for defense purposes , but of course they produce heat as well , because as we have seen every reactor of this type inevitably produces both heat and plutonium . When we built them around 1949 we did not know enough to run the reactors at a high enough temperature to be able to harness the heat economically , so that what heat was produced just went up the chimney . By 1953 , when it was decided to build more reactors , this time at Calder Hall , the problems had to some extent been solved and besides using the reactors to make plutonium we were able to use the heat from them to boil water . The steam thus produced drives turbines and the turbines drive alternators , which generate electricity ( Figure 11-18 ) . Let me remind you of what 1 said right at the beginning ? the only  | difference between a nuclear power station and a conventional power station burning coal or oil lies in the source of the heat . The rest ? the boilers , the turbines , and the alternators ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prototype of the civil atomic power stations now being built it is worthwhile to study it in some detail . This will show us how practical engineering require-  | ments led to modifications of the basic design and will also give us some idea of the size and complexity of an industrial reactor . At Calder Hall ( Figure II-19 ) the moderator is made up from 58,000 separate pieces of graphite into a structure 36 feet across and 27 feet high . Every piece was made to an accuracy of two thousandths of an inch . The channels in  | which the uranium fuel elements are placed run from top to bottom instead of from side to side and there are some 1,700 of them . Each fuel element consists of a rod of uranium about an inch in diameter and 40 inches long and is sealed in a metal container with spiral fins to help in transferring the heat from the uranium to the gas . Six of these fuel elements are stacked one on top of another in each channel , which means that there are over 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reactor a charge chute is inserted in the appropriate tube passing through the roof and the fuel elements are lowered down it . They are later extracted in the same way . The gas we use to carry away the heat is carbon dioxide , and to remove the heat more efficiently we keep the gas circulating under a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch . Because of this pressure we have to surround the graphite core with a steel vessel two inches thick . This pressure vessel has four large pipes leading away from the top and another four leading back into the bottom . Gas flows up through each of the channels round the fuel elements , collecting the heat as it passes , then flows out through the top pipes to the heat exchangers or boilers . Here the gas loses its heat to water and converts it to steam . By the time the gas reaches the bottom of the heat exchangers it is comparatively cool and it is then pumped back into the pressure vessel through the pipes at the bottom to begin its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this way , collecting heat from the fuel elements and delivering it to the water in the heat exchangers . The speed of flow is so fast that a ton of gas flows back into the pressure vessel every second . Surrounding the pressure vessel is the biological shield which reduces the radiation from the reactor to a safe level . The walls of the shield are made of reinforced concrete seven feet thick with an eight-foot concrete roof . To prevent the concrete from getting too hot we line the entire inside surface with thick steel plates , which we call the thermal shield . A six-inch gap separates the thermal shield from the concrete , and through it cold air is constantly flowing .  | The top of the eight-foot concrete roof forms the working deck of the reactor . From here the fuel elements are loaded into the core thirty feet below through tubes which pass through the concrete and into the pressure vessel itself . In order to reduce the number of openings in the pressure vessel , each of these charge tubes serves sixteen fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderator has been altered from our basic design . Instead of being pushed in and out from the sides , they operate in special vertical channels . These channels are directly beneath the charge tubes which pass through the roof , and this enables us to put a winding mechanism on the top of the tube and hang the control rod from it on a steel cable . The winding mechanism raises or lowers the control rods in the reactor core and so enables us to regulate the power level . In an emergency , the control rods fall into the core under their own weight and we do not therefore need a separate set of safety rods . All these atomic power station reactors are producing not only heat but plutonium as well . This inevitable by-product is an artificial nuclear fuel of great value . Every industry tries to find a use for its by-products so as to reduce the cost of its main product , and in the same way we want to find the best means of using this plutonium which is formed in our reactors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with uranium which has lost some of its uranium 235 atoms ? the fuel atoms which can be split ? so as to restore it to its original standard as a fuel . If , however , you have a highly concentrated fuel , it is generally a bad thing economically to dilute it down : it is far more economical to design a machine which can take advantage of its special properties , and this is what we have done . At Dounreay , in the north of Scotland , we have built a reactor which is designed to work with a very rich fuel like plutonium . The Calder Hall reactors use uranium as it is extracted from its ore  --  what we call natural uranium ? and less than one percent of this can act as fuel . Because these fuel atoms ? uranium 235 ? are so few we have to provide a  | large mass of graphite to slow down the neutrons so as to ensure that a sufficient number of the neutrons do manage to split the rare fuel atoms , and do not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all or most of the atoms present are fuel atoms , we do not have to worry about the neutrons being captured , and so we need not provide any moderator to slow them down . This means we can get rid of over a thousand tons of graphite , and put our fuel close together . This makes the core of our reactor very much smaller . Instead of being something like the size of a house , it is now the size of a dustbin . You will remember that the two and a half neutrons produced on the average each time an atom is split can go one of three ways . One from each fission must cause another atom to split to keep the chain reaction going ; some are wasted because they are caught by materials in the reactor and get lost , and the rest are used to convert atoms of uranium 238 to plutonium . In this plutonium-fueled reactor , there is much less material in which our neutrons can get lost , so there are more neutrons available to convert atoms of uranium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no uranium 238 in the core , so we surround the core with rods of this uranium and these capture the spare neutrons . Of the neutrons produced from each fission one keeps the chain reaction going by splitting another plutonium atom , on average about a quarter of a neutron is lost , leaving one and a quarter neutrons to escape from the core and convert uranium 238 to plutonium . So each time we split a plutonium atom in the core we get one and a quarter new plutonium atoms produced ; that is , for every four atoms we burn , we get five new ones . In fact , we make new plutonium faster than we burn it . We call this breeding . Also because we do not slow the neutrons down , but use them when they are still traveling fast , it becomes a fast fission reactor . This combined with its ability to breed more new fuel than it burns makes it a fast fission breeder reactor . Now how do we ensure that the spare neutrons do not go on hitting more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converting the uranium round the outside into fresh fuel ? The answer lies in the precise arrangement of the phi tonium in the core arrived at by a combination of intricate mathematical calculations and skilful design . So in this reactor ( Figure II-20 ) we have a core consisting of plutonium fuel elements surrounded by rods of uranium 238 . Because the fuel is richer and closer together , the heat produced is much more concentrated than it is in the Calder Hall type of reactor . In fact , it is so concentrated that no gas could remove the heat fast enough , and we have to use a liquid metal . This liquid metal is a mixture of sodium  | and potassium . The mixture is pumped through the core of the reactor where it collects heat from the fuel . This heat we use to boil water and produce steam for our turbines just as in the other atomic power stations . Unfortunately , while the liquid metal is collecting the heat it becomes radioactive as well , so we can not allow it to come outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do not want to take the water inside the biological shield . So in order to transfer the heat from the liquid metal to the water we have to provide a link between the two in the form of a completely separate circuit or loop of this sodium-potassium mixture , which we call the secondary liquid metal circuit . Round the reactor core , and inside the biological shield , are the primary heat exchangers . They are made up of coils of double tubes , one inside the other . The liquid metal which has been heated in the core flows through the inner tube , while the secondary liquid metal flows through the outer tube . In this way the heat but not the radioactivity is transferred to the secondary liquid metal which we can then bring out through the shield to the secondary heat exchangers or boilers . There it passes its heat to water and produces steam . The only other feature of the Dounreay reactor that I want to mention is probably the best known of all . Surrounding the reactor , the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball , 135 feet across . That is there to prevent the escape of radioactive material in case there should be a fire , because sodium is very inflammable and burns very fiercely . I told you that the object of building this fast fission breeder reactor was to burn the plutonium which is inevitably produced in the industrial power stations of the Calder Hall type . But from what I have just said it will be clear that once we have given this fast reactor its first supply of plutonium fuel it produces more fuel than it burns . That means that as long as we keep up a supply of uranium 238 , which you remember is not fuel , it will keep itself going . So we can see a possible pattern of industrial power stations in Britain for the future . Stations with reactors of the Calder Hall type will produce by-product plutonium which we can  | use to start up an increasing number of fast reactor stations , which will then keep themselves going indefinitely . But there is another important advantage to be gained from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They enable us to burn up all our uranium , instead of only a small fraction , since the uranium 238 ? the atoms which will not split ? can all eventually be converted to plutonium and used as fuel . Indeed we can go further . There is another natural element ? thorium ? which can be converted into nuclear fuel . Its atoms will not split at all , but like atoms of uranium 238 , thorium atoms can capture neutrons and change into another isotope of uranium ? uranium 233 which is also an artificial nuclear fuel . So we could surround the core with thorium rods in place of the uranium 238 and still breed new fuel . This means that the fast breeder reactor will enable us to add all the earth 's store of thorium to the stocks of uranium as a potential source of fuel for atomic power stations . In saying this I am looking quite a way into the future . There are many difficult problems yet to be solved , though the reactor at Dounreay in the north of Scotland ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of the answers . During this period of development , improvements to the Calder Hall type of reactor , which are continually being made , will provide a reliable and efficient source of heat for nuclear power stations , and of course that kind of reactor has the great merit that it runs on natural uranium . The two types of reactor I have described so far are typical of the large range of possible systems , all of which work on the fission principle ? the production of heat by splitting atoms . We can , however , also release heat by the opposite process ? building atoms up instead of splitting them down ? what we call the fusion process . The simplest of these fusion processes is the joining together of two nuclei of heavy hydrogen to form a nucleus of helium and a spare escaping neutron . An atom of heavy hydrogen contains one proton and one neutron and when two of these atoms collide at very high speed their nuclei fuse together for a moment and form one  | atom of helium . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen atoms but only one of the neutrons . The other escapes . The difficulty with this process is that the atoms have to be traveling at enormous speeds before their nuclei will fuse together . One way of speeding them up is to raise their temperature , but to get them going fast enough to fuse needs a temperature of several million degrees ? far hotter than the surface of the sun . Clearly , we can not reach this sort of  | temperature , or anything approaching it , by heating the atoms over a fire or in a furnace since all known materials would melt and vaporize at temperatures far lower than this , and so we have to find some other way . The most promising way , it seems , is to pass a powerful electric current through heavy hydrogen gas in a tube . By this means the gas can be made extremely hot but there is the further task of maintaining this temperature long enough for fusion reactions to take place . Some very successful work has already been done along these lines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1958 , Harwell announced for the first time that they were able to heat up heavy hydrogen gas to a temperature of five million degrees and hold it for a few thousandths of a second . How was this done ? British scientists and engineers at Harwell built a large apparatus called Zeta . It looks like a big transformer the size of a double decker bus . The vital part of Zeta is a large container shaped like the inner tube of a motorcar tire ; this tube is about ten feet across and has thick aluminium walls . Heavy hydrogen gas is put into the tube and a jolt of electricity is passed through it from a transformer . The object of this electric current is to heat the gas to a temperature at which the atoms of heavy hydrogen will fuse together . Fortunately as soon as the electric current begins to flow the gas is automatically squeezed Sato a narrow column in the middle of the tube away from the walls Figure II-21(a) . This happens because all electric currents have magnetic forces acting round them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the center of the tube . Up to this point nature works in favor of the scientist . But as soon as the gas is squeezed like this , we face a major problem . The gas carrying the electric current immediately begins to wriggle and jump about inside the tube Figure 11-21(b) . Unless we can do something about this wriggle it will touch the walls and lose its heat and perhaps melt the wall . It is essential to keep the gas in the center of the tube for as long as the electric current lasts . In Zeta the gas is kept centrally in the tube and well away  | from the walls by imposing additional magnetic forces along the path of the current Figure II-21(c) . These magnetic forces are generated by winding coils of wire round the outside of the aluminum tube and then passing electricity through the coils . When this is done the wriggle disappears . The main achievement with Zeta has been to hold the gas in the center of the tube long enough , and at temperatures high enough , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusion ? Well , remember the fusion of two heavy hydrogen atoms gives an atom of helium containing three atomic particles in its nucleus , and in addition a spare neutron . These spare neutrons escape from the tube altogether and it is by detecting them that we know that fusion must be taking place in Zeta . The next step facing research scientists is to raise the temperature of the gas even higher by putting still more electrical energy into Zeta and its successors . At higher temperatures held for longer times the amount of energy produced from fusion of the gas will increase until it exceeds the amount of energy needed to create the tremendous heat . We shall then start showing a profit , and ultimately be able to convert this energy gain into electrical power . But scientists estimate that in order to show the profit we are after , we shall need to heat the gas to temperatures exceeding a hundred million degrees . So the main problems facing scientists are heating the gas to a temperature above a hundred million degrees , holding it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of converting the energy gain into electricity . No one can say just how long it is going to take them to crack these enormous nuts ? it may well be many years . And even when these major problems have been solved , many engineering difficulties will have to be overcome before we see the fusion equivalent of Calder Hall . ( Figure 11-22 ) . What then is the advantage of the fusion reaction which justifies all this elaborate research ? The answer lies in the fuel it burns . We get it from ordinary water . Water is made up of oxygen and hydrogen and I said earlier that most  | hydrogen atoms have one proton but no neutron , but that one atom in every six thousand is different . It has both a proton and a neutron and is called an atom of heavy hydrogen or deuterium . This in fact is our fuel . It is obtained by a separation process costing only a few shillings a gram to produce . The energy stored in this thimbleful of deuterium is equivalent to the energy stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only cheap ? its supply is inexhaustible . II-22.  | Archaeologists divide man 's history into three main divisions ? the Stone Age , the Bronze Age , and the Iron Age ? each with many subdivisions and frequently overlapping . It is possible that the first use of iron began during the Stone Age when it was discovered in meteors . We do not know how the complicated process of smelting was discovered but the metal was in limited use several millenia before Christ . In wroughtiron form it was highly prized for swords and daggers . Gradually , as tempering by quenching in cold water became understood , its use spread in both craftsmanship and agriculture . But not until the coming of the blast furnaces of the Middle Ages were temperatures obtained hot enough to melt the metal for casting . In the fifteenth century , iron cannons were cast in molds , thus sounding the death knell of chivalry and feudal castles . In the sixteenth century , iron became increasingly scarce and expensive , due to increasing population , the demands of war , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's day this scarcity resulted in the substitution of coal , but such use was limited and unsatisfactory , because of impurities in the coal and difficulties in forcing a blast through the mixture . Abraham Darby of Birmingham was the first to use coke in blast furnaces , and founded a family of great ironmasters . Coal mining boomed and the problem of freeing the mines from water led to the steam pumps of Savery , Newcomen , and Watt . The connection between smelting and steam power became closer when John Wilkinson used the new invention to create a hotter and more continuous blast independent of water . He ordered his machine from the newly founded firm of Boulton and Watt in 1776 . Another improvement had been made by Benjamin Huntsman , a Doncaster watchmaker , who produced a steel free of slag and other impurities in the intense heat of a crucible furnace . He moved to Sheffield in 1 744 , where a competitor dressed as a beggar is said to have 144  | learned his secret . His process , at first rejected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this purpose during the following decades . Nevertheless , the manufacture of cast steel continued to be a costly process and wrought iron , although inferior in performance , remained the material in most common use . The innovations of three engineers of genius , whose contributions are described by J. D. Bernal , introduced the fourth great age of man ? the Age of Steel ? in which we now live . Dr. Bernal , a noted crystallographer , is Professor of Physics at the University of London , and author of several books including The Social Function of Science and Science and Industry in the 19th Century , from which this selection is taken . THE AGE OF STEEL J. D. BERNAL IN THE LAST THIRD of the nineteenth century , economy and politics were largely influenced by the availability , cheap and in quantity , of what was virtually a new material ? cast steel , which could be rolled or forged . Steel rapidly replaced iron in most of its important large-scale uses ? for rails , for ships , for bridges and for buildings . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these purposes but also enabled much more daring constructions to be attempted . The adoption of steel was a major factor in opening the whole world to a new level of trade and exploitation in a matter of decades . It made colonial dependencies and undeveloped areas much more profitable , helped capital expansion , and was the material basis of the new imperialism of the end of the century . Economic and technical factors combined to make the steel age the prologue of a new period of wars and revolutions . The transition from iron to steel appears on close ex-  | amination to be due to the work of far fewer men than any other major transformation in techniques . Three great names stand out clearly , Bessemer of the converter , Siemens of the regenerative open hearth , and Gilchrist Thomas of the basic lining . The three changes they introduced , though extremely simple in underlying principle , marked each in its own way an abrupt and decisive change in technique . Yet they were more than technical changes , as witness the fact that despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not one of them came from anyone in the trade but instead from rank outsiders , whose ignorance of what could not be done was their chief asset . The technical break involved in large-scale steel production was one too great to be bridged by slow improvements of existing techniques ; it needed fresh and imaginative minds that did not know what could not be done . Bessemer was an inventor and manufacturer of bronze powder ; Siemens was an engineer whose chief interest had been in electricity and the steam engine ; Thomas was a police court clerk with a classical education and a hobby of chemistry . What made their achievements possible was that they all , in very different degrees , made use of science . But this , in itself , is no explanation . There were , in their time , hundreds of engineers and chemists who knew far more science and even more of the science of metallurgy than they did . What they had in common , and what made their success , was their appreciation of the existence of technical and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were determined to solve them by a radical examination of the ends to be achieved and not merely , as most metallurgists had done before them , by a mere modification of existing practice . The approach of each of the three was very different , characteristic not only of the man but of his times . Bessemer , born in 1822 , was an unusual combination of prolific inventor and self-confident enterprising capitalist of the mid . century . Sir W. Siemens , a trained engineer , was one of a band of brothers determined to apply science in one form or another to make their fortunes , characteristic of the new  | German capitalism of the seventies . Gilchrist Thomas , solitary and poor , was the only one of the three who appears to have been conscious of exactly what he was trying to do . He alone analysed the whole problem and found a theoretical solution which was successful in practice almost from the start . What is perhaps even more remarkable is that , unlike such inventors in the past , he had secured , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most powerful interests were unable to break . In his work one can see the prototype of the industrial research establishment of the next century . By 1854 the manufacture of iron , cast and wrought , was expanding with ever increasing speed , but steel was still a luxury product , selling at about ? 50 a ton , of very uncertain quality and available in small pieces , as against ? 3 ? ? 4 for pig iron , and ? 8 ? ? 9 for wrought-iron rails . It might have seemed that this disparity in price between products containing approximately the same materials would have led to an intense search for new methods of manufacture , but rightly or wrongly no ironmaster thought it was worth his while . The steelmakers on their side were as satisfied with a small turnover of a valuable commodity . Henry Bessemer entered the field almost by accident , but was well equipped for the task . The son of an engineer and craftsman , he had little formal education but great practical experience , particularly of type casting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he supported himself in his early years . He had a genuine passion for mechanical work and had picked up a good deal of science , particularly chemistry . At the age of thirty he had had the idea of replacing the age-old hand process of making powder for gold paint out of leaf brass by one using machinery alone . What led him to do so is best told in his own words : My eldest sister was a very clever painter in water colors , and in her early life , in the little village of Charlton , she had ample opportunities of indulging her taste for flower painting . . . and had , with much ingenuity , made  | a most tastefully decorated portfolio for their reception . She wished to have the words STUDIES OF FLOWERS FROM NATURE , by Miss Bessemer , written in bold printing letters within a wreath of acorns and oak leaves which she had painted on the outside of the portfolio ; as I was somewhat of an expert in writing ornamental characters , she asked me to do this for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me for that purpose . How trivial and how very unimportant this incident must appear to my readers . It was , nevertheless , fraught with the most momentous consequences to me ; in fact , it changed the whole current of my life , and rendered possible that still greater change which the iron and steel industry of the world has undergone , and with it the fortunes of hundreds of persons who have been directly , or indirectly , affected by it . The portfolio was so prettily finished that I did not like to write the desired inscription in common ink ; and as I had seen , on one occasion , some gold powder used by japanners , it struck me that this would be a very appropriate material for the lettering I had undertaken . How distinctly I remember going to the shop of a Mr. Clark , a colourman in St. John Street , Clerkenwell , to purchase this " gold powder . " He showed me samples of two colours , which I approved . The material was not called " gold " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounce of each shade of colour , for which I was to call on the following day . I did so , and was greatly astonished to find that I had to pay seven shillings per ounce for it . On my way home , I could not help asking myself , over and over again , " How can this simple metallic powder cost so much money ? " for there can not be gold enough in it , even at that price , to give it this beautiful rich colour . It is , probably , only a better sort of brass ; and for brass in almost any conceivable form , seven shillings per ounce is a marvellous price . ... Here was powdered brass selling retail at ? 5 12s.  | per pound , while the raw material from which it was made cost probably no more than sixpence . " It must , surely , " I thought , " be made slowly and laboriously , by some old-fashioned hand process ; and if so , it offers a splendid opportunity for any mechanic who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I adopted this view of the case with that eagerness for novel inventions which my surroundings had so strongly favoured , and I plunged headlong into this new and deeply interesting subject . ' Realizing that everything depended on secrecy he devised an almost automatic plant which he set up in a factory without windows , operated only by his wife 's three brothers . Thus he retained his secret for forty years . This achievement was in many ways more difficult than that of making steel and points to the factories of the age of mass production . As a result he made a small fortune , which he found essential for his large-scale experiments on making steel . He had , in fact , financed his own industrial research establishment . Always combative , particularly when roused by official complacency and stupidity , he determined to attack the problem of the large-scale production of cast steel just because the War Office had maintained that it could not be done . He had devised an aerodynamically spun shell adapted to smooth-bore cannon which they said no cast iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be used and was told condescendingly that no such gun could be made , because uniform steel could not be had in quantity . lie thereupon decided to produce it . His only qualification for the enterprise was his successful development , a few years before , of a method of continuous casting of glass sheet which is the basis of all present methods . This gave i . It was from old books , probably based on the Treatise upon Divers Arts by Theophilus the monk in the eleventh century , or .1 derivative source that Bessemer found the principles of the process which was still carried out on a traditional basis in Germany . See Sir Henry Bessemer , F.R.S. , An Autobiography , London , 1905.  | him a good knowledge of the making and management of furnaces . In his own words : My knowledge of iron metallurgy was at that time very limited , and consisted only of such facts as an engineer must necessarily observe in the foundry or smith 's shop ; but this was in one sense an advantage to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was open and free to receive any new impressions , without having to struggle against the bias which a lifelong practice of routine operations can not fail more or less to create . He started with the idea of using the first scientific method of steelmaking , devised by Reaumur in 1720 , of fusing together wrought iron , almost carbon free , and cast iron , saturated with carbon . This he proposed to do by using a reverberating furnace , but had little success . Noticing that much of the gas remained unburnt , he introduced air pipes into the furnace itself . This increased the flame temperature but also , he noticed , burnt the carbon out of the iron . Seizing on this observation he was led , step by step , to blowing air through the molten metal in fixed and then in movable furnaces , and ultimately to his famous converter . This development , which took barely two years , was an admirable example of the combination of observation and full-scale experimentation with scientific explanation of each step . In 1856 he succeeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converter and announced his success , characteristically enough for the times and the man , at the Cheltenham meeting of the British Association . Bessemer 's process was enthusiastically taken up by the ironmasters , but almost as quickly dropped because of the apparently fatal flaw of failing to remove the phosphorus which most English and European ores contained . He himself , however , persisted and set up a works in Sheffield , and in the teeth of the steelmakers made steel with phosphorus-free ores from Sweden , Spain , or Cumberland which was better than most and cheaper than any that they made . The rest of Bessemer 's business life was spent in fighting a long , but ultimately successful , battle against the prejudices  | and interests opposed to the use of the new steel . This , though it involved little science , was an essential part in the changeover from iron to steel . In the hands of a less combative and businesslike man , the innovation might have been overborne and the transformation postponed for decades . This surmise requires the usual qualification that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of men were working towards the idea of violent oxidation of molten cast iron . Nasmyth had already in 1854 blown steam through molten iron to keep it stirred ; he was within an ace of discovering the converter but he generously admitted Bessemer 's claim to the full credit because he understood what he was doing . William Kelly , a Pittsburgh man , came closer still and made what would be now known as a sideblown converter in his Suwanee Furnace on the Cumberland river in which he made plates for the Ohio and Mississippi steamboats as far back as 1851 . Lacking the knowledge , the facilities , and the money that Bessemer could command , and caught by the instabilities of American finance , he was unable to develop his method and his patent was invalidated . The practical success of the converter was assured once it became possible to control accurately the low but vital carbon content of the steel it poured . One way to achieve this , but a difficult and unreliable one , was to stop the blast at the right moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon out and then to restore just the right amount at the end of the process . Spiegeleisen , an iron manganese carbide , proved to be an ideal way of doing this , as the manganese had an additional deoxidizing effect and cured the defect of early Bessemer steel of being red-short . Its preparation and properties had been investigated by a skilled metallurgist , Robert Mushet , who proposed its use in steel making . He was the son of David Mushet , the discoverer of the black-band ironstone that was to make the fortune of the Scottish iron industry . Mushet 's patent was badly drawn up and Bessemer was able to evade it , but he seems to have had some conscience in the subject for on being appealed to by Mushet 's daughter he paid the now impoverished steel-  | maker a pension of ? 300 a year until his death in 1891 . There is no question , however , that it is to Bessemer and not to Kelly or Mushet that the real credit for making steel on a large scale is due . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles still remained to be overcome before the full day of cheap steel . To many ironmasters the converter seemed an unnecessarily costly and complex machine and they welcomed a simpler way of making steel in large quantities . This was provided in 1867 by the Siemens-Martin process . It is difficult to place Sir William Siemens in the history of science and technology because , though by himself he would be a typical scientific inventor of the nineteenth century , he can not be considered apart from his family of six distinguished and enterprising brothers , particularly the eldest brother , Werner von Siemens , who saw to his education . It was the latter who directed what was virtually an international syndicate of inventors and industrialists centered in Germany but operating in Britain , France , Russia , and indeed all over the world . The Siemens family contributed perhaps more than any other group of persons to the creation of modern German industry and gave it , from the start , the academic scientific basis that neither British nor American industry acquired till very much later . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventies was still higher than in Germany , and Sir William Siemens ? the English Siemens ? found there a wider market for the exploitation of the family 's inventions . Though these were multiple and covered an enormous range , the most successful were the production of instruments and cable for the growing telegraph industry , the development of the dynamo and electric power production , and industrial furnaces . Unlike Bessemer , who attempted to solve a number of specific problems one after the other , using any means that occurred to him , what we now would call a series of converging researches , the Siemens were consciously applying certain general engineering principles and feeling their  | way as to where they could be used most profitably , typical divergent research . The principle that concerns us here is that of regeneration . The idea is one of common sense backed by the thermodynamic principle that heat should not be allowed to escape from any industrial process but should be used for warming up incoming products . Applied to metal furnaces it meant an end of the flaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky in Sheffield and the Black Country . Instead the hot gases heated a mass of bricks white-hot and escaped when relatively cool , while fresh air was later heated up by forcing it over the hot bricks . Originally intended as a means of economizing fuel , regenerative furnaces proved to have the unhoped-for power of raising temperatures to levels never before reached . Using gas fuel to avoid contamination they made the original Reaumur process of a mix of scrap iron and pig iron possible on a large scale and on an open hearth . Just that extra temperature was needed to convert the tedious puddling process , in which the purer , and consequently less fusible , iron was drawn out in a pasty condition , into one in which the whole charge could become a bath of melted steel which could be poured out by the ton . There were , naturally , many practical difficulties , particularly in finding refractory furnace linings , but these were largely overcome by the French ironmaster , Etienne Martin . The final result by 1867 was a process as cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less mechanically and chemically revolutionary , thus appealing more to the traditionally minded steelmakers . Siemens himself was not notably successful in his use of it . His own Landore works , though it turned out excellent steel , suffered seriously in the depression of the seventies and Sir William lost there much of what he had gained in his other enterprises . The regenerative open-hearth furnace did not depend as much as Bessemer 's on phosphorus-free ore , but it still could not make steel out of the highly phosphatic ores of Cleveland and the by then German Lorraine , which could  | only be used for iron . By the middle of the seventies this disparity was a glaring one and the problem of making steel from phosphatic ores was an open challenge . Yet despite all the new talent called into action in the steel industries of Britain , France , and Germany the solution did not come from any ironmaster or metallurgist , but as the result of the deliberate and carefully directed researches of a very part-time scientist , Sidney Gilchrist Thomas . He came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes , particularly marked in his mother . His father , a civil servant , was never very well off and his early death left the family in very reduced circumstances . It was for that reason that Sidney , at seventeen , with a promising university career before him , felt he must give it up and obtain an extremely wearing job as a junior police court clerk in the London docks , the conditions of which probably conduced to his early death from tuberculosis . He continued his studies at Birkbeck College in the evenings , concentrating on chemistry . There he heard the lecturer , Dr. Chaloner , say that anyone who could solve the problem of making steel from phosphoric ores would make his fortune . Thomas needed that fortune badly , not , as might be thought , for the support of his mother and sisters , but because the horrors which he had to witness every day at his East End court filled him with idealistic schemes for social reform . He , therefore , set himself deliberately to the problem , not as Bessemer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific analysis of the factors involved . He read voraciously in the technical literature and himself became a contributor to the journal Iron , using his scant leisure to visit ironworks at home and abroad . The solution of the problem which had baffled all professional metallurgists took him from 1871 to 1875 , using a cellar as a laboratory and working in what time was left between his duties and his courses . Essentially the solution was that of absorbing the oxidized phosphorus or phosphoric acid in a basic lining , made from magnesian limestone . The necessary practical tests were  | carried out in the course of 1877 by his cousin , Percy Gilchrist , who was employed as a chemist in the Blaenavon ironworks , working at first with a miniature converter holding eight pounds . Later with the assistance of the manager , Mr. Martin , they worked up to 11 cwt . By March of the next year Thomas was confident enough to take out patents and announce his discovery to the Iron and Steel Institute , where no notice whatever was taken of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his paper on the new method was not found sufficiently interesting to be read , but there Thomas met Mr. Richards , the manager of a Cleveland ironworks , and impressed him enough to persuade him to make some full-scale tests . Finally on April 4th , 1879 , the first few tons of steel were made at Middlesbrough . Immediately the whole steel world was at his door clamoring for licenses . Krupps tried to evade the patents , but Thomas , who had not been a police court clerk for nothing , brought them to law and forced them to pay up . The process , unlike Bessemer 's , was an almost unqualified success from the start . It made the steel industry of Middlesbrough , of the Ruhr , and of the southern United States . The steel age had begun in earnest , but the man who had made that possible and who could have gone on to further triumphs had only a few years to live , dying in Paris in 1885 and leaving the bulk of a now considerable fortune to charity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metallurgy , the first striking point is their independence of any organized scientific movement . Of the three inventors only Siemens had a university education , and none of them received any material assistance or more than a little advice from academic , scientific or governmental sources . This is the more surprising as by the midcentury the official scientific movement was in full swing , thanks in part to the German influence that came in with Prince Albert . In fact , the beginning of organized and subsidized industrial research had to wait another ten  | years , though its value had been amply proved by Bessemer 's work . In those days it was still thought sufficient to provide institutes and bodies like the British Association for promoting and discussing the reports of research carried out by private means . The inventor was expected to recoup himself by exploiting his invention under cover of the patent laws , if he was lucky . We see , in fact , Bessemer and Siemens using the results of one invention to finance the next , while Thomas was only able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and starving himself . Even the military departments , which were to benefit so largely by the results of the revolution in steelmaking , did not encourage it and indeed were so attached to older materials and methods that they subjected the innovators , particularly Bessemer , to a series of painful snubs . These conditions were exaggerated in an industry like iron and steel , which had grown up in the hard way by expanding the operations of smiths , with the occasional injection of critical new ideas by outsiders , such as Roebuck and Cort in the eighteenth century , both of whom ruined themselves for their pains . The result of this state of affairs was that new methods penetrated very slowly and there was an altogether unnecessary time lag between scientific knowledge and its application . None of the scientific ideas used by Bessemer , Siemens and Thomas were more recent than 1790 and the steel age might well have begun fifty years before it did . It would , however , have grown more slowly , owing to the far more limited technical and financial structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for the enterprise and good fortune of the inventors , particularly Bessemer , it might have been delayed , but not for so long , because it is clear from the methods of Siemens , and still more of Thomas , that science was soon to reach a stage when it could be used consciously and deliberately to solve industrial problems .  | The growth of engineering has been fostered not only by such inventions as those of Watt and Bessemer , but by innumerable less revolutionary devices and materials which have become part of the standard equipment of the profession . In the history of construction , one of the most interesting and useful of such materials was developed during the 184o 's by a German immigrant to the United States named John A. Roebling , who was to become one of the country 's greatest bridge builders . Roebling was born in Prussia in 18o6 , studied at the Polytechnic School in Berlin and after emigrating in 1831 , set up shop as a civil engineer in Western Pennsylvania . Here he developed his new process for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention appeared in the " American Railroad Journal and Merchanics ' Magazine " in 1843 . The first important use of the material was in the Grand Trunk Bridge at Niagara Falls , which Roebling undertook to construct after another engineer had resigned . The bridge , for railroad use , was an unqualified success , and inaugurated an active era of suspension bridge building in the United States . Roebling 's most spectacular achievement , shared with his son Washington , was the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge . Part of the story of that monumental undertaking is reprinted on page 255 . MANUFACTURE OF VIVRE ROPES JOHN A. ROEBLING THE ART of manufacturing ropes of wire is comparatively new . Numerous attempts have been made in Europe and here , and most of them have proved failures . A collection of parallel wires , bound together by wrappings in the manner of a suspension cable , is no rope and not fit for running , it can only be used for a stationary purpose . The first rigging made in England was of this description . The difficulty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the material ; iron fibres can not be twisted like hemp , cotton , or woolen ; their texture would be injured by the attempt . To remove this obstacle , some manufacturers have resorted to annealing , and thereby destroyed the most valuable properties of iron wire , viz. its great strength and elasticity . My first attempts in the manufacture of wire rope were made four years ago , my intimacy with the construction of wire cable bridges induced me to investigate this matter . The principles of my process differ from those of the English manufacturers , they are original and secured by patent . The novelty of my proceeding chiefly consists in the spiral laying of the wires around a common axis without twisting the fibres , and secondly in subjecting the individual wires while thus laying to a uniform and forcible tension under all circumstances . By this method , the greatest strength is obtained by the least amount of material , and at the same time a high degree of pliability . Each individual wire occupies exactly the same position throughout the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force applied in laying is the close contact of the wires , which renders the admission of air and moisture impossible . Three years ago I offered to the board of canal commissioners , which was then in power in Pennsylvania , to put a wire rope of my manufacture on one of the planes of the Allegheny Portage railroad , at my own risk and expense , the value of the rope to be paid in proportion as it rendered services equivalent to a hemp rope . This liberal offer however was rejected and not considered until the present board came into office . Last year I put three ropes , measuring in the aggregate 3400 feet , 41/2 inches circumference , in operation on plane No. 3 . Owing to the want of adhesion , I had at the start to contend with some difficulties . By means of a double groove on the receiving sheave and a guide sheave placed back of it , which crosses the rope and leads it from one groove to the other , which improvements were added to the machinery last winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather there is delay and  | slipping on the other planes the wire rope can at all times pull as heavy a load without a balance , as the engine is capable of hauling . The planes of the Portage railroad require hemp ropes of 81 inches circumference , made of the best Russian or Italian hemp , and which can not be trusted longer with safety than one season . They are frequently from reasons of economy continued 1 ? seasons ; much however , depends upon the weather and business . The unfavorable circumstances under which the wire rope had to work last year affected it some ; the wear of the whole of this season , however , is not perceptible , and its present condition promises a long duration . I am now manufacturing another wire rope of 5100 feet long in four pieces for plane No. 10 . The first rope of my make , 600 feet long , 81 inches circumference has now been in successful operation two seasons , hauling section boats from the basin to the railroad at Johnstown . Two more were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hallidaysburg and Columbia . From my present experience , I may safely assert that wire rope deserves the preference over hemp rope in all situations much exposed , and where great strength and durability is required . By my process of manufacture , the same pliability is imparted to the rope which is proper to the wire itself . Paradox as this may appear , it is nevertheless a fact and is easily explained . By pliability is here understood the extent of flexure to which the rope or wire may be subjected , without producing a permanent bend ; when released the rope must resume its former and straight position . To bend a rope requires force , and this force is in proportion to its areal section , caeteris paribus . Well manufactured iron rope is more pliable than hemp rope of the same strength . I am manufacturing tillers of fine wire , capable of bearing 3000 pounds and which ply around cylinders as small as four inches in diameter , and in which the wires are so compactly laid , that not the slightest shifting in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my tillers are in use on the Ohio and Mississippi . Such rope would be pliable enough for running rigging and be of long duration .  | I will here add a few remarks on the introduction of standing wire rigging in place of hemp rigging . This subject has , for some years past , engaged the attention of the navy department of England and France , and the success which has attended the use of wire in place of hemp for shrouds and stays in the naval and commercial service of Great Britain , would , it appears , seem to warrant an attempt to test its utility on our national vessels . Allow me to cite here a few remarks from the notes of Capt . Basil Hall , on a tour through Switzerland , and while examining the wire suspension bridge at Fryburg . He says , attempts are now making and will ere long succeed , to introduce wire rigging , which is stronger and better than chain , because less dependent on the accidental quality and careless manufacture of a single part . How strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so successfully adopted in France , and elsewhere , should not have found favor enough in England to be fairly tried on a large scale . Fryburg bridge 301 feet wider than Menai , at least equally strong , has cost only one-fifth of the money . I do not think wire will answer for running rope ; but for standing rigging it may , I conceive , be most usefully substituted for hemp , for with equal strength experience shows it to be lighter . The cables of suspension bridges are stationary and will , when protected against oxidation , last an indefinite period . Standing rigging ( when compared to running rope ) is nearly stationary , and there is little wear but what arises from the direct strain , which if supported by sufficient strength , will have no deteriorating effect . In comparing the two materials , wire and hemp , for rigging , the state of preservation and time of use should be considered . For instance , a hemp stay of a certain size , made of the best Italian hemp , will when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay of the same weight per foot ; but let the two stays have been exposed and served five years , then the strength of the hemp stay will be gone , while the wire stay will not show  | any perceptible reduction . In this case , of course , a common wear and tear is supposed . The most prominent features of wire rigging , as compared to hemp rigging , are its great durability , less weight and size , less surface exposed to wind , less danger in time of action of being destroyed by shot . Another good quality of the wire rope is its great elasticity which is quite sufficient to counteract the effect of a sudden jerk , while a vessel is rolling heavily at sea . The elasticity of hemp rigging is only to be relied on to a very small extent ; it will give and stretch a great deal but not return . A common objection of those not familiar with the nature of wire rope is its supposed rapid destruction by oxidation , but no apprehension is less founded than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or out of water , in mines or any other situation , will not even require the protection of oil , varnish or tar ; while at work it will rust no more than a rail or a chain in use , but when idle , oxidation will affect it in proportion to the surface exposed . As , however , the process of laying is carried on with mathematical precision , by which the wires are brought into the closest contact , the assemblage of wires in form of a strand present a solid rod , which will be no more subjected to rusting than the link of a chain of the same size . The individual wires as well as the strands and ropes are coated with an excellent varnish during the manufacture . Wire rigging will require no other protection but oiling or tarring once or twice a season . Where elegance is an object , black or green paint may be used . Rigging made of zinked wires and not painted , would present a most elegant appearance and be exempt from all rusting . Wire rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The attachment of wire shrouds to the sides of the vessel and to the masthead and their connection with the rattlines ( which should also be of wire ) can be effected by the old method ; the use of wire however , will suggest some modifications better adapted to the material . Some wire rigging has been manufactured in England which simply consists of a collection of parallel wires bound  | together and served over with hemp . These mixtures , as experience has proved in the case of tiller ropes , are objectionable , the wire will rust inside of the hemp in spite of all protection by varnish ; besides , the cover of hemp , which adds nothing to the strength , is only an additional expense . Iron is now gradually superseding wood in the construction of vessels ; a complete revolution in ship building has already commenced in England . Although very expensive at first , iron ships will prove the cheapest in the end . Are there any well founded objections to wire rigging , which assumes the same relation to hemp rigging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why then not test this matter by encouraging those who are capable of bringing it to perfection ? A number of iron vessels are now building for the naval and revenue service , which seem to offer appropriate occasions for the test of this matter . The earliest practice of mining preceded the dawn of written history . Such metals as gold and copper , which occur in the free state , were mined before the science of metallurgy was born . As civilization advanced and demand increased , mining with pick and shovel , hammers and wedges , increased . Shattering of rock by heating and sudden cooling with cold water became accepted procedure . The first record of extensive mining by means of shafts beneath the surface seems to be that of the Greeks at the silver mines of Laurion . The Romans sought out metals with avidity , not only in Italy but in every other corner of the Empire . Although they permitted conquered territories a measure of self-government , they took strict control of mineral resources . Slave labor was regularly employed and the appalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper , galleries were supported by timbers , the perennial problem of water in lower levels was met with bucket wheels and screw pumps . In general , no revolutionary methods were employed . Production judged by later standards was extremely small , but the gold , silver , copper ,  | and quicksilver of Spain , the tin and lead of Britain , and iron from as far away as India played their part in shoring up the power of the Empire and adorning its inhabitants . The greatest early treatise on mining , " De Re Metallica " by Georg Bauer , known as Agricola , was printed in 1556 . It described machinery , techniques , and underground construction with such lucid text and illustrations that it remained a standard reference work for hundreds of years . Many of the methods advocated are still in use . Incidentally , a translation from Latin into English was published by former President Herbert Hoover and his wife in 1912 . Over the centuries , the muscles of men were gradually supplemented by horsepower and rudimentary pumps and stone crushers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining and metallurgy began with the steam engine . Profound changes in technique resulted from new discoveries in the pure sciences ? particularly chemistry . Large-scale operations became the rule . In the past one hundred and fifty years the profession has seen changes as great as in all the period preceding them . The most important techniques now in use are described in this article by C. C. Furnas , a civil engineer who is now Chancellor of the University of Buffalo . It must be remembered , however , that mining is essentially a provincial enterprise and that techniques vary widely according to the nature of the mineral and the terrain in which it is found . The emphasis today is on automation devices , such as larger loading machines , higher speed rock drills , and greater use of belt conveyors . A belt system , now in full operation , carries iron ore from Cleveland to Pittsburgh and coal from Pittsburgh to Cleveland . The depletion of natural resources , particularly iron , caused by two great wars has alerted the great powers to the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sophisticated location techniques have been adopted . New processes by which low-grade ores such as taconite can be profitably worked have been invented . Substitution of man-made plastics is another solution which is being investigated . Although we can do no more than guess when the event will take place , we may at some time in the future find ourselves in dire want of essential minerals . It  | becomes important for the survival of any nation that it make discovery and conservation of national resources a matter of urgent public policy . DISCOVERING , RECOVERING , AND CONCENTRATING THE MINERALS C. C. FURNAS Discovery of Ores OLD CACTUS PETE , the prospector , with long beard , slouch hat , a great deal of hope , and a faithful burro loaded to the gunnels with grub and pick and shovel , is almost a trademark for western America . Civilization owes much to men of the Cactus Pete type . Had there not been many optimists in the past few thousand years , who were possessed with the overpowering urge to search for hidden wealth , there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knows where they are . Some of the old recipes for rabbit soup started out with the instruction : " First you catch your hare . " The first part of a recipe for a civilization built on minerals is : " First you find your minerals . " The old-time prospector merely looked carefully to find what he could on or near the surface . He panned the sands of stream beds to see if there was a bit of the color of gold . He looked over the earthy debris from a woodchuck hole to see if the ignorant creature had discarded some nuggets . He broke off pieces of unusual rocky outcrops in the hope that they might be something valuable . He knew no metallurgy and less chemistry and had but very hazy ideas about geology . Yet the oldtimers who spent their lives playing a game with chance and against very heavy odds built up a  | large body of useful empirical knowledge and discovered many of the great mineral deposits of the world . The searching for minerals was greatly improved when modern geology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , James Hutton , a man of great intelligence and curiosity and a distressing lack of respect for authorities . He felt that the existing hazy ideas of the structure of the earth 's crust were all wrong . He made careful observations of the numerous strata along the beaches of his seacoast farm . He ended up with a full realization of the importance of sedimentation in the forming of the character of the crust . He organized the history of sedimentary rocks on the basis of erosion , transportation , and deposition of materials . In 1785 he communicated his views to the then recently established Royal Society of Edinburgh in a paper entitled " Theory of Earth , or an Investigation of the Laws Observable in the Composition , Dissolution and Restoration of Land upon the Globe . " The science of geology had its beginnings at that time . It gradually became known that certain types of minerals would be found in association with certain types of rock structure . This greatly limited the field of search and made the efforts of prospectors much more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been largely a matter of surface scratching , the number of discoveries really has been amazing . The human animal , with prying insistence and undying optimism , has gone into every corner and noted everything that looked hopeful . A map of known deposits in the mineral-veined part of the country takes on the appearance of a face with smallpox . Many of the hundreds of mineral deposits are undoubtedly deposits by courtesy only . Some of them will never amount to much in a commercial way . But these are mere skin indications . What then is underneath ? What is there back under the ridges where no one has sampled ? What would one find in a region such as this if he could investigate the entire area to a depth of 10,000 feet ? The oldtime prospector will never know , but new things are now on the program ; new methods of prospecting are making it  | possible to investigate to great depths . We can hardly look forward to acres of diamonds under everyone 's feet ; but we may very well expect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within recent years the delicacy of physical instruments has been greatly increased , so now we find that the old hitand-miss prospector has been partially replaced by the experts in geophysical prospecting . Five principal methods are now employed in this line of activity . 1 Magnetic methods . A body of iron ore , even deep in the ground , which contains appreciable quantities of magnetic iron oxide ( Fe ; , O , ) will cause a dipping magnetic needle to be pulled out of its normal position . This is caused by a vertical distribution of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the ore body . A sensitive magnetic needle which is confined to a single horizontal plane will show abnormal deviations in the apparent magnetic north if brought close to a hidden magnetic body . The magnet is a great aid in locating magnetic types of iron ore . 2 Electrical methods . If ground waters are in contact with sulfide ore bodies , voltaic cells are set up at various points in the ground . Careful measurement of gradients of electrical potential along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as galena ( lead sulfide ) are better conductors of electricity than the average rock of the crust . Galena bodies are sometimes located by measurement of the electrical resistance of cross sections of the crust . 3 Gravitational method . The acceleration due to gravity ( the physicist 's friend , g ) is appreciably increased in the vicinity of very dense ore bodies . A measurement of the time of swing of a pendulum affords a method of determining this constant , but that is usually too insensitive . The torsion balance , which balances the pull of the earth for two dense bodies through the torsional effect of a fine quartz thread , is usually employed . The measurements portray the presence of any large bodies under the surface which are of greater or less density than the average of surrounding rocks . This has been used extensively in locating the salt domes with which petroleum is associated .  | 4 Seismic method . The density and rigidity of a rock structure can be estimated from data of the speed of travel of shock waves through the solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hundred pounds of nitroglycerin under ground . ( It not infrequently discharges prematurely . ) The rate of travel of the shock is determined by timing the response of seismographs placed a considerable distance away . The waves travel at different speeds through different kinds of rock , and any unusual variation in character can thus be detected . Many of the salt domes which indicate possible petroleum deposits have been located in this manner . 51 Radioactive methods . Sensitive electroscopes , electrometers , or Geiger counters will detect even weakly radioactive minerals over a considerable distance . Radium or even uranium deposits can be located in this way , but the method is necessarily confined to the radioactive minerals . The instruments of the physics laboratory have been a great aid in opening the storehouse of mineral wealth , but the field of geophysical prospecting is most decidedly one for carefully trained experts . The measurements have to be made very carefully and interpretation is by no means simple . But the methods are scientifically sound and have nothing in common with the superstition of the effectiveness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proper geophysical prospecting really produces results . Predictions often are not accurate ; but the combination of geophysical methods and systematic searching has succeeded in taking a great deal of the chance ? and a great deal of the supposed romance ? out of prospecting . Recovery Operations After the prospector comes the miner , for no mineral is of any use as long as it stays in the ground . The method used for recovering the mineral from its earthen environment depends upon many conditions . The traditional mine is a dark hole in the ground . A shaft , a sort of glorified well , is dug straight down to the level of  | the ore body . Then horizontal tunnels or drifts are cut out through the mineral body . The miner cuts and blasts his way through the vein of desirable material . The ore is loaded into small cars which are pushed by hand or drawn by small electric locomotives to the shaft and then it is hoisted to the surface . Unless the rock structure over the ore is unusually strong , it is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been removed . This calls for extensive bracing with heavy timbers . Often pillars of the mineral itself may be left in place to help support the roof . This obviously is a wasteful procedure , for a significant percentage of the material may be left under the ground in this way . When the veins of mineral do not lie in horizontal strata or are badly broken , the ideal plan of a vertical shaft connected to numerous horizontal tunnels has to be modified to fit the case . Sloping shafts and numerous connecting tunnels at various levels have to be utilized . There are attending facilities which must be installed in every mine . There must be considerable power available for transporting and hoisting the material . There must be adequate ventilation , particularly in coal mines where there is a gas hazard . The inevitable water must be pumped out . The problem of getting the water out of the English coal mines led to the demand for a satisfactory steam engine over a century and a half ago . As long as horses were the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a few hundred feet . When steam power came in , the water could be pumped out from almost any depth , and mining took on new life . The use of electric power has sent the mines still deeper . The deepest shaft in the world at the present time is down some 8380 feet in the Robinson Deep Mine near Johannesburg , South Africa . In this ease mere ventilating fans are not sufficient , for the temperature in these deep workings is about 120 ? F. ? with a humidity of 90 to 100 percent . Men can not work under such conditions . Huge refrigerating plants have been installed to cool and dehumidify the air to make conditions tolerable for the workmen .  | Every increase in depth brings more trouble and obviously more expense . Hence , only the richer ores can be mined at great depths , for the cost of the recovery must be less than the value of the mineral , but there is no definite limit to the depth to which mines might go . Modern methods and equipment can drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of a thousand feet calls for a greatly increased expenditure for operation . An ore has to be very valuable if it is to be feasible to recover it from depths greater than 5000 feet . The Hull Rust Mine at Hibbing , Minnesota , looks like part of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado moved north . No burrowing like moles here . Nature obligingly put down only about fifty feet of soil and debris on top of the great beds of iron ore . The overburden was stripped off with steam shovels , and other power shovels began digging out the great hole by loading the ore directly into cars . The general appearance of the mine is that of an inverted pyramid with the base at the top . The sides are terraced in wide shelves which descend hundreds of feet in ever closing circles to the bottom of the deposit . Another great operation is in the open-pit copper mines at Bingham , Utah . Many of the coal seams in Indiana and Illinois are covered with only a few feet of debris , and open-pit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power shovels in the world ( one of them takes up thirty-two cubic yards of dirt in one scoop ) are used for stripping off the overburden . Some of the lignite deposits of Germany are worked by open-pit methods . Presumably almost any mine could be operated by openpit methods , but if the overburden is large the problem of its complete removal becomes enormous . Finally a point is reached where it is more economical to sink a shaft and let the overburden stay in place . It is seldom feasible to use open-pit methods with overlying debris more than fifty feet thick . When the mineral to be recovered is a liquid , the mining process consists of drilling a hole in the ground ? in the right place ? and putting a pump in operation . The largest scale recovery operation of this type is in the petroleum industry .  | Sometimes nature has stored up gas in the tight pockets of rock overlying an oil deposit , and the pump can be dispensed with during the first part of the well 's history . The accumulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build up a gas pressure greater than a thousand pounds per square inch . The earth then has a local condition resembling that of a severely abscessed tooth ; and , when the drill tool breaks through the overlying solid structure , the earth 's gas accumulation tries to correct the situation by forcing the oil up through the newly made relief passage with a rush and a roar . This is the beginning of the " gusher , " the only kind of oil well that often gets into the public press . Most of the wells are more sedate and less exciting ; the oil often has to be pumped to the surface . As the sands or porous rocks in the immediate vicinity of the well casing are depleted , more oil seeps in from the surrounding structure to be picked up by the sucking action of the pump . Gas wells are not pumped . If the pressure is so low that the gas can not flow out through the open hole , then there is n't enough gas to be worth recovering . In a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves the well in order to send it through pipe lines with a reasonable speed . The world 's record depth for a petroleum well at the time of this writing ( 1938 ) is 15,004 feet , almost twice as deep as the deepest mine . Wells of such depth could not be possible without power equipment and rotary drills ; but , even with the finest equipment , drilling 15,000 feet straight down through solid rock is a difficult and expensive task , but deep wells are not entirely new . The Chinese drilled wells over 3000 feet deep to obtain salt water for salt making in the Middle Ages . Such a well , drilled without mechanical motive power and with only the crudest tools , was a far greater accomplishment than the 15,000-foot well of today . Ingenuity is no monopoly of the modern world . There are other valuable liquid minerals besides petroleum . Brine has been pumped from the ground for salt making for thousands of years . Over two thirds of the salt recovered in this country is obtained by evaporating brines from wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | brines have become the base of a large chemical industry . The brine wells of Midland , Michigan , are now the source not only of salt ( sodium chloride ) but of bromine , Epsom salts , and metallic magnesium . There are several brine wells in California that are used to produce iodine . Sulfur is another mineral that often comes from wells . The most important sulfur deposits in the world occur along the Gulf coast of Texas . The first sulfur recovered by wells came from Louisiana but that deposit has been almost exhausted . This sulfur in Louisiana and Texas was deposited apparently in the free state by the oxidizing action of certain bacteria on hydrogen sulfide gas , H2S . The Frasch process for sulfur recovery uses a well with a double casing . A mixture of steam and water at 250 pounds pressure ( 175 ? C. ) is pumped down the outer annular space . This melts the sulfur in the vicinity of the well , which then flows into the casing and is brought up the central casing by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was proposed , has completely revolutionized sulfur recovery . It not only is an inexpensive , rapid method , but by the process of selective melting purifies the sulfur before it leaves the bed . There is still another kind of mineral deposit , which does not require even so much as a well ; it is simply a case of come and get it . Many of the brine lakes which are scattered over the surface of the earth contain compounds that are worth recovering . The Dead Sea lived on its history for several thousand years , but now it is doing its turn as a source of crude salt for the recovery of potassium salts for fertilizer . The brine pumped from Searles Lake in California supplies most of the borax used in this country and a significant part of the potash . Then there is the most nearly limitless mineral source of all ? the ocean . Sea water has been used occasionally as a source of salt for seasoning for thousands of years , but only recently has it been used as a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bromine is now being extracted from sea water at a chemical plant on Cape Fear just south of Wilmington , North Carolina . The plant started operations January 10 , 1934 . That was a landmark  | in chemical industry . The possibilities of recovery of elements from sea water have by no means been exhausted . More will be heard of this in the future . In the same sense that the sea is a mine , so is the atmosphere . The air is now serving as an absolutely boundless mine of free nitrogen , which is the chemical raw material for making ammonia and hence nitric acid . It is available merely for the taking . No legislature has found a way to impose a tax on it yet . Bcneficiation of Ores There are many steps on the mineral stair before final utilization is reached . First , there were the various steps in the segregation of compounds to make ores ? processes which had no connection with human existence . Then the prospector had to find the mineral deposits . Then the miner , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mineral from the ground , the well , or the ocean . Still the succession was not complete . In most cases some operations had to be performed to bring the desirable material to a higher concentration than it had in the natural ore , before it could successfully be processed . There are very few of the solid minerals which do not go through some form of beneficiation to improve their quality before they reach the smelter or the market . A catchall term , " ore dressing , " is often used to desigrate whatever is done to an ore to improve its quality , though some sticklers for usage may contend that the term refers only to the mechanical operations which may be employed . The most obvious way to get ore of good quality is to pick up only the better pieces . This technique probably was followed in the gold mines of the Pharaohs and of King Solomon . VVhere the desired material is easily recognized and not too finely divided , and where labor is inexpensive , this is one of the more effective ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . Miners often do a certain amount of selection of the material sent to the surface , and  | hand picking from belt conveyors is still used almost universally to segregate slate from coal . Every mining industry has a variety of methods and apparatus for making little rocks out of big ones . Glass-hard metal jaws seize large rocks and crush them to bits . Gyratory crushers take rocks as large as a man 's head , that have withstood the elements of weathering for thousands of years , and squeeze them into little nodules in an instant . There are hammer mills , ball mills , rod mills , stamp mills , driven by large motors , that pound and smash away at their tasks in deafening and dusty surroundings . The object of all of these activities is to break the rocky material down so that each desired piece of ore stands by itself , is not attached to impurities or gangue . Sometimes , as in the case of certain iron ores , it is necessary only to crush to five-inch pieces , for iron comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills ground to an almost impalpable powder , for gold usually occurs as minute flakes in the rock . After grinding comes the separation of the desirable from the undesirable . In some cases there is a distinct difference in the friability of an ore and its attending impurities . If the ore is soft and friable and the gangue ( impurities ) is hard and tough , a crushing operation will break up the ore into smaller pieces than the gangue . In such a case , rocks after crushing may be separated by the use of screens . The small-sized material will be rich in the desired ore , the large-sized material will contain but little . If a mixture of mineral particles of various sizes and densities is allowed to fall through water from a given height , all pieces starting at one instant , the individual particles will form layers according to their densities and size . If all particles are the same size , the densest particles will form a layer on the bottom , with the least dense on top , the intermediate material graded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large-sized particles of low density may be mixed with some small particles of high density ; but all of the particles in any one layer have " equal fall " periods . By carefully controlling size , it is possible to make very good separations on the basis of density alone . The pieces of equipment used for  | gravity separation are as varied and as strange as their names : jigs , tables , vanners , sluice boxes , and classifiers . It is impossible to give one-sentence explanations of the operations of each of these . The " gravitational " methods of ore concentration depend on the differences in rate of settling of particles of different densities in water ; but , if given time enough , all particles settle . If particles of ore and particles of undesirables have distinct differences in density , it seems quite obvious that the simplest and most efficient way to separate them is to put them into a liquid with a density intermediate between the two solids . The heavy one will sink , the light one will float ; the separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the liquid . The liquid must fulfill several requirements . It must be relatively inexpensive , it must not be volatile , it must not be absorbed to any large degree by the solids , and above all it must have the correct density . Nature made things surprisingly difficult for man on this score . Among the solids there are rocks and metals with specific gravities well spread from 0.534 ( lithium ) to as high as 22.48 ( osmium ) . Among the liquids there are water with a specific gravity of 1.00 and mercury at 13.6 . But of the materials that are liquid at ordinary temperatures , there are very few that have intermediate specific gravities . There is n't much in between to be used for float and sink operations for the separation of minerals . Liquid bromine has a specific gravity of 3.12 but it is a volatile , highly obnoxious , and expensive element . It is unusable on all counts . The organic chemists , having small regard for nature 's limitations , have synthesized several liquids somewhat heavier than water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific gravity 1.50 , carbon tetrachloride ( CCL , ) specific gravity 1.58 , pentachiorethane ( C , HCI. , ) specific gravity 1.83 , and tetrabromethane ( CH , Br , ) specific gravity 2.97 . The latter two have proved to be highly successful as media for the separation of coal ( it floats ) from slate ( it sinks ) . Prices of the organic liquids have been lowered and methods of minimizing losses have been improved so that the float and sink method stands an excellent chance of re-  | placing the eyes and hands of sorting workmen in the old coal breaker . Pilot-plant operations at Shenandoah , Pennsylvania , have shown that the method is inexpensive , requires only a small amount of equipment , is infinitely cleaner than the old hand picking , and gets very much better results . " Float and sink " has a great future in the coal business , for improved efficiency of separation is badly needed . If someone will devise suitable liquids of intermediate specific gravity for use in the metal ore fields , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of separating iron filings from dirt is to pass a small magnet over a thin layer of the mixture . The iron filings jump to the magnet as if it were a long-lost friend . Magnetic iron oxide ( Fe , O4 ) can easily be separated from undesirable material in the same way . The separating is usually done by means of a conveyor belt with electromagnets placed underneath to hold the iron oxide in place longer than the nonmagnetic material . Any iron ore can be rendered magnetic by roasting ( heating in the presence of air ) at a few hundred degrees C. Hence the magnetic separation can be employed for any iron ore . Iron is sometimes an impurity rather than the desired material . Zinc ores are frequently benefited by the removal of pieces of iron ore . One of the few types of experiments with which the ancient Greeks would dirty their hands was electrostatics . A piece of amber rubbed with cat 's fur attracts a pith ball . The pith ball will cling to the electrically charged amber almost indefinitely in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , will cling to the charged amber only momentarily , for the electrons which make up its charge are quickly dissipated to the charging body . This difference in the length of time of retention of charges is the basis of the electrostatic method of separating minerals from impurities . The variable property in this case is that of electrical conductivity . Finely divided ore is put onto the top of a metallic roller which is one of the electrodes of the electrical system . A high potential electrode rests above the roller and sprays the mineral layer with electrons ? a high potential  | brush discharge . The minerals , which are relatively good conductors ( lead sulfide , for instance ) , lose their charge to the roller immediately and fall off into a hopper . The poorly conducting particles ( the impurities ) cling to the roller and are scraped off on the opposite side into another hopper . We have discussed separations of valuable from undesirable materials on the basis of differences in friability , specific gravity , magnetic susceptibility , electric conductivity ; and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wettability " is one of those catchall phrases used to designate something that is not completely understood . When a liquid spreads over a solid in a thin and tenacious layer , the solid is easily wettable . The system , hands ? dirt ? soap ? water , offers an illustration . When the system , hands ? dirt , is brought into contact with the system , soap ? water , with a certain amount of agitation , the dirt becomes thoroughly wetted with thin layers of soap in water . There is a change in the interfacial tensions , the dirt clings tenaciously to the soap ? water phase and leaves the hands . The same principles of this cleaning process are applied on a large scale to the concentration of minerals . There is an unverified story to the effect that a gold miner 's wife told her husband that she would show the men a thing or two about the process of mineral concentration . If soap could pull dirt out of clothes , it ought to pull gold away from pieces of rock . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soapy froth carried a relatively large amount of gold in it . By scraping off the froth she concentrated the gold . The story 's authenticity is a little doubtful because soapsuds are not very effective in separating gold from gangue . Nevertheless , someone worked a major revolution in metallurgy a generation ago when he started the investigation of the possibilities of " flotation " through the floating of desirable ore particles on the froth of a water suspension of the finely divided raw ore . In this process the entire ore is ground to very fine dust , in ball mills or in stamp mills , and is mixed with water to form a slime or sludge . A small amount of oily material , such as oil of eucalyptus , coal-tar creosote , or ethyl xanthate , is  | introduced into the water . If the correct agent has been added to the water , the oily material dashes to the surface of the desirable mineral particles and forms a very thin , perhaps mono-molecular , layer on them . The vat of sludge is then agitated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top and the oily part of the suds carries the ore particles upward with it . The gangue materials are not wetted by the added organic agent , so they stay behind in the bottom of the vat . Strangely , it is usually the heavier solid particles that are " floated . " They " float " because the air-filled froth which contains the finely divided mineral in the oily films is lighter than water . The froth is skimmed off with paddles , like skimming the foam off a glass of beer , and the mineral is obtained in practically a pure condition . The treatment of each mineral and each ore presents a research project of its own . Every system has distinct behavior problems that can be solved only by extensive investigation . Flotation was first used commercially in this country in 1912 when the Butte and Superior Mining Company at Butte , Montana , installed a plant to handle the slime of a lead-zinc ore . The process is most successful on sulfide ores , such as those of copper , lead , and zinc ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery . Research work has been carried on for the separation of almost every mineral from its impurities . It appears that a selective wetting agent can be found for practically any solid substance and that it can be floated in a froth . Finely divided coal has been successfully separated from slate in this way and iron ore can be floated away from siliceous impurities . These last two have not been applied commercially as yet , for some of the other mechanical methods are less expensive . AluIIminuII1 The foregoing is a bare outline of some of the most successful mechanical and electrical tricks used to concentrate , or purify , minerals ; but chemistry makes large contributions , too .  | The production of pure aluminum calls for the use of pure aluminum oxide . The mineral now universally used for aluminum production is bauxite ( Al2O2 ? 2H2O ) . But bauxite always contains impurities , such as iron and silicon compounds . These must be separated from the alumina ( AlO : , ) with which they are intimately associated , and only chemical methods have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxide is converted to a soluble aluminate by heating with a strong solution of sodium hydroxide . The aluminate is soluble and thus separates from the impurities which are insoluble in an alkaline solution . The aluminum is then precipitated as aluminum hydroxide , Al(OH) ; , , by cooling the solution . Impurities in the solution are not precipitated . The aluminum hydroxide is decomposed to alumina ( A1 , O , ) by heating . Gold Gold concentration and recovery have had frequent contact with chemistry . Metallic gold has a strong affinity for mercury , forming a silvery amalgam as anyone can determine by rubbing a drop of mercury on a gold ring . Gold is secured from many " free-milling " ores ( those which break up easily ) by an amalgamation process . The finely ground ore is brought into contact with liquid mercury . The fine ore particles are dissolved in ( amalgamated with ) the mercury . The liquid amalgam when saturated with gold is drawn off and placed in a retort . The mercury is distilled off and condensed for reuse . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was invented in 1891 and has now almost superseded the other methods of recovery of finely divided particles of gold . Finely ground gold ore is thoroughly washed with a dilute solution of potassium cyanide . Gold cyanide is formed , which is soluble in water . The rest of the solid matter of the ore is insoluble . The solution containing the dissolved gold is filtered off and the gold is precipitated by means of zinc shavings or by electrolysis.  | Bromine Bromine ( used in making photographic emulsions , headache powders , antiknock gasolines ) can be extracted from sea water where it is present in minute proportions . The water is acidified to a certain , carefully controlled point ( pH of 3.5 to 4 ) and gaseous chlorine is pumped into the water to replace the bromine . The bromine is then stripped out of the water solution by means of an air stream . What is an Ore ? This discussion of the processes of ore formation and methods of recovery has been merely leading up to a discussion of the question : What is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's definition of an ore is a mineral that can be recovered and worked at a profit . The items which must enter into consideration are the value of the final product ( in dollars ) ; the concentration of the desired constituent in the deposit ( solid or liquid ) ; the accessibility of the deposit ; the number , character , and chemical and physical conditions of the undesirable impurities . A deposit of pure copper 25,000 feet under the surface would not be a usable ore at the present time , for we can not yet operate mines at a depth of 25,000 feet . Pure iron oxide on top of an inaccessible mountain in the middle of a wilderness would not be a usable ore , for operators could not get to it nor could it be taken out . The concentration of the material is one of the chief considerations . As rich deposits have been depleted , new techniques have been devised to handle poorer material . In the old days of the West , gold was mined from quartz veins by grinding the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( gravity separation ) . The dumps of spent ore grew and grew and sullied the landscape ; but these clumps still contained considerable gold . Then came the amalgamation process of gold recovery which would remove about 60 percent of the metal . This new technique changed  | the old ore dumps into gold mines . The once useless material was reground and the gold recovered by means of mercury . The tailings of these mills were dumped to choke the valleys again . After a time the cyanide process came in and the dumps from the amalgamation mills were again valuable ores for the new process , which could remove about 98 percent of the gold . Again , the old ore dumps were reused and gold was recovered at a profit . The rich copper ores of the West were seriously depleted by 1911 when the flotation process came into use . When the new process of concentration was shown to be successful for copper ore concentration , old mines were reopened , former low-grade deposits became valuable . A pile of dirt today may be transformed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker in a distant laboratory . Mineral resources are only half determined by the deposits which nature has handed to us . The other half is the ingenuity of the chemist and the engineer . A large part of the story of the individual sciences can be told in terms of the tools , instruments , and machines they employ . The history of astronomy is concerned not only with the theories of Copernicus and Newton but with the observations and proofs provided by the telescope , the radio telescope , and the spectroheliograph . The science of bacteriology was founded in the seventeenth century when a Dutchman named Leeuwenhock observed " very small living creatures " through lenses he had ground . The modern physicist uses giant cyclotrons to shatter atoms for research . The geologist measures the distance , direction , and force of earthquakes with the seismograph . There is hardly a discipline in which the camera , like the written word , does not preserve knowledge . ' The engineer , as we have seen , first relied on relatively simple tools , like the lever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew in complexity , such tools , utilizing new scientific principles , developed into machines like the steam engine , the  | turbine , and the dynamo . Today , machines exist which perform many of the functions of the human brain with so much greater speed and accuracy that they pose problems of great sociological and economic importance . The dilemma is not new . Throughout history , refinements in tools and techniques have proved long-term blessings but have often meant misery for large sections of the population . The word " saboteur " has its origins in one revolt of man against the machine . In his book , Automation , Samuel Lilley mentions Karel Capek 's play R.U.R. as a dramatization of the hatred and fear of human beings for the " robots " which threaten to take their place . How much justification is there for this deep-rooted suspicion of the machine ? Can automation ever dispense with human supervision ? What type of workman is apt to be displaced ? Will the resultant benefits justify the technological unemployment involved and what can be done to cushion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a society in which far less effort will be spent on production and far more on creativity and enjoyment . TOOLS AND AUTOMATION SAMUEL LILLEY THE FIRST QUESTION that needs answering is : What are we talking about ? What do we mean by this rather ugly new word , Automation ? To get started , let us be content to define automation provisionally as : The introduction or use of highly automatic machinery or processes which largely eliminate human labor and detailed human control .  | It is the italicised phrase that is important and distinguishes automation from mere mechanization . In mechanization the machine takes over the work , but the human operator is still required to exercise detailed control over its operations ? to observe at every stage just what the machine has done and then to operate controls which give it instructions as to what it must do next . Automation abolishes that sort of control . In the ideal case ( though naturally practice often falls short of this ) the machine completely controls its own actions ; it carries through a manufacturing process from beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the human worker is required only to see that the machine is kept in good running order . If we are to appreciate the impact of automation today , we shall first need some understanding of engineering production methods in the preautomation era and of how they grew up . It was about 1800 that Henry Maudslay transformed the old woodcutting lathe and the refined watchmaker 's lathe of the eighteenth century into the robust and accurate metal-cutting lathe which is the fundamental tool of engineering . And it was about the same time that the first steps were taken toward a new way of organizing the production processes as a whole , which has been the main road of development ever since . The new method was not mass production as such , but production on the principle of interchangeability , which facilitated the extension of mass production to quite new fields . The new method of interchangeable manufacture was based on the principle that all the parts , as produced , must conform to standard measurements ( within permitted variations , called " tolerances " ) so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , knowing in advance that they will fit one another , and can build them up into the completed article without further manipulation . The highly skilled fitter is replaced by the unskilled or sometimes semiskilled assembler . Maudslay was associated with one early enterprise on these lines ? that of Marc I. Brunel and Samuel Bentham ( brother  | of the more famous Jeremy ) for making pulley blocks in 1808 . Every block consists of several parts . A single frigate needed 1,500 of them , and the Admiralty at that time used 100,000 yearly . Brunel and Bentham conceived the idea of producing blocks by interchangeable manufacture , and worked out the general scheme of the machine to be used , which was put into execution by Maudslay . The project was designed to use unskilled labor ? indeed , convict labor , for it was connected with Jeremy Bentham 's prison reform schemes . And in fact ten unskilled men did work that would previously have needed 110 skilled . They produced 130,000 blocks a year , equivalent to the previous output of the six largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitney started making muskets by interchangeable methods in 1800 , and Simeon North did the same for pistols a little later . At first they used water-powered machinery for rough processes , but the accurate finishing was done by specialized workmanship and by filing and drilling in standard jigs , not by special machinery . They soon , however , began to feel the need for machinery specially designed for the purpose of turning out components at high speed and with unvarying accuracy . In 1818 Whitney produced the first milling machine , and Blanchard the " gunstocking lathe " for turning irregular shapes by accurately following a pattern . The turret or capstan lathe , in which several tools set in a revolving turret can be brought successively to bear on the work as the operator manipulates the controls , appeared about the middle of the century . Through the addition of various automatic connections between the working parts , it gradually developed from the ' sixties onwards into the automatic lathe . The universal milling machine appeared in 1861 . And so the development goes on , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turret lathe and many others . Similar developments were taking place in such operations as dropforging and die-stamping . And before the end of the nineteenth century most of the basic range of machine tools had appeared .  | It was the small arms industry that established interchangeable manufacture . And for the first fifty years or more , most of the new developments in machine tools were made in connection with that industry . But gradually other industries took up the method ? again almost exclusively in the U.S.A. It was applied to the making of wooden clocks by 1809 , and a little later to brass clocks ; by 1855 these were being produced at the rate of 400,000 a year at 50 cents apiece . In the ' fifties interchangeable manufacture was fundamental to the widespread success of the sewing machine . And for a different reason it was equally fundamental to the widespread use of agricultural machinery in the ' sixties . This time the point was to solve the problem of maintenance in rural areas where skilled labor was not available . The farmer ordered replacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily into place . Interchangeable manufacture was also applied to the mass production of typewriters in the ' eighties , and of bicycles ? several hundred thousand a year ? in the ' nineties . And so by the end of the century , just as the motorcar was coming along to give it renewed impetus , the method had become the established way of producing engineered goods in large quantities . It was the car industry that established that other major characteristic of modern practice , the assembly line . But even that has a prehistory that goes back well into the last century . In 1833 the British Admiralty set up a remarkable bakery for ship 's biscuits . It used machinery for kneading and other operations , but the chief novelty was that the work passed from one workman to another on trays running on power-driven roller conveyors . Again , we find Johann Georg Bodmer , a Swiss working in England , building a factory about 1840 for making textile machinery , with special attention to the arrangement of the machines so as to minimize transport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But once more the scene shifts to the U.S.A. , and the first real appearance of the assembly line was at Cincinnati in the ' sixties ? even though it was applied not to the assembling of engineering products but to the disassembling of pigs , to cut-  | ting them up for canning . The carcasses were carried on overhead conveyors past a series of workers , each of whom had the job of making a single cut or removing a single piece . These methods were developed further in Chicago , where they reached such a pitch of efficiency and economy that ? so it is said ? they even used the pig 's dying squeal to work the factory hooter . Something approaching the assembly line was used in building railway freight cars in the ' nineties ? with the chassis towed along rails between workmen who each did only a few specialized operations . But the full advent of the modern assembly line was a consequence of the mass-production car industry . The early cars were built as individuals . But about 1902 some firms started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars in 1902 and 5,000 in 1904 . Ford 's production passed 10,000 in 1909 . The industry used all the machine tools that earlier mass production had created and added many more ? precision gearcutters , precision grinders of many types , a great variety of presses , stamps , die-casters , drilling and tapping machines , and much else . And then in 1913 ? 1914 Ford introduced the assembly line . He first tried a conveyor-belt system for assembling flywheel magnetos , and succeeded in reducing the assembly time from twenty minutes to five . This led to applications in the assembly of other small parts , and shortly after to experiments concerning the assembly of the whole car . In the first of these the chassis was towed along a 250-foot length of street beside the factory past stockpiles of parts placed at regular intervals , and this reduced chassis assembly time from fourteen hours to six . The principle of the method was now established , and it was not long before it had taken on the more familiar conveyor form . Ford himself summarised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembling practice is to place the most suitable component on elevated ways or rails and to carry it past successive groups of workmen , who fix the various components to the principal component , until the assembling is completed . " There have been many changes and improvements since then . Many new machines have been introduced , the most  | important perhaps being the centerless grinder . Systems of marshaling the components for the assembly line have been steadily improved . And the machining also has become more and more organized on a flow , rather than a batch , basis ? the work passing progressively through whole lines of machines . But in essentials , the practice that emerged in the Ford works about 1914 is the engineering production practice of today ? except in so far as it has very recently been modified by automation . The essentials of this practice are : ( a ) Machining on machines so designed that , once they have been correctly set , they will turn out work repetitively to the required measurements in the hands of semiskilled or even unskilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a main component flows continuously past many workers , who attach the other components to it . Experience has shown that this system of production is a very efficient one . But the system is not free from disadvantages . The degree of division of labor continually increases . From this there results a progressive degradation in the amount of skill required from the factory hand . The ideal worker becomes a brainless automaton capable of repeating a few simple movements with very great speed and dexterity , but not required to exercise any judgment . The problem ? as so often in history ? leads on to its own solution . Once a production operation has been reduced to a form in which the human worker has merely to act like a machine , then it is not technically difficult to take the further step of substituting a steel and oil machine for a flesh and blood one , the step of making the process entirely automatic . That is what is beginning to happen . Actually the motive that has led to the strong trend towards automation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . The real driving force has been management 's wish to reduce labor costs .  | Automation did not become important till after the Second World War . But it has a prehistory stretching back to the 1920 's . Indeed , we could stretch its prehistory a good deal further if we agreed to include such items as the automatic flour mill set up by Oliver Evans near Philadelphia in 1784-1785 . But , though it certainly worked , this can perhaps be dismissed for our purpose as an historical curiosity . A more serious start was made in 1923-1924 , when Morris Motors installed transfer machines for machining cylinder blocks and other large components . The cylinder block machine , 181 feet long , did 53 operations at the rate of 15 blocks an hour , and needed only 21 operators . Because these machines had to rely entirely on mechanical controls , they proved too unreliable and had to be abandoned . In 1928 , A. 0 . Smith and Co. of Milwaukee set up a very remarkable plant for making car frames entirely automatically . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspection station , where it was checked and straightened . Thereafter , as the work passed automatically from station to station , the strips were cut , bent , punched and pressed in the various forms needed for different parts of the chassis . Still automatically the parts were brought together and riveted , and finally the completed frames were brushed and cleaned ready for painting . Run by a staff of 120 , mostly supervisory and maintenance , it produced about 10,000 frames a day , so that each frame was the product of only sixteen man-minutes of work . In the U.S.S.R. parallel developments were taking place . In 1939 , Foreman Inochkin of the Stalingrad Tractor works linked five lathes together by automatic conveyors to perform a sequence of ten operations on caterpillar roller bushings . And about the same time a remarkable automatic iron-casting machine came into use at Klimovsk . Using permanent metal molds on a rotary caster , this plant had an output of 10,000 pieces in a two-shift day . Though these machines are obviously direct predecessors of the automated lines of today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for widespread automation was probably in the development of electronics .  | While it is probably true that even today the greater part of automated machinery in use manages to do without electronics ? using mechanical or electromechanical devices instead ? it is equally clear that the future of automation lies very largely with electronic control . The reason for this is that only in very simple cases can a mechanism be set in advance to complete a given job without need for adjustment in the course of the work . It is easy to verify this point by setting oneself a simple task such as that of picking up a pen from a table at the other side of the room . I try to preset myself to achieve this object ? that is to say , I look to see where the pen is , and then , shutting my eyes , I try to walk across the room and pick it up . Almost always I am very wide of the mark . Contrast that with my normal procedure . After preliminary observation of the pen 's position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open ; when I get near enough I move my hand in the correct direction ; and finally , as my hand comes into position , I bend my fingers to grasp the pen . But all the time I am making use of my eyes and brain . In the early stages my eyes send a succession of messages to my brain , saying : " The table is now so many feet and inches from you in such-and-such a direction . " My brain considers these messages and transmits instructions to my legs concerning such points as the length of the next stride they are to take . Soon comes a message from the eyes reporting that I am within arm 's length of .. the pen . Here my brain tells my legs to stop moving and starts sending instructions to my arm muscles to move in such-and-such directions . As this movement goes on , my eyes make further reports concerning how close my hand is getting to the pen , and from moment to moment my brain sends further orders to the muscles to modify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message from the eyes to say that my hand is in position to grasp the pen , and so my brain starts telling my fingers to bend ? and so on till the operation has been completed . This is the process known as feedback . Information from my eyes about how well my limbs are getting on with the job is fed back through the " telephone exchange " in my brain  | and used to modify the action of my muscles from moment to moment . Similar conditions apply to the work of many machines . In all but the simplest cases the operator must watch the progress of the work and take action from time to time to modify the machine 's behavior . And if the process is to be made automatic , then it is necessary to find a mechanical or electrical feedback mechanism to take the place of the operator . The principle of feedback control of machinery is far from new . A steam engine is required to run at constant speed . That can not be ensured by a fixed throttle setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stoker will affect the speed . A man could be set to watch the engine , with his hand on the throttle control ready to open it a little if the engine slows down or close it when the revolutions increase . But the centrifugal governor which James Watt invented in 1788 does the job much more efficiently . A somewhat similar device is used in a ship 's steering gear . These examples show that feedback can be achieved by purely mechanical means . But only rather simple feedback jobs can be dealt with mechanically . For most types of automation that are common at present , electromagnetic methods are good enough . But for really advanced automation electronic control will often be required . The main thing that gives electronics the advantage is that the speed at which information is fed back is often of crucial importance . If there is too much delay , the machine will " hunt " ? that is , it will oscillate backwards and forwards on either side of the required behavior , but will never be dead on . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment of picking up the pen . I arrange to put a considerable delay into the feedback mechanism by keeping my eyes shut and getting my information from a friend who tells me just how my hand is placed in relation to the pen . It will be found that my hand moves hither and thither about the pen for quite a while before I succeed in grasping it . Another convenient way of introducing a delay in the feedback is by the immoderate consumption of alcohol ? and anybody watching a  | drunken man trying to pick up that pen will see plenty of examples of hunting . Now electromagnetic relays work in tenths , or at the best hundredths of a second , while electronic valves can cope with millionths . That is why electronic control methods are essential in cases where really fast feedback is needed . Then again , any feedback mechanism necessarily includes a part which corresponds to the human sense organ , a part which observes what has happened up to date . Usually the observation takes the form of a measurement ? the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a vessel in which a chemical reaction is taking place . Some observing and measuring jobs can be done mechanically ? Watt 's governor measures speed ; mechanical " fingers " can " feel " the size of a piece being worked in a lathe or a grinder . But again , electronic devices have great advantages ? the photo-electric cell , which produces a small electric current when light falls on it , can perform the functions of an eye ; other electrical and electronic devices can estimate chemical composition , or do jobs analogous to that of the railway wheel-tapper who tests the soundness of carriage wheels by the noise they produce when hit with a hammer . Most of the main electronic devices were invented before the First World War , but it was only in the ' thirties and after that their potentialities as production control devices were seriously explored . Then photo-cells came to be used for such jobs as grading and sorting rice , beans , and cigars by color ( they would have taken over from that chap who disliked the responsibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off an automatic labeling machine ; and removing metal bars from a furnace at a specified temperature ( measured by the light they emit ) . All these are simple cases of feedback ? the action of the machine is varied according to what the photo-cell " observes . " There were also some applications of photo-cells to inspect articles coming off machine tools ? for example , in an American unit for inspecting camshafts , which enabled four men to do the work of a former 18 ? though , so far as 1 know , it was not until the late  | 1940 's that any inspection device was linked with a feedback circuit for adjusting the setting of the machine . Another way of using photo-cells was exemplified in the Russian development in 1940 of a lathe controlled by a photo-cell which reads a blueprint and directs the actions of the tools ( on one or many machines ) accordingly . A similar application , made in the U.S.A. during the war , was to the control of an oxyacetylene cutting machine by a photo-cell reading a scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " program-controlled " machines . Wartime problems like that of keeping an anti-aircraft gun trained on its moving target led to rapid developments in electronic feedback mechanisms , while radar work produced extremely rapid progress in electronics generally . The war , too , was the time when work began on the development of electronic computers ( " electronic brains " ) whose role in automation is becoming more and more important . As a result of all this , we in the postwar era have at our disposal a range of electronic equipment that is apparently capable of dealing with most of the control and feedback problems that automation will pose . But despite the impression created by many popular articles in the Press ? most automated machinery in use at present does not employ electronic controls , but is sufficiently well served by the cruder electromagnetic relay . Let us suppose that we have to machine an Austin A40 cylinder block . The foundry supplies a rough casting , but to turn this into the finished article several hundred operations will have to be done . A great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drilled . The cylinder bores and the holes to take the camshaft and crankshaft will probably need three operations each ? a preparatory drilling , a semifinishing operation and the finish boring . Various faces will have to be milled smooth . And so on . Until a few years ago , a series of jobs like this would be done on a long line of individual machines . Each machine might do several operations simultaneously ? drill a number of parallel holes , for example . Each machine might , as a  | separate unit , be substantially automatic ? in a driller , for instance , the operator might have to place the block in position and move a lever to start the motors ; then the drills would begin revolving , advance slowly until the holes were drilled to the correct depth , retract to their original positions , and stop ; here the operator would take over again to unload the piece on to the conveyor that would carry it to the next machine . We are now asked to find a method of substantially reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already come very near to perfection . There is little possibility of making them work faster , for example , or of saving significantly on the power they consume . But well over a third of the cost lies in the wages of the operators . And , looked at from a purely engineering point of view , the operators contribute very little to the job . They do a few simple loading and unloading movements , and one or two manipulations of levers and switches , which look quite trivial compared with the work of the machine in removing large quantities of unwanted metal and doing it to a very high degree of accuracy . Would it be possible to do without these operators ? to arrange for the machines themselves to take over the few simple jobs which they still leave to their attendants ? One could , perhaps , arrange for mechanical hands to load the blocks from conveyor to machine and unload them from machine to conveyor , and connect these mechanisms to the motor switches , so that the powez is switched on and off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most purposes it would be a clumsy compromise , and it is usually better to redesign the machine completely as an integrated unit . What we now have is a Transfer Machine ? the bread-and-butter of automation . Instead of a series of separate machines , there is a series of stations , each of which does the work of one of the old machines . The cylinder blocks lie in a channel that passes through the center of these stations , and they are tranferred from one station to another automatically . Let us follow through a complete cycle of operations . If a cycle has just finished , there will be a partly worked block in every working station , and a finished one in the unloading  | station at the end . An operator removes this finished block , puts it on the conveyor , and presses a button to signal " All clear . " Meanwhile another operator places an unworked block in the empty loading station and also presses a button to indicate that he has done so . The transfer mechanism comes into action and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools in all the stations advance simultaneously to do their various jobs . When they have finished , they automatically retract and stop , and the cycle is finished . Every block in the line has had one further set of operations done on it ; there is another block ready for unloading and an empty loading station ready to receive the next block starting on its journey . In some cases it may be necessary to turn the work upside down , so that the tools can be brought to bear on the bottom , or to turn it through a right-angle horizontally . Special stations for executing these movements are introduced at appropriate points . Again , some machining operations take longer than others , and it would obviously be wasteful if the majority of stations had to stand idle for half of each cycle , waiting for one or two slow-coaches to finish . This difficulty is overcome by what is known as " double indexing " 1 ? by arranging for two successive stations to do the same job , each piece of work spending twice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if such a machine is to work smoothly , there must be elaborate arrangements for coordinating its various parts . If the transfer mechanism were to operate before a drill had fully withdrawn from the hole it was working in , the result would be a broken drill , and a serious hold-up for repairs . To avoid this sort of trouble , the machine makes use of feedback , although only in a rather elementary way . Each station is electrically connected to a main control panel . Only when every station has reported " Job completed and tools fully withdrawn " ( and , of course , the two operators have also made their push-button reports that their jobs are done ) can transfer take place .. If a drill gets 1 . To " index , " in engineer 's parlance , is to move a piece of work or a movable tool from one working position to another .  | stuck in its hole , the machine stops completely , and the operators ? or if necessary , the maintenance staff ? must take appropriate action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on its actions in more detail than this . Frequently a hole that has been drilled at one station has to be tapped ( have a screw thread cut in it ) at a later one . If the hole were not drilled deep enough or if some swarf were left in it , then the tapping drill would be broken . To guard against this , a station in between is equipped with a probing device . It pushes into the hole a hollow rod , down which air is blown . The air blows out the swarf , while the probe must travel to the full depth before it can signal " All clear " to allow the next cycle to start . Like any machine tool , the transfer machine is , of course , set in advance to turn out its work to specified sizes . But , again as in any other case , its tools wear and its working parts may get out of alignment , so that the work has to be inspected to insure that it keeps up to standard . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in preautomation days . But in all but the most elementary cases it pays to have the machine do its own inspection . A special inspection station at the end of the line applies gauges to all the important dimensions and , if they are outside the permitted tolerances , stops the machine and calls for attention . ( It is possible to arrange for the inspection station in some cases to feed back instructions that cause adjustments in the machining stations , but , so far as I know , this is not normally done at the elementary transfer machine level . ) Let us now make a more detailed examination of the transfer machine for working Austin A40 cylinder blocks . This machine does not by any means do all the machining operations on the blocks ? a great deal has to be done by other machines , mostly of old standard types ? both before and after it in the line . Nevertheless , it does a very impressive list of jobs : Drilling all holes in the front and rear faces ( except the oil gallery holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the camshaft and crankshaft bores ; Facing , opening out , and reaming the oil pump bores ; Milling the cam clearance round the oil pump bosses ; and Facing the center bearing crank thrust face . It used to require thirteen separate machines to do those jobs , and thirteen separate operators to attend them . Now the work is done by one machine , with two operators . Transfer machines of the simple type so far described can be used for jobs that involve such operations as drilling , reaming , boring , countersinking , tapping , milling , grooving , and ( with rather more difficulty ) broaching ? that is , operations in which the work remains stationary and only the tool moves . When turning or grinding is involved , the transfer problem becomes much more complicated . But even with the restriction to " work-stationary " operations , the transfer machine has a wide field of application in , for example , the production of car engines . It can deal with most of the machining needed on cylinder blocks , cylinder heads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a number of smaller components . In the U.S.S.R. a 16-station transfer machine does 504 operations on cylinder blocks for ZIS-150 lorries , turning out 30 blocks an hour , replacing 56 standard machines and reducing the floor space needed by 60 percent . Further detail is given by A. Zvorykin in Engineering Progress in the U.S.S.R. ( Moscow , 1955 ) . In the summer of 1955 , I personally saw working at the Stalin Automobile Works in Moscow another cylinder-block machine of about similar capacity , and one machining gear-boxes , which replaces 15 standard machines . The general quality of Soviet transfer machines appears to be comparable to our own , though they seem to be rather behind us in the number so far in use ( a different picture will emerge when we come to consider more complex types of automation ) . A single transfer machine will not usually do all the operations required to convert a casting into a finished corn-  | ponent . So the natural development is to link a number of machines for the purpose . Transfer machines are connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to give completely automatic lines as much as a quarter of a mile long . There may be one laborer at each end , for loading and unloading , but otherwise there is no direct labor at all ? only maintenance and supervisory workers . Ford led the way in this development . The line for machining six-cylinder blocks at their engine plant at Cleveland , Ohio , is 1,545 feet long . On a series of 42 linked transfer machines it does completely automatically all the 530 operations and the many inspections which transform the rough casting into a finished block ready for assembly . Turning out 5,000 blocks a day , it needs only 41 workers , against the 117 used by earlier Ford methods , which were already very advanced . The processes that we have dealt with so far involve only those types of operation in which , during machining , the work remains stationary . The transfer operation is therefore little more complicated than that of pushing a toy truck along a model railway and stopping it precisely at certain points . When turning operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex . The manual operation would run something like this : lift the workpiece from the conveyor , place it in the chuck of the lathe ( or between the centers " of a center lathe ) , clamp it there , release the grip of the fingers on the piece , take the hand to a safe distance and start the machine ; and at the end of the turning process , grip the piece between the fingers , release the chuck , remove the piece from the chuck and place it on the conveyor . To do the equivalent of these movements mechanically is obviously much more difficult than the simple transfer operations so far considered . Much the same applies to cylindrical grinding , while centerless grinding presents just as complicated , if rather different , transfer problems . Another problem arises with centerless grinding : the tool movements can not be prearranged ( as they can , for example , in turning ) to reduce the piece to  | the required size ; and so the grinder must be provided with a device which continually measures the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right moment . It is not surprising , then , that ( setting aside the degree of automatic operation used in the multispindle automatic lathe and its variants ) the automation of processes involving turning and grinding should be a much more recent development than the simple transfer machine for cylinder blocks and the like . The Pontiac piston line , which is completely automatic in all its machining and transfer operations and inspections , starts with rough-turned castings and ultimately delivers finished pistons . Omitting a few technical details , the operations performed are as follows : Core-drilling and other operations on the pin holes ; Turning the head , grooves , lands , and skirt ; Drilling smoke and oil holes ; Inspection of skirt diameters and sorting into high- and low-compression types ; Weight adjustment ( the machine weighs the piston , mills the appropriate amount from a protuberance inside , and checks correctness of final weight ) . Inspection of the smoke and oil holes ; Grinding the skirt ; Tinplating ( the first example we have met in this survey of a chemical operation ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in a temperature-controlled room ) , together with sorting by pin hole size and skirt diameter . The output is about 200 an hour . Automatic assembly is much less advanced . Some hint of how future developments may go can be gleaned from the radio industry . Looking at the complicated mass of connections inside a standard radio set , one would be inclined to guess that it would be hopeless to try automatic assembly . But as soon as one works free of the idea  | of merely doing the assembly of an existing set automatically , and decides instead to redesign the set from scratch with automatic manufacture in mind , then the problem solves itself as if by magic . The basis of the solution is what is called the " printed circuit . " One of the several variants of this technique starts with a molded bakelite panel on which the circuit is represented by a collection of grooves . After shot-blasting , a layer of metal is sprayed over the whole surface . Then the face of the panel is milled until metal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condensers , as well as connecting links , can be automatically produced in this way . In the most recent developments , the panels then pass to a machine which automatically inserts most of the remaining components ? though so far valves have proved too delicate to be treated in this way . Finally the soldering of the connections is done by automatically dipping the back of the panel in a solder bath . It has been estimated that automatic machines in existence today will ultimately supply half the small table sets used in the U.S.A. Similar procedures are also being used to assemble television sets . Using this method , an American concern has set up a radio assembly in which two workers turn out a thousand sets a day ? an output that would formerly have needed two hundred . So here we have a hundred-to-one increase in the productivity of labor ? by far the largest we have met yet . The suggestion naturally arises that the problem of automatic assembly in general may be solved , not by automating existing assemblies , but by fundamentally redesigning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor saving on other products . An alternative method of building radio sets that also lends itself to automatic working is the so-called " modular design . " In essence this consists in building up the circuits , as a child builds with toy bricks , out of ceramic wafers , each of which has an element of the circuit worked into it . This offers much less in the way of labor saving ? perhaps only 50 percent ? but it is much more suitable for producing a large variety of different models in small numbers .  | The forms of automation described in previous pages apply only to large-scale serial production . This can be used for the production of prototypes or for " a-few-off " jobs . The other forms took over the work of unskilled or semiskilled repetition workers . This can be used to replace highly skilled craftsmen . Let us consider the case of a man milling a prototype ? perhaps a complicated cam ? from the blueprints . It is highly skilled work to read the information contained in the prints and translate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually also very slow work ? with one job often taking several weeks . But when we examine what goes on , we discover that the machine is in use for only a very small part of the time . Most of the time is " thinking time " ? time spent by the craftsman in poring over the blueprint and deciding just how to translate blueprint language into machine movements , and checking his decisions carefully since one mistake can undo the work of many days . His work can be taken over by what is called a " program-controlled machine . " Part of his skills have been built into the machine . But the chief novelty is that it has been equipped wtih sufficient " intelligence " to enable it to read a set of instructions that are presented to it ? usually in the form of a list of measurements ? and translate these into action . The instructions are presented in the form of patterns of holes punched in a paper tape . The punching is done on a machine rather like a teletypewriter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more than those of an ordinary typist or a Hollerith punch operator ? they can be learned in a few weeks . This punched tape is now used to control the milling machine ( or in some cases , the instructions are first transferred by an automatic device on to a magnetic tape ? each system has its advantages ) . And now the machine runs continuously ? there is no " thinking time . " The control mechanism in the machine ? its " brain , " as it were ? has been given the faculties necessary for translating tables of dimensions into motions of machine parts . For example , where  | an elaborate curve has to be milled , the instructions will only specify the positions of a number of points at intervals along it ; the " brain " calculates how to join these up with a smooth curve and manipulates the motions of the machine accordingly . In more elaborate cases , the " brain " may make calculations about what cutting speeds are to be used for various types of cut and make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , is a small-scale example of an electronic computer . Feedback also plays a far more important role here than in any of the cases we have met previously . It is not possible to get sufficient accuracy by simple direct instructions to the moving parts . Instead , it is necessary to incorporate very refined measuring devices which report from moment to moment just where the various parts are ; the brain calculates the difference between where they are and where they should be , and sends out further instructions to bring them into place . It would be impracticable to arrange the " brain work " of the control mechanism and the various feedback circuits in terms of electromechanical devices , and so at last with program-controlled machines electronics comes into its own . For various technical reasons , program control has been applied first to milling machines , but it is equally applicable to all types of machine tools . The American Machinist ( 1st August 1955 ) described a program-controlled turret lathe . Formerly a machine of this type needed a skilled setter to prepare the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it runs itself , while the set up is planned by a methods engineer or " programmer " and the tape is punched accordingly by a clerk ? both in the office . The tape is delivered to the machine with the shop order and operation sheet or tool scheme . An unskilled operator can mount the numbered , " plug-in , " preset tools according to the chart and can place the tape in the machine director . As simply as this , the machine is ready to produce pieces . An aircraft factory produces at the best only a hundred or  | so of any given model ; transfer machines are quite uneconomic for such short runs , but program-controlled machines could be used extensively . They would produce very great savings also when a mass-production factory is retooling for a new model . And there are possibilities that program-controlled machines may prove economical in small factories and shops where transfer machines would be quite out of the question , or in large factories which produce a great variety of products in comparatively small numbers . Thus program-controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in almost any sphere , large or small , of engineering production . And increasing automation of long familiar machines points the same way . Take the well established automatic lathe , for example , so useful a tool for runs of a few thousand or more . Fed occasionally with a bar of metal , it will in its normal form automatically go through the motions of advancing the bar till the end is in the cutting position , bringing to bear on it a number of tools in succession , and finally cutting off the finished article and letting it drop into a hopper ? after which the cycle is repeated . But tools wear down , and so the work has to be inspected frequently , and every now and then a setter must readjust the tools and eventually replace those too much worn by new ones . Now , however , the Sunstrand Machine Tool Company markets a lathe which measures each piece it turns off and automatically resets the tools to compensate for wear . And when the tools have worn down to a predetermined limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unloaded in addition , these machines can run from five to eight hours without attention ( except for an occasional check to make sure that parts are being delivered to the loading mechanism ) . Clearly any shop or factory that can use an automatic lathe at all , can use one of these with very great savings in the wages of both operators and tool-setters . Remembering that an automatic lathe can be changed quite quickly from one line of production to another , it is obvious that this type of machine offers great possibilities for many small and medium-sized shops .  | So far as engineering production is concerned , the car industry has in fact led the way in automation ? because it is by far the largest mass-production branch of that industry . But other branches of engineering are introducing automation too ? though more slowly . An American Ordnance Factory for making 155-mm. shell casings must have been easily the most advanced example of automation at the time of its completion towards the end of the last war . Starting with 24-foot bars of steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and does all the machining operations on them . The work is untouched by hand , but many of the operations are manually rather than automatically controlled . The factory employs about 140 workers , including engineers and maintenance staff . A Westinghouse plant in Ohio uses a high degree of automation , including some automatic assembly , in its 2,000 odd machines and 27 miles of conveyors to produce five refrigerators a minute . The U.S.S.R. has an automatic line for making tractor ploughshares , which uses 15 workers instead of a former 150 . It starts with sheet metal , cuts and rolls it , grinds the surfaces , subjects the shares to heat treatment , cleans and oils them , gives them an anti-rust coating , packs them and loads them into trucks . They have also applied transfer machines to making water taps and to drilling the holes in sewing machine bodies and inserting the various pins and bolts . In the metallurgical field , highly automatic blast furnaces and rolling mills have been used in the best plants for many years , but recently many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron-casting machine uses six men instead of 40 in turning out 3,600 twoand-a-half pound castings an hour . It can be changed from one job to another in half a minute . On a capital investment of 600,000 dollars , it saves 300,000 dollars a year in wages . Machines are now available , small enough and cheap enough to be used in the average foundry shop , which will make cores and molds in half a minute that used to take a skilled man a quarter of an hour . The continuous casting process , in which the molten metal pours into the top of a  | long vertical tube and cools on the way down so that a continuous billet emerges at the bottom , was developed for brass in the early ' forties and applied to steel in 1948 . Besides being substantially automatic , it gives very large savings in cost by eliminating several stages of the orthodox process and producing a semifinished product in one operation . Rccent developments in sintering ( a sort of casting process in which finely powdered metals , pressed and heated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form the finished article ) are making a strong bid to eliminate machining operations altogether from the production of small components . For sintering can now produce these to accuracies of a thousandth of an inch and with tensile strengths only slightly less than those given by standard methods . This is not necessarily an automated process in itself ( though it could easily be automated ) , but it will have the same effect as very thorough automation of the machine line ? for the metallurgical process uses far less labor and far less elaborate machinery than metal-cutting . Turning to the electrical industry , we may note an American machine which makes electrical resistors , calibrates , classifies , and packages them with virtually no operator attention at a rate of 3,000 an hour ? formerly the output of 82 people . Another machine making thermostats occupies ten square feet of floor space in place of a former 6,000 and enables one man to turn out as many instruments as 22 used to do . On the electronics side , we have already seen the rapid progress of automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains to add that the manufacture of components like valves and cathode ray tubes has also been made substantially automatic . Automation is , in fact , cropping up in all sorts of industries . On one floor of a Columbia Record Company factory , 250 men work old presses producing gramophone records ; on the floor below , with automatic presses , four men turn out eight times as many records ? a productivity increase of five hundred times ! A British chipboard factory is virtually automatic in operation . The raw material , which may be large logs of wood or small pieces , is ground and then  | the chips are carried pneumatically to a screening machine and thence to a drier in which their final moisture content is automatically controlled . The next conveyor acts as a weighing machine , and as they leave this the chips are sprayed with a mixture of resin and hardener in automatically controlled proportions . The " carpet " of sprayed wood passes continuously through a press where it is heated and finally formed into the chipboard . In a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per shift supervise machinery which turns out over ? 300,000 's worth of mica dust per year . One might think that automation is unlikely to make much progress in industries like transport and building . Yet automatic marshaling yards are already established on several ' U.S. railways . In the one at Conway , Pennsylvania , every wagon on a train is sent to the right siding by switches controlled by an electronic " brain " fed with information on a punched tape . As each wagon or group of wagons rolls down from the hump , devices incorporated in the tracks weigh it and also determine how much it is being slowed down by friction . Other apparatus notes how many trucks there are already in the siding and calculates how far the new group has to run . A sort of radar device measures their speed as they approach . The combination of all these pieces of information controls retarding devices on the track which act to bring the wagons to a stop at just the right place . In the building industry there is obviously great scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chipboard factory we have just discussed is a case in point . Concrete mixing has been automated in both the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. The American plant can provide 1,500 different mixtures as required . The operator selects from a file a punch card representing the required formula . When he has placed it in the control mechanism , the rest is automatic . Specified quantities of the materials are delivered to a mixer , mixed , and loaded into trucks for dispatch . The machine produces 200 cubic yards of concrete per hour . The Russian plant , for use in connection with hydroelectric and canal construction schemes , is made  | in sections so that it can be easily transported . It uses no manual labor , and has a staff of 17 , whose working life is spent at control panels pressing buttons . The process is substantially automatic from the unloading of the raw materials from trucks to the placing of the finished concrete , and the production rate is 4,000 cubic meters a day . It is all very well to automate the production of building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the actual building automatically ? Fantastic as it may seem , this has already been achieved on an experimental basis in Warsaw . An electrically driven bricklaying machine , operated by one man who needs no bricklaying skill , spreads the mortar and places the bricks , leaving openings as desired for doors and windows , and building walls of any specified height and thickness . In the food-processing industries , automation is used not only to save labor and costs , but also to improve standards of cleanliness . In many canneries , sheet metal , paper , cardboard , and the produce to be canned , fed into their respective parts of the mechanism , are automatically transformed into cartons packed with sealed and labeled tins of sterilized food . Six largely automatic bakeries ( the first of which was built in 1931 ) now provide almost the whole of the bread used by Moscow 's population of eight million plus . These more or less random examples will be sufficient to show that , despite the automobile industry 's present lead , automation has a very wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be affected by it , and those that have lagged so far may be expected to catch up in the future . Conditions affecting automation in the chemical industries are very different , both technically and economically , from those in engineering . On the technical side , the problems of automatic transfer are usually very much simpler . Most chemical operations are done on fluids ( liquids or gases ) , or on solids that are made to behave like fluids by powdering them and carrying the powder about in streams of liquid or gas . Arrangements of pumps and valves , which are quite simple in essence , will do all that is required in  | the way of transporting such materials from one part of the plant to another . As against that , problems of process control are usually more complex in chemical production . The control involved in machining some article from metal usually amounts to little more than ensuring that at each station some dimension is reduced to a given size by the time the operation is finished . But to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chemical plant , a whole series of separate factors must be simultaneously controlled within fine limits ? the temperature and pressure in the vessel , the rates at which several reagents are fed in , the level of the liquid lying in the bottom , the rate at which the product is drawn off ( or the several products if the operation is a distillation in which quite different substances condense in different parts of the tower ) , and so on . Furthermore , these various factors will usually interfere with one another ? an increase in the input of some cold material will tend to lower the temperature , and so more heat must be supplied . Because of these differences , the operating staff in a modern chemical factory ( say an oil refinery ) perform very different functions from those in an engineering factory . Since " transfer " is done by pumps and valves , the operators are not to be found near the work itself . Instead , they are concentrated in control rooms , surrounded by dozens , perhaps hundreds , of instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to watch the movements of the needles on the dials and to take appropriate action from time to time in order to keep each needle pointing where it should . If temperature rises , then a knob must be turned to reduce the flow of the steam that does the heating . If a liquid level drops , the rates of input and withdrawal must be adjusted accordingly . Even the most advanced chemical factories still fall a long way short of completely automatic operation . Only individual stages ? like distilling or cracking ? out of the whole complex of processes are made substantially automatic within themselves . But each stage feeds the next , and what is  | happening at each stage affects operating conditions in the next . At present the adjustments that this requires have to be made by operators . A completely automatic plant , in which all stages of manufacture were subjected to one integrated control would require , not only a control of the " electronic brain " type ( which might perhaps be made available even now ) , but also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the varying conditions affect the output of each chemical process , and very great advances in measuring instruments . Obviously what the instruments should measure is the quality of the product ? say , at the final stage , the octane value of petrol produced . Instruments that will do this are not yet available in most cases . The automatic controls in use at present simply ensure that temperatures , pressures , rates of flow and the like are kept at levels which are expected to give the required quality . Samples of the products are taken at frequent intervals and sent to the analytical laboratories for checking . If the quality proves to be wrong , the operating conditions will have to be altered , and instructions go to the operators to make the appropriate adjustments ? after which the automatic controls operate at new levels . All this takes time ? during which the plant has been producing an inferior product . Obviously it would be advantageous to automate this quality control , so that the plant would be adjusted automatically and nearly instantaneously to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come some day ? an automatic chemical laboratory might feed back instructions to the plant controls ; infra-red spectrometers can perform certain analyses continuously on moving streams of fluid . The car industry employs three hundred thousand or so manual workers in this country . Against that we have about 21/2 million clerks . So the automation of office work , which has been going on at an increasing pace for the last few years , might well have far greater effects ? for good or ill ? than any of the machinery we have so far surveyed . A great deal of office work can be reduced to a simple routine . That is to say , it would be possible to prepare a set  | of instructions for the day ? or the week or the month ? such that if the clerks merely follow the instructions accurately , without ever taking decisions on their own , the work of the office will be done . The instructions may well have to include alternative courses of action , but these , too , can be reduced to instructions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , if there is a credit balance , do this ; if a debit balance , do that . " Work of that type ought to be easy enough to automate . In some respects office work is easier to automate than anything we have dealt with so far . When production of real articles is to be automated , we have to face the fact that real materials have awkward properties ? all those metalcutting machines , for example , produce swarf and chips , and the clearing away of this waste so that it does not foul the machines is one of the biggest headaches in engineering automation . Again , no matter how carefully they may have been manufactured , real materials vary in properties from sample to sample , and the machines must be designed to allow for these variations . But the figures with which the clerk works are abstract symbols , free from all the cussedness of real materials . True , they have to be represented by something material before they can be manipulated ? by conventional marks on paper , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can choose what sort of material representation we will have , and we can choose it-in such a way that it will be easy to manipulate automatically . One useful method is to represent numbers by the positions of gear wheels ? a tentoothed wheel advanced seven teeth beyond its zero position represents the digit seven . Out of combinations of such wheels there emerges the ordinary desk calculating machine , which mechanizes some part of the clerk 's work ? mechanizes only , not automates , since the machine must be controlled in detail by its operator . But gear wheels have far too many awkward material properties ? considerable power needed to drive them , backlash which provides problems growing more and more serious as the chains of gearing get longer , and so on . And gear  | wheels move slowly . A much better way would be to represent numbers by pulses of electricity . Modern electronic devices can manipulate such pulses with great speed , great accuracy and great reliability . And it is along these lines that the " electronic computer " ( popularly known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is not the place for a detailed description of how an electronic computer works . It will be sufficient to give the merest outline . As already indicated , the numbers are represented by electrical pulses circulating in various circuits . There is a " store " or " memory " in which the machine can keep a record of numbers it will need to use in the future . There are a number of arithmetical units which perform the ordinary arithmetical operations . An adding unit , for example , will be a combination of valves such that when it receives two groups of pulses representing number x and y , it sends out in response another group of pulses representing x. +y . And lastly , there is some form of master control , by which the various parts of the machine are told at every instant just what they must do next : " Memory ! Send this number and that number to the adding unit . Adding unit ! Feed back the result to this ( specified ) place in the memory . " And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important has been gained if the machine has to be instructed about every step it can take . But the point is that any lengthy calculation can always be reduced to a routine which is to be repeated over and over again . The machine is fed with a certain set of numbers to start on . It is told to perform certain calculations on these and store the results in the memory . It has then to do the same routine of calculations again on a different set of numbers , some or all of which will be numbers that it produced in the first routine . And so on . Occasionally there may be need for varying the routine ? just as the clerk must take different courses of action according to whether a balance is credit or debit . But instructions that allow for that can easily be arranged . Every set of instructions , in fact , must contain at least one such provision ? an order to stop when the calculation is finished .  | It must not , like the broom in the Sorcerer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . The criterion that decides when the job is done may take various forms ? " Stop after 783 repetitions of the routine , " or " Stop when a certain cumulative total has passed a given figure , " or " Stop when a number that is being calculated by successive approximations has reached a given degree of accuracy . " So the routine instructions incorporate an order of the type : " At the end of every cycle , examine a certain number ; if it is ( for example ) positive or zero , repeat the routine ; if it is negative , stop . " Usually the numbers that the machine is to use and the instructions it is to follow are fed into it in the form of patterns of holes punched in a tape ( or cards ) . Having read its instructions the machine sets to work , carries out the complete calculation automatically and eventually puts out the results . The output may be in the form of figures printed by an automatic typewriter , or in the form of yet more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or ( quite commonly ) both . The idea of a completely automatic machine to do all this is quite an old one . It came almost fully fledged from the brain of Charles Babbage , one of the nineteenth century 's most frustrated geniuses , in 1833 . But at that time , only mechanical devices like gear wheels , ratchets , and levers were available for putting it into practice . And they are far too clumsy for the job , so that Babbage 's attempt ended in complete failure . It was the development of electronics that made it possible to turn Babbage 's ideas into working computers . These machines work at enormous speeds ? several tens of thousands of additions , subtractions , multiplications , and divisions per second are now the usual thing . That does not merely mean that they can do calculations faster than human computers ; it means in practice that they can do calculations that would not be possible at all without their aid . For there are many scientific problems in which the theoretician can write out a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the answer you want . " The only trouble is  | that to solve the equations without the aid of the electronic computer would often take generations , or even centuries . We can not wait for that ? and so till a few years ago these problems were in practice insoluble . But the electronic computer nowadays runs off a solution in a few hours , and in that way is enormously accelerating the progress of many branches of science . The electronic computer proves in practice to be not only very much faster , but also considerably more reliable than its human equivalent . It has its-breakdowns , of course , and an efficient maintenance service is essential , but by and large it makes far fewer mistakes than do human computers . And it is a great deal cheaper ? even with the first of these computers ever produced , when interest , depreciation , running costs , staff salaries and all the rest were allowed for the cost of doing a calculation worked out at something like an eighth of what would be required using human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made since then . Apart from military applications ? in ballistics , for example ? electronic computers have been widely applied to the extremely complex calculations that occur in such fields as X-ray crystallography , atomic physics , optical design , calculations of stresses in engineering structures , aerodynamic design of aircraft , weather forecasting and many types of statistical work . All these jobs are essentially mathematical ones , and it is true that up till recently these machines have been used chiefly to carry out calculations ? hence the name " computers , " from a Latin word meaning to reckon or calculate . But that is , in a sense , a historical accident , and these are really machines for handling large quantities of any sort of information that can be precisely stated ? for sorting it out in any way that may be desired , for deducing its logical consequences , and for presenting the information in any way that may be found convenient . They can be made , for example , to play chess ? rather poorly , it is true , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few moves is unimpeachable , they lack any ability to com-  | prehend a strategic situation as a whole in the way that the experienced player can do . At the present time , several teams are developing them as translating machines ; their job here will be to accept the information conveyed by the words of one language , refer to a dictionary incorporated in the " memory " to find the corresponding words in the second language , work in the other pieces of information that are conveyed by such things as inflections and word order , and finally turn out a readable translation of the original . To emphasize the fact that these machines possess abilities much wider than that of mere rapid calculation , a recent tendency has been to refer to them as " data processing machines " or " data processing equipment , " though the term " computer " is holding its own , even for cases where actual computation plays a minor role . From all this general description , it will easily be seen that electronic computers should be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by teams of clerks in large offices . The machines are simply doing more quickly and more cheaply jobs of types that armies of clerks have been doing more clumsily for many years . But the speed of the electronic machines is already making it practicable to undertake new types of work that have previously been quite impossible . This particularly applies to tasks of assembling and sorting information on which to make managerial decisions about production policy . A computer has been installed at the Fawley refinery , the main task of which will be to facilitate the selection of a production plan that will meet as economically as possible the changing market requirements from existing stocks of crude and partially processed oil . The data ? the orders and the stock figures ? are available , of course ; but human computers could not do the sorting and calculation quickly enough for it to be of any use . On the other hand , the electronic computer will produce not just one but several alternative production plans in a matter of hours ? leaving it to the management to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been solved by computers  | include such things as : minimizing transport costs of a firm that has eight large factories and 56 warehouses , with a choice as to which factory shall supply which warehouses with which products ; planning the most economical use of the limited resources of a farm , given the market conditions ; and discovering which of several government contracts offered to an aircraft firm would pay best in terms of the known disposition of the firm 's resources . If computers can assemble and analyze the information needed to make production-control decisions , might they possibly go further ? might they receive their information automatically from its sources , draw their conclusions from it and themselves send out the various machines the instructions that must be followed ? Certainly there are instances of computers ? much simplified computers ? directly controlling machine behavior ; the program-controlled machines and the concrete mixing plant . But these are cases in which the program is supplied from outside and the computer merely interprets it in terms of machine operations . Something much more advanced has been achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the simplest of all processes to automate . For many years now , the operation of the individual powerhouse has been largely automatic ? once the engineer in charge has prescribed the conditions , automatic controls take over . But a major problem is to prescribe the regime that will give the most economical working of all the stations in a large grid under the varying load conditions . Electronic computers can now solve that problem . Given the pattern of demand at any moment ( supplied automatically by meters ) they can calculate how much power each station should be producing in order to give the most economical result , and automatically transmit the appropriate instructions to each of them . Already a computer controls in this way the operation of 35 generators in the nine plants of the Ohio Edison Company scattered over 9,000 square miles of country , and the U.S.S.R. has similar but more ambitious plans for the automatic control of the Moscow grid , which includes stations 600 miles away in Kuibyshev and Stalingrad .  | Electric power generating , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be a good many years before we see computers running engineering factories or chemical plants . But looking ahead , it is possible to visualize computers not merely operating plants more efficiently and cheaply than human managements , but even making it possible to work processes that could not be attempted now . Some theoretically possible chemical processes , for example , are beyond our reach at present , because they tend to get out of control and " run away . " No human operator could think or act quickly enough to keep them stable . But an electronic computer , fed by signals from measuring instruments throughout the plant , could correlate the relevant pieces of information and send back appropriate control signals in a thousandth of a second , and in this way make such processes practicable . It goes without saying that they can never do any really creative thinking , never take major decisions . They can examine data presented to them and use it to " decide " on one course of action rather than another ? but only on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " decisions " are completely automatic , wholly unintelligent . Unless some human brain has foreseen and prepared instructions for every possible eventuality , the computer will be lost . It has no faculty for dealing with the completely novel . That is reserved for humanity . But what the computer can do for us ? and do far , far better than we can do ourselves ? is to perform low-grade brainwork in a high-speed way . It is often said that automation is not just the substitution of automatic machinery for human labor and control , but is rather a " new philosophy of production " ? meaning that automation is not to be achieved merely by accepting existing processes and making them automatic , but should rather recreate the whole manufacturing process on an entirely new basis . I forget ( and I am not going to search the reference books to rediscover ) how many years elapsed after the invention  | of the incandescent gas mantle before it struck somebody that it would be better to have jet and mantle point downwards , instead of in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naked flame . The early motorcars were truly " horseless carriages , " very little different from the horse-drawn vehicles they were destined to replace , only slowly were they modified to a design really apt for self-propulsion ? and indeed , many people doubt whether , in the matter of external contour , they have reached that design even now . It has been the same whenever new manufacturing methods have come along . And the same thing seems to be happening ? must inevitably happen ? in the early days of automation . We used to make cylinder blocks on lines of machines with manual transfer between them . And so we take our first steps in automation by pushing the machines closer together and mechanizing the transfer . We do not stop to consider whether a different design of block , or a different design of the whole engine , might enable us to use some far more efficient automatic method . Yet the present form of the block has been determined just as much by the methods formerly available for making it as by the function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design of the whole car ? or of any other mass-produced article . This design has been profoundly influenced by the whole structure of the method of interchangeable manufacture as it has been practiced for the last thirty years or so . The machines which are automated are , in their essentials , the old machines with a few frills added ? program control is applied to standard milling machines ; an automatic lathe is equipped with the addition of an automatic tool-changer ; transfer devices are added to only slightly modified standard machines . Automatic machines designed anew from scratch and free from the influence of now irrelevant traditions have hardly begun to appear . There are plenty of designs and processes excellently adapted to the production methods of yesterday and today , but completely unsuitable for automation . Could one conceive of any practicable and economic method of automating  | the upholstering of car seats ( or drawing room furniture ) with their present designs and materials ? Or would one dream of trying to weave the homely shopping basket automatically from its reeds ? Obviously not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substituting automatic devices wherever human labor is used at present . It will be a method of manufacture as different from the established methods of today as the latter are from the handicraft work of two hundred years ago . And presumably automatic manufacture will in due course replace present manufacturing methods as completely as these have replaced handicraft production . But does " in due course " mean in ten years , or in thirty , or in a hundred ? Nobody can yet say . The last paragraph raises the question of the automatic factory . Can we expect a time to come when most of the material things of life will be produced by processes that are substantially automatic from raw material to finished article ? Before we try to answer that question as a whole , let us look at the weak link in the chain of automation as it is today . That main weakness is undoubtedly in assembly . The car ? as usual ? is the most convenient subject to discuss . At present its 5,000 or more parts are assembled by many hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line and of the many subsidiary assemblies that feed it . If we are to visualize automatic car factories , then we must first see if that assembly can be done automatically . So , in view of what has been said above , our thoughts turn first to the question of redesign . The consumer certainly does not want a car of several thousand parts . A few dozen will satisfy him ? wheels that revolve are the first essential , and after that come the various controls ( some of which he hopes to see eliminated by things like automatic transmission ) , doors and the handles that open and shut them , sliding windows and the knobs that move them , and a few other incidentals . As far as the user is concerned , the rest of the vehicle can be made all in one piece . Of course , the  | automobile engineer insists on more than that , for the car has to work . But is a total of 5,000 or more parts essential ? Of course not . Surely it would be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels , or even in one piece ? The electric wiring might be automatically molded inside the body work , which would do away with a great deal of electrical assembly work , as well as with the need for the ordinary insulating coating on the wires . I do not know how many parts make up the engine ? several hundred , I should imagine . Many of them will be essential to the working of the engine , but presumably many others are merely manufacturing conveniences of the present , which become manufacturing inconveniences from the point of view of automatic assembly and which could be eliminated by redesigning . Then there are all the accessories . Each would have to be considered on its merits to see if its construction could be simplified or if by some means ( other than the obvious one of doing without conveniences ) it could be eliminated . Take the windscreen wiper , which must , as it stands , involve some dozens of assembly operations . Glass coated with certain compounds of the silicone family has the property that any water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redesign the shape of the windscreen ( and if necessary the bonnet ) on aerodynamic lines , so that when the car is in motion these drops are swiftly blown aside to leave a clear view ? Or , if that does not work well enough ( for example , at low speeds ) , could one find a coating with the opposite property , a coating which would make raindrops spread out into a continuous even film over the whole windscreen ? That would solve the problem , for it is all that the wipers do now . In detail these suggestions may all be nonsense . They have simply been put in to suggest that if engineers consider car design carefully , resolutely abandoning traditions that arise from the needs of present manufacturing methods , and grasping at the same time at every new possibility that modern science and invention can provide , then they may end up with a car consisting of two or three hundred parts  | rather than the several thousand of the present time . And then the prospect of automatic assembly becomes a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provide the necessary incentives ? all these problems could be solved . There remains one major difficulty . Even when assembly is done by manual labor alongside conveyors , the problem of bringing components to the correct places as and when required is a serious one . The hundreds of minor fittings must be coordinated so that final assembly can run smoothly . The problem was not so serious in the days when Ford could say that his customers could have the T-model in any color they liked provided it was black . All T-model cars were absolutely identical ( except that one might choose between a roadster and a coupe body ) , so that it was only necessary to ensure a continuous flow of all components to the appropriate stations . But nowadays a single line will be producing many versions of the same basic model ? with variations of body type and color , different upholstery schemes , left- and right-hand drive , perhaps engines of different capacities and choice of synchromesh , preselector and automatic gear-box , as well as various optional fittings from overdrives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur , successive cars on the line involving quite different assemblages . If twenty components could be varied , with a choice of two possibilities for each , the total number of different combinations would be rather over a million , and it might take a year or two for any given combination to crop up a second time . In practice things are not quite so difficult as that . But they have none of the simplicity of the T-model days . It is no longer enough to ensure a steady flow of each component to the place where it will be wanted . Instead , the material-handling side of the factory organization must arrange that each variation of each component ( coming from some subsidiary line or from store ) meets the chassis for which it is intended at the appropriate place on the line and dead on time . To cope with this sort of thing , Austins have embarked on an ambitious scheme for controlling the movements of  | the various parts by a Hollerith punchcard system . Such a control system is well within the reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within sight of the automatic factory . Whatever the works takes in from outside would be tipped into hoppers or picked up by automatic handling devices and loaded on to conveyors . The aim would be to do as much as possible within the walls ? to receive metal ingots , for example . Many of the metallurgical processes and all the machining could be done automatically , while jobs like upholstery that obstinately defy automation will have to be replaced by more suitable alternatives . And so the work would flow , without human intervention , from machine to machine . Storage hoppers would intervene here and there to cushion any stoppages or to facilitate the problems of general coordination . From the machining lines the parts would flow to plating baths , paint-spraying chambers or other finishing shops , and thence ( with or without further intervening stores ) to the subassembly lines where they would be built up into engines , gear-boxes ( if these still survive ) , back-axles , bodies , and the like . And these in turn would finally come together on the automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first human hands that the growing car has encountered would press the starter button and grasp the wheel to drive it away . All the many machines in such a factory would have to be kept carefully in step , and this would be the task of an electronic computer , or perhaps of several computers each controlling a group of related machines and the relevant subassembly , and all controlled in turn by the master computer . Every machine would be sending a stream of signals to the computer , reporting on its rate of output and its needs for raw materials . The computer would digest this mass of information and then send back appropriate instructions ? this machine or department is to slow down , or that one speed up to bring them back into step ; this group of multipurpose machines is to change from one line of production to another . Then there would be a management grade to take major  | policy decisions , for no automatic device can decide a policy that is intended to serve humanity . Apart from the possibility of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminated ? management need not be concerned with anything less than top-level policy . Somewhere in the background would be the really important people : the machine builders , the designers , and the research and development staff . The machine builders would never be idle , for there would be a steady trickle of demand for replacements or for new machinery to put into practice the improvements in either product or process that the research and development staff would think up from time to time . And even if the machinery should be built by automated processes , there must somewhere be the workers who will build the automatic machinery that will build the automatic machinery that will build the production machinery . All this , I am sure , is not idle dreaming . My sketch may be wrong in almost every detail , but I am confident that production on something like those lines will some day be achieved . The twentieth century has seen the opening of a new era in construction , in which American engineering is a leader . Population and standards of living have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication have blossomed into activity hitherto unimagined . Practical problems involving power , materials , and methods have been attacked by a growing number of professional engineers . New alloy steels , glass , aluminum , and plastics have entered the market . Reinforced concrete and more recently prestressed concrete have been used in cheaper , sturdier , and sometimes startlingly unusual designs . Although its origins lie in the nineteenth century , the strut ture which perhaps best epitomizes this new development is the skyscraper . Sharply rising land values in New York and  | Chicago , cheap-construction steel , and the invention of the hydraulic elevator were the elements out of which it was born . The stone walls of early multistoried buildings were under the handicap of having to support themselves , and were unconscionably thick at their bases . With the substitution of steel frameworks , walls were hung on internal structures which were sturdy , light , and easily assembled . Thus separated , the skin and the bones provided new opportunities for both architects and engineers . Some of the results are described in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SKYSCRAPER : SKIN FOR ITS BONES JAMES MARSTON FITCH AS THE term is used nowadays in the United States , " curtain wall " describes the nonstructural sheath or skin which encloses our skeletal structures . In appearance , this new wall is quite unlike its predecessor , the load-bearing wall of history ; and this novel appearance is not deceptive , for the new wall marks a big conceptual advance over the old one . The specialization of members involved in this separation of building skeleton and building skin corresponds to the specialization of tissue in biological evolution . And it has had equally powerful consequences , for the evolutionary step from the load-bearing to the nonload-bearing curtain wall has made possible a new order of performance in buildings . Any architectural structure has two distinctly different tasks to perform . The first is simply that of carrying vertical and horizontal loads . The second is that of providing an enclosure which can regulate the flow of heat , cold , light , sound , air , and water between the building and its external environment . These two tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , they are mutually exclusive . That is to say , a material suitable for one function is not adaptable to the other . Steel and concrete are excellent load-bearing materials , but they are exceedingly poor thermal insulators . Mineral and glass wools make excellent thermal and acoustical insulators , but they have no structural value at all . Glass is transparent to light and heat and , for that very reason , is useless as an insulator . Wood is strong in tension and compression but vulnerable to fire and rot . There is , in short , no such thing as a universal building material . The only way to escape this paradox is the way of nature ? i.e. , through structural specialization . But before the appearance of steel and reinforced concrete the only natural material available for specialized use was wood . Wood has been scarce in most of Europe for centuries ; even in those areas where it was still plentiful , the hazards of rot and fire tended to limit its use to upper floors and roofs . Thus masonry remained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undifferentiated tissue ? serving both for support and for enclosure ? masonry could not perform either of its tasks very well . American experience proved to be somewhat different . In the new world the English settlers found limitless supplies of virgin timber . They brought with them a familiarity with the relatively advanced , wood-framed house of the seventeenth century . These two factors combined to make wood the dominant building material on this side of the Atlantic . The English frame was subjected to steady refinement and produced , by the mid-eighteenth century , a highly specialized structural system : a light wooden skeleton sheathed in two skins ? overlapping wood shingles or siding on the outside , plaster on wood lath internally . This familiarity with skeletal construction was to stand Americans in good stead when iron and steel became generally available in the last half of the nineteenth century . Nevertheless , all the early metal skeletons appeared first in Europe . The English train sheds of the 1830 's and 1840 's , like the Library of Ste. Genevieve in Paris ( 1843 ) , employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass and no weight . And this principle was shortly to be carried even further in two English structures of breathtaking scale and lightness ? Decimus Burton 's Palm House at Kew Gardens ( 1845 ) and Joseph Paxton 's Crystal Palace in London ( 1851 ) . Here the consequences of structural specialization , of the separation of building tissue into skeleton and skin , were clear for all to see . Although the vitreous skin did not yet protect the ferrous skeleton , the concept of the curtain wall had appeared in full flower . Its origins were European , yet the subsequent development of the curtain wall was largely to be carried on by the Americans . There were many reasons for this . The first was , as we have seen , our familiarity with skeletal structures in wood . The second was our discovery , during the nineteenth century , of immense supplies of coal and iron ore . These made the metal skeleton as cheap , relatively speaking , as the wooden ones . But the third and greatest reason was undoubtedly the skyscraper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our thinking since the 1880 's , when the rapid growth of our cities made necessary  --  and the elevator made possible ? this peculiar form of urban concentration . As a matter of fact , the demand for multistory office buildings was so great , during those early days , that the first skyscrapers were not skeletal at all . Root 's Monadnock Building ( Chicago , 1891 ) climbed to a height of 16 stories with solid , load-bearing masonry walls . To reach this height , the walls had to be six feet thick at sidewalk level . But this was the absolute limit . Someone had to perfect a stable , selfsupporting steel skeleton which could rise indefinitely , independent of enclosing walls . As a matter of fact , someone already had : William Le Baron Jenney built the Home Insurance Building in 1883 ? the world 's first completely articulated , multistory steel skeleton clothed in a nonstructural skin . Once this structural system had been invented , architectural attention could be focused on the further refinement of its parts . It must be confessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with the skin : even here they saw the problem as more esthetic than functional ? i.e. , the emphasis was more on its appearance than on its performance . The principal walling materials then available ? cellular terra cotta tile , brick , plate glass ? produced walls which were weatherproof , fire resistant , and relatively lightweight . Such architects as Root ( in his Reliance Building , 1895 ) and Sullivan ( in his Schlesinger Building , 1899 ) used them wtih great distinction . But for the climates of North America such walls were far from ideal . A typical Chicago year presents temperature extremes unknown in Europe from one hundred degrees Fahrenheit to twenty or thirty degrees below zero ; a typical day can easily have extremes thirty , forty , or even fifty degrees apart . Solar radiation is intense in summer ; heavy snows , high winds , and months of frost mark the winters . An American wall must be designed to meet both subtropical and sub-Arctic conditions . All this implies a high degree of specialization within the tissue of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermal insulation , soleil brise , waterproofing , vapor barriers , ventilation , daylighting , etc . Another negative aspect of these early curtain walls was economic . While incomparably lighter and less massive than load-bearing masonry , they were still built up of relatively small units ( brick and tile ) , whose assembly required a lot of hand labor in contrast to the skeleton itself , which was largely prefabricated . The next logical step , therefore , would have been to abandon masonry altogether and prefabricate the curtain wall in story-high , bay-wide panels . Only thus could the advantages of industrial production , already applied to the fabrication of the skeleton , be brought to bear upon the fabrication of the wall . Yet half a century elapsed between the Schlesinger Building and the first prefabricated curtain wall . The reasons for this delay were two : the trade unions and the municipal building codes . The mason crafts , early and powerfully organized , were umbilically tied to the old techniques and naturally resisted technological change . The building codes , drafted during those same years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ceramic walling materials . Their specifications were all written in terms of how a wall should be built , rather than in terms of how it should perform . It took decades of pressure to overcome these two obstacles , with the result that a nonmasonry curtain wall has become legal in most American cities only since the Second World War . Thus only in the last decade has it become possible to clothe the American skyscraper in skins of stainless steel , aluminum , porcelain enameled steel , and plastics . Progress since the war , however , has been spectacular . The new metals , together with the new thermal and acoustical insulations , synthetic finishes , and insulating glasses , are yielding walls three inches thick ( instead of 12 to 15 inches ) which weigh 12 pounds per square foot ( instead of 125 pounds ) . The panels are so large and light that one entire 23-story skyscraper in New York was sheathed in a single day ! In terms of its total area , glass has always played a dominant role in the curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly more glass , perhaps no more glass , than some of Sullivan 's buildings of sixty years ago . The glass itself has been importantly modified , however . The industrial production of rolled glass in large sheets was accomplished by the early 1880 's , and the Chicago architects were quick to use it ? in fact , big plates of fixed glass were originally called " Chicago windows . " But ordinary glass , for all its remarkable properties , displays many deficiencies when used in the skyscraper . Its transparency to visible light and infrared radiation is both a blessing and a curse . In the bitter American winters , large areas of ordinary glass are uncomfortable , wasteful of heat , and cause serious condensation . In the torrid summers , on the other hand , they admit too much solar heat . To correct this the insulating glasses were developed ? sandwiches of two sheets of glass separated by a hermetically sealed air space . They are 51 percent more efficient as thermal insulators than ordinary glass . Another limitation of ordinary glass is its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent to visible light , offering no means of modulating its intensity or dis-
