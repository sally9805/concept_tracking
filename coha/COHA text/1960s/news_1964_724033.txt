txt The House of Representatives approved without significant change today President Johnson 's foreign aid authorization request of $3,516,700,000 for the fiscal year beginning July 1 . The roll-call vote of 230 to 175 sent the authorization measure to the Senate . The bill sets the ceiling for foreign aid funds . An appropriation bill must be passed later to allocate the money , and fund reductions can be made in this process . The House action brought to an end two days of debate that was described by Democrats and Republicans alike as one of the most resigned discussions in the 17-year history of the aid pro gram . Johnson Praises House When the results were in , it was clear that a majority of members had accepted at face value President Johnson 's statement that he had submitted a " bare-bones " program that could be reduced only by jeopardizing the security and foreign policy interests of the United States . ** Johnson , when notified of the passage vote , issued a statement that said : " The House is to be congratulated for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 50 votes , on the foreign aid bill . Those members of both parties who rightly concluded that this is no time to be cutting a carefully drawn measure deserve the thanks of their countrymen . " This is an important step in maintaining a sound and stable foreign policy in the national interest . " A Precedent In House In the vote on passage , 174 Democrats and 56 Republicans joined to sustain the President 's request . Voting against passage were 115 Republicans and 60 Democrats . It was the first time since foreign assistance began with the Greece-Turkey aid plan in 1947 that any President had his full asking figure authorized by the House . Only a technical reduction of $127,600 , approved in advance by the Administration , was cut out of the bill that had been reported to the floor by the Foreign Affairs Committee . The committee had questioned the validity of contributing that amount toward a United Nations Peace Corps , and the request was withdrawn . Inadvertently , however , the money authorization ' remained in the bill as reported to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . During the day , nearly 20 amendments intended to cut economic aid categories or restrict the President 's freedom of action in foreign affairs were rejected by substantial majorities  --  most of them by voice vote . Just before the vote on final passage , Representative E. Ross Adair , ft ( dublican of Indiana , put a motion to send the bill back to the Foreign Affairs Committee with instructions to prune $172 million from the proposed $922 million authorized for development loans and to . eut the President 's contingency fund by $50 million under the proposed $150 million ceiling . Vietnam Funds Marked A vote of 211 to 193 rejected this last-ditch effort . It confirmed the majority decision earlier , when Mr. Adair tried to cut the development loan fund and the cold-war contingency fund by means of amendments , soon after the House met at noon . His effort to slash the loan ceiling lost on a standing division of 61 to 35 and on a demanded count by tellers of 102 to 61 , Moments later , his at-1 tempt to cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , only those amendments were adopted that had been accepted by the floor manager of the legislation , Thomas B. Morgan , Democrat of Pennsylvania , chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee . In this acceptable category were proposals by Representative Peter H. B. Frelinghuysen , Republican of New Jersey , to earmark $200 million of the $405 million ceiling on " defense support " funds for South Vietnam . . The same proposal had failed in the committee when Administration supporters argued that it would prevent use of the money elsewhere if it were not needed in South Vietnam , But Mr. Morgan said he would accept it , since an even larger amount of defense support for that country had been included in the Administration 's program . " Defense support " funds are a form of economic aid to countries maintaining larger defenses against Communist aggression and infiltration than they can finance without outside aid . The entire $405 million requested is intended for 11 countries on the periphery of the Sino-Soviet bloc . Another amendment unchallenged by the committee chairman was one offered by Representative Ogden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give United States ambassadors greater discretion to permit use of foreign local currencies for approved projects in recipient countries originating such funds . These local-currency or counterpart funds are deposited by recipients of various forms of aid including surplus agricultural products . They must be spent in the recipient country , but their use has been restricted by Washington . Mr. Reid told the House there was now $920 million in foreign currencies under control of the United States as joint trustee . His amendment would make them available for the first time for schools , housing , language instruction , travel and related purposes of foreign service officers and employes . Net Reduction The net effect of the amendment process was a reduction of $27,600 in the bill 's total . This was the result of a successful proposal by Representative Frelinghuysen that restored $100,000 of the $127,600 technical cut made because of disallowance of the United Nations Peace Corps contribution . As finally passed , the bill authorized , in addition to $922 million for economic development loans , a total of $550 million for the Alliance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants to emerging nations and $134 million in voluntary contributions to international organizations . The remaining amount for economic aid was made up of the $405 million of defense support and $150 million for the President 's contingency fund . A total of $1,055,000,000 of military aid is included in the total amount authorized .
