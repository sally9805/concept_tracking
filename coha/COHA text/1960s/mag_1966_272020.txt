ACCIDENT by Nicholas Mosley . 192 pages . Coward-McCann. $4 . <P> Iris Murdoch ( A Severed Head ) has put readers on warning that novels by Oxford philosophy dons are apt to baffle as well as entertain . The same warning applies to Accident , by Nicholas Mosley ( who is , coincidentally , the son of Sir Oswald Mosley , former chief of the British Union of Fascists ) , which is about an Oxford philosophy don , and which raises the art of the intellectual tease to the level of mild torture . There is no doubt that in Accident a fictional design of subtlety and distinction has been attempted . But it is a literary jigsaw puzzle with perhaps some extra pieces belonging to another design slipped in . <P> The book seems perversely dedicated to confusion , like Oxford 's linguistic philosophy which , from a puritan devotion to clarity , actually makes it very difficult to say anything about anything . Professor Stephen Jervis ( and Novelist Mosley with him ) struggles against this self-denying ordinance . After all , the intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is , the reader is told by one character , not about characters or society , but " about knowing . " <P> Knowing what ? Picking up clues or philosophic crumbs like a capriciously fed pigeon , the reader will learn that Stephen is married to a beautiful wife whom he loves , that he has two children , and that he does his job more or less well . He is also 40 years old , has problems of identity , and , more specifically , " ca n't keep his hands off the girl students . " It is not really his hands but his irresponsible voyeurism that is Stephen 's trouble . <P> There is an automobile accident . William , an aristocratic undergraduate , is killed , and Anna , another student , is carried from the wreckage by Stephen-who is responsible in no ordinary legal or moral way , but is unhinged by guilt . Glimpses of his previous history indicate that he has enjoyed a sort of vicarious pleasure in the love affairs of his students and friends . He has had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an affair that seems to have done no harm ; yet , without apparent cause , his wife falls desperately ill in his absence . In one episode , a parody of war is enacted by rich undergraduates at a great country house ; the aristocracy , we are told in a blurred Freudian attribution , is good only for causing death-their own and others . There is a fancy-dress party at another country house , once notorious as the scene of diabolic revels . <P> But these are all enigmas . Nor is the situation made clearer by the intimation that one of Stephen 's contemporaries , a freelance careerist of the emotions called Charlie , is the hero 's Doppelgnger . It is even suggested that the story is Charlie 's not Stephen 's ; thus , although written throughout in the first person , it should actually be in the second . If so , the moral of the story seems to be that a man can not be trusted to write his own history , and that even his best friend will have trouble with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?
