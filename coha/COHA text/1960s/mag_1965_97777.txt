Mike Bundra is , or was , a defensive tackle with the New York Giants  --  a heavy-jowled , slope-shouldered , soft-spoken 250-pounder in his fourth year of play in the National Football League . He is originally from the football-player spawning grounds of Pennsylvania  --  a little town called Catasauqua , not far from Allentown . His people are Slovak , and the rough texture of their tongue often crops up in his own speech . He refers to his position as " defense tackle . " He has played " defense tackle " with four NFL teams  --  coming up as a sixth-draft choice for Detroit in 1962 , then in 1964 with Minnesota and also Cleveland , where he finished the year and earned the right to wear the heavy-cut championship ring . // Playing second-string tackle , Bundra had performed very rarely  --  not much more than 10 minutes of game time in those three years . Defensive tackles are durable and , once established as starters , they are difficult to supplant . Bundra always remained a backup man . But the Giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and when they traded with the Browns in September for Bundra he got his chance . He opened at tackle . Lack of experience marred his play , but he had his good days ; in the first Cleveland game of the season the sportswriters awarded him a Bulova watch as the outstanding Giant defensive player against his old teammates . He began to make plans . He and his wife , Evelyn , an attractive girl with thin features and heavily penciled eyebrows , moved out of the Concourse Plaza Hotel near the Stadium into a furnished apartment . With them went their nervous , popeyed chihuahua , Ginger , which Bundra kept to pools of shadow while walking it at night lest some of the other Giant players living in the vicinity catch him with a dog that he could set , trembling on its thin legs , in the palm of his hand . // In the second Cleveland game last month Bundra had troubles , particularly in the second half , when the Cleveland center  --  working cleverly and gauging Bundra 's responses perfectly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle . Bundra was replaced , and when he reached the sidelines he exploded into 10 or 15 seconds of self-recrimination , during which he threw his helmet , kicked it and swore his anger out before finally slumping down on the bench . // That night he comforted himself on his poor play as he walked the chihuahua by remembering Head Coach Allie Sherman 's dictum that the Giants were a young team and that they would make mistakes . He often repeated that to himself : " There 'll be mistakes , but we 're learning all the time . We 're a young team . " // The next day  --  a day he will not forget , Bundra 's Blue Monday  --  he was driving westbound on the Cross Bronx Expressway in his 1963 Chevrolet , when a trailer truck going east in the opposite lane lost its spare tire . The tire , rolling at a 40-mile-an-hour clip , jumped the expressway divider and sailed down at Bundra 's car . This sudden apparition gave him just time to throw up his arm to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tire crumbling his front fender , then slicing up over the hood and crushing the windshield frame so that the convertible top came down around his ears . He was able to bring the car to a stop , and he sat shivering for a while in the quick silence . He could not remember a closer escape , ever , and he began thinking about his luck  --  how perhaps it was pretty good , considering . // That afternoon he was telling his wife about the accident , perhaps for the fifth time  --  when the phone rang . It was Allie Sherman 's secretary asking for Bundra . The coach wanted to speak to him . // Remembering it , Bundra said , " He came right to the point . He said , ' We 've decided , the coaches and I , to put you on waivers . ' He and the rest of the coaching staff , they were sorry . That was all there was to it . I said to him , ' You got to drop me all the way down ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He said , ' No , we ca n't . ' I said , ' Why , what did I do wrong ? ' and he said he was sorry . I said I was just one year away from the five years you need for the pension . What about that ? What would the other clubs think  --  my being dropped right out the bottom ? He said he was sorry . I would do all right . He said I had good experience . I was young and strong . // " So that was the end . I kept thinking , ' What a day , Blue Monday . ' I lost my car and my job . I was surprised my wife did n't leave me  --  except she was too angry at what she 'd heard : she had too much to say . So she stuck around . ' What could it have been ? ' I kept asking myself . Maybe they was just mad , and they use me for a guinea pig . It 's no joy for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . I could n't figure what they had on their minds . " // Football coaches say that releasing a player is the toughest part of their job . The coaches hate it because it is hard to do cleanly . There have been procedures in the two leagues that are difficult to believe . Some years back , at Buffalo in the American Football League , the coach would cut a player by having the equipment manager clear out his locker . When the player arrived in the gym to dress for afternoon practice , he would sit down on the bench to work his shoelaces loose and suddenly find his locker empty , not even believing it at first , staring up at the locker number and then into the lockers on either side , the hope beginning to fade as his teammates , now no longer teammates but acquaintances , looked away from him embarrassed , and stared down at their own socks . // It was an experience all players went through as rookies  --  cutdown time , often called the Night of the Turk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to signify the emissaries coming along the dormitory corridors to fetch the players over to the office to be officially let go . At Cleveland during the training seasons when Paul Brown was the coach , he would wait until the players were all in their quarters at night . On those occasions when a cut was due , the rookies would collect in one room and , to keep their spirits up , they would put on twist records and practice the dance steps that were the rage at the time  --  the twist , the chicken , the mashed potato  --  the volume up high and the feet pounding , until Paul Brown from the floor below complained that there was so much noise he could n't keep his mind clear to decide who to let go . Eventually the door would open anyway , and Brown 's envoy would point at the unfortunate through the crash of music and the players turning in the dance patterns . // At Chicago , George Halas used to reach out and touch a man on the shoulder , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about being cut  --  would tend to sidle away . One day he reached out to touch a quick little scat-back , who saw the hand coming at the last second and , dodging it , dropped to the ground with a groan and began to do a series of quick push-ups . " Look , " he said , glancing up at Halas , " I 'm strong , too . I can do these forever . " Halas was supposed to have been so touched by the player 's desperation that he turned away as if it had n't been his intention to tap him at all . He kept the player for an extra week and then came up swiftly behind him in the locker room when the player was skinning himself out of a sweat shirt and got him on the shoulder before there could be any chance of avoidance . // The reactions of released players are likely to be more consistent than the methods of dismissal  --  often tearful , then sullen as they think back on all the wasted effort , then a slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been exceptions . Some years ago , at the Detroit Lions ' training camp on the grounds of the Cranbrook School , after two Lion players had been told they were cut they went up to their dormitory room and got mean on a bottle of rye . They came lazying out looking for trouble . They found a Cranbrook mathematics teacher in the lavatory brushing his teeth . He was wearing a green silk kimono embroidered with a red dragon . He heard them come in behind him , and he turned , smiling at them pleasantly , his mouth full of toothpaste. // " Hi , fellows , " he said . " Nice practice today ? " // The two players , both big linemen , stared at him , rocking slightly . // " Who 's that clown ? " one of them asked , pointing at him . // After studying him , the other said , " He 's a Chink ! A mad Chink ! Look at that foam on his mouth ! " // The mathematics teacher turned back to the sink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed him back to his quarters where they found a packed trunk ( he was about to leave the school for a late summer vacation ) , which they hoisted out and threw down a stairwell . // If the behavior of a released player is sometimes unpredictable , almost invariably the rest of the squad is sure to ignore his misfortune . When Bundra was dropped the Giant squad , to a man , was surprised . There were a few rumors and speculations . Yet his release was discussed only briefly . Ballplayers shy away from the unpleasantnesses of their trade  --  indeed , they pretend such things do n't exist . Being released or injured are the two most common hazards of football , both insured if one stays around long enough , and both are treated equivalently . If a player is hurt and is slow to get up after a tackle , his teammates nearby will shout , " Wipe it off ! Wipe it off ! Get up ! Forget it ! " almost as if their raillery could dismiss the concept of injury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move from him . Similarly , a released player is ignored . Bundra was well liked on the Giants . Their affection was sufficient for them to give him friendly nicknames  --  Big Mike the Bear , the Slovak , Boondra  --  and some of the players , because he had come to the Giants from the champion Browns , thought of him as a good-luck talisman . " Where Bundra goes , so goes the championship . " But only two or three called him on the day of the release . Each said over the phone that he did not believe it  --  an error , it had to be some sort of error . They refused to accept it . Bundra said later that those who called were so positive that his release was a mix-up that in his daze from the accident and the horror of Sherman 's phone call , he began to wonder if perhaps he had n't dreamed the whole thing  --  that perhaps Sherman 's secretary had got the wrong party on the phone . But then , almost immediately , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire services , his relatives from the Allentown area began calling . They joshed him gently . They were ex-Giant fans now . In just over a year they had been ex-Lion , ex-Viking , ex-Brown and now ex-Giant fans . One or two of them were bitter : " How can they drop you like that ? " // " I do n't know , " Bundra had said . " Believe me , I do n't know . " // Just before the recent St. Louis Cardinal-Giant game Allie Sherman announced to his players at a team meeting : " If you do n't do well on Sunday we wo n't even give you the courtesy of having you come in to face us . We 'll cut you on the phone . " The threat was by no means the first that Giant players had heard during the year from one or more of their coaches ; nor is rule by fear a device used only by the Giants . Invariably coaches in both leagues will deny using such pressure . Sherman will say , " You never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not run scared in football . " But the problem of getting a team to its peak  --  giving it the " juice "  --  is complex , and anything is utilized to heighten a player 's performance . There are some who , under the threat of being released , play in a controlled terror that brings on a performance they can scarcely believe themselves capable of . // Sherman is a discreet man . He believes that the personnel problems on his club are private . He will not discuss how he brings the best out of his players . He is very good at it . His record this year is better than any experts thought possible . Nor will he discuss a player who has not come up to expectations and is to be released  --  such as Bundra  --  any more than he would divulge a game plan for a following Sunday . He called Bundra a fine man , and he mentioned that his problems were those of " technical difficulties . " It was absurd to believe the rumors  --  that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reasons of personal pique . Bundra 's future ? The fact that he had only one more year to go for his pension ? Well , he could fit in somewhere else . He could have made it with the Giants , perhaps , if the present personnel had been better balanced . // It was a tough part of the business , releasing a man . Curiously , in Sherman 's own case , thinking back , it was a trade that had upset him more than letting a player go outright  --  the Darrell Dess trade . It had to be done  --  the only way he could get his quarterback , Earl Morrall  --  and he gave up an unbelievably skillful man with a perfect football temperament . For Sherman , it was apparent that giving up perfection rankled far more than any feeling of compassion he might have felt for someone being released who had n't quite been able to make the grade . One felt he could talk about Dess for a long time . // The Bundras would have left New York for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they had to wait for their Chevrolet to be repaired . They had called the Giant management to see if something could be done financially to help them through the delay . They were told politely that there was n't anything in the contractual arrangements that obliged management to assist them . // So they stuck to their apartment  --  with its brown wall-to-wall carpeting , the alcove kitchen and bar , with the two tall bar stools in pink and the two Utrillo prints in cloth on opposite walls in the living room . The Bundras ' only personal belongings in the living room were two souvenir ashtrays , a cardboard box in a corner for Ginger , with a blanket door , a portable television set , and next to it on the table three football trophies  --  two small football-player figurines on wooden stands from Bundra 's high school days , and a large , gold-tinted football with a plaque that identified it as the John Dye trophy for the year 's ( 1961 ) outstanding lineman at Southern California , where Bundra went to college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to see the Giant coaches , to find out why , exactly , he had been dropped . He sat in the locker room at Yankee Stadium , but he was ignored so pointedly that after a while he left . " They knew I was there . But they would n't look at me . It was like I was n't there . I 'll see them before I go back to Detroit . I do n't hold them no grudge . I 've only played maybe 10 minutes before this year . I need to find out what was wrong . If I have a chance I 'll better myself . It takes time . // " You do n't learn nothing in your rookie year . The veterans wo n't talk to you . My second year I began to learn ; Alex Karras began to show me things  --  how to key and pick up moves to tell me how to strike and where to pursue . // " At Cleveland , Modzelewski  --  Little Mo  --  he was the best teacher I ever had He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a good year . Then I was running after Jimmy Brown in practice when I felt this big pain and I stopped up short  --  like someone had hit me from behind with a stick  --  and they tell me I busted a blood vessel in my calf . They ca n't use me much after that  --  just on the goal-line stands when they use four defense tackles . But I got this . " He turned his hand so the championship ring glinted. // " It 's not the end of the world , " he said . " I 'm going to make it with another club . But I wish I knew what had happened here in New York  --  to go all the way from first string right out the bottom .... " // " Perhaps it 's their fault , " his wife said . " They 're the ones that are wrong . " // " One of my troubles , " Bundra said , " is that I fight too much with the man in front of me on a pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Maybe that 's it . Maybe if I could straighten that problem out .... " // " They had it in for you , " his wife said . " Do n't ask me why . " // Bundra went on : " Maybe on the runs I play the man opposite different from what they want . My habit is to play him soft , not kill him , just to pop him and get rid of him and then go on the pursuit . That 's the way Alex Karras does it . Sometimes he hardly touches his man to get around him . That 's my style , too . That 's what I learned . But maybe Allie and Pop Ivy , the defense coach , they want me to do different , to kill the guy in front . Well , I 'll do that  --  I 'll do what they want . But they got to come to me and say something . I mean , how can I do what they want if they do n't tell me ? " // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You do what you learned best . " // Bundra got up and turned on the television set . A few days before , he and his wife had watched the Giant-Cardinal game . He had rooted for the Giants to win . His wife joshed him half humorously for doing so . She cheered heartily for the Cardinals . " What 's wrong with you , anyway ? " she had asked . // " It 's a good team , " her husband had said . " I ca n't knock them . I love pro ball . I ca n't knock anything about it . It 's been good to me. "
