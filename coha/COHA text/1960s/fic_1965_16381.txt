1-5 FADE IN : SERIES OF ESTABLISHING SHOTS - DAY View page imageExterior scenes of St. Louis , particularly the riverside industrial district . Even more important to establish than the place is the time : end of summer , 1936 . Election posters would help , with the Republican ones stressing such themes as " Burst the Roosevelt Bubble , " " Save the American Way of Life , " " Vote for Landon and Knox . " 6 EXT . FACTORY - DAY One of the most typical scenes of the day : a mass picket line outside a textile or shoe factory . And the picketing is anything but peaceful ; the demonstrators are in direct conflict with the police , who are trying to keep an entrance open for strike-breakers . Whatever the general action , a small segment of struggle breaks off from it , and it is this that our CAMERA picks up : some police chasing some pickets or some pickets chasing some strike-breakers , the one faction pursuing the other up an alley with violent intent . 7 EXT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pursued and assault them with clubs or other weapons .

KITCHEN IN SLEAZY RESTAURANT NEAR RAILROAD The eight men gathered here in a game of five-card stud are clearly removed from the struggle outside , even though the SOUNDS of it are very close , coming through window opening on the alley . In fact the noise is so loud that the DEALER of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance . &nbsp; DEALERSomebody shut the goddam window . Let a man think .  --  3  --  View page image The player nearest the window shuts it . The Dealer , who also owns the restaurant , is the talkative type of poker player . Except for THE CINCINNATI KID , the other men at the table look like hoods of one sort or another : gunmen , labor spies , extortionists , what have you .

As the gun clatters to the floor , and the others force the door , The Kid takes a step backward to provide enough momentum , then swings at Danny 's middle with his left , dropping him , then jumps up on the wash basin and wriggles his way out through a window .  --  6  --  View page imageSUPERIMPOSE : MAIN TITLES Danny recovers his balance and his gun , unbolts the door just before it is smashed in , and runs with the others to get out of the building and after The Kid . 10 EXT .

The Kid drops from the window to the ground and starts to run toward the railroad yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poker players appear and run after him . 11 EXT . RAILROAD YARDS - DAY The chase across the tracks goes on behind the Credits . The Kid 's pursuers split into two groups to cut him off , and they seem to have succeeded in cornering him against a track on which a passenger train is bearing down , headed for the station . His dubious chance of escape depends on his getting beyond this track in front of the train , which , with a burst of speed , he manages to accomplish just in time . The passenger train divides The Kid from his pursuers , and we PAN with the train into the depot . 12 INT . UNION STATION , ST . LOUIS The train slowly stops .

If Lancey is not right . If he 's got a cold , or his stomach ulcer is acting up , or something like that . &nbsp; KIDBut then everybody 'd see he was n't right and it would n't prove nothing .

Then she takes a bottle of alcohol from the medicine chest and returns to the bedroom with it . She stands in front of him waiting for him to move , but The Kid is singularly listless . Not till she sets the bottle down does he respond by turning his face to the pillow . She goes right to work on his shoulder muscles , and she seems to know what she is doing . &nbsp; KIDWhat did you do with yourself this time ? &nbsp; CHRISTIANLast night I went to a movie with The Shooter 's woman .

After a bit he brings in the shale stone can with the other hand to chord and accent the rustle of the first can .  --  53  --  At the same time he begins to sing a simple song in a pure , delicate voice .

CRAIGIE PORCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sitting just outside the kitchen , where Mrs. Craigie and Christian are pasting labels on the mason jars they filled earlier . The paste and some of the jars are just inside an open window on a shelf behind the men 's heads . The light comes from a kerosene lamp inside .  --  65  --  &nbsp; CRAIGIELet me get this straight in my head . Cards is all a matter of luck , who gets dealt the best ones . The Kid stands up and selects six playing cards from a deck in his pocket . During the next few lines he uses the paste on the shelf to stick together three pairs of them so as to form three double-thick cards . One of these has two faces , another two backs , and the third a back and a face . &nbsp; CRAIGIESo when one of you professional gamblers sits down with a bunch of your  --  what do you call them  --  customers , clients ?  --  66  --  &nbsp; KIDThe technical term is " suckers .

That 's cheating and it 's not any part of what we 're talking about . &nbsp; CRAIGIEThen how do you win ? &nbsp; KIDI 'll show you . He displays his three cards . &nbsp; KIDYou see one of these cards is white on both sides , one is red on both sides , and the other is white on one side , red on the other . &nbsp; CRAIGIEWhat about it ? The Kid lifts a straw hat off a peg on the porch wall . &nbsp; KIDThis . I put the three cards in a hat and shake them up , and then I ask you to draw one card out blind . Put it face down on the table so neither of us can see the bottom side . Craigie does as instructed . The ensuing dialogue assumes the card he picks is red on top ; if it 's white the words " red " and " white " will be reversed in the dialogue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-white card , right . So the card you 've picked is one of two  --  the all-red or the red-and-white . One out of two is an even chance , an even-money proposition . Right  --  you follow me ?  --  67  --  &nbsp; CRAIGIEI think so . &nbsp; KIDSo if I said I 'll bet you a dollar to seventy-five cents the other side of that card is red , you 'd take the bet would n't you ? &nbsp; CRAIGIESeems like . Yeah . &nbsp; KIDAnd that answer makes you a sucker . Because the odds are two to one , the other side of that card is red , and I ought to be offering you a dollar to fifty cents instead of seventy-five . &nbsp; CRAIGIEBut if there are just the two possibilities . &nbsp; KIDThere are three possibilities . ( indicating card on table ) That can be the red side of the red-and-white card , or it can be either side of the all-red card . In two cases out of three the other side is red . And I 'd win the bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . &nbsp; CRAIGIE ( dubiously ) You would ? &nbsp; KIDSure . It 's obvious when I explain it , is n't it ? &nbsp; CRAIGIEReckon so . Except if there 's only two things that the bottom side can be , red or white  --   --  68  --  &nbsp; KIDTake my word for it  --  the odds are two to one . And knowing that is the difference between your gambling man and your sucker . Not who gets the better cards but who knows what the proper odds are . In a poker game there can be a million different situations , each with a different set of odds to figure . The man who ends up winners is the man who knows when to bet and how much . . . . . &nbsp; CRAIGIEThe sucker is still took advantage of , is n't he ? The gambler knows something he do n't know . &nbsp; KIDSure  --  like if you grow better corn or raise a cow that gives more milk than the other guy 's .

Whatever your line is , the one who wins out is the one who knows his job better . &nbsp; CRAIGIESeems like there should be something else to it  - -  -  &nbsp; KIDThere is  - -  -  Making the man you 're playing against think he 's got the best hand  --  and making him pay to find out .

By the time they are through with this process ; The Kid has found three decks he is n't satisfied with , and Lancy two .

Then he begins to deal in his magnificently precise way , pitching each card so that it comes to a stop six inches in front of the player 's money and in clear view of everyone at the table . 114 CLOSE SHOT - SHOOTER 'S HANDS With Sokal in b.g . It is notable that as The Shooter completes dealing hole cards and switches to the first up card , there is no visible difference in the motion of his hands .

He awakens in considerable confusion . Melba is amused by his difficulty in adjusting to his circumstances . &nbsp; MELBAIt 's really only about twenty-five to four . You can stay right where you are . &nbsp; THE KIDI do n't want you to think I 'm getting too personal , but you mind telling me how the hell you come to be here ? &nbsp; MELBAYou mean you do n't remember last night ?

Schlaegel staked him for three years . He has his hooks so deep in Shooter Man , he 'll take out his liver when he pulls them out . The Kid stops shaving and looks at her . &nbsp; THE KIDYou asking me to go along with the fix ? &nbsp; MELBAI 'm asking you to consider whether your ego is worth destroying another man 's whole life . &nbsp; THE KIDYou 're still working for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; MELBAWhat kind of switch is this ?

The Kid , in the bathroom in f.g. , is similarly frozen in his tracks . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - CHRISTIAN IN F.G . The scene as it looks to Christian is circumstantially incriminating . CAMERA MOVES with her gaze from The Kid to the one mussed bed , to Melba . The faces and the silence of the two people are even more incriminating than the circumstances . &nbsp; CHRISTIANHello , Kid . Hello , Melba. ( a pause ) You said wait home ' til you let me know . &nbsp; THE KIDYeah , that 's what I said . We took a break in the game to catch some sleep . Shooter sent his woman up here to wake me up . &nbsp; MELBAYeah , I woke him up . &nbsp; CHRISTIANIt do n't take much . &nbsp; MELBANo , I did n't find it any trouble .

Maybe I 'll take it over later on tonight . &nbsp; THE KIDHow 's your Mama and Papa ? &nbsp; CHRISTIANFine . How 's the game going ? The Kid fastens his trousers and returns to the basin to give his face a last few strokes with the razor and wash off the soap . &nbsp; THE KIDIt 's come to be just me and Lancey . He comes back into the bedroom to finish dressing . As his movement brings him fairly close to Christian , he realizes he has n't kissed her , and repairs the omission before putting his shirt on . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; THE KIDI got my mind on the cards .  --  110  --  &nbsp; CHRISTIANI know .

I mean if I 'm any use to you at all , this is when it 's most important . To The Kid preoccupied by the game and the fix , feeling both affection and guilt . The idea that she can be any use to him against Lancey is one he ca n't grasp . &nbsp; THE KIDI 'm glad you came , Christian . You got as much right here as anybody .

Old bones need a little more time to loosen up . &nbsp; THE KID ( meaning it ) Listen , I think it is amazing you 've been able to keep going this long .
