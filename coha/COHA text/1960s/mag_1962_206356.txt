For 13 years , audiences attending the weekly concerts of the Boston Symphony had stared at the unruly , silvering thatch of Conductor Charles Munch ; for 25 years before that , the thatch had been that of Conductor Serge Koussevitzky . Last week , when the Boston appeared at Manhattan 's new Philharmonic Hall , the man on the podium was Erich Leinsdorf-thatchless and in impeccable control of his orchestra . Few who listened doubted that one of the most distinguished eras in the orchestra 's history had begun . <P> Serge Koussevitzky played on the Boston with Slavic ardor , kindling it to its best efforts in Russian works or in the epic grandeurs of Beethoven and Sibelius . Charles Munch tuned its voice to the French composers , infusing it with a certain Gallic grace . Leinsdorf , 50 , is Viennese-born but internationally bred , and he will presumably make the Boston speak a more international tongue-well-modulated , clear and precise . Although a great orchestra does not change its accent overnight , the Boston played with wonderful clarity and precision last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The orchestra was installed on risers introduced by Leinsdorf to get a better integrated sound , and it was apparent from front row to rear that the men were emotionally " up " as well-for their new conductor as much as for the new hall . <P> Controlled Nostalgia . There was scant surprise in Boston when Leinsdorf was appointed Munch 's successor ; he had already made an excellent impression on both orchestra and public in guest appearances . If there was surprise elsewhere , it was only that he would be willing to give up the opera conducting that has been such an important part of his career . But despite the fact that he had started in opera-first at Salzburg , later at the Metropolitan Opera , to which he was invited in 1937-Leinsdorf found when the Boston invitation came that " my nostalgia for opera is well controlled . " <P> Control , in fact , has always been a Leinsdorf hallmark-and it has continued to be in the few months since he moved with his wife and five children to a Boston suburb . A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he has so far announced no drastic new programming plans , has even declined to announce all the programs for this season ( " I would like to retain the woman 's privilege of changing my mind " ) . He would like the Boston at Tanglewood to commission and play more works for small groups-for the very practical reason that " more and more far-out composers are writing for small groups now and not for the orchestra at all . " <P> " Quite a Band . " Leinsdorf 's extraordinarily rapid ability to assimilate new scores has already amazed his orchestra : a week before he had to lead the Boston through Samuel Barber 's intricate new Piano Concerto ( see above ) , he had not received a complete score , a hazard he dismissed as being part of " musical tradition . " Just before leading the orchestra in Philharmonic Hall , Leinsdorf conducted Walter Piston 's Symphony No. 7 in Boston , rehearsing it for the first time purely from memory . Said an astounded Piston : " I was n't prepared for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
