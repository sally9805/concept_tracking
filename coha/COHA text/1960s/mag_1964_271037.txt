Sculpture must defy gravity , says Alberto Collie , and by using magnets he performs feats of levitation with objects made of aluminum , copper and magnesium . Though Collie 's magnetized sculptures do not soar with full air borne freedom , they do hover and float* above their pedestals , attached by almost imperceptible nylon strings . The effect is playful and magical-rather like Collie himself , who combines the hot-eyed zeal of a young Merlin with the twinkle-eyed grin of a boy with a toy . Collie , 25 , calls his works spatial-absolutes : spatial because they are floating in space , absolute because " the true essence of a shape , its 100% value " can be fully experienced and appreciated only when it is lifted from its base . <P> Two sculptural shapes dominate Collie 's show at Manhattan 's Nordness Gallery . One is a tilted disk that looks like a model of a flying saucer . Such disks jiggle at a fingertip touch , but may weigh as much as 13 Ibs. - as a thief discovered when he tried to whisk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it drop with a clang . The second , also a space-age motif , resembles the hollow cone of a missile . Inside , visible from both ends , are two metallic spheres , one hanging down like a tiny bathysphere on its nylon thread , and by its magnet attracting the magnet in another sphere that levitates upward , tethered by a thread . Each open end of the sculpture gives out a sound like a giant sea shell humming with the rhythm of breakers . If the viewer steps back a few paces , the interior spheres look like twin , lightless moons haunting the barren landscape of a science-fiction planet . <P> Collie 's spatial-absolutes represent a marriage of technology and art , but science is clearly the stronger partner . Yet Collie insists that he is no technological faddist catering to a novelty-hungry art public that is ready to pay $1,000 to $3,500 for his floating sculpture . In his obsession with simplicity and freedom of form , he argues that his shapes " derive from Brancusi . If he were alive today , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swim . He simply lacked the technology that we have today . His work implies flight . " Collie promises to fly even higher in his next show : no strings . <P> <P> * Using the principle that identical magnetic poles ( two norths or two souths ) repel each other . Collie embeds light , powerful ceramic magnets in the floating and fixed elements of his sculptures , which are themselves made of light , nonmagnetic metals .
