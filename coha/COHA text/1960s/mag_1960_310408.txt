To Samuel I. Newhouse , 65 , the little-known press lord whose 14 daily newspapers form the nation 's fastest-growing newspaper chain , anything less than absolute possession of a paper is unthinkable . Sometimes newspapers resist his all-consuming appetite : it took him six years , from 1945 to 1951 , to swallow the Jersey City Jersey Journal , and he is still trying diligently to enlarge the 15% bite he took in the Denver Post last June. * Right after Denver , hungry Sam Newhouse invited himself to a newspaper feast in Springfield , Mass . But by last week his New England dinner was biting back . <P> " Inglorious End . " Newhouse paid some $4,000,000 for what will eventually be a controlling 85% of Springfield 's three papers , the morning Union ( circ. 81,000 ) , the evening News ( 100,000 ) and the Sunday Republican ( 112,000 ) . The papers are the succulent descendants of a family empire founded in 1824 by Samuel Bowles . Newhouse 's buy included possession rights to a 45% stock holding that belonged to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers ' eccentric last dynastic proprietor , who died in 1952 . But until 1967. voting rights to that 45% are held , by a voting trust controlled by trustees of the papers ' pension funds . ( Bowles , though he fought unions , was a paternalistic employer who wanted his own employees to have a big stake in their paper . ) Thus , along with another 15% actually owned by the pension fund , the trustees ( all of them staff members ) are in control . <P> No sooner did Newhouse start to move in than the trustee-directed papers began glowering at the man who presumably meant to eat them up . Cried the Union and the News in front-page editorials : " The work and pride of four generations is at an inglorious end . " When Newhouse asked to see the company books , Treasurer Sidney Cook , 56 , spokesman for the current management , not only refused but barred him from the plant . <P> " Just as Stubborn . " Confronted with such stern resistance , Newhouse has sued in U.S. District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He does not deny a consuming curiosity about the papers ' pension fund , which finances employee benefits unparalleled in the U.S. press . A Springfield newspaper employee of 30 years can retire at 60 at full pay for life . To support such generosity , Newhouse says , the fund has assets in excess of $17 million . <P> " I do not want to impair the pension rights of any present employee , " says Newhouse , " but I want the profits hereafter to be used for the improvement of the physical plant and of the newspapers themselves . " As far as Custodian Cook is concerned , Newhouse can whistle somewhere else for a meal-at least until 1967 . Said Cook last week : " Newhouse has met a bunch of New England Yankees up here who are just as stubborn as he is . " <P> *The Portland Oregonian , which is Newhouse-owned , has been struck by the American Newspaper Guild and printing-trades unions , along with the rival evening Oregon Journal , since Nov. 10 , 1959 . Both have lost heavily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newhouse , 41 , Samuel Newhouse 's cousin and business manager of the morning Oregonian , was wounded in the thigh by an unidentified assailant who fired a shotgun through a basement window .
