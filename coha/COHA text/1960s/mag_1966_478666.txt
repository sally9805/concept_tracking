tremendous amount of ingenuity , discretion , and humor has gone into making this introductory exhibit for the young , and I know few adults who consider themselves sophisticated in the graphic arts who would n't benefit from an hour in it . Having had my sights realigned , I went from there back to the Whitney . It was a bright autumn Monday morning and the culturettes had deserted their hives and were buzzing like bees around the new cultural bouquet . If the building has a brutish look on the outside ( in a short time , I expect , its now strange aspect will become pleasingly familiar ) it is as agreeable a gallery within as I can remember ever having visited . I did as a guard suggested , and took the elevator to the fourth floor and found myself in a gallery that was at once spacious , light , and beckoning , and it flowed into other smaller areas with inviting ease . None of the walls are permanent and the exhibition areas have been planned with elegant respect for the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening exhibition , a remarkable overview of American painting and sculpture , gives way on November 28 to a group of works 2 . Shakers " Williamsburg , " a historian said to me recently , " is always going to look as though it had been built in the 1930s . In fact it is going to look more and more that way as time goes on . " I asked him to explain . " It is a 1930s concept of eighteenth-century architecture , " he said . " It emphasizes broad , simple planes when in fact the eighteenth century was usually fussy and cluttered . " It is true , of course , that even the most meticulous reconstructions , reproductions , or outright forgeries of ancient styles of art ? whether architecture or painting or sculpture ? eventually look like the time in which they are reproduced and not the time they are imitating and are meant to look like . It is one reason why forgeries made in one 's own time , and therefore in one 's own manner of seeing the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spot for what they are .

I suggest that you avoid Saturday and Sunday if you can get there on any other day . A friend who tried to get in on Sunday said , " We had to give up . There was such a crowd around the outside of the place , you 'd have thought there had been an accident . " As I walked duwn from floor to floor looking at the exhibits on each , I was reminded of what the earphone at the Junior Museum had told me about looking at paintings . It was something to the effect that a picture is an ultimate statement and that nothing anyone says about it alters it and that the only way to understand it and what it says is to look and look and look at it . The earphone said it better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitney Museum and its architect understand . Whatever the building may say outside , the works of art speak entirely for themselves and without hindrance inside . Except , that is , when the people nutshout the pictures , which is not likely to happen except on opening night . teenth-century copies of Gothic palaces on the Grand Canal in Venice , and there is no question that Carcassonne looks like a nineteenth-century architect 's romantic notion of a medieval walled city . It might have been designed by the novelist Walter Scott rather than reconstructed by the architect Viollet-le-Duc , a man of sound principles and one of the fathers of modern architectural thought . But , though he fancied himself an archaeologist , he was a creature of a romantic era , and it shows . My conversation with the historian mentioned above , who has written extensively on the arts of our earliest years , came about because 1 had recently spent several days looking at an attempt to preserve and reconstruct a community which had thrived in the past but had died . It was the Shaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prim in a cheerful and tidy bucolic setting approached by winding roadsover rolling hills . In its way this community is a model for preserving the social history of America , though there is no method , it seems , of avoiding in small ways the trap that Williamsburg fell into headlong . If you should go looking for the Hancock Shaker Village in the Berkshires you will find several diversions which may prevent your getting there at all . One is a sign to a Shaker Museum , tempting but not Hancock . The other is a Shaker village in Mt . Lebanon , New York , just a few miles from Hancock . I went there late last September and found it " closed for the season , " peered through the windows of some of the clapboard buildings , and , if I had n't happened on a man walking along the dirt road which leads into it , and of whom I inquired , I would have thought I 'd got to the right place at the wrong time and given up , He directed me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different community indeed . The main road , Route 20 , from Pittsfield , Massachusetts , to Albany , New York , runs right through it . Once there were several Shaker communities scattered around the Berkshire Hills . Hancock was not the first of them ; before its establishment in 1790 there had been two others , the one at Mt . Lebanon , where I had stopped , and one at Watervliet , a town near Albany . The leader of the movement was a dour woman called Mother Ann Lee , once a millhand and a cook in Manchester , England , who came with seven followers to America in 1774 . She was regarded by other Shakers as " the female element of Christ , " and like Him a performer of miracles . The Shakers were an offshoot of the Quakers and they left the Society of Friends to practice the forms and beliefs of a group of French radical Calvinists called Camisards . They became known , for good reasons , as the Shaking Quakers ; their curious rituals consisted of " first meditating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing . " They believed in ( and practiced ) the strictest celibacy ; the men and women lived and worked separately , though they ate together and worshiped in their odd manner together . They believed , since they would not propagate their membership , that their communities could perpetuate themselves by making converts and by adopting orphans , many of whom were brought to them in the days before the establishment of organized orphanages . During the Revolution they were suspected because of their pacifist convictions of being British sympathizers , and in some cases they were persecuted . Mother Ann Lee and some of her tribe spent five months in a Poughkeepsie jail as the result of complaints heard by the Commissioners for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies in the State of New York . The peak of Shaker membership was achieved just before the Civil War when they numbered about six thousand in eighteen communities , the farthest west of which was in Ohio and the farthest south in Kentucky . They were looked upon with a mixture of awe , amusement , disgust , and respect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty . As Dickens remarked in his American Notes they even resisted in horse trading " those thievish tendencies which would seem , for some undiscovered reason , to be almost inseparable from that branch of traffic . " As farmers they were widely known for maintaining their fields and their stock and barns as models of neatness and efficiency ; " world people , " as the Shakers called everyone not of their faith , were willing to pay high prices for the product of their fields and shops because of the quality of their produce and manufacture . Dickens found them " grim " in every respect . When he visited the Shaker Village at Mt . Lebanon he said , " ... we walked into a grim room , where several grim hats were hanging on grim pegs , and the time was grimly told by a grim clock , which uttered every tick with a kind of struggle , as if it broke the grim silence reluctantly , and under protest . " Nathaniel Hawthorne , who lived for a time not far from Hancock in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was a pain and constraint to look at it ; especially as it did not imply any real delicacy or moral purity in the occupants of the house . " He deplored " their utter and systematic lack of privacy ; the close function of man with man , and supervision of one man over another . " And he added , It is hateful and disgusting to think of ; and the sooner the sect is extinct the better . " AFTER HOURS There is nothing hateful now about the Hancock Shaker Village , a bright scattering of yellow and red and white houses and barns , a meetinghouse , a number of buildings which once served as shops for the manufacture of brooms , furniture , medicines , and the packaging of seeds , a large brick " dwelling " which was a dormitory , and an architecturally famous circular stone barn . I parked my car and sought out Eugene M. Dodd , the curator of this " museum , " if it can be called that , and he kindly took me on a tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from teaching architectural history at Berkeley , California , and is an enthusiastic , well-informed , but not unamused partisan of the Shakers . I found him in the kitchen of the brick dwelling talking with a photographer who was working on a picture story , and whom Mr. Dodd turned over to a " volunteer . " The Village is staffed largely by volunteers , mostly women from the neighborhood who believe in the place . He took me first to look at a garden laid out as precisely as a bowling alley , in which the only blossoms were bright orange calendulas . " Over against the fence , " Mr. Dodd said , " is a very old kind of rose . The Shakers grew them to make rosewater for medicinal uses . The calendulas were also grown for medicinal purposes , do n't ask me what. * They grew no flowers for the sake of ornament . " He explained , " This garden is just a very small sample . There used to be I discovered later that this Hower of the marigold family was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Third New International Dictionary ) . acres and acres of herbs and medicinal plants . They packed seeds ; in fact the Shakers had a monopoly on seeds and herbs from about 1800 to 7850 . The place was three thousand acres in its heyday . Now we have about a thousand . " The most interesting building at Hancock and the most famous is the circular stone barn 270 feet around that is in the process of collapsing . I had driven by the barn twenty years or so ago and had stopped in to look at it . In those days it was filled with cows and in sound condition . Later , Mr. Dodd told me , a sanitary law was passed in Massachusetts prohibiting cows from being housed on wooden floors , and the barn was deserted for a complex of three modern ones . The surprising result of this was that in winter ( the temperature there can go to 30 degrees below ) , without the body heat of the cows in the barn , frost got into the masonry and split it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planks and timbers outside . " We 're going to have to tear it down and rebuild the masonry and then put the rest of the structure hack , " Mr. Dodd said . " It was the first round barn in the world , I believe , and it was widely copied . " This is not surprising ; it was a characteristic model of Shaker efficiency , beautiful in its simplicity and the sophistication of its concept and structure . Next to a sentence in his copy of A History of Berkshire County which said , " For simply laying the stone of this building the masons were paid 500 dollars and boarded , " Herman Melville , who lived in nearby Pittsfield , had written the word , " Amazing . " The Shakers , though shrewd , were not pinchpennies . They were gadget-minded , but only when gadgets increased the efficiency of their farms and shops and the maintenance of their buildings . They invented the flat broom , now the household standard , to replace the round gathering of broom straws . They heated their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegantly functional , but as soon as central heating was developed they immediately adopted it and sold the stoves to farmers in the vicinity . " What 's that ? " I asked Mr. Dodd , pointing to a wooden and metal construction a few feet high that sat on the floor of the buildings in which the " sisters " of the community worked . " It 's a self-acting cheese press , " he said . " I have n't yet found out how it worked . " The Shakers were credited with the invention of the common clothespin , the circular saw , a pea sheller , looms for weaving palm leaves into bonnets , and a host of other devices . a great many of which are to be seen in the " Brethren Shop , " the " Sisters Shop , " and the " Brick Dwelling , " neatly displayed in the rooms in which they were originally used . The Shakers were weavers and coopers and tanners and harness makers . They dried fruits and sweet corn and sold applesauce , and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the last century , and they were sold at high prices , as high , indeed , as $17 ! Shaker chairs , like their cupboards , tables , and stools are very light in construction but very strong and completely without ornament . It is not difficult to understand why they are popular in our era of purism in design ( functionalism , if you prefer ) , but it seems odd that they should have been popular in Victorian days when rosewood chairs were little baroque monuments . The same elegant simplicity which characterizes the Shakers ' furniture also marks their buildings ? foursquare , symmetrical , and unadorned by architectural devices . Their sense of proportion surely did not stem from any aesthetic theorizing or desire to provide pleasure ; it came entirely from a sense of fitness and economy and accommodation of structure to practical use . In the " Brick Building , " which was a dormitory , refectory , and meeting room , there is a kind of spaciousness which the exterior scarcely suggests . Women lived on one side of the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided by wide corridors separating the sexes ; there is an airiness about these corridors which belies Dickens ' description of grimness , and the delicately turned banisters on the wide stairs would only seem grim to a lover of clutter like Hawthorne . Not all of the buildings which constitute the Hancock village have been restored , but eventually all of them will be . One of those which is now open for exhibit , the meetinghouse , was moved to Hancock from a Shaker site at Shirley , Massachusetts . It is identical with the original Hancock meetinghouse which was taken down by the Shakers not very many years ago when their numbers no longer warranted its maintenance . In the days of Dickens ' visit and later , New Yorkers used to make overnight excursions up the Hudson by side-wheeler and across country for the purpose of watching the Shakers at their strange religious gyrations . It evidently was quite a show , a sort of rehearsed and disciplined mass ecstasy . Unfortunately , Dickens did not see it for himself , but he wrote ; " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may judge from a print of this ceremony which I have in my possession ; and which . I am informed by those who have visited the chapel , is perfectly accurate ; it must be infinitely grotesque . " Hancock is now the site of a race track , and if it had not been for a threat that the Shaker Village and its rolling acres might be turned over to developers for motels and subdivisions and roadside honky-tonk , the Village might just have disintegrated . The few remaining Shakers who lived and farmed there put the place on the market at an asking price of $250,000 . Mrs. Lawrence K. Miller , the wife of the editor of the Berkshire Eagle , an excellent daily published in Pittsfield , rallied the . support of thirty-three citizens of the vicinity . They convinced the Shakers , as she explained it to me on the telephone after my visit to the Village , " to agree to hear all offers and recommendations " for the property . " They agreed to sell to us for $125,000 , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop in price , she said , " They regarded this as their contribution to the project which is a memorial to the Shakers . " The group organized an educational , nonprofit ( and therefore untaxed ) corporation and borrowed $125,000 from banks , This took place early in 1960 . Since then they have had help from a number of individuals and foundations ( most especially the Stern Family Fund and the late Mrs. Bruce Sanborn , who underwrote moving the meetinghouse ) . The local residents of the area , who used to disAFTER HOURS garage " those crazy Shakers , " now , according to Mrs. Miller , are proud of the Village and come and bring their friends . Last summer there were about 22,000 visitors at the Village , an increase of 40 per cent over the year before . The peak of the Village 's season coincides with the music festival at Tanglewood in Lenox about a dozen miles away . The village costs about $70,000 a year to operate , and admissions at a dollar each ( and less for school groups come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds to reduce the debt at the bank ur paying for the restorations which are far from completed . There are still buildings to be renovated on the site ? the tannery , the icehouse , herb house , and several others , and some to be " acquired , moved , and restored . " Fortunately , there seem to be no plans for trying to build " authentic reproductions " of Shaker buildings , make-believes like so much of the construction at Williamsburg , though it is the hope of the trustees to have someday " a new building in the Shaker manner , to inelude a sales area , offices , auditorium ; improved facilities for visitors ' lunches . . . . " If there is any attempt to have this building serviced by a lot of local folk phonied-up in Shaker bonnets and flat hats , I will personally lead a band of vandals to burn the place down ! One of the remarkable things about the Hancock Shaker Village is its success in escaping a hint of quaintness at the same time that it maintains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasons why the Shaker Village is successful , I believe , is that those who run it recognize that the history of a community is a matter of progress and change and not , as interpreted at Williamsburg , the image of an isolated segment of time , Unlike many communities that are devastated by highways , " progress " is about to give this Village a remarkable break . Mr. Dodd and I stood on the edge of the highway that divides most of the Village from the meetinghouse . " They arc going to put a new Albany-Pittsfield highway over there beyond the edge of our property , beyond the trees , " he said , pointing across the wide meadow . " From the new road you 'll be able to look down on the Village from a , hill . It looks wonderful from there . The Shakers made a great point of having their places look like models of peace and prosperous farming . They hoped to make proselytes that way , and evidently they did . " 1 allowed that I had become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to another sort of revelation . I have long been a staunch supporter of saving significant buildings of the past especially when it is possible to put them to some good use . One use is as museums , of course , though too many museums can become a public burden . It was , I think , to Shaker simplicity with its built-in elegance that I became a convert . Happily this lack of pretentiousness that characterized the Shakers and their Village has also characterized the efforts of those like Mrs. Miller and Mr. Dodd who have turned the Shakers ' private face to the public . It may be , though I can not object to it , that they have taken a historical liberty with Hancock . They have made the community that Dickens found so grim , smile .
