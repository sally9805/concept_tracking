txt FOCUS on Red bloc What 's ahead ? ? The United States this year will try to chart closer trade ties with Eastern Europe . This ' will fly in the teeth of several gales . One of these will be Vietnam . A 1965 effort in the same direction foundered over the American role in the Vietnam war . Rough seas will well up at home , too . Some American public opinion resists wider trade with the Red bloc . But despite these things , and despite continuing strong economic , political , and security ties to the Soviet alliance , nations around the Communist bloc show ever greater interest in American trade . Every bloc member , except Poland  --  which already has it  --  is seeking " most favored nation " trade treatment from the United States . The President can recommend this if he thinks it in the American interest . And he does . He was reportedly ready with a bill last year . But bloc hostility over Vietnam sank the idea . The White House is expected now to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try to steer American public opinion in its direction . Moscow 's quarrel with Peking is churning toward a climax . The two Communist powers have long teetered on the rim of a final split . Peking has always done its part to provoke a schism . But this time it looks as if the Soviets themselves will wield the final blow . Many feel it will fall in March  --  at the Soviet party congress . Last year the Soviets met bilaterally and almost continuously with local party leaders in Eastern Europe . And they made major headway in isolating Peking from the great mainstream of Communist sympathy and support . The scene now is set for the party meeting in March . There the Soviets and their supporters will lay out their position in full . Peking wo n't be formally expelled , since some important parties still balk at that . But , in effect , it will be put just as much outside the pale as Yugoslavia was in 1948 ? by Stalin 's edict . Trends .. . Far from wanting to prevent a Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abetting it . Peking is making it harder and harder for Soviet equipment earmarked for North Vietnam to cross Chinese territory . Persistent reports have the Chinese hindering Soviet rail shipments to Hanoi . Some sources suggest Peking wants to force the Soviets to ship their supplies to North Vietnam by sea . But American warships patrol the Vietnamese coast and sea lanes . Any ocean-bound Soviet aid to Hanoi would run head on into them . And such a direct clash with the United States is just what Moscow wants to avoid . Soviet agriculture is plowing an experimental furrow between American-style large-scale farming and Communist collective methods . The new scheme comes close to establishing private group tenancy for state-owned farms . The tenants are even permitted to hire farm labor for wages . This is a complete break with Soviet tradition . For two years the system has been tried on a limited scale . It has thrived . Under it , collective and state farms are subdivided into large plots . These plots are entrusted , fully equipped , to four or five families , who operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lease sets a price for which a specified amount of grain or other produce is to . be sold to the state or collective parent farm . All production above that , however , can be merchandized freely . This system has trebled yields and more than doubled the earnings of operators . Lessees have turned a profit for both themselves and the state . The trend shows promise of catching on . How and why ... Most of the Kremlin greets Washington 's Vietnam " peace offensive " with a brow knitted in suspicion . The majority in its ruling party Presidium , headed by veteran Party Secretary Mikhail A. Suslov , is convinced it is a smokescreen laid down to cover up an American military and logistic build-up . Consequently , the Kremlin is in a grim but cautious mood . Soviet leaders want to keep out of war . But they are also beholden to international communism . That means that despite looking daggers at Peking , they would have to pitch in on its side if the war were extended to Communist China : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backing military aid to Cambodia and Laos if the United States attacks there .
