The League of Gentlemen ( AFM : Kingsley International ) . Midnight . A manhole cover lifts hesitantly . Not a soul in sight . The cover slides back and out of the hole pops-tickety-snit ! an upper-class Englishman in a dinner jacket . Casually , he shoots his cuffs , slides into his Rolls and glides into this British comedy of misdemeanors-one of the brighter bubbles on the having-wonderful-crime wave ( Ocean 's 11 , Big Deal on Madonna Street , Make Mine Mink , Two-Way Stretch that has recently flooded the movie markets with felonious fun . <P> The gentleman in the manhole ( Jack Hawkins ) turns out to be Lieut . Colonel J.G.N. Hyde , Retd. , of the War Office , an impecunious nob who feels that his capacities for command were never adequately recognized in Her Majesty 's service . To restore both purse and pride he decides to organize a paramilitary operation of his own . Objective : a bank . A riffle through the army 's records discovers seven competent but crooked officers and other ranks ( Nigel Patrick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore , Terrence Alexander , Norman Bird ) - all cashiered out , all out of cash .

" From there out , the picture becomes simultaneously a sort of rollicking Rififi and a hilarious parody of the last skaty-eight milidramas from Blimey . The major organizes his gang as a commando , runs it by " Queen 's Regs , " soon whips together a unit that makes up in morale what it lacks in morality . " England , " says the colonel proudly , " always supplies the right man for the job . Even if it 's the wrong job . " Along the sound track at appropriate moments float snatches of martial music , and after B-day ( " our finest hour " ) , many a brave mug 's eye is misty as he bids his mates farewell . Happily , the well-mannered British police , always ready to give quod pro quid , arrange for a touching reunion of The League-in quarters provided by Her Majesty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawdle , and the blank spots are too often chocked with cheesecake . But the actors , old-line British professionals , are unflappable , and the film is more than merely funny . It demonstrates , more impressively than most recruiting pictures , the advantages of military training in subsequent civilian life .
