I think the 1964 Civil Rights Act may turn out to be one of the best things that ever happened to the South . Now that it 's the law , the race issue will gradually fade into the background ? and that will liberate everyone to begin talking about moving ahead on other things . I think you 're going to really see the South blossom in the next decade . " This is no Northern liberal talking , but a lawyer in McComb , Mississippi , which last summer and fall was racked by bombings and burnings . Today , like the overwhelming majority of Southern communities thus far tested , it is complying , technically at least , with the operative provisions of the 1964 law . In the wake of the agonies in Alabama in March such optimism may seem unwarranted . Attention has shifted away from the South 's response to the 1964 law to the dramatic events of 1965 and the quest for new voting legislation . Significantly , however , the embrace of the civil-rights cause by a Southern President and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted with surprising receptiveness by Southern Senators . Fulbright of Arkansas , Smathers of Florida , Long of Louisiana , and Gore of Tennessee , all of whom had filibustered and voted against the 1964 law ( its voting provision had , ironically , been watered down by Northern liberals ) , indicated they would probably support a new voting measure . The New York Times commented in mid-March , " ... passage of such a bill , which now seems assured , would have been inconceivable only a year or two ago . " Evidently , then , although Selma captured the national spotlight , a crucial though far less heralded change had already taken place in much of the South during the first eight months of the historic 1964 Civil Rights Act . In fact , the Southern compliance with the public-accommodations portion of that law ( the only part that has yet had time to take hold ) has been extraordinary . Burke Marshall , until recently head of the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division , says , " Before the passage of the act , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he . As it turns out , I was conservative . The South 's performance has been remarkable . " Looking back over the South 's near past , the word " remarkable " seems apt . In Birmingham . 1963 was the year the police dogs and fire hoses were used to put down Negro protests . By contrast , 1964 saw the peaceful desegregation of hotels , restaurants , and theaters . In Jackson , Mississippi , 1963 was the year of the Medgar Evers murder , the near-riotous funeral , and Mayor Allen Thompson 's famous " armored tank . " Few would dare publicly thwart the segregationist Citizens ' Council . But in 1964 , the Chamber of Commerce , hacked by the mayor ( an avowed Citizens ' Council member ) openly called for and won general compliance with the new law . In Monroe , Louisiana , in the heart of Klan country , a mayor who owes his election to a massive purge of Negro voters has openly favored and won substantial compliance . Most notably , in McComb , so recently ruled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for law and order but for racial justice . Negroes have been served in previously all-white restaurants . I by no means wish to suggest that discrimination is dead in the South or that the region 's racial problems are behind it . Especially on the voting front , as Selma has so vividly demon-67 strated , much is to be done . Even in public accommodations , Negro poverty and established social patterns make the advances to date more symbolic than real and in small towns and rural areas there is still considerable noncompliance . Although the job-discrimination harrier may be lowered , the serious gap in education will persist . And there are still many towns like Greenwood , Mississippi , locked in a tight segregationist grip , where it is reportedly unhealthy to speak in any but the most defiant terms . But even in such hard-core areas , the question ? at least regarding public accommodations ? is no longer whether compliance will come . but when . Throughout the region the pace of racial progress has quickened strikingly in the past twelve months . Reaction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key to that city 's vastly improved racial climate since the riots of 1963 . Gone is segregationist Eugene " Bull " Connor as the reigning power ; gone , too , the antiquated form of government that gave him his hold . In its place is a more modern mayor-council government , headed by a moderate mayor , Albert Boutwell . Even before the enactment of the Civil Rights Act , Boutwell resolved that Birmingham must meet any new law with a concerted , planned policy . " The real danger of disorder , " he and the Chamber of Commerce jointly warned the city , " will lie in reaching no decision at all . " As Congress debated the civil-rights bill , he conferred with restaurant , theater , and hotel owners . By the time the bill became law in July , most of them had decided to comply . Thirty-six hours later prearranged Negro tests began . Police squad cars were stationed out of sight throughout the city . Everything went smoothly . Three hours after the tests began , all the squad cars had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was not Boutwell 's only contribution . Soon after he took office , all segregation ordinances were expunged from the books . A bi-racial citizens ' advisory committee was appointed ; the people of Birmingham saw on television what would have been unthinkable in the " Bull " Connor reign : Negroes entering City Hall and conferring at the same table with whites about community affairs . A Negro was appointed to the city 's important Planning Commission ; five of twenty members of a new antipoverty committeeand three out of nine on a housing committee are Negroes . As of early March , however , the city had yet to satisfy a long-standing Negro request for representation on the police force . Officials say ( and some Negroes agree ) that this is in part due to unwillingness among Negroes to apply for or accept police jobs . The change in Birmingham had its origins in 1961 . Business leaders ? increasingly aware of the damage done by racial tensions to sister cities such as Montgomery , and of the contrasting prosperity enjoyed by such relatively untroubled cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Significantly , the moving spirit behind this awakening was a prominent realtor , Sidney Smyer , Sr. , who was one of the most active organizers of the Dixiecrat party in 1948 . Today he flatly declares the Civil Rights Act " is largely a reaction to our inaction in not granting Negroes some of the rights to which they were entitled . " Birmingham voters are apparently enthusiastic about this new look in their city . Last December they reaffirmed the new form of government by a two-to-one margin . With this test behind it , the city administration is expected to move even more boldly on race relations . * * * The racial climate in Tuscaloosa , only fifty-eight miles away , is markedly different from Birmingham 's . Headquarters for the United Klans of America , Knights of the Ku Klux Klan , Inc. , and hometown of His Lordship , Imperial Wizard Robert Shelton , Tuscaloosa is one of the few Southern cities its size where a number of restaurants initially defied the new law . Although most have since admitted Negroes , government legal action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . The passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act was followed by days of turmoil : street mobs were on the verge of violence . Film actor Jack Palance , who an angry crowd thought had taken a Negro girl into a movie theater , had to be whisked by police not only out of the theater but out of town , leaving his clothes in his hotel and his car on the street , its tires slashed and bearing a sign , The eyes of the Klan is on you . " An impasse over the hiring of Negro bus drivers has left the city without a transit system since last July . There have been Negro boycotts of downtown stores , and a Negro Philip M. Stern is a free-lance writer in Washington , author of " The Great Treasury Raid " and of the forthcoming photographic book on American poverty , " The Shame of a Nation .

Mayor George van Tassel is a former New Yorker ; there are those who believe he feels he must " out-South the Southerners . " All the city 's hotels and some restaurants have now integrated , and some of the hold-out restaurants give the impression they are only waiting for a court order to desegregate so that they can tell their clientele they had no choice . Yet there is almost no communication between the white and Negro communities , and most observers feel that racial harmony will be a long time coming . * * * Compliance with the law in Monroe , an urban island in northern Louisiana 's toughest Klan country , appears to spring from two factors : the unwillingness of the city to allow racial strife to jeopardize its burgeoning prosperity , and the landslide election of Lyndon Johnson . Unlike Birmingham , Monroe has had no sweeping political change . The present mayor , Jack Howard ? the 1964 state co-chairman of Democrats for Goldwater ? was elected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substantial purge of Negro ( and some white ) voters . Obviously proud of his transformation of a debt-ridden city into one eager to undertake major improvements , Howard says people in Monroe are aware of the troubles racial unrest has brought to other cities . " Monroe is moving and growing and it is n't going to stop . " Compliance in Monroe was not immediate , as it was in Birmingham . Restaurateurs were divided as to what course to follow . None wanted to be the first to serve a Negro . This reluctance was intensified one evening last summer when five hundred apparent Klan sympathizers descended en masse on one restaurant , filling all the seats to prevent any Negro from testing the law . It was a tense and frightening evening for the proprietor , who could not persuade police to send a squad car to investigate the strange sit-ins . From July to November , the policy of hotels and restaurants was to deny service to Negroes . Klan sympathizers roved the streets in cars recog- * Because of a court order , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 13 ( i of the courthouse are now duplicate , side-by-side men 's rooms , paid for by the taxpayers of Tuscaloosa County and open to both races.nizable by their special radio aerials and their stars-and-bars license plates . One downtown store was picketed by Klansmen who heard the lunch counter was to be desegregated ; the store was closed for the day . A monolithic pro-Goldwater sentiment gripped the city . An LBJ bumper sticker was heresy ; one Negro was stopped by police who stripped the sticker from his car and arrested him for drunken driving . Many of the leading Goldwater supporters are said to have actually convinced themselves that their man would be the next President . When Lyndon Johnson won by a record-breaking landslide , " they were shaken , really shaken , " one Monroe man says . " Before the election the Civil Rights Act was the law of the country , but not of Louisiana . After the election , it was clearly our law , too . " A downtown hotel owner , who admitted he might have gone on denying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close election , " reversed his policy . " With that landslide , " he says , " I had no choice . " Apparently the restaurateurs agreed . They met with the Chamber of Commerce and the mayor , and , with the backing of both , let it be known they would accept Negroes . While compliance is widespread in Monroe itself . the same does not hold for the surrounding rural areas . One caf ? in nearby Jonesboro ( population 3,8481 has denied service to Negroes . Another has given them menus listing coffee and Coke for sixty cents instead of the usual dime , and pricing a three-dollar steak at eight dollars . Although the library in Jonesboro was technically desegregated and issued cards to 236 Negroes in one day , the next day the new cardholders found that all the tables and chairs had been removed . But in Monroe itself the atmosphere seems calm . The Klan is less in evidence and is attracting fewer people to its meetings . The attitude in Monroe may have been summed up by Ouachita Parish Sheriff Bailey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're now in the Second Period of Reconstruction . Barry Goldwater was the commanding general of the Second Army of the Confederacy , but he had to surrender at Phoenix . But now it 's all over . We do n't like this law , but we 'll obey it . " * * The story of Jackson , Mississippi , is the story of the waning influence of the Citizens ' Council . In 1964 the following events challenged the Jackson Council : First , on the day after the Civil Rights Act was signed , the Jackson Chamber of Commerce ( which included some Citizens ' Council members ) publicly urged its members to comply . Second , the Council 's best-known member , the mayor himself , who was always to be counted on in the past as a last-ditch fighter against integration , deserted the Citizens ' Council by backing the Chamber and urging compliance with the new law even before it had been tested in the Supreme Court . Third , the school board ignored the Council 's demand that the schools be closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without incident. * Probably the clearest signal of a change in Jackson 's racial and political climate was Mayor Thompson 's reversal . Through the years Thompson has consistently held out against every racial change in Jackson until the final word on the final appeal had been handed down by the courts . In July of 1964 , he could have taken the same stance , pending a Supreme Court ruling . Or he could have remained silent . He did neither , " I knew I was going to have to go through Gethsemane , " he now says , " but I also knew it had to be done . " Although the expected Citizens ' Council wrath descended upon him , apparently Allen Thompson had not misjudged the public mood . When a segregationist city councilman , Tom Marshall , floated a trial balloon for a possible political race against the mayor the response was not encouraging , and Marshall is again a candidate for reelection to his lesser post . " We 're Everybody " McComb , a town of 12,000 , is eighty miles south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many find the greatest hope for other communities still ruled by segregationists . The local newspaper describes the reign of terror that lasted through the summer of 1964 and into the fall : " Negro homes were dynamited . Molotov cocktails were hurled at the homes of a white city official and three other white residents . Three taverns were burned to the ground ; Negro churches were dynamited and bombed . One white man had household ammonia thrown into his face . Individuals were flogged . Gun blasts were fired into homes and businesses . " Both the business leaders and the city officials were silent . The bombers roamed free . The break came when Pike County Sheriff R. R. Warren suggested to Oliver Emmerich , publisher . of the McComb Enterprise-Journal , that reward money , which both city and county hoards had refused to offer , could help bring the terrorists to justice . An editorial appeal brought private contributions of more than $5,000 within forty-eight hours . Emmerich decided the time was ripe . He published a series of front-page editorials and began mobilizing community leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the second meeting the group had grown to twenty ; by the third , to forty . ( " At that point we had to do some winnowing , " one of the original four says , " because we found we had some Klan sympathizers in our midst . " ) Ultimately , a " Statement of Principles " was published over the signatures of 650 McComb citizens , not merely endorsing law and order , but calling for " equal treatment under the law for all citizens , regardless of race , creed , position , or wealth . . . . " The statement transformed McComb . The next day many local hotels , motels , and restaurants were peacefully desegregated . The mayor , an ex-chairman of the county Citizens ' Council who some believed had been " playing along with the racists , " called for orderly behavior during the segregation tests . The bombers have been arrested and placed under suspended sentence ? contingent on there being no further violence , whether by them or by others ? and the bombings have not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems have been solved . Only a few hundred Negroes are registered to vote in the county , and the local registrar says he is unfamiliar with and probably wo n't put into effect the new literacy provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act ( a sixth-grade education is supposed to rule out any literacy test ) . The schools are still wholly segregated ; the " white " and " colored " signs remain on the City Hall drinking fountains ; and the local Rexall drugstore has turned its soda-fountain lunch counter into a private " club , " although as a stranger I was twice served there with no questions asked . Still , a basic change has taken place in McComb . One of the original four men explains it : Before the 650 spoke up , the people behind the bombings considered themselves patriots , heroes , with public opinion behind them -- which is not surprising , because that was the way the politicians had been talking , and no one contradicted them . But now things are turned around . The " thinking people " of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can be against us : we own the land , the businesses ; we 're the em70 AN UNEXPECTED DIVIDEND FOR THE SOUTH ployers , the bankers , the labor leaders ? we 're everybody . Nobody can lick us , so they 're going to join us . Many regard this as McComb 's lesson for other beleaguered Southern towns : the " thinking people " ? starting with just four men and ending up with 650 ? finally found their voice and took control of their community from a handful of segregationists and terrorists . This lesson has not been lost . In early January , a group of influential businessmen and civic leaders from all over Mississippi met in Jackson to explore ways of emulating the McComb experience . * * * Any consideration of the South 's response to the Civil Rights Act would be incomplete if it failed to take into account the many cities of the Middle and Upper South which integrated their public accommodations many months before the law required them to do so . Charlotte , North Carolina , is representative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Savannah , among others , might be placed in a similar category . ) Here , as in Birmingham and Jackson , a combination of business and government leadership brought about peaceful integration of hotels , restaurants , and theaters ? a full year before individual proprietors could claim to be merely obeying the law of the land . Charlotte Negroes have now begun to break into " nontraditional " jobs as store clerks , secretaries , bank tellers ; new industries wish to hire more . But the long years of educational discrimination have left their mark , and qualified Negroes are sometimes more scarce than jobs . Charlotte also is not without considerable racial problems . Negroes are dissatisfied with what they consider token school integration and the continued segregation of teaching staffs . Some feel that the city 's housing and urban renewal policies work to the Negroes ' disadvantage . Yet Charlotte , with an active biracial mayor 's committee of long standing , may have turned a corner . Paying the Piper The returns are not yet all in on the South 's response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the public-accommodations portion ? has yet been felt to any extent . Historians . in fact , may find it ironic that the public-accommodations section was the lightning rod for Southern opposition during last year 's Congressional debate , since its short-term effect on Southern life is likely to be insignificant compared with two other portions of the law that have yet to come into full play . One is the fair-employment section of the law , and although it does not take effect until July 1965. firms in each of the cities I visited had either begun complying or were preparing to do so well ahead of the legal deadline . A survey of companies in McComb , for example , disclosed a general willingness to comply . The McComb Manufacturing Company , a clothing mill , after careful planning with its white employees ( many of them women from ordinarily troublesome outlying rural areas ) has hired Negroes . The transition has gone smoothly . Both the Mississippi Manufacturing Association and the Jackson Chamber of Commerce have held meetings on the question with their members . In Birmingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiring Negro operators , and , perhaps because of the advance consultation , has received pledges of wholehearted cooperation . Both white and Negro leaders agree that the problem is likely to center around finding Negroes for jobs rather than jobs for Negroes . As one white businessman put it , " The Freedom Rides wo n't make a girl a stenographer or a boy a bookkeeper . " James Polk , a young Negro leader in Charlotte , argues that years of barred doors are discouraging Negroes from applying for " nontraditional " jobs . The section of the 1964 law likely to have the most pervasive effect on Southern life ? the one which bars federal funds from racially discriminatory state and local programs ? is just now beginning to come into play . ( It applies to hospitals , colleges , universities , and research centers as well as to public schools . ) Because federal dollars are so ubiquitous , this aspect of the new law offers the greatest lever against discrimination and will he the most difficult for the South to resist. * This became quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being requested to do so , voted to sign the nondiscrimination pledge essential to the continuation of its annual $37 million of school aid ; Georgia and Virginia followed within weeks .

Federal officials feel confident this is likely to be the pattern , a feeling confirmed by a leading McComb citizen who believes even his local school board will comply . " After all , " he says , " he who pays the piper calls the tune ? and Uncle Sam sure has been paying the piper . " Reducing the Risks in general , national Negro leaders have been pleasantly surprised by the South 's pre-Selma reaction to the Civil Rights Act . They seem , in fact , far more impatient with the North than with the South , although as CORE 's James Farmer puts it , " the millennium has not yet come .

" Yet Young sees a change of mind , if not of heart , as the South faces up to its racial problems " more honestly than the North , I think that five years from now , Atlanta will have better race relations than Cleveland , " he says . Roy Wilkins of the NAACP acknowledges that there are still the " sticky areas " of voting , jobs , and schools to be dealt with . But he is impressed and encouraged by the " change of mood and attitude in the South . Just look at the die-hard areas where there has been compliance : Birmingham , Jackson , Montgomery , Mobile , Columbia . In some of those places , the compliance on public accommodations has been spectacular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights Act ? The principal articulated reason is that it is , after all , the law of the land , and must be obeyed regardless of personal feeling . Birmingham lawyer James A. Simpson , for example , has deeply felt convictions that the Negro is inherently inferior to the white ( in part because of what he contends is a smaller cranial capacity ) . But now he believes he has no choice but to advise his clients to comply with the law . Jackson 's Mayor Thompson , whose former prosegregation stance was based on upholding state laws , now defends his call for compliance as merely " upholding they law " ? this time a federal law . In Monroe , Sheriff ' Bailey Grant , who describes Negroes as one-time wearers of breech cloths and rhinos ' teeth , says , " Look , we do n't like to pay income taxes , but we do . The same goes for this law . " On a more practical level , a Monroe restaurateur answered a complaining white customer , " The first time a Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come and help me throw him out ? and you can go to jail with me , too . " He found no taker . The defense of complying with " the law of the land " has reduced both the risk and the loneliness involved in dropping the color line . Businesses covered by the law are all on an equal footing ; none need risk lone action . Individuals , too , have found comfort in knowing they are not alone . A Charlotte minister compared McComb in 1964 with Grenada , Mississippi , during the Ole Miss riots in Oxford two years earlier . At that time , " he recalls , " a minister friend of mine in Grenada had exactly four people in the town he could even speak to ? and that included his wife . What a difference to be in McComb and know there are 649 other people with you . " Whole communities seem to have drawn strength from the successful integration of other cities . One Jackson businessman believes his city 's experience paved the way in Laurel , Biloxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned from one another . Birmingham studied what Atlanta and Dallas had done ; the Chamber of Commerce of Orlando , Florida , called Charlotte , North Carolina , for guidance ; and at least two other Mississippi communities have sent observers to McComb . Burke Marshall calls this a " snowballing effect that could have gone either way . But this time it was compliance that became contagious , just as defiance was after the 1954 school decision . " This contrast may suggest that today 's use of the " law-of-the-land " argument is a surface manifestation of a deeper change in the South . " After all , " Barry Golden observes from a parlor rocking chair in Charlotte , " the Supreme Court school decision was the ' law of the land ' too , and Southern politicians could have urged obedience then , as they 're doing now . But they did n't . " One can sense two changes below the surface between 1954 and 1964 . One is a resignation to the inevitable , springing from the ultimate failure of every single device of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quo . The other is a less articulated awareness that resistance is not only futile , it is harmful . Hence the chain reaction has had both a positive and a negative side . Birmingham not only looked enviously at Atlanta , ? but with apprehension at Mobile . Little Rock , and St. Augustine , where racial turmoil had brought 72 AN UNEXPECTED DIVIDEND FOR THE SOUTH not only terror , but economic adversity as well . A visitor to the South eight months after passage of the Civil Rights Act comes away impressed with the gains already made , sanguine about the future , but nonetheless deeply aware of the fact that the life of the average Southern Negro has been very little affected . Patronage of downtown restaurants , theaters , and hotels has largely been confined to test " teams " and is beyond both the experience and the means of most Negroes . Years of second-class citizenship have made him slow to assert some of the rights he has won . ( I saw a city bus rolling through downtown Monroe , its only passengers eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) In many counties he is still denied the vote , still discouraged by the same barriers to job and education that existed before the 1964 act was signed . Any significant lowering of these barriers is likely to be more effectively achieved through the Administration 's antipoverty program , its various manpower training programs , and its proposed education program than through the 1964 Civil Rights Act itself . A historian , however , looking back twenty-five years from now at the past ten months . may perhaps mark them as a time when the Southern business community finally found its voice and began wresting control from defiant politicians . " Before last July , " one Jackson businessman says , " most active businessmen stayed out of the race question . We let the politicians run the show ? they or a handful of rabble-rousers . " But now that the businessmen are speaking up , local politicians in many places are either joining or following them . High-water Point ? Without wishing to be overly sanguine , I also believe the historian may note the period immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-water point of the race issue as dominator and inhibitor of Southern economics and politics . Already there are signs that the South 's new mood is paying economic dividends . Eastern Airlines told Charlotte businessmen , for example , that the city 's successful integration in 1963 helped influence the location of a computerized reservation center in Charlotte . And in Jackson , where a national concern had previously decided against a plant expansion , the city 's present racial tranquillity has caused the firm to take a second look . " This shows , " a Jackson manufacturer said not long ago , " how we have been holding ourselves down with our old traditions . " This is what the McComb lawyer had in mind when he spoke of the Civil Rights Act as " liberating " the South . " We 've denied ourselves so much in the past . " he says . " When we would start to build a new hospital , there would be a big hassle over whether it would be open or closed to Negroes . So we 'd end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has to be open . So we 'll go ahead and build it . " Or , as Harry Golden puts it , " When you draw a line and tell people not to cross it , you spend your life watching the line . " There are signs , too , of a gradual freeing of both Southern politicians and the Southern electorate from their enslavement to the litany of race ? signs such as Jackson Mayor Thompson 's desertion of the Citizens ' Council and the failure of a segregationist to launch a countermovement ; the recently reaffirmed defeat of " Bull " Cannot- in Birmingham and , more notably , the lack of a local rabble-rouser to take his place ; the absence of the race issue in Charlotte 's last mayoralty campaign , in spite of serious racial disorders elsewhere in the state at the time . Some of this is due to increased Negro voting in all but the hard-core areas ? a process that will undoubtedly be accelerated by an effective new voting law . A twenty-year journalistic veteran in the deep South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole new breed of Southern politician . For a century , racists have been inflicting on the South these fourth- and fifth-rate hacks who could only get into office because they could demagogue on the race issue . " At first I was very leery when President Kennedy put in the civil-rights bill in 1963 . I thought it would tear the South apart again . But as I look at it now , it i% as a stroke of genius . Nothing else could have freed the South from its preoccupation with the race issue ? nothing but a law that everyone would feel they had to obey . " Even though Selma and its aftermath have disturbed the relatively placid period following the enactment of the 196-1 act , this enthusiasm is still shared by LeRoy Collins , the former Florida Governor who now heads the federal government 's Community Relations Service , charged with helping smooth race relations in troubled communities .
