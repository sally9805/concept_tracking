It will mean higher prices for bread , French wine , oil and gasoline , cotton dresses , Argentine beef , butter , wool , cheese and vacations over-seas , Just how much more all this will cost remains to be seen . But the general assumption is that the cost of living may rise at least 3 per cent for the Average Briton , The goods produced at home  --  milk , for example ? will not go up . And if a consumer manages to get through the week buying all Britishproduced goods , he will probably be getting just as much as he did for his old pound . But the chances of avoiding anything imported are slim . Take bread , for example . About 3 per cent of its cost represents North American wheat . The estimate is that as a result its price could rip somewhat less ? than a penny for a loaf , which now costs about cents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the United States ) will go up about 4 per cent ; gasoline and oil as high as the amount of the devaluation , 14.3 per cent , and beef from Argentina by the same amount .

The British Broadcasting Corporation last night , for example , , interviewed 10 people on the streets of London , none of whom could explain what devatuAtion would mean . Whether that was representative or not , the impact will be felt soon . Small crowds had gathered at 10 Downing Street all through the day today as Prime Minister Wilson met with his advisers . Most were silent . Others shouted : " Wilson out ! " The manager of a downtown theater said he was disgusted by the action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm emigrating .
