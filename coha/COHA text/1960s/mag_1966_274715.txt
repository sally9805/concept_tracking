The Beat Generation of writing is forget it . Some curly new hair is coming up in Beardsville . The new boys still have n't found a name-The Camp Crowd ? The Hallucinogeneration ? - but they have brattishly proclaimed their principal preoccupations : LSD , pot , the Spirit of Berkeley , californication , and not fighting in Viet Nam . While there are only a few of them , they have begun to produce a noisy literature that confesses its mongrel origin in the cult of hip , the theater of the absurd , the works of Jack Kerouac , the pop art movement and some of the more deplorable traditions of the college humor magazine . <P> The masterpiece of the new manner , a book called simply V. ( TIME , March 15 , 1963 ) , is an epic of planned irrelevance that Joyce would surely have respected . Unhappily , its successors have contributed little more than absurdity to the novel of the absurd . Constructed on the principle of free dissociation , they occasionally come off as hip happenings . More often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they simply degenerate into glossolaliac gibberish . <P> BEEN DOWN SO LONG IT LOOKS LIKE UP TO ME , by Richard Faria ( Random House ; 329 pages ; $5.95 ) , is a pot-and-peyote boiler about a supercooled campus hippie named Gnossos Pappadopoulis . Written by the brother-in-law of Folk Singer Joan Baez , the book is fashionably half-coherent , a collection of Kerouacky kinks . Gnossos turns on four times a day , calls girls " man , " says " dig " a great deal , makes like the Green Hornet with cringing officials at Mentor University , rucksacks triumphantly to Mexico , Las Vegas and Cuba , knows how to hot-wire a car , plays Corelli on his phonograph , and even wins acceptance as an equal by Negro bartenders . Most readers will be more discriminating . Kerouac had a likable knack for making his zaps and zowies add up , against all probability , to a goofy , over-the-wall-and-gone exuberance . Faria creates nothing more than a pot mood : airless self-satisfaction . He writes like a campus popoff who read a book about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
