txt An unidentified New York City Commissioner shared with former Water Commissioner James L. Marcus and with Herbert Itkin a $10,000 payoff that was " very close to a bribe , " according to Mr. Itkin 's testimony in Federal Court yesterday . Mr. Itkin , a ** Manhattan labor lawyer who last week testified to being an informer , for the Federal Bureau of Investigation , did not mention the second Commissioner 's name . ' He did add , however , that The man had received $2,500 and Marcus and Mr. Itkin $7,500 . : James . La Rossa , a defense lawyer ? in the Federal kickback conspiracy trial against Antonio ( Tony Ducks ) Corallo and four other defendants , did not ask Mr. Itkin for the Commissioner 's name during the crossexamination that elicited the accusation . Questioned on Payoff There was no indication from Mr. Itkin 's testimony whether the second commissioner he accused of taking . a payoff was still a member of Mayor Lindsay 's administration . Mr. La Rossa asked if Mr. Itkin had ever taken a bribe from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was very close to a bribe , " Mr. Itkin replied . " It was for a New Yorlc  --  City Commissioner . " When Mr. La Rossa.asked if it was Marcus , the answer Was : " No ; it was not . " Mr. Itkin 's " appearance as ' a key witness for . the . Government in the current kickback case ended at 2:30 P.M. yesterday after almost three days of direct and cross-examination . His testimony included the mention of businessmen , politicians and companies that allegedly took , paid or tried to solicit bribes in " deals " in which Mr. Itkin had a part . In his testimony yesterday , Mr. Itkin again mentioned numerous names , but many of them were either last names only or full names without further description . Most of those mentioned by Mr. Itkin yesterday were , he said , involved in " fraudulent " deals whereby escrow accounts over which Mr. Itkin had control were used for payoffs to officials of the Teamsters Un- ion Pension and Welfare Fund of the Central States . Mr. Itkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgages from the pension fund to getthem . He said the escrow accounts were merely a device demanded by those seeking mortgages " to protect corporate interests " by having something down in writing . Mr. Itkin admitted that he had violated many escrow accounts by mingling the money in them with his own funds . But , he said , " in truth they were ' not escrow accounts or agreements , but a fraudulent device on the part of all the parties . " Mr. Itkin is under indictment in New York County , for violating several thousand dollars worth of escrow accounts . He is charged with grand larceny in the cases involved . He said that among those with escrow accounts were the Arrowbrook Country Club , the Louis B. Hirsh Memorial Fund , a Dr. Gitler , ? who , Mr. Itkin said , paid him $20,000 , and Vernon Shipp , of Phoenix , Ariz. , Who paid about $25,000 to " pay off the teamsters . " Payment Made He also testified that a payment of $60,000 had been made to him by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , the rest having been " used for purposes intended . " It- was knot explained who " Mrs. Freulingheisen " was . Her name was - not spelled for the court , and her place of residence was not given . Nor were the " purposes intended " in any way described . Mr. Itkin , under cross-examination , disclaimed any guilt for Violating the ' escrow accounts on the grounds , " I was helping my Government " to uncover illegal practices . He said he reported all of the escrow account deals with the teamsters to the F.B.I .  --  but some of them long after the fact . I At one point in his testimony , Mr. Itkin was asked ' about land and contract deals he had previously testified to ( having arranged in the Dominican Republic . As he had throughout much of his time on the stand , he let drop a tantalizing but unexplained 1piece of information in a soft , confidential voice . " I was working for another agency of the Government in Santo Domingo , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Itkin , when asked for the name of a Government agent with whom he had spoken to report on one of his many trips abroad , turned to Judge Edward Weinfeld and asked , with a pained expression on his dark face : " I understand I 'm not supposed to answer questions like that for reasons of national security . " Judge Weinfeld sustained a Government objection to the question . When a defense attorney subsequently asked Mr. Itkin what kind of " cover story " he used to protect his identity as an informer from some of his associates , he said he could answer only in a general way . There was no mention by either Mr. Itkin or lawyers of any Government agency , other than the F.B.I. , for which Mr. Itkin said he worked . Normally , however , the Central Intelligence Agency is responsible for most Government investigative activity abroad . Much of the cross-examination of Mr. Itkin yesterday was marked by defense lawyers ' efforts to tear down his credibility and show moral turpitude . There was also a strong attempt by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an F.B.I . informer ? before or after he committed the various crimes to which he has readily admitted . Mr. Itkin reiterated much of last week 's testimony concerning his relationship to Marcus in the alleged $40,000 kickback on the Jerome Park Reservoir contract . Marcus awarded the contract in the fall of 1966 to S. T. Grand , Inc. , a concern owned by Henry Fried , a contractor from Mount Kisco , N. Y. It is charged in a one-count Federal indictment handed up last December that Mr. Fried and his company , both defendants in the current trial , paid 5 per cent of the emergency contract 's $840,000 total to , Mr. Itkin , Marcus , Corallo , and Daniel J. Motto , a union official . Charles Rappaport , a former law partner of Mr. Itkin 's , was also charged in the alleged conspiracy . The Government contends , that interstate telephone calls were made from New York to Mr. Motto 's home in Greenwich , Conn. , in furtherance of the conspiracy . Thus , the Government contends , the alleged bribery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state crime , comes under Federal Ijurisdiction because an interstate facility was used in the conspiracy in violation of the Federal antiracketeering statute . Cases Severed Both Mr. Itkin and Marcus have been severed from the current case  --  Marcus because he pleaded guilty at the opening of the week-old trial , and Mr. Itkin because , he said yesterday , he expects the Government to drop the charges against him . Throughout his testimony Mr. Itkin insisted that , although he was involved in all of the various deals and crimes he had described , he did not feel " guilty in my heart " because he always intended to tell the F. B. I. about what he was doing . He testified , however , that there were several times when he was tardy about reporting deals to F. B. I. agents , whom he said he saw " at least three times a week . " ? Besides giving information to the F.B.I. , Mr. Itkin said yesterday , he had " told about crimes " to New York ' District Attorney Frank S. Hogan 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not Mr. Itkin talked to Mr. Hogan 's office before or after he was indicted . Asked by a defense lawyer whether he , expected immunity from New York County in cases in which he was involved , he said that he had asked his lawyer to try to make some arrangement . But prior to the indictment , he said , no immunity in state cases had been promised him . Marcus testified last week that , he intended to plead guilty in at least three charges he expected to be indicted for in New York County  --  two felonies , one of which is grand larceny , and a misdemeanor . He was told , Marcus said , that he could get a seven-year sentence and a $10,000 fine in the state courts . Four defense lawyers tried hard to shake Mr. Itkin 's composure during the day , but Mr. Itkin repeatedly answered " yes or no " questions with rambling statements , screwed up his face into looks of scornful disbelief so that his interrogator did not understand his replies , or simply said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Calm Broken Briefly Only once ? did Mr. Itkin appear less than icily calm . He was asked by Mr. La Rossa , who represents Mr. Motto , if he knew someone by the name of Christopher Ballard . A. Yes , I do . Q. Is he the son of . Joanne Bayes Ballard ? A. That 's right . Q. Are you the trustee of a trust fund ? A. Yes , I was . Q. Was there $6,000 involved ? A. Yes . A moment later ; after testifying he invested the trust monies : Q. Were there any funds in the trust agreement after you invested it ? A. No . I lost the money . Q. Who was Christopher Ballard ? A. It was a little boy . I represented the woman in a divorce case . I retained the money , I invested it badly , and since that time , rather than tell her that the money was lost , I have been paying it back to her . He said he had invested the money in bowling alleys run by one Emil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid off the teamsters in fraudulent " It was a reckless investment , " Mr. Itkin said . " I felt obligated to return the money to Joanne Bayes , and have'been over the years . " It is expected that the Government will close its case today , and that among the first witnesses for the defense will be Mr. Fried , testifying on his own behalf .
