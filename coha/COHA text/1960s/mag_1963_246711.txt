" The revolution must go on ! " cried Strongman Ahmed ben Bella . Countered Colonel Mohand Ou el Hadj : " The time has come to give the right of speech to all revolutionaries . " Thus the first revolt broke out last week against Ben Bella 's year-old regime . To be sure , the motives included provincial pride , poverty and political ambition . But the root cause was Ben Bella 's drive toward absolute power at the expense of his onetime , rebel comrades in Algeria 's struggle for independence . Stronghold of the revolt was fabled Kabylia , a sweep of razor-spined mountains and deep gorges east of Algiers ( see map ) . Populated by 1,000,000 fiercely independent Berbers who call themselves imazighen ( free men ) , Kabylia was overrun by successive invasions of Arabs , Romans , Vandals , Spaniards , Turks , and finally the French - but it has never been totally subdued . No Algerians fought more heroically in the 1954-62 guerrilla war against France ; yet the Kabyles charge that Arab Ben Bella has done little for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the cornerstones of many a promised textile mill . <P> Jeweler in the Rough . Kabylia discontent was tailor-made for a disenchanted native son , Hocine At Ahmed , who shared a French prison with Ben Bella but is now among the several revolutionary " chiefs " who have been elbowed aside by the strongman . A dreamy Marxist , At Ahmed , 37 , opposed Ben Bella 's outlawing the Communist Party last year . Then last June , on the floor of the National Assembly , At Ahmed denounced the government 's arrest of an independent chief and Ben Bella critic , leftist Mohammed Boudiaf . Repairing to his Kabylia village of Michelet , At Ahmed formed a tiny , clandestine party , the Front of Socialist Forces . With hardly any difficulty , the F.S.F. convinced over half the voters in Kabylia to boycott last month 's referendums that rubber-stamped Ben Bella 's one-party constitution and his nomination for President . <P> Among those won over to At Ahmed 's movement was another disgruntled ex-rebel , Colonel Ou el Hadj , 52 , the Kabylia army commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had served as wartime boss of Wilaya III , the Algerian guerrillas ' savagely aggressive Kabylia military zone . Ou el Hadj had become furious with Ben Bella 's army boss and No. 2 man , Colonel Houari Boumedienne , for purging the ex-guerrillas in favor of more obedient officers , many of whom spent the war in exile . <P> At the Forum . The two dissidents launched last week 's crisis at a Sunday rally in the tile-roofed Kabylia capital , Tizi-Ouzou , which they had ringed round with machine guns . In Algeria 's first popular demonstration against Ben Bella , 2,000 turbaned men and shawled women flocked into the town square , unintimidated by a government helicopter that fluttered past overhead . Sharing the platform , At Ahmed and Ou el Hadj proclaimed what began , at least , as a peaceful insurrection . At Ahmed called Ben Bella a " potentate , " charged him with " betraying his comrades " and " destroying the revolution , " added : " If the government wants to change its ways , we are ready to discuss things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this dictatorship .
