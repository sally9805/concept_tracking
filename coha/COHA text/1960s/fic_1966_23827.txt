You Take the Easy Road to Success in Writing A story by John Leggett Ineed some advice . This particular difficulty began last spring with the appearance in my office of my nephew , Otis Badger . Otis lives in Winnetka , a suburb of Chicago , but he had just graduated from the University of California , and I scarcely recognized him . Three or four years ago , when I had last seen him , he was a pink-checked , milk-fed youth who struck me as a rather bland , ineffectual fellow . But the shape of his rebellion was instantly apparent . He wore a gray flannel shirt that looked unfamiliar with the laundry and from his chin there unraveled a straggly little beard . I should have been prepared for this , for he had been preceded by twelve pages of manuscript , a short story describing a party whose scene was the North Beach section of San Francisco . It seemed to me that characterization was below the necessary minimum . The dialogue was so hip as to be totally obscure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly dismal story . He was without a gleam of talent and I felt that the kindest thing was to tell him so . The most extraordinary sense of d  --  j ? vu came over me . The incident which was emerging from my memory took place fifteen years ago , just a week before I was married . I had gone to theoffices of the Macmillan Company , on lower Fifth Avenue , to get the verdict on my first earnest attempt at writing  --  two-thirds of a novel for which I had the highest hopes . It was no less a person than George Brett , the president of the company and an acquaintance of my father-in-law-to-be , who took five minutes of his valuable time to tell me I was late for my appointment and what this disclosed to him about my character . He then proceeded to tell me that the manuscript which I had offered Macmillan 's for publication revealed me to be without any gifts whatsoever . Moreover , if I had any thoughts about a soft job at Macmillan , I could forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me was in an industry where my laziness would not be encouraged , where my muscles would be put to work  --  possibly in a coal mine . He would frame all this in a letter to my prospective father-in-law , who I realized would find it absorbing reading . And , by golly , George Brett did just as he promised . The letter , which I keep pasted inside the cover of a notebook , has always had a tonic effect upon me . This recollection did not suggest any reasons for relenting in my stern advice to Otis . On the contrary , it occurred to me for the first time that he might have some ambitions for a job in pub-50 YOU TAKE THE EASY ROAD TO SUCCESS IN WRITING lishing . As I looked more closely into Otis ' eager brown eyes , it seemed that I detected some envy there . My office is not large , but it is clean and on this warm June afternoon was pleasantly cool . " Look , Otis , " I said . " Let me give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be deceived by appearances . The pay is not high . The work is hard . For the most part it 's one disappointment after another . As William Jovanovich  --  the president of Harcourt , Brace  --  says , what a man needs for publishing is high hopes and a short memory . Otis ? " I asked . " What are the other possibilities ? " " Well , " he replied . " Father wants me to come back to Chicago and go into Badger &; Co . " Badger &; Co. is the family firm , a small but active brokerage on La Salle Street . " Great , " I said . " Just the thing . What splendid opportunity lies before you , and besides it will give you the means and the opportunity to enjoy life . Sometimes I wish I had it to do again . " I glanced significantly at my watch and held out my hand . But Otis did not take his cue . lie was producing from his pocket a page torn from a magazine and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read , " TAKE THE EASY ROAD TO SUCCESS IN WRITING . " Beneath it , was a photograph of a man in tweeds strolling along a pleasant , country lane in company with an agreeable-looking hound . The caption read , " J.C . Pigott photographed on a typical afternoon walking around his estate . It is here he thinks up the ideas for his wonderful stories and books , which often require him to visit such far-flung places as Hong Kong and Paris and which he sells for thousands of dollars . His one rule  --  never to work more than four hours a day . It 's the morning hours for work with the rest of the day kept free for relaxation and the leisure pursuits . " Reading on , I discovered that J. C. Pigott was not only a practitioner of this wonderful life but a member of the faculty at the academy where one prepared for it and whose advertisement I was reading . This was The Celebrity School of Writing and Publishing of Little Silver , New Jersey . Here was a roster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were other names heretofore unknown to me . There were also familiar names . There were authors of wide , though not very recent , reputation . Indeed , one of them I had thought was dead . John Leggett , clean-shaven , a Yale graduate , and a Navy lieutenant in World War H , is a hook editor at Harper &; Row and the author of two novels , the latest called " The Gloucester Branch . " I went on to read about the teaching methods at Celebrity . " We have pooled all our secrets , " the faculty reported , " and put them into textbooks . We have prepared fascinating assignments to give you just the help you 'll need . And our instructors , professional writers themselves , will spend up to two hours in analyzing their results . " " Look at this , " I said . " Note that ' up to two hours . ' Two minutes is what you 'll get . Now , Otis , if you do n't remember another thing I 've told you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Writing can not he taught in a course . 1 have sat in many of the great writing classes in this country  --  Martha Foley 's at Columbia , Wallace Stegner 's at Stanford , Paul Engle 's at Iowa , the 47 Workshop at Yale . Not one of them attempts to teach writing . They do provide a forum , a largely hostile audience on which a student can try out his work . One more thing ; I have been in Little Silver , New Jersey , and there is no writing school there . There is , of course , a post-office box . This is a fraud  --  a fraud to fleece sheep like you , Badger . " " How could it be ? " Otis asked , pointing out some small print under the return coupon that stated , " School accredited by the Accrediting Commission of the National Council of Off-Campus Study , Washington , D.C. " " And what do you suppose the National Council of Off-Campus Study is ? Part of the Justice Department ? Ca n't you read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you expect to write if you ca n't even read ? No , " I said , helping him to his feet and stuffing the ad back in his pocket , " You 're well out of it . " I saw Otis into the lobby with heartiest wishes for his good luck with the stocks and bonds and urged him at his earliest convenience to look into the pocket-book stock I had bought several years ago as a hedge against being in what 's known as the " whooping crane " end of the business . When the elevator door closed on a somewhat crestfallen Otis , I felt that I had fulfilled my obligation to my wife 's family for the season , and that nothing more would be expected of me until Christmas time . Aweek later , as I was preparing the evening 's palliative , I learned from my wife that her sister called from Winnetka to report that Otis Junior had put off going to work for six months in order to take a correspondence course that I had recommended . Otis Senior was hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to give me the benefit of his opinion to my face . I was angry . I was angry at Otis for putting the blame on me , and I was equally angry at that devilish copywriter in Little Silver for so ensnaring poor Otis . My first thought was to enroll in the course and when I had discovered all their deceitfulnesses I would reveal them to the Better Business Bureau . But as the evening wore on I had misgivings . It occurred to me they might find me out , a traitor in their midst , like that girl Democrat who stowed away on the Goldwater train . Besides I do n't want to be on any more mailing lists . It takes a strong man to bring the day 's harvest of circulars and catalogues indoors as it is . Instead I wrote to Otis reminding him that I had been against the Little Silver plan , not for it , that he was a full-grown adult and , if he was going to follow such inclinations as this of the correspondence course , he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , square me with his old man . / went on to say that I had nonetheless come to admire his determination and felt a growing curiosity about the course of instruction he was about to undertake . Would it be possible for him to pass on any of the materials he received from Little Silver ? Otis replied promptly:a story by John Leggett Dear Uncle Jack , Father seems to have gotten it balled up as usual . I did n't tell him you encouraged me to take the course . What I did pass on was your feeling that Badger &; Co. was the place where my natural indolence would be least apparent . He seems to have taken this personally though I tried to explain I did n't think you meant it as any particular reflection on him . Anyhow I would n't worry about it . He 's touchy about everything these days . Now  --  the good news about the school . Instead of taking the aptitude test , I sent in the story you saw and within three days I had an answer back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only am I getting into the advanced class but for counselor I am to have Dean Pigott himself As to the curriculum you asked about , we are n't allowed to show the course material to these who are n't enrolled at Celebrity but because of your special interest I 'm sure the faculty wo n't mind if I pass along some of the stuff we 're learning . The first week 's assignment is " The Writer 's Tools " and here are some things I 've picked up : The best novels are written on the back of rejection slips . The best novels are not written but rewritten . The common quality of good writers is intelligence . As Hemingway said  --  a good writer must have irrepressible confidence in himself and his ideas . As William Faulkner said  --  nothing can hurt a first-rate writer . The essential function of a writer is to hold the mirror up to life . Everybody has at least one good book in him . The problem is getting it out . Hope all this is of use to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oti a publishing course at Celebrity ? I am thinking of taking that too . Believe it wise to know what the other side is up to and Dean Pigott agrees . Would you like any tips from that curriculum ? 0 . Dear Otis I replied , Thanks for the cribbings from your first lesson . Do n't believe everything they tell you . Here are some contrary views . You can show them to the Dean . About what can ruin a writer . Norman Mailer says , " A lot can ruin a first-rate writer . Booze , pot , too much sex , too much failure in one 's private life , too much recognition , too little recognition , frustration . Nearly everything in the scheme of things works to dull a first-rate talent . But the worst probably is cowardice  --  as one gets older , one becomes aware of one 's cowardice ; the desire to be bold , which once was a joy , gets heavy with caution and duty . And finally there 's apathy . About the time it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROAD TO a great writer , you know you 've slipped far enough to be doing your work now on the comeback trail . " About the essential function of a writer : Max Shulman says it 's to support his family . About everybody having at least one good hook in him : Russell Lynes says that 's true . Also , chances are that 's the best place for it . Keep up the good work at school . And , yes , I guess I would be interested in whatever you feel you can reveal to me from the publishing course . What is the bursar 's office asking for that one ? Affectionately , Uncle Jack Iheard from Otis again in late July : Dear Uncle Jack , This week we are doing subject matter and these are the topics I am wrestling with right now . Books about the theater , China , or musicians do n't sell . Books about San Francisco or Jews do sell . Books with the word death in the title do n't sell . The subject matter of readable fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aborigines are seldom successful . ( The last is attributed to an editor at Little , Brown and may even be part of their editorial policy . ) Thine , Otis Dear Otis I replied , Pleased to know everything going so well . Very illuminating all those views on subject matter , though from the crush of the marketplace they do seem a bit academic . Tell the dean to check his sales figures on Death in the Family , Death in the Afternoon , and The American Way of Death . Affectionately , Uncle Jack And now lying before me is a letter from Otis which has just arrived : Dear Uncle Jack , I am now digging into the publishing course and hasten to pass on some of the meat . Actually it looks a lot easier than writing . The test of a good book  --  when you scratch it , does it bleed ? You do n't have to cat the whole egg to tell when it 's rotten . Never publish a bad book to keep a good author . Brown jackets do n't sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-selling novel . Spring is the worst publishing season . SUCCESS IN WRITING Second novels are generally disappointing and thus should be published first ( attributed to Robert Giroux of Farrar , Straus , and Giroux ) , There are only two times to publish a book about a scandal in Washington  --  either the day before it happens or five years afterwards ( attributed to Walter Bradbury of Doubleday ) . White jackets sell . According to Alfred Knopf , the trouble with the " returns " policy is that books are gone today and here tomorrow . Well , the semester is drawing to a close and I think you are going to be pleased with my progress . The marks on the finals are not in yet but I do feel I did well on them and am going to graduate with honors . Dean Pigott has been unusually encouraging in his last two letters . One happy result of the Celebrity training is that I 'm beginning to see how that story you read can be expanded . It began to dawn on me in Lesson 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do think it will make a novel and am getting fired up to have a go at it now that the Partisan Review has bought the story . They paid a hundred dollars for it by the way . Is that okay ? I have no way of knowing . Many thanks for all your encouragement , Otis So  --  what about Otis ? I suppose I could be wrong about that story of his . I 've been wrong about people 's writing plenty of times . It 's possible I 'm wrong half the time . I confess that only because I 've come to believe that all editors maintain about that average . And that in turn always makes me wonder about Maxwell Perkins . We know all about Perkins ' victories , his Thomas Wolfe and Scott Fitzgerald , but what about his mistakes ? I think there 's an idea there for a book . But getting back to Otis Badger . Do you suppose those Partisan Review editors are right about his story ? I hear there 's a new crowd over there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's possible too that he 'll expand it into a novel . Supposing Otis takes it to another publisher ? Supposing it gets to be a best-seller . It could happen , you know . Look at the best-seller list . Then imagine the abuse I 'll be liable to ? from my brother-in-law , from my sister-in-law , from Otis . My wife wo n't say anything  --  but she 'll be thinking . And so will I. Does anybody have a suggestion ? Harper 's Magazine , February 1966
