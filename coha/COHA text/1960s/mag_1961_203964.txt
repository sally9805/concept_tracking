Facts of Life ( H-L-P ; United Artists ) suggests that if the commercial comedians would only stop trying so hard to make people laugh , some of them might be funny . In this picture Bob Hope and Lucille Ball , sometime major magnates of the TV laugh industry , set out to make a quiet little country-club comedy-partly for the mass audience , but partly also for their own pleasure in reading good material again after all those years in the yak pastures . To their considerable amazement , they have produced the funniest U.S. film since The Apartment-a quick , slick , slyly satirical and sometimes wonderfully nutty comedy of middle-class manners and middle-aged morals . <P> Written , produced and directed by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank , Facts of Life inquires with wicked glee into the nature of the tie that binds men and women in holy wedlock . Is it love ? No , it is inertia ; most married people remain faithful to each other because it is just too much trouble to cheat . <P> The theory is illustrated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one female ( Ball ) , each happily married to somebody else-who have known and mildly disliked each other for years . Then , accidentally , they find themselves in Acapulco for a two-week vacation , alone together and falling in love . They fight it off , swim it off , laugh it off , in the end settle for a nice , safe , neuter idyl that is both hilarious and painful to watch . <P> Back home , the nonlovers realize suddenly how much they have missed , make a date one night to meet in a nearby town . Just as Hope is about to leave home , his wife reminds him that he has promised to take his son to a Cub Scout meeting . Furious , he drags the boy off , sits through an interminable report on Indian smoke signals , arrives for the date two hours late-too late to do anything but tool over to a drive-in theater . They settle down for some heavy necking , only to find that they are parked beside their mutual laundryman , who is peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scramble for the keys , bump heads , accidentally hit the horn-which sticks . Two minutes later , the whole drive-in audience is straining angrily to get a glare at them as they hastily back out . So it goes , at tryst after assignation after rendezvous , until finally in sheer exhaustion both parties decide that fidelity is the best policy .
