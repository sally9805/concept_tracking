In the 18 years since Johns Hopkins ' famed Surgeon Alfred Blalock electrified the medical world by turning " blue babies " into pink and active youngsters , at least 10,000 such invalids since birth have had operations of this type . The number may be closer to 20,000 ; nobody knows for sure . Until now , nobody has known the fate of these children as they matured . Could they marry and have children themselves ? If they did , what were their children 's chances of being born with defective hearts ? <P> " Do n't Be Discouraged . " Last week Pediatrician Helen B. Taussig , 64 , who did the basic research on blue babies and suggested the operative approach to Surgeon Blalock , gave an encouraging report on the progress of the 1,700 patients who have had the blue-baby operation at Baltimore 's Johns Hopkins . Among these and other victims of congenital heart defects , at least 235 with whom Dr. Taussig has been able to keep in close touch have become parents : 76 men and 159 women . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six children were born malformed , three had heart defects and three had other malformations . The rates were almost identical in 348 cases where the affected parent was the mother : 13 malformed infants , six with heart defects . <P> The rate of 1.8% for heart defects is about six times the normal average , said Dr. Taussig and Dr. Catherine A. Neill . Blue-baby mothers also had more spontaneous abortions ( miscarriages ) than the general population . But the researchers felt that the rates were not high enough to discourage former blue babies from attempting parenthood . Most of them can achieve it and have healthy offspring . <P> A striking case is that of Adele Roveda , whose heart defect was diagnosed in infancy before any corrective surgery had been devised . At 17 , she had an early Blalock-Taussig operation , and another nine years later . Now 31 , and married to Baltimorean Raymond W. Hepner Jr. , she has a normal daughter almost three years old , and does her own housework . <P> Another blue-baby mother has had five normal children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taussig and Neill are not certain . They doubt that it is simply because of oxygen shortage , but suspect that a little-understood hormone deficiency is involved . <P> A Fifth Anomaly . Most blue babies , so called from the color of their fingertips and lips , suffer from a set of four inborn defects in the heart and arteries , known as Fallot 's tetralogy . The effect is to recirculate much blood from which oxygen has been naturally removed in the veins , and send only part of it to the lungs for re-oxygenation . The Taussig-Blalock operation , devised years before open-heart surgery with a heart-lung machine became possible , is a compromise : it consists of purposely creating a fifth defect-a connection from the aorta to the pulmonary artery-to shunt more blood to the lungs and thus overcome some of the effects of the original four .
