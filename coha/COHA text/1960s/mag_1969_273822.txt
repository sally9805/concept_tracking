It was exactly ten minutes after seven on Thursday evening , June 12 , that Mrs. Lela Bass , 73 , stood combing her long gray hair in the backyard of her white frame house in Port Neches , Texas . Casually she turned and saw for the first time an eerie outline etched in the plastic of her backdoor screen : a bearded , long-haired man with a halo , looking east toward a fig tree in the yard . It was , she was certain , Jesus Christ . Neighbors spread the word , and since then , more than 50,000 curious visitors have descended on the Bass home to share her vision . <P> Port Neches is a bleak Gulf Coast industrial town that is also intensely religious . On Sundays , most of its 10,000 inhabitants troop loyally to one or another of the town 's 35 churches ; some have so much fundamentalist fear of the Lord that they respectfully refer to Jesus as " Mr. Christ . " The shared excitement over the phenomenon has brought blacks and whites together in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes differ on what they see . One white farmer , who claims that he has taken some 25 photographs showing images of " the Christ Child , the Virgin Mary , the Three Wise Men , and angels , " scoffed at Negro viewers . " These niggers come away saying they 've seen Martin Luther King , Bobby Kennedy and J.F.K. Boy , those people sure have an imagination . " <P> No Tampering . The tide of visitors keeps a constant daily crowd of 300 to 500 people on hand from dawn until late evening , reducing the Bass 's backyard to dust and littering it with Polaroid film waste . Mrs. Bass , though , rejoices that the vision has brought her 78-year-old husband back to churchgoing . She is undisturbed by the variety of reported visions ( " Everyone 's seeing what they need " ) and by the relic hunters who tore her fig tree apart for souvenirs and crushed what was left of it . ( " Maybe the Lord intended for them to take it home . " ) <P> According to TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the screen-a profile view of a man that looks like the picture of Christ we all know . There appears to have been no tampering with the screen . " The most likely rational explanation is that the screen acquired the image by the effects of normal weathering and its juxtaposition over an inner screen . But for Mrs. Bass the image is a true " sign from God . " She believes now that it explains a mysterious " revelation " she had some 35 years ago , when , one day in prayer , she saw " hundreds of saved people coming toward me . " Saved or not , at week 's end they were still coming .
