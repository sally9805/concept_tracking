" I do n't think most Americans realize the way the situ  --  ation has changed , " the President said to me . He sat back , relaxed , in his rocking chair , leaning forward occasion  --  ally to flick the ash off a small cigar . He still looked amaz  --  ingly young , but there were lines about his eyes . He had had a rough day , culminating in a press conference that afternoon . " 1 do n't think many people really understand the change , " he said . " As late as 1954 the balance in air power , in the nuclear weapons , was all on our side . The change began about 1958 or 1959 , with the missiles . Now we have got to realize that both sides have these annihilating weapons , and that changes the problem . Of course in some circumstances we must be prepared to use the nuclear weapon at the start , come what may  --  a clear attack on Western Europe , for example . But what is important is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . What you need is control , flexibility , a choice . . . . " Unlike most politicians , President Kennedy does not like to bloviate . The useful verb , " to bloviate , " was in  --  vented by President Warren Gamaliel Harding . It means to theorize , to generalize , to talk in large and imprecise terms . Most politicians love to bloviate . President Ken  --  nedy does not . He does not like to be bloviated at , either . When people begin to talk to him in generalities , he is apt to tap his front teeth with his right index finger . Those close to him recognize this small gesture as a sign of impatience , and when they see him tapping his teeth they quickly abandon generalities and get down to facts . Facts are what the President likes . He collects facts , as others collect dead butterflies or Louis Quinze furniture . In a recent talk with the President at the White House , I find from my notes , he referred to twenty-four nations , mentioned twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects ranging from the precise percentage of the Canadian gross nationalproduct devoted to foreign aid , to the quality of the train  --  ing at Fort Bragg . But the words quoted above were the closest the President came to those large and sweeping generalizations in which most politicians love to indulge . Yet those words , while they are not particularly eloquent , are nevertheless deeply significant . Among them , the key word is the word " choice . " The basic purpose of the Ken  --  nedy grand strategy , which is now visibly emerging , can be summed up in one sentence . It is this : Kennedy 's purpose is to achieve a " choice " in the " changed situation " which now confronts the United States . There are those who would deny that there is any such thing as a Kennedy grand strategy . Among his friendliest critics the chief criticism is that he is an empiricist , an op  --  erator , a manipulator , lacking any underlying purpose or goal . For example , James Reston of The New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Ken  --  nedy Administration , wrote a column about Kennedy which did not please its subject . Kennedy , Reston wrote , is " a tactician , more interested in political manipulation than in public education , and this leaves him without a goal to which his day-to-day decisions can be related . " Although what Reston wrote irritated Kennedy , it is quite true that Kennedy is by nature and instinct a " tac  --  tician . " " What are the facts ' ? " he will say , or " Let 's get specific , " or " Well , what do you do ? " Those are the phrases of a born tactician . The President 's private manner , more  --  over , his personal style , is coolly casual , interlarded with the special Kennedy brand of kidding . Add this manner to the President 's disinclination to generalize , and it is easy to see why those who wish to discuss kith him such large matters as the goal to which his day-to-day decisions can be related " are likely to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has a " shore dimly seen , " and a coherent strategy for reaching that shore . Of that I am convinced after talking at length with the President and his chief advisers . Kennedy is the least doctrinaire of men . He came to the White House with cer  --  tain basic convictions , but without any preconceived doc  --  trine for dealing with his situation . The process of facing up to that situation , through a whole series of crises , has shaped his grand strategy , rather than the other way about . Take one example  --  the long-drawn-out crisis in Laos which Kennedy inherited from President Eisenhower . " When 1 first got here , " the President told me , " there was this Laos problem  --  the Pathet Lao guerrillas were sup  --  ported by the Communists , and there seemed no way to stop them unless we intervened . If we intervened with a few thousand troops . and the Chinese Communists then intervened in mass , then you have the choice between hacking down and using nuclear weapons , and nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been ready to intervene , there would have been no chance at all of a settlement in Laos . You 've got to try to think these things through , and then make the best judgment you can . " As these words imply . the long Laos crisis has suggested to the President certain conclusions : about the limitations of a defense policy based almost wholly on nuclear power , about the need for more ground forces on our side , about the effectiveness of guerrilla warfare as an instrument of Communist expansion . Other experiences  --  the Cuban disaster , the war in Vietnam , Kennedy 's meeting with Khrushchev in Vienna , the Berlin crisis , the failure to reach a nuclear-test-ban agreement with the Soviets , which Kennedy calls his " greatest disappointment " ? have also had lessons to teach . Out of such experiences  --  and out of the first-class brains of such subordinates as Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and Secretary of State Dean Rusk  --  the Kennedy grand strategy has been shaped . The strategy , in other words , has grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of specific situations . But the place to start , in order to grasp what the Kennedy grand strategy is all about , is with the grand strategy of his Soviet opposite number , Nikita Khru  --  shchev . On January 6 , 1961 , a few days before Kennedy took his oath of office , Khrushchev made a long speech in Moscow before a convocation of the world 's Communist leaders . Kennedy read Khrushchev 's speech at the time . and it impressed him then . Since then he has become con  --  vinced that in the " January speech , " as it is known in the White House , Khrushchev was explicitly outlining his strategy for the global victory of Communism . In Febru ary of this year Kennedy ordered prepared a detailed analysis of Khrushchev 's January speech . Speech and analysis were circulated among the fifty chief officials of the Kennedy Administration , with instructions to " read , mark , learn and inwardly digest . " In his January speech Khrushchev stated his own " goal " to which his own " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unexpectedly , what Khrushchev calls " the great goal of on earth . " What is more interesting is Khrushchev 's detailed blueprint for achieving that goal . It is not to he achieved by nuclear war . On the contrary , " the problem of preventing a global thermonuclear war is the most vital and burning problem " for all Communists . ( This doctrine is , of course , at the heart of Khrushchev 's ideological battles with the Chinese Communists . ) In or  --  der to prevent such a war , it is necessary to " do everything in order to enhance the military might of our country . " This in turn will ensure that in case of nuclear war " cap  --  italism would be wiped out and annihilated . " Khrushchev cites statistics to prove that in a nuclear war the British would lose " at least 20,000,000 people , " and the Amer  --  icans " 50,000,000-75,000,000 . " But he also implicitly ac  --  knowledges that " the workers ' state " would be destroyed too ; and thus global thermonuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " national uprisings " and " na  --  tional liberation wars " ? must by all means be promoted . As examples of such desirable wars Khrushchev cites the Vietnam guerrilla war and Castro 's uprising in Cuba . This kind of war , Khrushchev says , " is a sacred war . . . The Communists fully support such just wars and march in the front rank with the peoples waging liberation struggles . " On the military side , Khrushchev 's strategy is thus a formula for spreading Communism through Communist-supported limited guerrilla warfare , under the umbrella of a nuclear stalemate . Such " national liberation wars " are the chief military instrument of Khrushchev 's double-barreled grand strategy . The other barrel is economic . Here , in Khrushchev 's words , is the guts of it : " The time is approaching when , in its share of world production , socialism will take first place . . . The victory of the U.S.S.R. in economic competition with the United States , the victory of the whole socialist system over the capitalist system , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then even the greatest skeptics . , . will make their choice in favor of socialism . " This , then . is what Khrushchev means by " peaceful co  --  existence , " which he calls " the high road of international relations . " Through a series of Communist-supported " liberation wars " the raw-materials-producing underde  --  veloped areas of the world are to be brought under Com  --  munist control , and thus the soft underbelly of the West  --  ern world is to be ripped open . This will lead in turn to a sharp shift in the world power balance in favor of the Soviet bloc , and thus to the " isolation and ultimate liqui  --  dation " of " military-political alignments like NATO . " The economic victory of " the whole socialist system " will then lead on , without " global thermonuclear war , " to the great goal of Communism on earth . There are certain points to note about this double-barreled Khrushchev grand strategy . The first is that Khru  --  shchev and his followers are not going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy himself dis  --  covered in Vienna , where he had what he described at the time as a " somber " meeting with Khrushchev last spring . Nowadays Kennedy often refers back to that meeting , which obviously made a deep impression on him . " He never gave way at all . " he says . " I kept insisting that there could be no agreement between us as long as he supported Communist subversion all over the world , but he never gave way , never gave an inch . " What made the meeting somber " was Kennedy 's realization that Khrushchev really meant what he said in his January speech . The second point to note is that Khrushchev is not in a hurry ; that he genuinely intends , for very good reasons , to avoid that " global thermonuclear war . " West Berlin is free today for one essential reason  --  because Kennedy has suc  --  ceeded in convincing Khrushchev that a grab for Berlin might well result in that global war which Khrushchev is determined to avoid . Thus convinced , Khrushchev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last summer . The third point to note is that Khrushchev 's grand strategy is not a stupid strategy at all ; that it is shrewdly aimed at the weak points in the West 's armor ; and that it might ultimately succeed . The umbrella of Soviet nuclear might , under which the process of nibbling away at the non-Communist world is to proceed , is already very for  --  midable , and growing more so . The formula for nibbling away by means of Communist-supported guerrilla wars is not a new formula , and it does not always work . It has failed , for example , in the Philippines , Malaya , Burma , Greece . But it has succeeded elsewhere , notably in Cuba and in China itself , and it has all too good a chance to succeed in Laos and Vietnam . It is an extraordinarily difficult formula to counter by military means . Finally it is quite true that the rate of economic growth in the Communist world has been higher than in the West , including the United States . And if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the mixed economy of the West , that will indeed be a " turning point in history . " So much , then , for the Khrushchev grand strategy . How about the Kennedy grand strategy , which is beginning to take on firm outlines ? In a sense it is the other side of Khrushchev 's coin . But it is also more than that . When Kennedy became President he inherited a 1956 policy paper which ruled that nuclear weapons would be used immediately in any war bigger than a " brush-fire war . " In line with this policy the American Army , which provides the bulk of nonnuclear power , had been sliced in half ' . The attempt to achieve a real nonnuclear counter It is Kennedy 's intention to create an elite corps of specialists who can provide the military expertise to deal with Communist-sponsored guerrilla warfare . But he real  --  izes that is only an essential list step . " In the final analy  --  sis , - he told me , " what is needed is a political effort . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he has studied closely the ex  --  tensive literature of the subject . He knows by heart Mao Tse-tung 's dictum : " Guerrillas are like fish , and the people are the water in which the fish swim . If the temperature of the water is right , the fish will thrive and multiply . " The best way  --  perhaps in the long run the only way  --  to deal with the internal Communist-guerrilla threat , is to " control the temperature of the water " in the threatened country , so that the guerrilla-fish do not thrive and mul  --  tiply . And in the final analysis , as Kennedy says , this re  --  quires a political effort . This is why the United States must use all its instruments of rower and persuasion to control " the temperature of the water " by strengthening the po  --  litical as well as the military base of the anti-Communist regimes in a threatened country like Vietnam . A major instrument of power and persuasion is the for  --  eign-aid program headed by Fowler Hamilton . " Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has remarked , " to realize that Southeast Asia is a battle  --  ground and that foreign aid is a weapon in the battle , not a charitable enterprise . " As Kennedy is well aware , there is no magic formula for dealing with Communist-supported guerrilla wars . And guerrilla warfare is a two-edged sword . There are many areas in the Communist world where " the temperature of the water is right. - Unless the guerrilla weapon can be turned against the Communists . the West will be like a man wearing boxing gloves fighting a man with a shiv . Ken  --  nedy is aware that this is so , but it is a subject which , for obvious reasons , he is unwilling to discuss in detail . But one fact at least is certain . Kennedy has recog  --  nized  --  and has forced the Pentagon to recognize  --  the deadly danger inherent in Khrushchev 's threat to support guerrilla uprisings , under the umbrella of the nuclear stale  --  mate . The power and the ingenuity of the United States are at last being brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of Kennedy 's new defense design for dealing with the " changed situa  --  tion- which confronts the West . Our European allies  --  notably the British  --  are deeply reluctant to make the great effort needed to provide in Europe the " choice " which Kennedy seeks . And there is the ancient problem of get  --  ting a better return in combat power on the money and manpower invested in our own armed forces , especially the Army . Kennedy and McNamara are wrestling manfully with this problem , but they have by no means got it licked . Until it is licked it will be difficult  --  perhaps impossible  --  to provide Kennedy 's " choice . " Yet when these caveats are entered , the fact remains that the Kennedy-McNamara defense design represents a radically changed way of dealing with that " changed situa  --  tion " of which Kennedy speaks ; and that the new design is intelligently tailored to meet the military-political chal  --  lenges implicit in Khrushchev 's " January speech . " The purpose of the new defense design is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided , while finding the means to halt the nib  --  bling-away process which Khrushchev has initiated under the nuclear umbrella . The new design is , by its very nature , defensive  --  it is a holding operation . If it succeeds there remains the second threat in Khrushchev 's doubly threat  --  ening grand strategy  --  his predicted economic " victory of the whole socialist system over the capitalist system , " which is to be the " greatest turning point in history . " On this score the President displays a quiet confidence more convincing than Khrushchev 's boasts . " You know , " he says , " I 'm not so much impressed by the challenge of their system . The most impressive thing they 've done is their achievement in space . But there is a lot that is not so impressive  --  East Germany in bad shape , famine in China , the farm shortages in Russia itself . They 've poured mil  --  lions into Cuba . and the people there are still miserable . They can exploit all the misery in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so impressive . " When he discusses his plan to form a trading partner  --  ship with the European Common Market , he shies away as always from hyperbole and gassy generalizations , like a balky horse . And as always with Kennedy , the grand con  --  cept of an economically unified Atlantic Community sprang not from some preconceived doctrine . but from the facts of the situation he faced . Britain 's decision to seek entry into the Common Mar  --  ket confronted Kennedy with a hard choice . Either the Atlantic Community would be split into two furiously competing and mutually exclusive economic blocs . Or the President could meet the problem head on , and by seeking radically to revise America 's trading relationship to Europe  --  with real hurt to certain powerful American eco  --  nomic interests  --  make possible a unified economic Atlantic Community . He chose the latter course . " If we can get a trading partnership with the Common Market , " he says , " and a special relationship with Japan and some other countries , then you will have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to work on the exterior lines . . . " An awfully strong base , economically . " Walter Lipp  --  mann , in a recent speech , was more eloquent when he spoke of an " Atlantic Community . . . a great and secure center of power and wealth , of light and of leading ... one liberal and progressive economic community . . . . " Al  --  though he eschews eloquence in private , that is certainly what Kennedy sees on the dimly seen shore . He sees that " awfully strong base " tying the great trading nations of the West together . politically as veil as economically ; act  --  ing like a magnet on the underdeveloped countries on the " exterior lines- and on the Communist countries , too ; and making nonsense of Khrushchev 's boasts about the corn  --  ing economic victory of Communism . The future is clouded . to be sure , to Kennedy as to all men . The President is no superman , ready to solve all the world 's problems , nor are those around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many high hurdles to be overleapt at home and abroad , from the United States Congress to Berlin and Vietnam . Many of the problems that confront President Kennedy also faced President Eisenhower and President Truman and even his more distant predecessors . The problems are still there , and they wo n't go away . There will never be a time when poverty and war and the attendant miseries of both are wholly banished from the earth . The President and the men around him seek no final solutions , because there are none . When he took office the President and certain of his advisers hoped that some way might be found to reach a live-and-let-live agreement with the Soviets  --  above all , that ways might be found to con  --  trol the hideous weapon which might yet write finis to man 's history . This was why the President 's " greatest dis  --  appointment " was the Soviet refusal to take the first small step of banning nuclear tests . But the hope is not yet quite dead , which is why the President insists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile there are no illusions left in the White House that Communists will cease to be Communists , that Khrushchev will cease to press on towards his " great goal of Communism on earth . " As the President said to me , the other side has " the advantage of a dictatorship , an authoritarian system . They can say do this , do that and it 's done . We are a free society , and we have a long , long struggle ahead , a tough competition . And we here in America have to bear the main weight of the burden . " It will be a long struggle certainly , a tough competition , a heavy burden . But of one thing I am convinced after talk ing to him  --  the President is beginning to see a shore , if only dimly , and he and the men around him are begin  --  ning to see how we all might reach that distant shore , without a global war . I am also now convinced of one other thing  --  the President has , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Khrushchev has of reaching his . THE END
