Seeds came up weeds at Wimbledon last week . The All-England Tennis Championships had barely begun when three of the eight seeded players in the men 's singles were eliminated . And by whom ? By three Yanks - all of whom had been completely ignored by Wim- bledon 's seeding committee , and two of whom were members of the U.S. Da vis Cup team that only a week before had lost ingloriously to tiny Ecuador in the American Zone finals . Illinois . Then , in an 89-game , 3 - hr , marathon that ranks among the longest in Wimbledon history , Texas ' crew cut Cliff Richey outlasted Australia 's No . <P> 4-seeded Tony Roche 3-6 , 3-6 , 19-17 , 14-12 , 6-3 . <P> For pure drama - and implausibility - neither of those victories came close to matching the upset engineered by a 23-year-old Puerto Rican named Charles Pasarell . Son of a wealthy Santurce businessman , " Charlito " Pasarell is the reigning U.S. indoor champion , the No.3-ranked player in the nation , and the possessor of a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet Pasarell 's game is as erratic as it is flashy . " I 've beaten just about everybody in the world , " he admits , " but I 've been beaten by just about everybody too . " He was not even named to the 1967 U.S. Davis Cup team , and the officials at Wimbledon obviously thought no better of him . In the first round , he was matched as a sort of warmup boy for the 1966 winner , Manuel Santana of Spain . Never in Wimbledon history had a defending champion been beaten in the first round . <P> Practice Pays . So much for history . Aiming his serves like a golfer lining up putts , Charlito blasted Santana with " the Bomb , " kept him unmercifully on the run with delicate lobs and volleys , swept the first two sets 10-8 , 6-3 . Rain interrupted the match for 15 minutes , and the Spaniard , refreshed , took the third set 6-2 . Then Pasarell dug in . He broke Santana 's serve with a booming forehand in the 13th game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> For a while , prospects of a U.S. victory at Wimbledon looked reasonably bright-especially after Australia 's Roy Emerson , the No. 2 seed , was beaten by an unseeded Yugoslav . But by week 's end both Riessen and Richey had been eliminated , and Pasarell was the only American left . Finally , in the quarterfinals , Charlito also came a cropper , losing to Brazil 's Thomas Koch , in five tough sets , 4-6 , 6-4 , 6-3 , 4-6 , 6-8 . At least the mercurial Puerto Rican had given the U.S. , at a time when its tennis fortunes were down , a few shining sets .
