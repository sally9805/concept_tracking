All through the chill , rainy afternoon , the simple urn containing the ashes of Jean Moulin was on view at the Memo rial to the Victims of the German Labor Camps near Notre Dame Cathedral . Inside the cement crypt glimmered 200,000 crystal rods-one for each Frenchman who died in the Nazi camps . <P> That night the urn was placed on an old armored car , and , illuminated by flaming torches and moving to the funereal roll of drums , the cortege passed between silent crowds bundled against the cold . All lights on the mile-long route to the Pantheon were extinguished . One cafe attempted business as usual with gas lamps , but police entered and blew them out . The colonnaded Pantheon was also dark , but brilliant tricolor searchlights cast a V up into the sky . As a military band played civil servant . When the Nazis arrived in Chartres on June 17 , 1940 , Jean Moulin met them in his full regalia as prefect of the district . His independent spirit soon landed him in prison . After one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document serving Nazi propaganda , he feared that he would not be able to hold out next time , and tried to kill himself by slashing his throat with a piece of glass . But he recovered . By October 1941 , Moulin had escaped France and arrived secretly in Britain , where he joined the Free French movement . De Gaulle , as he recalled later , decided that Moulin was " a man of faith and reason , doubtful of nothing , defiant of everything . " Within a few months , Moulin parachuted into the French Alps bearing the microfilm of an order naming him De Gaulle 's top representative in France . <P> As the legendary " Max , " Moulin became head of the Resistance movement . He was small , dark and inconspicuous , usually wore a navy blue trenchcoat and a grey scarf to hide the scars that remained on his neck from his suicide attempt . Moving about the country with speed and stealth , Moulin managed to weld together mutually mistrustful Frenchmen of the left , right and center . He created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi detachments , and drew up plans for massive help for the eventual Allied landings . While the Nazis searched frantically for him , Moulin , nicknamed " the King of Shadows , " held a Paris meeting of the 16 most important leaders of the underground , who elected him president . But in June 1943 , Moulin was captured near Lyon by the Gestapo , and a few weeks later he was dead of torture-without having revealed anything he knew about the Resistance to the Nazis . <P> <P> Sense of History . Before last week 's reburial at the Pantheon , Moulin 's remains had rested for two decades at Pere-Lachaise cemetery , and there were some skeptics who wondered at Charles De Gaulle 's long delay in recognizing Moulin 's great wartime contribution . Some saw the ceremony as designed to inaugurate De Gaulle 's presidential campaign . But there come moments in France when political passion and factional rivalry are briefly overshadowed by a sense of history and literature . One such occurred when Andre Malraux , De Gaulle 's Minister of Cultural Affairs and leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all political factions hailed as a masterpiece . <P>
