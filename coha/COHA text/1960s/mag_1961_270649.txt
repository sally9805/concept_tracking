To the 18 California Republicans he invited for dinner one evening last week , Richard Nixon represented the host with the most . Polls showed that of all likely Republican candidates , Nixon would have the easiest time defeating Democrat Pat Brown in California 's 1962 gubernatorial election . Painfully mauled in 1958 , the California G.O.P. needed a ticket leader like Nixon , who boosted 22 new Republicans into Congress last November while narrowly losing the presidency . As they pulled their rattan chairs a little closer together in the Nixon playroom and sipped their cocktails , the visitors strained to hear whether their host would be willing to run . His decision : probably not . <P> $2,000 a Month . Ever since Nixon came home from Washington last February and began building a $135,000 Beverly Hills ranch house , most Californians have shared the same curiosity about his plans . Aware of the growing demand that he make up his mind , Nixon produced a carefully prepared statement . He was flattered to be asked to run , he said . But , he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international level . I do not think I can turn my back on my responsibility to the national party . " <P> The former vice president was obviously not at all anxious to ignore his private road map , which does not include Sacramento as a way stop on the route back to Washington . For one thing , Democrats are almost certain to control the next California legislature ; they would make life unbearable for any Republican Governor , and particularly for Nixon . Another reason : campaigning in California and serving as Governor would restrict Nixon to his home state when he would want to be out touring the U.S. <P> Current Nixon strategy is national exposure until the presidential campaign of 1964 . He is writing a book ( Six Crises ) and a syndicated column that has already been snapped up by 145 newspapers . He is in wide demand as a speaker ; he receives about a thousand letters a week , runs up a $2,000-a-month telephone bill keeping up his long distance contacts . Moreover , Nixon is preparing to campaign in 1962 for Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them win and strengthen the party , partly because he hopes to have the favor returned at the " 1964 G.O.P. convention . Few Nixon strategists seriously consider the idea of bypassing ' 64 for ' 68 ; win or lose , the next Republican presidential nominee would become titular head of the party , and Nixon would be frozen out . <P> " My Judgment . " After they digested their host 's arguments , Nixon 's guests moved from the playroom to the poolside patio to digest roast beef , nine vegetables and fruit glace . They had , in effect , been turned down . But when they left the party , they took with them one faint but sweetly sounding if . If , promised Nixon , 60 days of political soundings left them still convinced that he was the only man who could beat Pat Brown , he would reconsider and run . But , added the host with the most , " my judgment will be the biggest factor in the final decision . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
