Solemn as a team of surgeons emerging from a hospital amphitheater , scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration last week reported on an operation of their own . Operation Echo A12 , they said , was highly successful - but the patient died . <P> The operation began when a Thor rocket took off from Cape Canaveral just before dawn carrying a canister containing a tightly folded deflated balloon of plastic film and aluminum foil . This was Echo A12 , an experimental successor to Echo I , the 100-ft. radio-reflector that was launched on Aug. 12 , 1960 , and is still orbiting the earth . Echo A12 was not expected to orbit ; its job was merely to expand in space and test a new kind of aluminized film that would stay rigid after the gas that blew up the balloon had escaped through meteor punctures . <P> When the rocket was 150 miles up , the canister containing Echo A12 was released by explosive bolts . Retrorockets fired , slowing the burned-out Thor , while small stabilizing jets in its nose kept it pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras . <P> Scientists gathered around a TV screen at Cape Canaveral , watched the canister soar free . Out swelled the silvery balloon . It took shape swiftly-too swiftly . The balloon expanded to its full 135-ft-diameter in two seconds . Then a rip raced across the silvery skin ; almost instantaneously the great balloon tore into shapeless shreds . The pictures were so good that they could be reshown on household TV sets . Back to the drawing boards went Echo A12 's designers . But airborne TV had already told them what had gone wrong : Echo A12 contained too much residual air , which made the balloon expand too violently into the vacuum of space .
