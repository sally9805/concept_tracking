The credit-starved housing industry has sunk proportionately faster and fur ther in 1966 , compared with where it stood a year ago , than the whole U.S. <P> economy did during four years of Depression in the ' 30s . Since last Decem ber , when tightening money began to choke off housing 's flow of mortgage funds , the annual rate of home and apartment starts has dropped more than 50% , to a 20-year low . In the latest count , in October , private-housing starts were scraping along at a mere 848,000 a year . At that pace , the prosperous U.S. <P> is building less new housing per capita than such countries as Austria , Greece , Czechoslovakia , Spain , Italy , Yugoslavia and even hard-pressed Britain ; per-capita U.S. output is only about half that of Sweden , West Germany . <P> Switzerland and the U.S.S.R. <P> Last week , for the second time in a fortnight , President Johnson responded to the industry 's cries for help by doling out a little federal mortgage money . He ordered the Federal Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into savings and loan associations over the next three or four months in order to help them step up their lending on homes . The week before , the President had released $250 million through the Federal National Mortgage Association for direct Government purchase of FHA and VA loans on low-priced new homes . <P> Glacial Torpor . Though $750 mil lion sounds like a bundle , it is only a Band-Aid for an industry that often consumes more new capital per year than all stock and bond issues combined . <P> The money will finance about 40,000 houses - 25,000 through S &; Ls , with an average of $20,000 per loan , and 15,000 through FNMA , under a $17,500 loan limit in most major cities . That is about 6% of the gap between the indus try 's current production and the 1,600,000 homes a year that the nation needs to keep up with the basic demand created by new families and increasing demolition of unfit dwellings . <P> Because housing responds with glacial torpor to such conditions , the prospect is that fewer homes will go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago last week , the National Association of Home Builders forecast a 10% decline , to 1,100,000 starts . The Commerce Department ex pects a drop of as much as 14% , to something between 1,050,000 and 1,150,000 new units , in either case the lowest number of starts since 1946 . <P> Back in Business . Despite that gloomy outlook , the mortgage-money market has begun to ease slightly . S &; Ls , which normally make more than 40% of all home-mortgage loans , are now soliciting business again in some areas . In California , Illinois and Texas , a few S &; Ls have shaved mortgage rates , though charges of 7% to 71% , plus a onetime fee of 2% to 4% for making the loan , remain common in the West .
