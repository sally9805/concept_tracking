txt // Since many of the writers are more concerned with shares in distribution than with the technique of production , it will also be advisable to defer some reflections upon the subject to later chapters . But the general framework may be briefly surveyed here . T , e factors , as already stated , have their importance both individually and as a four-horse team . We may , therefore , first consider opinions as to the functions of each separately and then take up the more difficult and debatable problem of how they should cooperate or be combined . Beginning with land , in the sense of all natural resources , there has never been any doubt as to its fundamental character . The superiority often assigned to agriculture is proof that , even though Nature may sometimes be niggardly , she does work with man when he uses his muscles and brains to make things grow . The distinction between fertility or intrinsic qualities and situation was made quite early , as by John Graunt and Sir William Petty in their respective surveys.58 Adam Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its fertility , whatever be its produce , but with its situation . Land in the neighborhood of a towi gives a greater rent than land equally fertile in a distant part of the country .... Good roads , canals , and navigable rivers , by diminishing the expense of carriage put the remote parts of the country more nearly upon a level with those in the neighborhood of the town.69 As a Scotsman , Smith was fully aware of the desirability of combining the raising of livestock with cultivation for the sake of enriching the soil.60 Ricardo 's grades of land , determining when and how much rent would be paid , were , of course , based on both fertility and the advantages of situation.C1 As an industrialist , J. B. Say was able to give a somewhat more comprehensive description of the elements included under the term " natural agents , " among them " the laws of the physical world " such as gravitation , magnetism , the pressure of the air , the elasticity of steel , heat , and " the physical and chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had lived today , he would have mentioned electronics and atomic energy . Land , then , affords a place in which to work , the necessary materials , and the crude forces . But their utilization , control , and final destiny await the more active human agencies . No writer has dared to dispute the importance of labor . Adam Smith gives it the central position , and says that the relative abundance of the necessaries and conveniences of life depends upon " the skill , dexterity , and judgment with which labor is generally applied " and upon the proportion between the number of people who are emPRODUCTION // ployed in useful labor and those who are not so employed.03 J. B. Say , again , in his illustration of making a lock , gives the three steps as ( 1 ) studying the laws and course of nature , ( 2 ) the application of such knowledge to the given purpose , and ( 3 ) the execution of the plan or project by manual labor which puts together the component parts.64 Yet there has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the laborer , as stated before , has not always been highly honored . Hence the growing manifestations of discontent on the part of labor itself ? and the charges of Marx and others that it is being exploited . To these , labor is almost , if not quite , responsible for the whole product . The concept of capital ? just what it should include , the forms which it takes , and the exact services which it performs ? has shown great diversity from the beginning , and is not yet fully resolved . Irving Fisher has reviewed the different ideas all too briefly in presenting his own view , that capital is all wealth existing at an instant of time , or capitalized income.85 Naturally , until the pattern of the factory system had been established , where as much as $10,000 may now be invested in building and equipment for each person employed , and where , as in the paper industry , a single huge machine may cost as much as $10,000,000 to install , emphasis was likely to be rather upon the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if technical illustrations were used , they related to the more primitive forms such as the boat and net of the fisherman , or the plow and oxen of the farmer . Sir William Petty has a paragraph in his " Political Anatomy of Ireland " ( 1672 ) in which he computes that if through one hundred days ' labor and much ingenuity a workman can make a plow , through the agency of which he can cultivate twice as much as before , " the art is worth one man 's labor forever . " " Adam Smith , as noted earlier , evidently regarded division of labor as more vital for increasing productivity than machinery , and only belatedly comes to use the word " capital " instead of " stock , " and to distinguish fixed from circulating capital . He says its main function is " to increase the productive powers of labor , or to enable the same number of laborers to perform a much greater quantity of work " ; but does not go into the engineering side of it sufficiently to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his contemporary in France , Turgot , stress what they call " advances . " As early as 1751 in his letter to Madame de Graffigny , Turgot defended inequality in wealth and in the division of the gains of industry , on the ground that someone must provide the means of subsistence in the interval and the implements with which the work is to be done . At several points in his Ref lexions ( 1700 ) he // dwells upon this same matter of avances , both under the share system in agriculture , and for materials , tools , and subsistence while learning a trade and carrying it on.88 Adam Smith says that , " In all arts and manufactures the greater part of the workmen stand in need of a master to advance them the materials of their work , and their wages and maintenance till it is completed . " 69 Unfortunately , this expression was picked up by some of his successors and made the basis of the wages-fund doctrine . Once more the palm probably belongs to J. B. Say for first stating clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so much superior to earlier methods . Through the use of machinery and the application of science it is able to harness natural forces which hitherto had gone to waste or had lain buried in the earth : The labor performed by natural agents , and that executed by pre-existent products to which we have given the name of capital , are closely analogous , and are perpetually confounded one with the other : for the tools and machines , which form a principal item of capital , are commonly but expedier ? s , more or less ingenious , for turning natural powers to account . The steamengine is but a complicated method of taking advantage of the elasticity of water reduced to vapor , and of the weight of the atmosphere . . . . Tools are but simple machines , and machines but complicated tools , whereby we enlarge the limited powers of our hands and fingers ; and both are , in many respects , mere means of obtaining the cooperation of natural agents.76 Again we see a tendency for the factors to merge or reassemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research , embodied its results in a technical device , and selected and perfected it for industrial uses , and that the function of capital , properly so-called , is ultimately that of financing the process . Say goes on to argue that , although capital is labor-saving , yet , chiefly through the increase in output and the lowering of the price , it is not labor-displacing . And this problem , with the expression of varying degrees of optimism , puzzled Ricardo , Mill and other classical economists.71 But , like Marx 's contention regarding " surplus value " and the hard bargain which the owners of capital are able to drive with labor , it is primarily a question of welfare and distribution rather than of production . Lauderdale and Ricardo both devoted considerable arithmetical zeal to computing when and how far it is really more economical to // employ time and labor for the manufacture of machines and other capital goods than to use older and more direct methods.72 A later refinement upon this question , perhaps first suggested by Sidgwick in 1883 , and sanctioned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sometimes less rather than more complicated than those previously in use , and may require less capital rather than more . Sidgwick agreed that hitherto inventions have generally worked the other way , but goes on to say that " this has not always been the case ; and , so far as I know , there is no definite reason why the inventions of the future should not be chiefly in the direction of simplifying and abbreviating industrial processes ; so that at each step of improvement the demand for capital will be restricted instead of being enlarged . " 73 As Clark points out , the very use of machinery to make other machines has often brought this about.74 Certainly , in so far as this is true , there is even less justification than was formerly thought for Bohm-Bawerk 's claim that there is an inherent merit or productiveness in the long-term , roundabout process . In his Positive Theory of Capital in 1888 he repeatedly asserts that " the most abundant product is obtained by the most lengthy and roundabout methods of production , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of present goods over future goods . " 76 But in this he seems to have exalted what is often an attendant circumstance into a relationship of cause and effect . The capitalistic mode of production , if we follow it back to its remote beginnings , is , to be sure , a time-consuming process ; but presumably in most cases each step has been shortened as compared with older methods , and so has the aggregate when volume of output is duly considered . It is , however , mainly a case of faulty emphasis . Coming back , finally , to that most disputed figure , the entrepreneur , it must be acknowledged that there is even yet no general agreement as to which of the several functions assigned to him is primary and which are only secondary . To Cantillon , the dealer and speculator in pre-factory days , he was a risk-taker , chiefly along commercial lines , buying goods and hiring labor at a fixed or contract price and selling at an " uncertain price . " 78 J. B. Say , while not granting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of duties as only few men could carry : He is called upon to estimate , with tolerable accuracy , the importance of the specific product , the probable amount of the demand , and the means of production ; sometimes to employ a great number of hands ; again to buy or order raw materials , to combine the workers , find consumers , to exercise a spirit of // order and economy , in short , the ability of the administrator . . . . In the course of such operations there are obstacles to be surmounted , anxieties to be overcome , misfortunes to be repaired , and expedients to be devised.77 The leader foreshadowed by John Stuart Mill had a capacity to make ends meet and a zeal for small economies greater than what could be expected from " hired servants . " 18 Mangoldt criticized his predecessors , Hermann and Riedel , for including among the functions of the entrepreneur some that could just as well be delegated to salaried employees , admitting , of course , that it requires some judgment and involves some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the distinctive role is that of ownership of the product and assumption of responsibility for any losses that . may occur.79 In his main text Francis A. Walker had a tendency sometimes to use the term " employer " as synonymous with " entrepreneur , " as though the main function were the hiring and management of labor ; but he was fully aware of the other duties which call for " incessant vigilance and a high degree of commercial genius . " 80 John Bates Clark seems to have found the life-history of the entrepreneur so varied and complex that he emphasizes somewhat different although not incompatible responsibilities at different points in his discussion . Sometimes it is the mercantile function of buying materials , hiring labor , and raising capital ; and profit is referred to as a " purely commercial gain . " Further on , the entrepreneur is described as the one who " makes the supreme decisions which now and again lead to changes in the business . " Admitting that under static conditions the entrepreneur has a passive role , Clark quite early outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider in his later work : ( 1 ) new mechanical processes ; ( 2 ) population increases ; ( 3 ) the growth of capital ; ( 4 ) changes in organization ; and ( 5 ) the multiplying and changing wants of consumers . To these , in the Essentials , he added a possible sixth : the depletion of natural resources . These constitute the problem or sphere of activity of the business leader . But he lays chief stress upon the task of coordination ? seeing that the other factors are directed into the most productive and profitable channels , and that they are employed most efficiently . Risk also inevitably comes into the picture , but Clark in an early article says that the entrepreneur is a risk-maker , implying that he is mainly instrumental in concocting projects and persuading others to participate with him in their execution . The corporate form is particularly adapted for this purpose because it distributes the risks among " good loss-bearers . " The // common stockholders are declared to be entrepreneurs as well as capitalists.81 Alfred Marshall , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that long period of incubation , there is also some lack of unity in the final result . Industrial organization , as already noted , is first discussed broadly and somewhat impersonally , without any clear distinction being made between the capitalist and the entrepreneur . But ultimately the ideal manufacturer and his qualifications appear more vividly and convincingly : He must have the power of forecasting the broad movements of production and consumption , of seeing where there is an opportunity for supplying a new commodity that will meet a real want , or improving the plan of producing an old commodity . He must be able to judge cautiously and undertake risks boldly ; and he must of course understand the materials and machinery used in his trade.82 The author 's real insight is shown in what he goes on to say about the role of the employer as a natural leader of men ; and in the remark toward the end of the volume that " business power is highly non-specialized " consisting of such faculties as " judgment , promptness , resource , carefulness and steadfastness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers can be mentioned . Frederick B. Hawley , the businessman turned economist , was quite positive in his opinion that risk-taking constitutes the sole title of the enterpriser to a profit , and that in so far as the capitalist shares in the risk he too becomes an entrepreneur.84 Along the same line and better known to the present generation of scholars , is Frank Knight 's contention that uncertainty or " believing where we can not know " is the crux of the situation , and what calls forth intelligence and courage in deciding what to do and how to do it . This it is which gives rise to " a new economic functionary , the entrepreneur . " 83 Joseph Schumpeter , who was never lacking in positiveness , denies , however , quite categorically that the entrepreneur , as such , is really a risk-bearer . " Risk-taking , " he says , " is in no case an element of the entrepreneurial function . " S8 His analysis of the motives of the entrepreneur , the keenness required , and the difficulties to be overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But like Clark , he holds that it is the capitalist or investor who actually " holds the bag " ? at most the entrepreneur in his capacity as capitalist . The real function of the entrepreneur is that of an innovator or maker of " new combinations . " This , he thinks , is often a temporary or intermittent task or relationship ; and , as we shall see more fully in a later chapter , he // has worked out a theory of the business cycle based upon the tendency of such leaders to occur in swarms or clusters , each induced or called into being more or less by the others , so that we have periodic booms and depressions.S7 Doubtless , all things considered , it is just as well not to quarrel too much about which of the functions of the entrepreneur has priority or supremacy , any more than about the number of factors as a whole . Whether as an individual , or now more typically as a member of a group , he must , in a sense , be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewpoint is that there shall be at all times enough such men to foresee possibilities and discover opportunities , and to take steps to meet them . Any man who , with his training and experience and all the aids at his disposal , can contrive and plan a larger number of wise and useful activities than he is able to carry out singly and alone , and who is able to persuade others of the fact , is justified in setting himself up as a business leader , giving directions to subordinates , and making the critical decisions . He is himself one of the dynamic forces , capable of making changes and , as we hope , progress or improvements . There may be risks , but some of them can be insured against ; and , as for the others , his own ability and his judgment in choosing associates and subordinates wiser than himself can go far to minimize them . 5 . EFFICIENCY AND THE PROPORTION OF FACTORS Each phase of organization and management has its own history which might easily extend into a chapter or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything suggested by J. B. Say and Mill , and elaborated by Marshall ; but there is considerable overlapping and interdependence among the processes , and the later additions are generally derivatives of the earlier ones . All of them help to dispel any notion that the successful conduct of a business comes about by rule of thumb or by trial and error , or that the different factors and elements somehow fall more or less automatically into a certain patterns like the colored bits of glass in a kaleidescope . Here would be included the progress of ideas respecting : specialization and the division of labor ; the theory of industrial location ; standardization and increasing mechanization ; the law of diminishing returns and the best proportion of factors ; optimum size and the integration of steps or processes ; scientific management , which has come to include substantially all the others ; and now , perhaps , automation . Only a few of these can be dealt with here . Adam Smith 's initial chapters on the division of labor are , for // various reasons , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite clearly two of the forms of such specialization , that among occupations and that within a given trade such as pin-making ; and he somewhat less clearly indicates the third form of territorial or geographical division which is the basis of international trade and is further developed under that heading.88 He also recognized the dependence of the system upon the size of the market and volume of output . Where conditions favored , as they did to an increasing degree in his time , he saw the advantages in the growth of dexterity , the saving of the time which would otherwise be lost in change of work and tools , and in the spur which minute attention to a single process gave to invention . But some of his successors and the historians have discovered that this passage also was not very original , and , furthermore , that it is not altogether sound and complete . Learned classical scholars have recalled that Socrates in Plato 's Republic is made to say that " all things are produced more plentifully and easily and of better quality when one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it at the right time , and leaves other things . " 89 Sir William Petty had enumerated division of labor as one of the reasons for the superiority of Dutch manufacture and shipbuilding.9 ? Discussion of the advantages of division of labor and of its relation to exchange is one of the significant points of similarity which Hazel Roberts notes between Boisguilbert and Adam Smith.91 Also early in the eighteenth century , that somewhat rakish Dr. Bernard de Mandeville had written about " dividing and subdividing labor " and its advantages both as between trades and within a given trade such as watch-making.92 Edwin Cannan , the most notable editor of Adam Smith , finds other parallel passages in Hutcheson and in a French encyclopaedia article published in 1751 , in which the example of pin-making is also used.93 On the side of completeness , it has been noted that Joseph Harris in 1757 had suggested other advantages not found in Smith , such as adaptation of the job to the strength and skill of the employee , and avoiding a plethora of tools which would otherwise lie idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Economy of Machinery and Manufactures ( 1832 ) as a reference , stresses the advantage of classifying labor , especially where women and children are employed ; and refers to John Rae 's emphasis upon full utilization of tools.95 But at least the criticism made by Lauderdale , Cannan , and others that Smith expected too much from division of labor in the way of new inventions , is hardly justified , because , if we read to the bottom of the page , we find that he qualifies his statement and says that , as industry becomes more complicated , the function of invention falls // largely to a " peculiar tribe or class of philosophers . " 96 Although so far along in his book as to seem like an afterthought , Smith also acknowledged that division of labor had a possible disadvantage in its dwarfing effect upon the worker , and said this could only be counteracted through proper provision for education.97 J. B. Say brought the two aspects together in his treatment of the subject.98 This , again , pertains chiefly to welfare economics . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it is essentially the same as the territorial division of labor . The bearing of situation in the determination of rent and land values was , as already noted , recognized quite early ; and the general position of the classical writers in favor of free trade was based on the idea of mutual advantage through specialization by each country in the products for which its resources were best fitted . But the subject became involved in the controversy , started by Torrens and Ricardo and continued by Mill and Cairnes , over the relative mobility of capital and labor as between nations and between the different parts of the same nation , known as " non-competing groups " and " the doctrine of comparative costs . " To this we may return in the chapter on International Trade.99 Otherwise , and as a domestic or regional problem , location theory is a late development . In actual practice , historical , sentimental , and even accidental influences have probably played a more important part in the location of plants and industries than any scientific weighing of alternatives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von Thiinen , in his Isolierte Staat ( 1826 ) , for first stating such a theory as it applies to agriculture , and perhaps for setting the pace toward its extension to other industries , especially by his German successors . Postulating an area in which there was a city as the chief market , surrounded by farm land of uniform quality , von Thunen worked out a series of concentric circles or zones where it would be most economical to raise the different crops , allowing for their relative perishability and difficulty of transportation.100 Alfred Marshall in 1890 included in his discussion of organization a chapter on " Localized Industries " in which he pointed out the factors , such as natural resources , political favors , traditional skill , accessibility to the market , auxiliary and supplementary trades , etc. , which cause industries to concentrate in given places ; and he returned to the subject later in his book where he developed the concept of " situation rent " as " the money value of the advantages of situation " which one business enjoys over another less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject was fed by Alfred Weber 's Standort der Industrien ; but his analysis was found to be faulty and laid too much emphasis upon // manufacturing costs as compared with total costs and demand.i02 A much better balanced theory has been evolved by Bertil Ohlin , August Losch , our own Edgar Hoover of the University of Michigan , and others.103 Without attempting to apportion praise in detail ( Hoover and Stolper give rather extravagant commendation to Losch ) , it can be said that the principle arrived at is the now familiar one of general equilibrium which since Walras , Marshall , and Pareto has been generally applied throughout the whole field of economics . We are not unduly startled when Losch tells us : An entrepreneur therefore makes his choice within the whole district and within his market area in such a way that his profit , within the narrow limits still left by the interdependence within the economy , shall be the greatest.104 The same holds true when Hoover gives such a prominent place to " transfer costs " as a part of the aggregate . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief aim of private enterprise ; and have known for some time that distribution costs often constitute more than half of the total price of commodities ! An industry may choose to locate with reference to its major cost or problem , whether this be materials , power , labor supply , or market ; but according to Walrasian equations it should rather locate where the different pulls or forces come to a balance ? where it has the lowest aggregate cost with due regard to volume and the price it can obtain in a competitive market . Incidentally , Losch gives the overly ambitious business some good advice , to the effect that a smaller and more compact area is often more profitable . ' " Scientific Management , to which reference has been made in an earlier chapter as a feature of the professionalization of modem business , 106 is also closely allied to division of labor ; and one of the recent texts in management traces it back to Adam Smith . The beginnings of the practice itself at least date from the 1880 's when Frederick Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steel Works in Pennsylvania . The term " scientific " seems to have been adopted at a conference of engineers with Louis Brandeis in 1910 when a railway rate case was pending ; and was used in 1911 by Taylor himself in the title of a series of articles , later gathered into a book . Since the more general adoption of its central ideas in most progressive industries during the next decade or more , the word is now less commonly used , and the Taylor Society , which for many years carried on an educational campaign , has graduated into the present Society for the Advancement of Management . The short and more emphatic definition of the system , used // by Taylor himself , is that of finding " the best way " of doing a task and getting it done in that way ; and the somewhat more elaborate description , first stated in Taylor 's Principles , is still the one most often quoted : First . They develop a science for each element of a man 's work , which replaces the old rule-of-thumb method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach and develop the workman , whereas in the past he chose his own work and trained himself as best he could . Third . They heartily cooperate with the men so as to insure all of the work being done in accordance with the principles of the science which has been developed . Fourth . There is almost equal division of the work and the responsibility between the management and the workman. ' ? 7 Neglecting , as we must here , the more technical aspect of the subject and the later contributions , it is of interest as before to inquire briefly into the antecedents and anticipations . Both Copley , the leading biographer of Frederick Taylor , and C. B. Thompson , who wrote one of the more reflective earlier expositions of scientific management , find some suggestions of scientific methods in Charles Babbage 's Economy of Manufactures ( 1832 ) already mentioned above ; but the world was too busy and the separation of scientific research from practical life was too wide to permit following them up.108 But there is other evidence that the idea of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Robert Hoxie have indicated to be the distinctive feature of the system , was in the air shortly before Taylor started his experiments . Stanley Jevons has an interesting passage on the intensity of labor and fatigue , in which he considers the proper size of the spade used by a workman , the economical weight of mail to be carried by a postman , and , referring to studies made by Babbage and by Coulomb , the best methods of handling heavy objects and of walking or marching so as to avoid undue fatigue.10B General Walker was a bit later , but surely did not need to have read Jevons to write what he did about the importance of organization and proper planning to the efficiency of labor : In an establishment where each person has his place and perfectly knows his duty , where work never chokes its channels and never runs low , where nothing ever comes out wrong-endforemost , where there is no fretting and chafing , where there are no blunders and no catastrophes , where there is no clamor // and no fuss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operatives of a noisy , ill-disciplined , badly-organized shop .. " And he makes here another of his vivid comparisons to army life and the marching of troops . Alfred Marshall showed that he understood another feature of scientific management when , as a youth of seventeen studying mathematics , he found that by taking a break every fifteen minutes he got along more rapidly than if he kept constantly at it ; and when he noted how a skilled workman lettering the sign on a window paused after each stroke.ili Very likely Frederick Taylor , who had to give up his ambition to go to Harvard because of impaired eyesight , and who was not a bookish man , was quite innocent of any knowledge of such precedents . He drew his inspiration rather from Professor Wentworth 's method of determining how long the math assignments should be at Exeter ; perhaps from Henry Towne 's paper on " The Engineer as Economist " before the Mechanical Engineers in 1886 ; and , most of all , from the labor situation he found in the Midvale Steel Works . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equilibrium idea which has all too tardily been adopted to synthesize and clarify concepts such as diminishing returns , increasing returns , constant cost , and the advantages of large-scale production , which had hitherto been left scattered and disjointed . It is the principle that , at a particular time and under given circumstances , there is an ideal combination of land , labor , capital , and enterprise which will bring the best results . The actual practice of such a balance or adjustment , giving rise to the successive economic stages , is as old as civilization . But the ultimate formulation of the rule had to wait until recognition of the fact that the same general truths and tendencies prevail throughout all stages and in all branches of industry . It is essentially a dynamic law , and , as already indicated , the task of choice and coordination is the primary function of the entrepreneur . The law of diminishing returns , as stated by Sir Edward West , lawyer and public servant , and by Malthus almost simultaneously and apparently with complete independence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physical or natural law , analogous to the law of gravitation . It merely described how things are built and how they operate , and was confined to the quantitative aspect of production . For the authors it had special pertinence to the population problem and the Corn Law controversy . Hence it was limited to agriculture or related activities , and so it remained for the better part of a century . Even so , it was not really a new discovery . Xenophon // had shown an understanding of the number of yokes of oxen and how many workmen it was profitable to use on a farm , but , strangely enough , did not think the same limitations applied to silvermining.112 Antonio Serra , the Italian , in 1613 had gone so far as to contrast the relative flexibility of the trades with the rigidity of farming as to the amount of wheat to be sown on a given acreage.113 The short commentary which Turgot wrote on a thesis in 1768 , with its comparison to the stretching of a spring , is acknowledged to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything up to that time or for years afterward ; but , as noted above , it was not really published until 1808 , only shortly before West and Malthus.114 The Earl of Lauderdale considered that he was only stating an accepted agricultural rule when he said in 1804 that " there can be no system of culture that can benefit from unlimited application of capital . " H Of the two majors , West probably has somewhat the edge upon Malthus in the matter of soundness , if not of priority . But for discretionary reasons his essay was published anonymously and never received the credit it merited . He admitted that division of labor and the use of machinery tend to make agriculture more productive , but held that this is soon counteracted by " the necessity of having recourse to land inferior to that already in tillage , or of cultivating the same land more expensively . " " 6 Whereas West generally deplored high rents and opposed the Corn Laws , Malthus , with somewhat characteristic inconsistency , made high rents seem to be an evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both writers thought that manufacturing , in contrast with the usual tendency of agriculture , is constantly using better rather than poorer facilities , and is therefore blessed with increasing returns.118 Ricardo 's reasoning throughout is much the same . He had little patience with Adam Smith 's somewhat physiocratic claim that nature cooperates more fully with man in agriculture than in manufacturing . And , in friendly disagreement with Malthus , he thought England 's greatest advantage lay in devoting more and more of its labor and capital to manufactures and obtaining more of its food supply through trade . It could scarcely be expected that one who believed that wages are ultimately determined by the cost of living , and that the price of goods is based on the cost of labor , would be other than a believer in abolishing the Corn Laws and promoting the fullest development of manufacturing . " Thus the classical tradition was firmly established and remained " gospel truth " for a long time . McCulloch was even more absolute in his assertion of less than proportionate returns in agriculture , while // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transition figure and still believing that agriculture had great possibilities of improvement , remained faithful to the general theory.121 John Stuart Mill called the law of diminishing returns as applied to agriculture " the most important proposition in political economy . " Living and writing in somewhat more fortunate times of peace , he was , like Senior , disposed to make more liberal concessions as to the effects of improvements and scientific advancement ; but these , he said , were only " temporary supercessions " of the inexorable law . He did , however , make a step forward in emphasizing that manufacturing itself was affected , because its raw materials and the food supply of its workers were derived from agriculture and related sources . Yet these were usually such a small item in the entire cost of manufacture that he thinks the industry as a whole is subject to decreasing rather than increasing expense.122 This was also substantially the view of Francis A. Walker in 1883 ? that " mechanical processes are not subject to the law of diminishing returns . " ' " Alfred Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit the law to land and agriculture , and developed the law of increasing returns for other industry where the internal and external economies of largescale production were assumed to prevail almost indefinitely . He also expressly stated that " diminishing returns " refers to output and not to value.124 But , as suggested above , the more comprehensive and sounder view represented in the phrase " proportion of factors " had to come when the full implications of the marginal utility and marginal productivity theories of value and distribution , developed after 1870 by Jevons , the Austrians , and Clark , were realized . The Ricardians , with their cost-theory , had generally admitted the marginal idea only with reference to land and rent . Now , perhaps , as previously suggested , because of a slight check in the prosperity of manufacturing , and premonitions of reaching a saturation point in the market , it was discovered that all the factors , with their varying costs and alternative uses , are finally subject to the same rules ? marginal productivity and the law of diminishing returns . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights , the law is temporarily suspended by the progress of technology and the gains of mass production . It is still there and operating , and a new balance or equilibrium will be approached even though it may never be arrived at . Once more the question of priorities and of the relative contributions made by different writers must be largely disregarded . Certainly , the name of John Bates Clark again stands high on the list . In his Philosophy of Wealth ( 1886 ) , it is true , he still tended to cling to // the orthodox , classical statement to the effect that manufacturing , creating " form utilities , " is emancipated from diminishing returns , while agriculture , supplying " elementary utilities " is subject to it.125 But his independence and originality of thought soon manifested themselves in the series of articles and addresses that formed the basis of his later books . In an address in 1889 he stated clearly that " the general law of diminishing returns is two-sided " or " reversible , " applying in turn to whichever of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illustration of its universality he refers to the problem of determining how many men to hire to operate a mill or shop , or to sail a ship.126 In making land an integral part of capital-goods Clark naturally brings both under the same rule of marginal utilization . In all branches of industry a point is ultimately reached where additional units of any single factor , other factors remaining constant , are no longer profitable.127 Much credit for helping to straighten things out is due , as Fetter , Lionel Robbins , and others have acknowledged , 128 to John R. Commons in his early book , The Distribution of Wealth , published in 1893 . Commons has usually been regarded as a labor investigator and not especially as a theorist ; but his two chapters on diminishing returns are really quite consistent with his later role as one of the founders of the Institutional School . He puts the whole matter of the choice and combination of factors upon a price or financial basis , just as the average entrepreneur views it . Whatever the industry , the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the quantity . Under fully competitive conditions , where the output of any one producer is too small to have appreciable effect upon the market price , and where his interest is therefore in producing as large a quantity as possible , the two will largely correspond with one another , and the consumer ( and presumably the population theorist ) , interested in abundance , will be adequately served and protected . But where elements of monopoly enter in , as Commons believed they did , especially with respect to land ownership , the producer may limit his output to the point of maximum profit and the consumer be compelled to pay a higher price . To the entrepreneur the other factors of production appear as expenses . It is out of his receipts that he expects to pay them . His receipts are the value of his product , and this is subject to the law of diminishing returns .... But not only are expenditures limited by profitable receipts ; the successful undertaker also distributes his expenditures among the different factors of production in such a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns . In this way // he gets the highest net returns from his combined expenditures . This adjustment of the different factors depends upon the prices and efficiency of each.i29 Thus , in Commons ' analysis the law of diminishing returns seems to absorb the law of diminishing utility , the concepts of marginal utility and monopoly price , and substantially the whole theory of value and distribution . Yet Commons , like some other pioneers , did not build a completely symmetrical structure or give a precise name to his theory . Carver in 1904 , like Clark , used the word " proportions " several times in an informal way to describe how the factors are adjusted to one another . He also cites Commons as one of a limited number of readings 139 But perhaps it was Davenport in his Economics of Enterprise ( 1913 ) , with his chapters on " the law of returns " and the " law of proportions , " who played the part of Amerigo Vespucci and gave the new principle " a local habitation and a name . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able exposition ) .131 Fetter , shortly afterward , gave a somewhat broader meaning to his " principle of proportionality . " Although himself usually regarded as a " welfare " rather than a " price " economist , he also used the financial as opposed to the quantity standard in measuring retums.132 A general economics text of today , such as for example , Gemmill and Blodgett 's Economics : Principles and Problems , is fully warranted in incorporating all this accumulated wisdom , in using the phrase " law of variable proportions " as applied to the factors , and in adopting the value test . Incidentally , the one mentioned , like its chief authority on this subject , Professor Carver , in his chapter , creates some confusion in thought by separating the treatment of the entrepreneur from the other factors , and only belatedly and without a complete tie-in , recognizing that when the size of the business is involved he also has his limitations and must bow to the law of diminishing returns ) . " Indeed , if it were not for this discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate examples , like Fetter 's about the number of copies of a reference book a library should have for a large class , or the minimum number of chairs that a family should own if all members are to be properly provided for , we might still contend that the law of diminishing returns , or its modern representative , the law of variable proportions , is primarily a physical and natural law , and continue to regard it as a manifestation of the niggardliness of nature . Modern agriculture makes such a large use of capital or equipment , and consists to such a degree of auxiliary manufacturing processes , and manufacturing , in turn , draws so heavily upon natural // forces and materials , that the two types of industry approximate one another and operate tinder the same rules . As to how much it helps to reduce everything to monetary terms instead of dealing in bushels , pounds or man-hours , there are other skeptics besides Alfred Marshall . Some students may prefer to take their economics on the installment plan instead of in homeopathic doses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term " diminishing returns " or some kindred phrase is used in three different senses in economic parlance and that these , in turn , represent somewhat different interests . First , there is the historical meaning , touched upon by nearly all the writers and often not very clearly differentiated from the others , relating to the depletion of natural resources such as soil , iron ore , coal and oil , and the depreciation of buildings and equipment which may make a plant antiquated . Second , there is the earlier usage to describe a falling off in proportional quantity of goods when the factors are maladjusted . And , third , there is the financial interpretation , just referred to , which considers the lowering of value-output and profit , whether due to an actual decrease in relative quantity or to a decline in price with increasing quantity under the principle of diminishing or marginal utility . Everyone , with the possible exception of the " get-rich-quick " exploiter , is more or less concerned about the problem of waste , exhaustion , and depreciation . The consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the maintenance and possible increase of quantity-output and a drop in price . But the third viewpoint is strictly that of the entrepreneur ; and the question remains open as to whether his interests will always coincide with those of the other parties .

The consumer 's wants , present and anticipated , are the chief incentive for his own economic activities , and , in the commercial world , for those of the other parties who endeavor to serve him for a consideration . They not only absorb his income but give him an incentive to increase it . This implies that the discussion of consumption is primary , and that only as economists demonstrate an ability to understand and explain the principles of both production and consumption can they be considered competent to develop the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . Indeed , it may be doubted whether any treatise on economics which does not begin and end with an adequate tribute to the consumer and his interests is really social science at all , worthy of study in a liberal arts college or university . What has happened in the past two decades or more is rather that the interest in consumption and the facts relating to it have transcended the limits of a chapter or two , and blossomed forth into a whole shelf of books ? among them those by Elizabeth Hoyt , Persia Campbell , Ruby Norris , Margaret Reid , and , lest it may be thought that only women are capable of such a product , those by Leland Gordon and Charles Wyand.l Our own simple task is to note the principal topics dealt with in these texts and to trace the course of their evolution . With some overlapping , they include such matters as the origin and expansion of wants , their classification and embodiment in standards of living ; the principles of choice , leading , as it is hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the analysis of family budgets or expenditures . The importance of the standard of living has necessarily been referred to already in the treatment of population and the rise of modem capitalistic production . The perils of the consumer under the doctrine of self-interest and with the growth of monopoly , have likewise been touched upon . Problems of credit buying , saving versus spending , and the underconsumption theory of business cycles , are destined to come up again and to remain with us for some time to come . 322 // 2 . THE MULTIPLICATION OF WANTS Elizabeth Hoyt is doubtless correct in stating that the chief reason why Smith , Mill , and company wrote so meagerly on consumption was that they did not know enough about it.2 Every conscientious author has at times experienced the same difficulty . The subject could hardly be regarded as a problem for the economist until it had become such for the average individual and for the community . Once more we had to wait for the dawn of a more democratic spirit and of the welfare concept in dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken for granted , and so long as food , clothing , and household furnishings were considered as purely private family matters , with much of the final processing being done in the home , they could hardly be made the objects of scientific investigation . Wesley Mitchell 's notable essay on " The Backward Art of Spending Money , " first published in 1912 , is now somewhat dated in spots , particularly where he indicates the difficulty of applying mechanical aids in the home ; but his description of the multiplicity of demands made upon the time , energy , and intelligence of the housekeeper still meets with a sympathetic response.3 Even with all the aforementioned aids and the increasing number of ready-made commodities , the burden upon the principal buyer and upon those who act at her behest , while it may have changed somewhat in character , has scarcely diminished in weight . Brands , the advertising pages , and the more disinterested tests and recommendations of the Consumers ' Union , may help ; but the number of choices to be made is legion . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the diet , for example ? and of experimental and behavioristic psychology , is undoubtedly helpful in the understanding and guidance of human wants . Dr. Hoyt is evidently distressed by some of the hypothetical anthropology or the lack of any other kind , noted in Adam Smith and other classical writers , and provides a thorough analysis of the way in which such cultural traits and tendencies probably developed . ' We can not be too sure that the modernized , social type of hedonism adopted by Hume , Bentham , and Mill , with its nicely calculated balancing of pains and pleasures , was really responsible for their attitude and their deficiencies with respect to this subject . Utilitarianism , as it came to be called , carried with it a certain degree of asceticism and a spirit of thrift and industry which often seemed to frown upon present enjoyments . Adam Smith 's emphasis upon the practical virtues has been noted ; and on the Continent J. B. Say defined consumption as the destruction of utilities . // Senior demurred a bit at such an unhappy outlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption , analogous to the physiocratic division between productive and unproductive occupations.5 From this viewpoint , the average workingman , as he eats his meager repast and partakes of the other limited satisfactions which nature and the economic system vouchsafe to him , must always keep uppermost in his consciousness the thought of conserving and building up his strength so that he can work so much the harder and turn out more goods . A similar degree of materialism and reversal of the natural order of things , was involved in the oft-stated reliance upon a rising standard of living to quicken ambition and check the birth rate . Advocates of the shorter workday , such as Robert Owen , Michael Sadler , and others in this period , did not always receive enthusiastic support from the economists . The value of leisure and of the more intangible , cultural satisfactions had to be rediscovered . " But several of the classical economists did have an inkling as to the origin of wants and their power to change and grow ? that they are not purely instinctive and static but often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expansion . Recognition of a standard of living involved some classification of wants and of the goods best calculated to gratify them , and some realization that , in spite of class lines and grave inequalities of wealth and income , imitation and social capillarity do operate . Adam Smith , although he pays only passing tribute to the subject of consumption , does have scattered comments upon it here and there . At the very beginning he rejoices that among civilized and thriving nations " a workman , even of the lowest and poorest order , if he is frugal and industrious , may enjoy a greater share of the necessaries and conveniences of life than it is possible for any savage to acquire . " 7 A bit further along , in one of those broad topic sentences of which he was so fond , he adds amusements to the list ; but toward the end , in discussing what would now be called a sales-tax , he has again only two classes , " necessaries and luxuries . " His comparisons , from time to time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon oatmeal in Scotland rather than the use of wheat bread , and the more firmly fixed demand for leather shoes in England than in Scotland ? showed an understanding of the social or traditional as well as the financial influence . In speaking of the growing supply of the precious metals , he says that " With the greater part of rich people , the chief enjoyment of riches is the parade of riches . " On the Continent , J. B. Say , who was the first to give Consumption coordinate rank , divides goods rather loosely into those " which conduce to the satisfaction of real // needs " ( sustenance , health , contentment ) , and those " which minister to sensuality , pride , and caprice " ( articles of display and ostentation ) . He deplores the dominance of fashion " which takes upon itself to discard things before they have lost their utility , or even their freshness . " 10 Nassau Senior , who , like Malthus , relates consumption mainly to population , introduces the separate category of " decencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual must use in order to preserve his existing rank in society . " He sees that they vary at different times and places , but thinks that the desire for them or the fear of losing them is the most powerful check upon population . " The term " decencies " is adopted by Francis Walker , who calls consumption the real " dynamics of wealth , " and who likewise makes his discussion of population a part of it.12 Carver , also , while stating that fine discriminations among commodities are difficult to make , regards the term " decencies " as especially helpful in showing the weight of public opinion.12 Thus we may conclude that necessities , decencies , and comforts have met with general approval , even among the most thrifty souls . But there has always been controversy over luxuries upon both moral and economic grounds . By some they are condemned as extravagance and heartless prodigality , while by others they have been credited with being the leading-string to progress in technology and wealth . Here , as so often , the pro 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some writers merely describe things as they are without expressing an opinion as to how they should be . J. R. McCulloch , like Charles Lamb 's " superannuated man " who thoroughly enjoyed seeing other people work , is perhaps most positive in favoring luxury : To make men industrious ? to make them shake off the lethargy which benumbs their faculties when in a rude and degraded condition , they must be inspired with a taste for comforts , luxuries , and enjoyments . When this is done , their artificial wants become equally clamorous with those that are strictly necessary , and increase exactly as the means of gratifying them increase . . . . In highly civilized societies , new products and new modes of enjoyment are constantly presenting themselves as motives to exertion and as a means for its reward . Perseverance is , in consequence , given to all the operations of industry ; and idleness , and its attendant evils , almost entirely disappear.14 Senior , again , while somewhat more objective , declares that the desire for distinction is " the most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious source of distinction is the possession of superior wealth . To seem more rich , or , to use a common expression , // to keep up a better appearance than those within their own sphere of comparison , is , with almost all men who are placed beyond the fear of actual want , the ruling principle of their conduct . " 15 John Rae , the Scottish-American economist , is perhaps the most interesting of the writers of the early period on this topic , because he anticipates the general thesis and some of the phraseology of Thorstein Veblen 's Theory of the Leisure Class . Incidentally , he quotes rather liberally not only from Adam Smith 's injunctions on thrift but from Storch , the German-Russian economist who held similar views . Rae concedes toward the end of his essay that the desire for luxuries has often , as in the case of glass , led to the spread of invention and other improvements . But these , he thinks , are only indirect and accidental effects . Its main influence is to discourage the accumulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuous are incapable of gratifying this passion . . . . All luxuries occasion a loss to society in proportion to their amount . The industry employed in their formation generates no provision for future wants , and may be said to be expended in vain . " 18 As might be expected from the long perspective of the Historical School of which he was a founder , Wilhelm Roscher takes a more moderate if not an equivocal view . After reviewing the history and general prevalence and effect of luxury in different nations , some good and some bad , he gives his approval to the form existing at the middle of the century in England , because " it supposes particularly that there is not too marked a difference in the resources of the people .... A proper gradation of national wants is best guaranteed by a good distribution of the national resources . " He suggests an idea similar to that of David Hume in 1752 , that luxurious habits on the part of a nation may be like an accumulation of fat in the human body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The contribution made by luxury and the desire for something more than the essentials , was evidently a favorite topic with Walter Bagehot of the London Economist ; and Dr. Mixter recommends his exposition as an antidote or balance for the criticisms of John Rae . Bagehot looked upon luxurious articles as capital if they reward and stimulate labor . Referring to the gaieties of the West End of London and its " seemingly thoughtless enjoyment , " he yet declares : It is the bait by which the fish is caught . To lead a bright life like that , at least that their children may lead it or something like it , many times as many as those who now live it , share and save . And if it be good for the poor that capital should be saved , then the momentary luxury which causes that saving , is good for the poor.1 ' // But it was , in turn : as a counteragent for such a comfortable philosophy that social science teachers of fifty years ago and more , and to some extent since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the style wordy and difficult , but frequently gained here his first insight into the pride , sham , and pretense which characterize so much of our social life and institutions : the patronizing attitude toward gainful employment ; pecuniary standards of taste , especially in the matter of dress and personal adornment ; an inordinate emphasis upon wealth , pedigrees , and archaic traits and practices ; and so on . Even our religious ceremonials and our educational system are found not to be wholly free from such invidious distinctions . Meanwhile the language of vituperation was being enriched by numerous terms , such as " pecuniary emulation , " " predatory occupations , " " vicarious leisure , " and " conspicuous waste . " 19 Remarkably little is said in the writings of nineteenth-century economists about such matters as merchandising , marketing , sales management , and advertising ? all those business activities which are calculated to make the average consumer dissatisfied with his present possessions and attainments , and to give greater prestige to the new than to the old . College and university courses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects , had to wait until after 1910 . Those who , like John Stuart Mill , had a division which they called " Exchange , " devoted it primarily to the exposition of money , credit , and international trade . The reasons for such grave omissions , closely akin to those given for the neglect of consumption in general , are to be found in the assumption of static conditions and the failure to give proper scope to the entrepreneur as a dynamic force both in production and in demand-creation . Present-day authors on advertising and selling assure us that this neglect was not due to the absence of such phenomena to be observed and studied ? that the art is really a very old one , dating back to Egyptian and Babylonian times , and perhaps beyond.20 Naturally , its full development had to wait for a knowledge of printing and the subsequent improvements , partly cause and partly effect , in typography , lithography , paper-manufacture , etc . But as soon as the economy passed beyond the self-sufficing stage ? if there ever was such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when everything was still local , sales talk and the " disposition to truck " manifested themselves . There were pedlars and other traveling salesmen , display , brands , signs , and crude advertisements . The Industrial Revolution , we have seen , occurred in large measure because of an expansion of the market and the demand for more goods . The gild monopolies were broken down , transportation improved , and // lower prices and increased purchasing power together with the relaxation of class lines , brought a richer life within the reach of all . Mass production tended to catch up with demand and called for broader and more aggressive modes of sale . Instead of waiting for the potential customer to discover his own want and to seek the means of gratifying it , the present-day manufacturer and merchant use their imaginations and their judgment in conceiving a new product , frequently invading the very home of the consumer and importuning him to come and buy . If he does not at once have the wherewithal to pay cash for it , let him have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still , to be sure , the problem of sales-resistance . The National Resources Committee concluded from its study in 1937 that it takes about thirty years to get a new invention like the automobile , the radio , television , and the airplane really placed , and to demonstrate its social effects . Part of this interval is , of course , taken up in the pilot-plant stage , when the " gremlins " are eliminated and the article prepared for large-scale manufacture . A larger part is absorbed in its conversion from being a luxury for the rich to a comfort or even a necessity for almost everyone.21 This involves a gradual lowering of the cost of production ( perhaps the surrender of temporary monopoly profit ) , and overcoming the conservatism and hesitation of new s'rata of the buying public , until , it may be , a saturation point is retched . For smaller and less expensive commodities the " educational " process may be more rapid . Nystrom , however , thinks that for any change of fashion or habit there is a limit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer is open to suggestion and education and that advertising and selling do influence purchasing is beyond question , but that consumer demand is wholly and even largely a result of producer 's promotion is a theory which has proved exceedingly expensive to many headstrong advertisers who have put their millions of dollars as well as their faith into it.22 Other writers are inclined to give somewhat more weight to aggressive selling . John Maurice Clark regards " the guidance of wants by business enterprise " as a positive force to be reckoned with.23 Neil Borden , who has , perhaps , made the most thorough study of the whole subject , leaves no doubt but that advertising and other forms of trade promotion increase the number of wants and at the same time offer a better choice of goods with which to gratify them : // While the attitudes which favor consumption of various products are determined by the entire milieu , aggressive selling and advertising have been important forces leading to the adoption and the general acceptance of new products . They have played a particularly important part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field of production goods or that of consumption goods , he considers such expenditures to be ultimately advantageous to all parties and holds that they should be put down as " growth costs " in the same way as those for research.25 Charles Wyand 's chapter on " Commercial Manipulation of Choice , " based upon a survey of many reports and cases , is much less confident as to the mutual benefits , and represents the consumer as frequently being " played upon . " Y8 3 . CHOICES Economic life under democratic conditions and where wholesome forms of competition prevail , is largely a matter of choices . This is another of those broad and somewhat elusive propositions which seem to comprehend the whole of economics . It is implicit in the entire Austrian or marginal utility theory of value and distribution , as , for example , in Carl Menger 's insistent and repetitious discussion of the " causal interconnections " and " mutual interdependence " of goods 21 Fetter makes it the keystone of his exposition of value , when he says : In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only partially met we are under the necessity of making a choice as to which desires shall be met . This involves a choice ? and therefore a comparison ? among things . . . . It is a large part of the task of economics to study in detail the large groups of choices which are thus made.28 Without professing any high degree of originality , Lionel Robbins finds the unifying principle in economics , not primarily in exchange , but in the choices made by individuals . " Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses . " 29 And in his presidential address before the American Economic Association in 1949 , Howard Ellis of California gave warning against the cramping effects of both private monopoly and too much bureaucracy , and declared that " Economics is necessarily a matter fundamentally of individual choice and is thus necessarily also libertarian and individualistic . " 30 Probably in the present century greater progress , both statistical // and expository , has been made in this phase of economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully in the next section , we have been very much concerned with the various levels of expenditure and the slow and unequal adjustment of income to rising prices . But , as we look back , we again are gratified to find that our intellectual ancestors were not wholly benighted , and that there were critics and prophets in those days who had premonitions of what seems to us like plain common sense . Their fame and teaching has only had to wait until conditions were ripe for the more general acceptance of the true gospel . The first important step was taken by those writers who recognized that utility is not only an attendant but the dominant factor in the determination of value . Cantillon admitted the importance of the demand side of the market , and wrote of " intrinsic value " ; and John Law , Harris , Adam Smith , and Ricardo played with the idea of " value in use . " But all of them regarded cost or scarcity as the major consideration.31 John Locke ( 1691 ) was perhaps the earliest writer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he called it ; and Caliani , who translated Locke 's work on money into Italian , followed him in making utility , or the ability to satisfy needs and bring happiness , the primary element , and looking upon scarcity as only a modifying factor.32 The Abbe Condillac , who on the philosophical side was also a disciple of Locke , and who is credited with helping to make psychology a science , likewise insisted upon the fundamental importance of utility : An article has value not because it costs , as one supposes , but it costs because it has value .... But we are persuaded to think that value is an absolute quality , inherent in goods independent of our opinions , and that notion is the source of confusion and bad reasoning . We should remember that goods have value only because they have qualities that make them useful ; they have no value for us if we judge that they do not , in fact , possess those qualities .... I stress this view so strongly because it serves as the basis of this entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owed much to Condillac , and who , by making utility the keystone of the arch , was able to include immaterial goods and services under wealth and to prepare the way for a valuation of productive agents.34 Thus we have already a clear realization that it is demand which sets things in motion and that the utility or value of a good is the projection of a physiological or psychological state on the part of the consumer . This having been established , it was not too difficult to put in some of the refinements , and to add modifiers , such as the law of // diminishing utility , the law of variety , the law of harmony and complementary goods , etc . John Locke himself had referred to the play of preferences and the existence of competition among different commodities.35 Both Say and Lauderdale showed an understanding of the fact that , income remaining constant , something must be given up as well as something received , if people insist on having sugar when it is scarce.36 Samuel Bailey , in his criticism of the labor-cost theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of mind " or process of estimation in which we calculate the relative importance to us of commodity A and commodity B , and make a choice between them.37 From 1830 on there has been no lack of writers able to explain the problem of " more or less " and the mutual advantage to be obtained from exchange as soon as the more intense wants of an individual or group are satisfied . At Oxford in 1834 William Foster Lloyd published one of his Drummond lectures in which , as we now see , he anticipated the whole marginal utility theory . In doing so he stated clearly the principle of diminishing utility as illustrated in the relative importance which a hungry man attaches to successive units of a food supply.311 Mountifort Longfield at the University of Dublin had the same idea when he said : However useful or even necessary to the subsistence of man any commodity may be there is a limit to the quantity of it which any individual can consume , and the love or necessity of variety will induce him to part with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by parting with it he can procure anything which can contribute more to his enjoyment.30 Noting that the most urgent appetites are soonest satisfied , and that there is thus no incentive for necessities to be engrossed by the rich , he adds : Each individual contains , as it were , within himself a series of demands of successively increasing intensity ; that the lowest degree of this series which at any time leads to a purchase is exactly the same for both rich and poor and is that which regulates market price.40 Here we have a somewhat backhanded description of " consumers surplus " as it was called by Marshall in 1890 . Nassau Senior , who probably knew of Bailey and Longfield , as well as Say , made the logical deduction as to a varied bill-of-fare : It is obvious that our desires do not aim so much at quantity as at diversity . Not only are there limits to the pleasure which commodities of any given class can afford , but the pleasure // diminishes in a rapidly increasing ratio long before those limits are reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice the pleasure of one , and still less will ten give five times the pleasure of two.41 Meantime in Germany much the same group of writers to whom we have assigned an advanced view on the position of the entrepreneur ? Hufeland , Rau , Hermann , and Mangoldt ? influenced on both points by J. B. Say , were evolving a neo-classical or psychological theory of value . Indeed , Hermann in reviewing Senior 's Outline in a German magazine in 1836 could say that its discussion of value was mostly " old stuff ' on the Continent . His own analysis of value on both the demand and the supply side , in 1832 , as we shall see , stands up well in comparison with any later exposition . He fully understood the relativity which prevails among prices , and that a shift in the price of one good starts reverberations throughout the whole market.42 This German influence was shown in Thomas Banfield 's lectures at the University of Cambridge in 1844 . He had lived for some time in Germany and was one of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He found Senior 's views upon consumption and value most nearly comparable to those on the Continent ; and himself , somewhat awkwardly , as Jevons thought later , indicated the gradation of wants and the way in which higher wants can grow as lower ones are satisfied.48 Also on the Continent , the French engineer Dupuit is credited with being the first author , with the possible exception of Cournot , to use geometrical diagrams to portray the stages in the . satisfaction of an individual 's want for a particular good . He likewise anticipated the concept of consumer 's surplus by distinguishing what he called " relative utility " from " absolute utility . " 44 At this point it may be as well to take the leap forward to Jevons in 1871 and following . In his first edition Jevons pays tribute to Senior , Bastiat , Courcelle-Seneuil , Hearn the Australian , Banfield , and Richard Jennings , and makes extended quotations from the last two writers . Jennings , especially , he considers worthy of more attention for his Natural Elements of Political Economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clearest previous statement of the law of utility : First , with respect to all commodities , our feelings show that the degrees of satisfaction do not proceed pari passu with the quantities consumed ; they do not advance equally with each instalment of the commodity offered to the senses , and then suddenly stop ; but diminish gradually , until they ultimately // disappear , and further instalments can produce no further satisfaction.45 Reference has already been made more than once to Jevons ' minor culpability for not including the German writer , Hermann Gossen ( 1854 ) , in this earlier survey . Certainly he made full confession and amends in later editions , when he acknowledged that Gossen had completely anticipated him as regards the general principles and method of the theory of economics.411 The historians have since exalted Gossen 's sad fate into a major tragedy , all the greater , perhaps , because of the supreme confidence which he himself showed in launching his book . His use of the geometrical method , his clear statement and illustration of the law of diminishing utility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law of variety and equimarginal consumption , and his anticipation of Menger 's classification of goods into levels or orders , all go to show that this obscure government servant was little short of a genius and a prophet.47 Whatever we may conclude , when we come to the end of this hasty survey , as to the originality of the " Big Three " in utility theory , or , what is not necessarily the same thing , about the newness of their doctrines , there can be no question concerning the ultimate extent of their influence upon economic thought in the subsequent period . Their independence from one another is attested , not solely by their own avowals , but by the almost simultaneous dates of publication ? Jevons and Menger in 1871 , and Walras in 1874 ? and by considerable differences in phrasing and method of presentation . They were widely separated geographically , represented three different languages , and were apparently not in communication with one another until after the event , when Jevons and Walras , at least , exchanged courtesies .4 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the earlier writers , notably in J. B. Say , and were confronted with a common problem or stage of economic evolution . They must share among them the honor of establishing a fairly complete exposition of value-theory from the demand side and of preparing the way for a well-rounded equilibrium theory . Jevon 's assertion of the primary importance of consumption , as over against Mill 's exclusion of the subject , has all the ardor of a partisan , and we may agree with the hesitant Marshall in saying that it is exaggerated and one-sided.49 But his restatement of the principle of diminishing utility , using the curve derived from a series of rectangles which he had found useful in his classes , instead of the straight lines which ( unknown to him ) had been used by Gossen ; his analysis of the apportionment of the supply of a commodity // among its various possible uses ; and his discussion of the most advantageous distribution of expenditure and of goods over a period of time ( what may be styled " thrifty consumption " ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as already noted , may not have had the rhetorical power to coin phrases to contain and perpetuate his ideas . He never arrived at a well-rounded term like Jevons ' " final degree of utility , " or the " rarete " which Leon Walras inherited from his father Auguste , or , finally , the Grenznutzen which his own Austrian successors compounded . But Menger 's adherence to the subjective or psychological approach is unmistakable . Two of the most prominent words , occurring upon almost every page of his chapter on value , are Bedurfnisse ( wants or needs ) and Be f riedigung ( gratification ) , often united in the delightful and all-inclusive Bedurfnisbefriedigungen . With much repetition for the sake of the Dummkop f e , or as a form of persuasion , he presents substantially the whole case as it has remained ever since . There is the obviously decreasing satisfaction which a person receives from successive units of a good ; the calculation made by " the economizing individual " ( wirtschaftende Mensch ) which enables him to divide his income and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same good in such a way as to gain maximum gratification , and so that the final unit of each affords equal pleasure or benefit ; and , in place of the geometrical figure or curve , there is the table with columns representing numerically the falling off in enjoyment from added units of each of a series of commodities like food and tobacco . Thus we have explained to us the different uses of a given article , especially if it varies somewhat in quality as well as in quantity , and the competition among rival goods capable of ministering to the same or equally insistent desires.61 Menger also developed the concept of complementary goods , but since he confined it almost wholly to productive agents or " goods of the higher order , " his treatment is really a statement of the law of proportionality and belongs under Production and Distribution rather than under Consumption.52 Leon Walras is an economist for the elite of the cult rather than for the rank and file . His Pure Economics , as the title might well imply , is highly abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers as Pareto and Barone in Italy , Knut Wicksell in Sweden , and H. L. Moore and Irving Fisher in America . Denying the adequacy of the old , pat answer , " demand and supply , " Walras thinks that each side of the market must be carefully analyzed , and that " vie can do this only by recourse to the language , the // method , and the principles of mathematics . " 63 The essential relativity and composite nature of the process of evaluating goods , whether they be capital goods and services or consumer 's goods , can only be shown by a series of equations taking into consideration all the functions and variables . In assessing his own obligations and discussing the matter of priorities , Walras pays tribute in the preface to his fourth edition , to Gossen , Jevons , and Menger , who had previously been mostly " unknowns " so far as he was concerned ; but states that his own chief indebtedness in the development of fundamental principles had been to his father , Auguste Walras ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principally to Augustin Cournot.b4 His insights , however , are not wholly mathematical . For those readers whose cast of mind is , perhaps , more purely poetic , he occasionally introduces a telling analogy . In explaining how , through trial and error , equilibrium between demand and supply , or maximum satisfaction , is achieved , he at first used the term " groping " ( tatonnement ) , and in later editions modified this to the idea of tickets representing successive quantities of a product offered at varying prices . Money or any abstract value is called a numeraire , introduced as a means of comparison or a common denominator . Maximum satisfaction " consists in the attainment of equality between the ratio of the raretes of any two commodities and the price of one in terms of the other . But if each party is the holder of several commodities . . . it is evident that maximum satisfaction will be achieved by each trader when the ratios of the raretes of the commodities not used as the numeraire to the rarete of the commodity so used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " a lake agitated by the wind , where the water is incessantly seeking its level without ever reaching it " ? as he says , a dynamic rather than a static condition . In the chapter on the valuation of capital goods he says that maximum effective utility and prices are " automatically governed , just as the universe of astronomical movements is automatically governed by the double condition of gravitation which acts in direct proportion to the masses and in inverse proportion to the square of the distances " ? thus combining the figurative and the mathematical modes of expression.58 Upon these foundations , consciously or unconsciously , the structure of neo-classical value-theory has been built . The great service of writers like Marshall , von Wieser , Wicksteed , Clark , Pareto , and Patten , in the middle period from about 1880 to 1910 , was one of synthesis , standardization , and elaboration . They perfected the terminology , extended what had been so largely limited to individual psychology and choices , to the whole market , and pointed out some // of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase we must more than ever resort to the method of sampling . General agreement upon the vocabulary was a slow process and was only partially achieved . The fundamental law of diminishing utility , easily recognizable whatever the prevailing brand of psychology , gave somewhat less trouble in this respect . The phrase itself is descriptive rather than highly technical , but there is a perilous analogy to the law of diminishing returns , already generally accepted . Marshall , in his first edition , used the rather awkward , capitalized phrase " law of the diminution of marginal or final utility " ; but this was changed in later editions to " the law of satiable wants or of diminishing utility . " Perhaps he had a more kindly attitude toward Jevons dead than he had first manifested toward Jevons living , for he coupled with his discussion of demand or consumption a footnote in which he said that " Jevons has done more than any one else to foster the growth of a widely-spread interest in this aspect of eco-nomics " 67 But the phrase " marginal utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main idea , has had harder sledding . Properly understood , as expounded in current texts with the aid of some adjectives like " relative " or " social " to indicate its scope , it comprehends the whole theory of choice , value and price . The margin so designated is the limit beyond which the least anxious buyer prefers some other good rather than paying a higher price for more of the one under consideration ; where the producers or sellers find it no longer profitable to extend their operations ; and , therefore , where the two parties come to an agreement and the market is cleared . A single line dropped from the point where the demand curve and the supply curve intersect , represents both marginal utility and marginal cost . Philip Wicksteed , in his Alphabet of Economic Science published in 1888 , seems to have been the first British economist to use the present term . He was largely influenced by Jevons , but prefers the word " marginal " to Jevons ' " final degree . " He uses it in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " effectiveness " and " usefulness " ; but Lionel Robbins , his editor , thinks it was throughout in the nature of a translation from von Wieser 's word Grenznutzen , just as was the case some five years later with William Smart 's and Mrs. Christian Malloch 's translation of the whole of Wieser 's Der Natiirliche Werth.as John Bates Clark , however , never fully committed himself to the word " marginal . " His studies in Germany in the 1870 's under Knies and other members of the Historical School had left him immune to // the Austrian influence ; and he always had a certain Emersonian penchant for originality and for being his own favorite author . He first used the phrases " effective utility " and " specific utility , " in much the same sense , in a series of articles in the New Englander ( later the Yale Review ) , beginning in 1881 , and refers back to these in his later books . In the Essentials he only hesitatingly adopts the word " marginal " to indicate the principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " effective utility " to designate the interchangeability of homogeneous units of a good.6 " Irving Fisher , as late as 1927 , found reasons for criticizing most of the terms used for the concept , and suggested the more colloquial one of " wantableness " or " the want-for-one-more. " so Indeed , where there is such a wealth of words , one can not always be sure whether or not different authors are writing about the same or about different things . We only need to recall the discussion of Pareto 's general equilibrium theory of welfare , to realize that the doctrine of alternative uses , the law of substitution , the development of a scale of preferences , the plotting of indifference curves , and the recognition of competition among commodities as well as among producers of the same commodity ( applicable in each case to both consumers ' goods and productive agents , and growing out of either the law of diminishing utility or that of proportionality ) , are all merely different expressions or derivatives of the ancient adage that " variety is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said in 1776 that they form the basis of any mutual advantage in trade between individuals and nations , and constitute the strongest possible argument for perfect freedom of trade and communication . Grateful as we are to Marshall , Edgeworth , Pareto , Irving Fisher , and , more recently , J. R. Hicks , for all their elucidations and curves , we no longer need to be persuaded of their fundamental truth and consistency . Much the same might be said of the principle of the elasticity of demand , as expounded by Marshall and others . Cannan thinks the term was suggested to Marshall by the use of the word " elasticity " in reports of the British Chancellors of the Exchequer with reference to the effect of a reduction in taxes upon yield . 62 The idea itself , however , goes back at least to the earliest attempts to classify goods , on the basis of intensity of demand , into necessities , conveniences , etc . The computations made by Gregory King and Davenant in 1696 as to the probable effect of wheat shortages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a backdoor approach to the subject.BS Lauderdale in 1804 and Lloyd in 1834 , realized clearly enough that there was a difference in the responsiveness of demand to changes in supply and price for different commodities .64 As Marshall devel338 THE PROGRESS OF ECONOMICS oped it , the variability depends upon the class of goods , whether they cater primarily to the rich or to all grades of income , the possibility of finding substitutes for them , how durable they are , and the chance to make adjustments over a period of time.65 His explanation of consumers ' rent , later called consumers ' surplus , is termed by Zimmerman " Marshall 's most original contribution to the theory of consumption . " 66 But the idea had been anticipated , as already noted , by Longfield and Dupuit ; and Marshall had himself evolved it as early as 1879 . This is also a logical derivative from the law of diminishing utility , the law of variety , and the concept of elasticity of demand . It helped by filling out what would otherwise be an aching void in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under normal competitive conditions it is necessary for producers and sellers to induce the more impecunious or less eager potential buyers to come into the market , the marginal price set is much below what the more fortunate buyers would be willing to pay if necessary . Consequently the latter group along the upper reaches of the demand curve enjoy a surplus which they can forthwith spend for some other good as soon as they are satiated with this one , or can save for investment in capital .67 Little practical use may have been made of the theory , but , as Marshall suggests , it has some application in the levying of taxes upon commodities , and emphasizes the importance of disparities in income . In one of his rare mentions of the Austrian writers , John Bates Clark complains that their presentation of the final utility theory is not analytical enough ; and he goes on to point out that a commodity is usually a composite or bundle of utilities capable of several uses , and that different uses are marginal for different consumers . There are marginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the real price makers for that commodity . " Eventually he calls this the law of analytical valuation , " and applies it to producers ' wealth as well as to consumers ' goods.6 " The space and emphasis he gives to the subject indicate that he regarded it as more than a mere refinement of theory . It has a bearing upon the ability of producers to appeal to different income levels and to induce the same buyer to invest . in a varied assortment of styles and colors.89 Thus it also comes back to the law of variety . But there is at least one other law of consumption , and that is the law of harmony , otherwise styled " joint demand " and " complementary goods . " Instead of being competitors for use and purchasing power , commodities are sometimes bought in pairs or groups , like bread and butter and jam , and the enjoyment of one is enhanced by the presence of the others . Simon Patten of Pennsylvania , and his former // pupil , Henry R. Seager , have , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his early essays , dating back to 1886 , Patten gives us a change from the customary example of salt , and talks about sugar and the great economic effects of its marked reduction in price : The effects of this change must in time revolutionize our present diet . Most of our fruits and many of our vegetables become palatable enough only through a free use of sugar , and it is of as much importance to the utilization of these fruits and vegetables as salt and ice are to the preservation of meat ... . The rapid increase of sugar is now worthy of especial attention because of its connection with the temperance movement.70 In his more formal later writings on the subject Patten discovers as many as five laws of consumption . One of them is , of course , the law of variety ; and three of the others , " the law of harmony , " " the law of grouping , " and " the law of negative utility , " are so much alike that they may be combined under the first heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the consumption of some articles is harmonious , and hence the sum of their utilities when they are consumed together is greater than the sum would be if they were consumed apart . " Seager finds ample illustrations in what is regarded as good taste in matters of dress , in pre-modernistic sculpture , painting , and music , and in what are desirable combinations on the dinner table . ( He was evidently misinformed as to the incompatibility of milk and lobster . ) Both writers refer to complementary goods in another place and we are not quite sure whether the ideas were as fully integrated in their thinking as they have come to be in more recent texts.71 Their other law , that of " least social cost , " calls for a balance-sheet of pleasures and pains for all parties concerned , and falls under production quite as much as under consumption.72 4 .

Naturally , we can not include much of their data , because , for the most part , they are endless ; but we are interested in any generalizations which they may have arrived at , whether they serve to confirm or to disturb the theories laid down by more deductive reasoners . The record might very well be a long one , because Henryk Grossman argues that the more evolutionary or factual approach goes
