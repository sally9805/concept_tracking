TRACK &; FIELD <P> According to an Arizona podiatrist named Wendell W. Rote Jr. , all the best sprinters are pigeontoed . Dr. Rote claims to have done considerable re earch in the subject . " It 's simply a matter of physics , " he explains . " Those who are pigeon-toed generate a line of thrust which is directly forward . They are 100% efficient in utilizing the power in their legs . " <P> So much for science . Texas Southern 's Jim Hines , 20 , is not the least bit pigeon-toed-in fact , he 's just a little duck-footed , and it may be a good thing . If he were 100% efficient , there is no telling how fast he could run . Three times last winter Hines tied the indoor world record of 5.9 sec. in the 60-yd. dash . Last month , in the 100-yd. dash at Houston 's Southwestern Athletic Conference meet , he got off to a so-so start , still was timed in 9.1 sec. - equaling the world record set by Bob Hayes in 1963 . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little slow getting out of the blocks , but tied the world mark of 10 sec. for 100 meters . No official bothered to clock Jim for the first 100 yds. of that race , but two coaches with stop watches did . One caught him 8.9 sec. , the other in 9 sec. flat . <P> Tying world records seems to be Jim Hines 's fate-so far . When he was a senior at McClymonds High School in Oakland , Calif . Hines tied Jesse Owens ' 31-year-old schoolboy mark of 9.4 sec. for 100 yds . That earned him a $1,200-a-year scholarship to Texas Southern . But when Hines first turned out for track at T.S.U. , Coach Stan Wright was appalled : " Jim 's starts were awful . He did n't concentrate . " <P> Now , three years later , Wright calls Hines " the best sprinter I 've ever coached . " Jim himself thinks he can break four world records ( 100 yds. , 100 meters , 220 yds. and 200 meters ) this summer . He showed why last week when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he beat San Jose State 's Tommie Smith , the 220-yd. world recordholder ( at 20 sec. flat ) by three yards in 20.5 sec . <P> Next year , of course , the Olympics . After that , Hines figures to add a few pounds to his 6-ft. 1-in. , 180-lb. frame and play pro football-although he has not tried on a helmet since he was a senior in high school . He is already counting the bonus he intends to collect : " Somewhere between $200,000 and $250,000. "
