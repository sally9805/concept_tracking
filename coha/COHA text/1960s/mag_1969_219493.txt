ERNEST HEMINGWAY : A LIFE STORY by Carlos Baker . 697 pages . Scribner. $10 . <P> THE orthodox literary theory has been that there were two Hemingways : Ernest the Good and Ernest the Bad . Ernest the Good lived above a sawmill in Paris and worked night and day to become the best writer of his generation . With the help of Gertrude Stein , Ezra Pound and the King James Bible , Ernest the Good learned to write books so true that , by his own definition , " after you are finished reading one you will feel that all that happened to you and afterwards it all belongs to you : . . . the people and the places and how the weather was . " <P> By the time he was 30 , two novels ( The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms ) and the most brilliant short stories since James Joyce 's Dubliners had made him , in his terminology , a champion . He should have lived happily ever after . But then , along came Ernest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Key West , drank too much , and kept remarrying . Instead of getting his work done , he was forever playing at great white hunter or bravebull aficionado or none-too-accurate war correspondent . When Ernest the Bad did write , the crisp sentences came out flabby , self-parodying . Finally , he turned himself from writer into public figure : " Papa , " the self-indulgent joker whom his embarrassed admirers could n't drag offstage and back to his Ernest-the-Good writing desk . <P> Fraid a Nothing . Because Hemingway was so flamboyant and public a figure , Carlos Baker 's long-awaited biography could hardly discover hidden chapters of his life . But Baker-a Princeton professor , the author of an earlier critical study of Hemingway 's writing and sometime novelist himself-is the scholarly inheritor of Hemingway 's papers . He has used the material to fashion the first solid , cohesive and convincingly authentic account of a lifetime most often presented in the past in fragments by partisan observers . The book 's great additional merit is that it forces readers to take Hemingway whole .

He was exhausted at the time and had been under treatment for erratic blood pressure , liver ailments and acute melancholia . But , Baker implies , the tragic themes of Hemingway 's writing were not contradicted but confirmed by that final act and by Hemingway 's entire personal history . <P> Certainly Hemingway 's life was as haunted by death and violence as his stories . " When asked what he is afraid of , " his mother wrote of five-year-old Ernest , " he shouts out fraid a nothing . " " But he felt compelled to spend half a lifetime proving it . An astonishing number of Baker 's pages-and the book 's rich lode of rarely seen illustrations-document the journeys Hemingway undertook to various test sites of courage : high school football in Oak Park , 111. , three wars , hunting grounds from Idaho to Africa , boxing and bull rings , ski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
