txt Mayor Wagner said yesterday that the principal goals of administration for 1961 were Charter revision , a massive attack on slums and " a vigorous drive against unethical practices . " In ail , he listed twenty-eight major objectives to achieve this year . Meanwhile the Charter Revision Commission appointed by the Mayor , ignoring a court challenge to its legality , moved to speed the drafting of a new Charter for submission to the voters on Nov. 7 . John T. Cahill , the commission chairman , an- , ounced the first of a series of nblic hearings by the group . b a 7,500-word message to the City Council , his eighth annual report , the Mayor estimated that the average New Yorker had about 30 per cent more money to spend than his national counterpart .

" Mr. Wagner delivered his message in person to an audience consisting of the City Council members and about fifty department heads . The message was accompanied by a 140-page printed report for 1960 , copiously illustrated . The Mayor , who on March 20 underwent an operation for the , removal of a benign tumor under his right ear , seemed tired . His apparent discomfort was recognized by Majority Leader Joseph T. Sharkey , Brooklyn Democrat , who rose from his seat and broke into the Mayor 's fifty-three-minute address about half way through and called for a brief recess . " Let 's give the Mayor a breather , " Mr. Sharkey said . After a four-minute break , Council President Abe Stark called the session back to order and Mr. Wagner . looking refreshed , resumed his talk . The Mayor said that close to two-thirds of the city 's families were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . He said that in 1949 it was estimated that a third of the families here were 2 , - in that group . Commenting on construction activities in the city , he said that last year fifty-seven office buildings were erected and that fourteen more were scheduled for completion in the next two years . Part of the Mayor 's message bore down heavily on " ethics in government . " " As long as I am Mayor , " he emphasized , " honesty , integrity and clean government will be the guideposts upon which I insist , in every operation , no matter how big or how small . " Conceding " an occasional slip by an unethical public employe , " Mr. Wagner asserted : " We are a government that deliberately seeks out and gets rid of the bad spots , wherever they may be . " The city , he said , has " de- , I vised machinery to frustrate ; unethical conduct , " and is using ' the machinery . " We are ? and will continue , ' to be  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratuity and the conflict of interest , " he ! - declared . " We will not tolerate even the - slightest vestige of corrupt1 , practice . At the same time , we ' will not  --  no matter what the ' provocation  --  infringe on the civil rights of employes , or derogate the great principle that guilt follows proof . Nor shall we stand idly and permit our-. selves to be bludgeoned by a double standard of morality ? one for the city , one for other units of government . " Nor do we forget that the man who offers the bribe is as guilty as the taker . " In reviewing the city 's relations with the state , the Mayor said that the $6.75 per capita allocation by the state to the city , established in 1947 , " is completely unrealistic today and should be increased by at least 50 per cent . " Takes Public in Confidence He noted that effective next Dec. 15 the city would have its first new comprehensive zoning law since 1916 . Conceding that many months had been given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process hat been " too time consuming . " " My view , " he said , " is that hearing the people is one of ; the most useful jobs of govern- ; ment . This is far better than a ! result imposed on the people . II propose to continue taking the ' city 's residents into- our con- fidence on all matters of public : concern . " Mr. Wagner reviewed his ef-. forts to establish a Charter Revision Commisoin and expressed ; confidence that the commission 's proposals would be worth " our ' , most careful scrutiny . " The group appointed by the Mayor , has eleven members . On this point , the City Coun-1 cil has differed with the Mayor . The Council has passed its own , bill calling for a nine-member , revision commission . The bill is , before the Board of Estimate and will be considered May 12 . Mr. Wagner emphasized his : intention " to persist in our campaign for the legalization of offback betting . " In giving details of his housing goal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more persons out of slum buildings and provide them with modern low-rental housing . " School Objective Cited He cited " constant improvement in the quality of education for New York 's children " as " a continuing objective . " Since 1954 , he said , the city has built 124 new schools and renovated or expanded sixty-four others . Mr. Wagner called swift mass transportation to and from the outlying areas " essential to the pity 's economy . " He noted that he had recommended to the Governors of New York , New Jersey and Connecticut " the cre-.tion of an effective tri-state transportation agency . " ? After the meeting , Council kinority Leader Stanley M. Isaacs , Manhattan RepublicanLiberal , criticized the elaborateness of the Mayor 's printed annual report . He said he estiWated that each volume cost at least $4 . He called it " elaborate and costly . " Deputy City Administrator Maxwell Lehman , whose office dandled the printing , said " all f the costs of the report are riot in .
