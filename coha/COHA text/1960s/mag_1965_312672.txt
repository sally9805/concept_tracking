DECLINE AND RISE OF EUROPE by John Lukacs. 295 pages . Doubleday . $4.95 . <P> <P> In a sequel to his History of the Cold War , Hungarian-born Historian John Lukacs , 41 , poses a paradox worth pondering by the advocates of European unity . A good European , argues Lukacs , must first be a good nationalist ; before he can become meaningfully committed to an integrated Europe , he must be emotionally committed to a single European nation . Lukacs shares De Gaulle 's suspicion of a federated Europe , advocating instead the Gaullist vision of a loosely linked Europe des patries . Far from urging a return to truculent nationalisms , Lukacs hopefully champions the more temperate patriotism of the Briton , the slowly developed reverence for history and tradition on which any greater society must be constructed .
