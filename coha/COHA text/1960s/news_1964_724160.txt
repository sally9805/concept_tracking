" Mr. Goldwater also asserted that the guerrilla war in Southl Vietnam " would never have occurred had the enemy really believed that we would have moved in . " The Arizona Senator made these remarks in a speech to about 1,500 persons at the national convention of the National Association of Counties . It was his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience of officials and employes of county governments applauded Mr. Goldwater four or five times during his speech . Striking a theme of " peace through preparedness , " Mr. Goldwater accused the Democratic Administration of having shown an " utter disregard " for the development of new weapons systems . He asserted that unless present defense policies and plans were changed that the United States ' deliverable nuclear capacity may be cut by 90 per cent . On the subject of the Vietnam crisis and the attacks of Communist torpedo boats on United States destroyers , Mr Goldwater said : " I charge that our policies have become so involved , so twisted with diplomatic red tape that the enemy might well have wondered if we would accept their attacks at sea on the same basis that we have been accepting their attacks on land . " He said that , " before anyone gets the wrong idea , " he wanted to say he supported the President 's firm action , but he called it no more than a response . " Yes , " said Mr. Goldwater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right action . No ? we will not let this one action obscure a multitude of other ' needed actions . " He said that support of the President 's action would not be allowed to " silence our basic criticism .

" Mr. Goldwater said that to prosecute the war in South Vietnam with the object of " ending " it " does not mean the use of military power alone . " " We have , " he said , " vast resources of economic , political and psychological power which ' have not even been tapped in our Vietnamese strategy .

" Mr. Goldwater placed himself among those who have " worked very hard over the past years on behalf of the preparedness of this nation , so hard that some critics try to make it appear that we are preoccupied by war , or eager to start one .

" Mr. Goldwater said the Democrats had so depleted the defense system that the United States faced the prospect of entering the 1970 's with no new manned bombers and only an obsolete remnant of strategic bombers . " At worst , " he said , " we could find ourselves in the 1970s without a single one of the flexible , manned weapons which give us the vital scale of a controlled , graduated deterrent ( rather than only a capacity for all-out , intercontinental nuclear confrontation .
