For a nation that has historically concerned itself with enlarging the electorate , the U.S. has always treated one large group of citizens with curious neglect . Over the years , five major groups have been added to the voting ranks : the landless ( under the Constitution ) , Negroes ( 1870 ) , women ( 1920 ) , Washingtonians ( 1961 ) and refugees from the poll tax ( 1964 ) . Yet America , a nation obsessed with youth , with nearly half its population under 25 , does not let a citizen vote until he is 21. * An 18-year-old can be drafted , and he can be held fully responsible before the law , can even be given the death penalty in some states , but he can not cast a ballot except in Kentucky and Georgia . An Alaskan can vote at 19 , a Hawaiian at 20 . Last week Lyndon Johnson moved to enfranchise all the 10 million Americans between 18 and 21 . <P> The President 's proposed 26th constitutional amendment is not a new notion . The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1954 bid to lower the nation 's voting age by a mere five votes . But the idea seems to be gaining favor . In recent years , polls have found that the majority of the population favors giving 18-year-olds the vote , and L.B.J. 's proposal joins more than 50 similar submissions that have been made to the 90th Congress . The opposition is typified by such stands as that of the New York Daily News , which facetiously urged that the voting age be raised to 30 , or lowered to two . Johnson sees today 's 18-year-olds " prepared by education , experience and exposure to public affairs . " Letting them vote would be a signal " that they are trusted . " This trust will have to permeate Congress and the legislatures of 38 states before the electorate gets its infusion of youth . <P> <P> *By common law , 21 is the voting age in most of the English-speaking world . France also makes it 21 , Japan and Germany 20 , Russia and some Latin American nations 18 , Norway and Sweden 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
