As the procession of churchmen wound slowly through Bethlehem 's Church of the Nativity , the elderly , bespectacled Anglican prelate stopped before the Roman Catholic altar , knelt and murmured a brief prayer . He also knelt before the two other altars in the three-sect church : the Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox . Flashbulbs popped and newsmen recorded the fact , for the prelate was none other than the Most Rev. Geoffrey Francis Fisher , 73 , Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of the Church of England . Dr. Fisher was in the Holy Land on the first leg of a twelve-day Middle Eastern pilgrimage that will climax this week in Rome in a " Christian summit meeting " with Pope John XXIII , the first meeting since the 14th century of a Roman pontiff and an Archbishop of Canterbury . <P> In his whirlwind , two-day tour of Jerusalem and Bethlehem , Dr. Fisher was honored by Armenian Orthodox and Greek Orthodox patriarchs , Coptic and Maronite prelates .

Before a crowd of 1,000 people , Bethlehem 's Mayor Ayoub Musallam called on the archbishop to look carefully at the " plight and situation of the Arab refugees , our brethren who are still living in tents , huts and caves . " Expertly sidestepping Ayoub 's entreaty , Dr. Fisher answered : " What can I say ? The troubles here and around the world have my deepest sympathy , but I have no power , no authority to right the evils of the world . Only Christ can put them right . " <P> Both churches and mosques were on the archbishop 's itinerary . Guarded by two black-uniformed kawases ( attendants ) armed with scimitars , he toured Jerusalem 's mosques , wearing large sheepskin overslippers . Then the Primate walked up the Via Dolorosa on the route where Christ had climbed to Calvary . <P> Spice , meat , and candy vendors were herded behind their rickety counters to let the archbishop and his party pass . " A bit difficult sightseeing this way , is n't it ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Sepulchre , where Greek , Armenian , and Roman Catholic priests fought for his attention . " It is very hard to compress eternity into only a few moments , " said the archbishop , as the organ began pealing God Save the Queen . ( The organist was a Belgian Catholic who had no idea what else was appropriate for an Anglican churchman . ) <P> An indefatigable sightseer , the Primate toured the Garden of Gethsemane , where he plucked an olive branch from a tree alleged to have been planted before the birth of Christ , and viewed the Dead Sea Scrolls . Near the town of Nablus , Dr. Fisher , fortified with a strong dose of stomach salts , drank freely from Jacob 's Well . ( The archbishop , said his staff , was holding up well under the rigors of the Middle Eastern diet . ) He looked at the ruins where Salome danced , saw the site where John the Baptist was beheaded . At the River Jordan , the archbishop refused to be totally immersed , instead dipped his foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
