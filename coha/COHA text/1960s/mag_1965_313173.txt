While Kondrashin &; Co. were celebrating the joys of collectivist music making last week , the Ford Foundation announced grants totaling $85 million to U.S. orchestras . It is the largest amount ever given at one time by any foundation to any of the arts . <P> The gift is the result of an eight-year study that explored the pathetic plight of the American musician . The average annual salary for musicians playing with the 25 major orchestras ( defined as those with budgets over $250,000 ) is $5,267 ; for those with the 33 metropolitan orchestras ( budgets over $100,000 but under $250,000 ) , it is $1,174 . In the vast majority of cities , elementary and high school teachers are paid better than the symphony musicians , most of whom moonlight at everything from teaching to selling used cars . <P> The grant will be divided among all 58 of the major and metropolitan orchestras , in sums ranging from $600,000 to $2,500,000 . One-fourth ( $21 million ) of the grant will be an outright gift , the remainder ( $64 million ) will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-to five-year periods . Large as it is , the foundation emphasizes , the grant will cover only about 10% of projected orchestral costs during the next decade . " We hope , " said a foundation spokesman , " that the very discrepancy between the size of the grant and the enormity of the need will awaken more people to the plight of the artist in our society .
