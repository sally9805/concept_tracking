( Socalled " charcoal-broiled " steaks at restaurants have been cooked with gas-heated briquettes for years . ) About $70 . <P> &gt; For the punctilious picnicker and Sunday sailor who loves wine but hates corkscrews , Faye et Cie . of Mcon , France , has put vin in a can for 99 , is now selling it in six-packs in supermarkets from Los Angeles to Boston .
