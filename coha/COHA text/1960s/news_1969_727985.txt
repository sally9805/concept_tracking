txt Liberal Democrats in the House will attempt next week to change the tax relief provisions of the pending tax reform bill to give more relief to middleincome taxpayers . The bill , as drafted in the Ways and Means Committee this week would give no tax reduction at all to the typical middle-income taxpayer who is buying his own home , according to the liberal Democrats . The bill 's principal provision that is aimed at providing tax relief at the middle - income level is an increase in the standard deduction , which few ' homeowners use . Typical homeowners have large interest deductions on their mortgages , plus sizable local property tax payments , which raise their itemized deductions beyond even the proposed higher standard deduction in the Ways and Means Committee 's bill . Liberals Are Annoyed The liberal Democrats in the House are annoyed not only with what they say is a lack of tax relief for the middleincome homeowner but also with the considerable degree of tax relief they say the bill gives to individuals with incomes of $20,000 or more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax relief , with more going to middle-income individuals . The liberals , mainly members of the informal organization of liberal Democratic House members known as the Democratic Study Group , have not yet decided exactly what their counter-proposal will be . They want to concentrate the tax relief provisions of the bill in the two bottom tax brackets  --  the first $2,000 of taxable income , after deductions and exemptions . Because any such reduction would be spread among all 72 million taxpaying families and individuals , however , it becomes very costly . The Democratic Study Group // is reported to be getting some help from outside experts in drafting its counter-proposal , among them , Walter W. Heller , the former chairman of the President 's Council of Economic ' Advisers . But as of late today , there was no plan for the precise provisions of the counter-pro .. posal . The Democrats had agreed on their tactics , however . On Tuesday , when the reform bill comes before the House Rules Committee , the Democrats plan to ask for an exception to the normal rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The liberals will probably be lecl by Reprtsentative Charles A. Vanik , Democrat of Ohio . They will ask to be permitted one amendment , which would embody their middle-income relief provision . Rejection Likely It seemed likely that the Rules Committee would reject the request and that the liberals would then take their case to the full House when the hill is iclebated Wednesday and voted ' on Thursday . opresen t lye . lames U'lLira . Democrat of Michigan. , a leader of the liberal group , said he had serious hopes that the counterproposal could carry . The kinds of individuals who would benefit from the amendment to be offered ? and who benefit little from the Ways and Means bill ? " are both numerous and voters , " he said . As the Ways and Means Committee members explained their bill this week , it would afford a large measure of tax relief in the middle-income and upper-middle-income brackets ? from $7,000 to $20,000 a year . This benefit would , however , be concentrated among those who do not itemize their deductions . The bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 10 per cent of income or $1,000 , whichever is smaller , to 15 per cent and $2,000 in three steps , beginning in 1970 . . The change would benefit some eight million taxpayers of the total of 28 million who itemize their deductions now . But the rest of the benefit would go to those already taking the standard deduction ? mainly those who rent apartments or houses . The tax bill 's provisions for relief of low-income individuak actually stretch upward into the middle-income zone . They would similarly be of little help to homeowners because they , , too , depend on an approach , similar to the standard deduction . . : , ho : 1 ? : 01l$ ' prOVISIr ) 11 ' ; Of the bill , once fully in effect in 1970 , would provide a minimum standard deduction of $1,000 for everyone . Itemized Deductions For the person with $7,000 income , that would he an increase of $300 from the standard deduction he may now take . But according to Mr. O'Hara 's arithmetic , a homeowner with $7,000 income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  already has itemized deductions for interest , property tax and charitable contributions that , exceed $1,100 . The tax relief for the upperincome levels is what the members of the Democratic Study Group want to redistribute . The bill provides for reductions in tax rates , in two equal steps in 1971 and 1972 , for persons with taxable income of $8,000 a year or more , which would be total income of at least $11,400 in the typical ease of a married man with two children . The rate reductions , which start at about 2 per cent at $8,000 of taxable income , scale up to more than 7 per cent at $100,000 of taxable income . In the highest income classes , . however , there will not he , on the average , any reduction in taxes paid because the reductions in tax rates will he more than offset by the elimination of preferences , according to the Ways and Means Committee 's announcement .
