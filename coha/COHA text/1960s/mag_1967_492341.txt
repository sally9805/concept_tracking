While you are reading these words , give or take a few days , President Johnson is reading a fat document on the same subject : the report of his Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice , which is due on his desk about now . He will admire the report , but he wo n't like what he reads ; and neither will you . For the American way of dealing with crime and the people accused of crime is an unholy and inexcusable mess . Even those who disagree with what the Supreme Court has been trying to do about the mess  --  and most lawyers and judges , plus all policemen , do disagree with the Court  --  ca n't find much to say for the system as it works today . We do n't even know how bad it is . We do n't know how many crimes there are ( the FBI in Crime Reports depend on a lot of guessby she lailice and do n't cover the whole is ) . We do n't know how many people are arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states do n't keep good enough records to tell us how many people are formally charged with crime each year  --  the best guess , after eliminating the speeders , drunks. prostitutes , gamblers and shoplifters , is about 700.000 , more than half of them juveniles . We do n't have the vaguest notion of what the courts do with the juveniles ; that 's kept secret by law . Of the grown-ups accused in court , we think about two thirds plead guilty . A team of investigators from the University of Chicago . who worked for a year putting together the information . estimates that a decade ago there were about 55,000 jury trials in the country . Some of those jury trials were for offenses not many people would call " crimes " ? among the jury trials turned up by the Chicago professors was one for installing a kitchen appliance without a license and another for illegally keeping a mud turtle . In some of the Southern and Western states you 're entitled to a jury trial before you can be lined for being drunk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with real crimes , which means that only about one eighth of the adults who are charged even ask for that " due process of law " which is supposed to be the glory of the American legal system . In the big cities , where the big problems are . the proportion is much lower  --  in Manhattan only three percent of the felony indictments ( the most serious crimes ) lead to jury trials ; and for misdemeanors ( the less serious crimes ) , New York does n't have jury trials at all . We think  --  again , we do n't know  --  that about 70 percent of those who stand trial are convicted by a jury . What happens to the 225,000 or so who plead guilty and the 25,000 or so who are convicted after trial is another mystery . Apparently , about 140,000 a year go to prison . Most of them have been in the jug before ; nobody knows what proportion of the nation 's crimes are committed by people who are already experienced at crime , but there 's no question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminologists believe that about two thirds of the people sent to prison for the first time dislike the experience enough to go straight later , while one third become recruits to the large and growing cadre of habitual criminals . T he reason we do n't know much is that for all our talk about crime and criminals , we really do n't care . " To us , " Nicholas deB . Katzenbach wrote in the American Bar Association Journal shortly before his resignation as Attorney General , " the system of criminal justice is largely invisible because we have no contact with it . " We hire policemen and prosecuting attorneys and judges , and ask them to " stop " crime and to punish what they ca n't stop . Most of the people involved in the system are involved in it every day , and it looks more or less all right to them because they 're used to it ; anyway , they 're so busy taking care of today 's problems that they ca n't take much time to wonder what finally happened to yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal justice system but do n't live there are the judges in the courts of appeals , who occasionally review some of the convictions in the relatively few jury trials . Recently , a number of these judges , especially ( hut not exclusively ) those on the Supreme Court , have become increasingly disturbed by what they see when they visit . In a series of opinions over the last 10 years , the Supreme Court has insisted that defendants are entitled to help from lawyers both before and after trial , that I he D.A . may not use against them evidence illegally seized by the police , and that juries may not hear confessions wheedled out of suspects during interrogations in station-house back rooms . How much difference these rulings will make , nobody knows . The courts never see anything but the part of the iceberg that shows  --  and the Supreme Court sees only a tiny ragged edge of that , because it 's only the hard cases that come for final appeal to Washington . Angry opponents of the Court 's decisions can point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rapists who have had to be released because their recent convictions  --  or the cases being prepared against them  --  had been based on evidence that the police gathered in ways the Court no longer permits . But these defeats for justice  --  and it should be remembered that justice is defeated when a guilty man goes free as well as when an innocent man is convicted  --  may be merely a temporary result of changing the rules in the middle of the game . " The cases that bug people are those that are already in the works , " says Richard A. Green , director of the American Bar Association project on minimum standards for criminal justice . He is a large round-faced younger lawyer and one of very few to come out of a first-rate education ! Harvard College and Law School I into work in the criminal courts . " A ruling comes down , and the evidence has to be excluded . and a confessed murderer has to go free . Like that boy up in Yonkers who admitted setting fire to the community center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the new rules , the police will make sure that murderers do n't go free . " Meanwhile , the system chugs along , not as yet greatly changed from what it was before the Supreme Court made headlines last summer . T o understand why the Court wants to change today 's system , and why it will be hard to change , you have to look at the system fairly closely . About the best place to start is New York 's Part I-A. a Manhattan courtroom which since January 11 has been on a " we-never-close " basis , seven days a week , to give everybody a little more time to process the business . Part 1-A is an arraignment court  --  a court to which prisoners are brought by the police who have arrested them , so that a judge may learn the charge the State expects to prove , hear the prospective defendant 's lawyer if there is one and assign one if there is n't , set or deny bail or release with orders to return on a certain day . The court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The walls are wood-paneled to a height of about seven feet ; dark fixtures hang down from the geometrically ornamented ceiling and give an even , just-bright-enough light , not influenced by what comes through the dirty northern windows , which face another wing of the building . Before January 11 , suspected felons passed through 1-A at the rate of one every five minutes ; now there will be 10 minutes or so for each case . Most cases are adjourned for one reason or another ; a few are disposed of ; a few are assigned to trial . The courtroom has four entrances . At the rear . a pair of heavy doors covered in leather swing soundlessly into the center aisle of a public area , full of long , dark-wood benches , which occupies about three quarters of the room . The public end is separated from the business end by a hip-high , dark-wood barrier . Into the working part of the court open three small doors , one at the spectators ' left for the lawyers and court attendants and two straight ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one to the shallow penswhere suspects , eight or nine to a cell , await their moment in court . Lawyers interview their clients , often for the first time , through the bars . Both parts of the courtroom seethe with humanity . In the public area sit several hundred people  --  those of the accused felons who are out on bail or " on recognizance , " their friends and families , complaining witnesses , some policemen , some lawyers . There is a great deal of motion along the rows of seats and up and down the center and both the side aisles . A buzz rises from the area , though many , perhaps most , sit dumbly and incuriously . People are not allowed to read in courtrooms , and the proceedings up front are only partly audible  --  and rarely comprehensible  --  in the rear . Judge Simon Silver . looking quite small , as judges usually do in black robes , sits on a chair behind a very long desk on a platform raised perhaps 18 inches off the courtroom floor . Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WE TRUST ( the " I " had fallen off ) . Below the judge , at a long table , sit assorted clerks and probation officers . Over by the lawyers ' door is a small desk and some chairs for the young Legal Aid lawyers . three or four of them , who will represent about three fifths of the defendants . Backed against the wooden barrier is a sometimes empty , sometimes crowded row of wooden armchairs , for the indi. yidually retained lawyers . On the wall at the spectators ' right are more chairs for policemen , chatting , lounging , waiting to lead their catch to the bar . The Assistant District Attorney , a very young lawyer with protruding eyes and a glum expression , stands at a lectern before the judge 's platform . In dead center , facing the public area . a uniformed policeman , known in the lingo of the court as " the bridgeman. " pulls a folder from the clerk 's table and calls out in a stentorian voice : " Docket Numbers Twelve Hundred Fifty and Fifty-One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from the public area to the railing before the bridgeman . They are accompanied by a policeman . who talks to the D.A . " Do you waive the reading of the charge ? " the D.A . asks . There is confusion at the center ; their lawyer is n't present . At the lawyers ' row one rather shabbily dressed older man says to a younger colleague : " If you 're not here , you get murdered . If you are here , you get murdered . " Michael and Mary have returned to their seats , to await their lawyer . A burly white man is at the railing , waiting while his lawyer and the policeman talk with the D.A . The D.A . says , " Your Honor . there 's a motion to reduce this charge to assault in the third degree . I have no objection . " The case is set for trial ; the judge asks , " Would you rather have a three-judge court or a one-judge court ? " A statutory-rape case : a small . thin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13. and her mother . The D.A . says , " We agreed to a rather long adjournment to give the parties an opportunity to get married . I request a final adjournment. - These statutory-rape cases are not meant to be prosecuted  --  they simply enable the State to act as a substitute father , pulling the shotgun out from behind the door . The Puerto Ricans leave . A white man in a ragged tweed jacket . the stuffing coming out the bottom , takes their place . He stole .5 ; 64 worth of jewelry from NIacy 's ; the charge is reduced from grand larceny ( a felony ) to petit larceny ( a misdemeanor ) , and he pleads guilty . The judge browses through some papers  --  the man 's " pedigree sheets . " a confidential report  --  and says , " Four months . " " Your Honor , I have a wife and four children  --  nobody else takes care of them . " " You should have thought of that before . " The judge looks down at the flimsy carbons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . By rights . I should give you that . Instead , I gave you four months . I think 1 was pretty generous . " Next a very pale , flabby , middle-aged man in a suit , white shirt and tie comes up with a policeman holding his elbow . He has laid his hands on a child on the Staten Island ferry . The District Attorney asks $10,000 hail : ' ' He 's on parole from a life sentence for rape in Maryland . " His lawyer objects : " It 's academic , anyway  --  hut he turned himself in . " The D.A . says again , " He 's on a life sentence . " The judge shakes his head . " He came in. " - Yes . Your Honor . " says the D.A . The judge sets $500 hail , and the man goes off to jail , to await trial ( or return to Maryland ) ; an outof-towner , he is a had risk for the bail bondsman . A tall , broad-shouldered young man comes up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl talk with the D.A . The judge interrupts : " Where 's your lawyer ? " The man shakes his head . " Do you want to go back to jail ? " " No . " " Then get a lawyer  --  you 're on bail , you can afford a lawyer . " But the girl with him is the girl he beat up . The D.A . says , " The People will consent to a reduction to third-degree assault . " The girl speaks to the D.A . even more earnestly , and he shrugs his shoulders . The complaint is dismissed , and the boy and girl go off arm in arm . A young Negro comes up . grinning , the arresting officer with him , and the D.A . puts the arresting officer in the witness chair . An oath is administered . and the D.A . asks , " Officer . did you arrest this defendant in possession of what you believed to be stolen property ? " He did ; the man could give no convincing explanation of why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set and four suits of clothes ; but nobody had reported a burglary . and the Legal Aid lawyers were raising hell about holding a man against whom no complainant had appeared . In Britain . the circumstances and the man 's inability to explain them would have constituted a crime ; not in America . The purpose of the detective 's testimony is to put these circumstances on record , to prevent any possible suit for false arrest . The charge is dismissed . A ratty little colored man comes in from the pens , and a detective in plain clothes is put on the stand . The case is felonious assault  --  a knifing  --  and the victim is in critical condition in the hospital . The D.A. , leafing through a folder  --  he never heard of the case until 30 seconds before  --  requests that the man be held without bail : " I should like to point out to Your Honor that there is a fifty-fifty chance the complainant witness will not survive . " At the lawyers ' row is an overdressed , over-powdered lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a wide-brimmed hat . She mutters , " Now , that 's an adverse comment . He could say . ' there 's a fifty-fifty chance the complainant witness will survive . ' He has a negative attitude . " Farther along the row . another lawyer is saying . " You got troubles  --  there are two defendants and a policeman I ca n't lind . " This is not a pleasant place to work . " You 'll notice that a criminal lawyer never wears a hat , " says one of them . " You know why ? It 's because if you put a hat down anywhere in a criminal court building . somebody steals it . " " The problem with being a defense lawyer is that it 's like giving your life to the Boston Red Sox , " says James Vorenberg , director of the National Crime Commission , and before that a Harvard professor who used to take his children to root for the home team . " You always lose . " Discussions of criminal procedure in America normally start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumed innocent until proven guilty . Unfortunately . an abstract " presumption of innocence " can not long survive the experience of the courts . " No one who has been indicted and formally charged with a crime is really presumed innocent by anyone but his friends or well-wishers , or somebody who happens to know that the government was wrong , " the late Charles P. Curtis once wrote . The best of horror stories is that of the innocent man convicted of a crime . and among the most popular of entertainments is the murder which the police have the deuce of a time solving , Both situations are real , too , they happen . But their incidence is statistically invisible in each year 's 300.000-odd serious criminal cases where an adult is arraigned before a judge . Substantially more than 95 percent of these defendants have unquestionably done something for which they could properly be punished by law  --  simple , if not necessarily felonious , assault ; possession , if not necessarily sale . of narcotics  --  and about 80 percent will in fact be convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of innocence is not put to the test in court . Of those arrested on a serious criminal charge , more people are cleared and ( continued on page 70 ) to prose ( . x or seven times as many people are released between arraignment and trial as are acquitted after a trial . A good proportion of these will be defendants ( like our young man whose girl decided she wanted him even though he had beaten her to a pulp ) who have never troubled to deny the charges against them  --  but for one reason or another it seemed impolitic for the prosecutor to proceed . Of the cases where the prosecutor does decide to press charges , something over 95 percent ( in Manhattan , the figure runs about 99 percent ? result in conviction by guilty plea or verdict . " The sad fact is that the cops do n't go around arresting people indiscriminately , " says the New York defense attorney Harris Steinberg , a sober , deeply thoughtful man who came into the criminal field largely because there were no other jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Harvard Law School . " And the district attorneys do n't go around indicting people indiscriminately . " Nobody is trained at a law school  --  or prepared by the culture  --  to operate as a defense lawyer in a system of criminal law like ours . It is a true paradox ( though probably an inevitable one ) that a period when the Supreme Court is insisting on ever.widening representation by lawyers in the criminal process should also be a iieriod when the traditional and popular function of the lawyer in the criminal courts has almost disappeared . Imost ? but not quite . " I have sympathy for these people ; they 're my clients , " Steinberg says . " And there 's a great deal the lawyer can do . A man may have had a stroke or a heart attack  --  he does n't think it has anything to do with his stealing the money . but I may know the D.A . has a policy of not indicting someone it may kill . A man may not know that the person who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be corroborated , and that it is n't . He may not know the statute of limitations has run . " After a brawl in a bar the police will bring in and book the man who 's still standing up  --  and he may regard himself as guilty , because he knifed somebody . But he may have a valid claim of self-defense . A boy who was part of a criminal group but did n't directly do anything may not have committed any crime . even though he identifies with others who are guilty . and the police have brought him in . He needs a lawyer to tell him he is clear . Basically , however , the criminal defense lawyer , like lawyers in many different areas of the profession , works as a negotiator for his client . The aim of the negotiations is to trade a plea of guilty for a reduction in the seriousness of the charge and/or the promise of a light sentence . " Plea bargaining , " as this process is called , has no legal standing , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe the most common crime in America , " says a New York lawyer who takes occasional court-assigned criminal cases , " is the perjury of the defendant who swears before the judge that he has n't been promised anything in return for his plea of guilty . " It is not that the judges do not know what has been going on  --  normally , they do , and may even have been consulted  --  but that without such a statement in open court a convict may later take the option of appealing for a new trial on the grounds that his guilty plea was induced . A few weeks ago , the first report from the A.B.A. minimum standards project , by a committee headed by Justice Walter Schaefer of the Illinois Supreme Court , called on the courts to recognize plea bargaining as wholly legitimate , and to find ways by which judges can promote and control this negotiated justice . As Judge Henry T. Lummus of Massachusetts once wrote , " The fact is that a criminal court can operate only by inducing the great mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leniency the price for the pleas . " More than 600 people are arraigned every day in the seven " parts " of the Manhattan criminal courts ; and there are fewer than a hundred lawyers in the district attorney 's office . If even one percent of these 600 arraignments were actually to proceed to a full-fledged trial , the system would break down instantly . On a smaller scale , the same situation holds everywhere . A Midwestern prosecuting attorney told an investigator from the American Bar Foundation that " All any defense lawyer has to do to get a reduced charge is to request a jury trial . " Sometimes the prosecutor is not , in fact , paying much for the plea . In a rape case , for example , conviction may be hard to get because of the girl 's intense reluctance to testify ; reduction to an assault charge in return for a guilty plea may be the State 's best result . The stiff mandatory sentences for burglary , which frighten defendants , make convictions much harder to obtain , because juries do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just because they broke into a house ; reduction of the charge to breaking-and-entering , at a year or two . makes the prosecutor 's life easier . Some of the State 's evidence may have been illegally seized by the police , and would not be admissible in court ; or the State 's witnesses may have criminal records , which gives a jury pause . For the man who committed the crime and believes he will be convicted and a guilty man must be highly experienced and sophisticated to give himself much chance of acquittal ) . even fairly small favors may seem desirable : there is a big difference between 18 months in jail and three years . The offer is particularly attractive when it involves reducing the charge to a misdemeanor rather than a felony , because felony convictions may involve the loss of citizenship rights , down to and including the right to hold a driver 's license  --  and because some " recidivist " statutes demand life imprisonment after a third or fourth felony conviction . The importance of this factor was demonstrated in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 and 90-plus percent of all cases were disposed of by guilty pleas  --  except in Las Vegas , where the District Attorney did not have the right to reduce charges to misdemeanors , and only 20 percent of accused felons " copped out . " W hat the lawyer normally seeks for his client in a criminal situation , then , is not vindication and acquittal , but a conviction followed by a suspended sentence or immediate parole . At the Los Angeles Public Defender 's office tin its own way a civilized place , where the management supplies newspapers and magazines and people take a number and sit on an upholstered theater seat rather than a wood bench while waiting for a lawyer ) , a young assistant bursts in on an interview to tell his boss , gleefully , " You know what Rosy did to my man ? Reduced it to simple assault , and let him off with time served , . . . " In the vast majority of cases the negotiation of these pleas is the real contribution the criminal lawyer makes to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty pleas to charges like armed robbery and nighttime breaking-andentering , which are always reduced on negotiation ( the reduction from armed to unarmed robbery is known as " swallowing the gun " ) . But there is no question that a lawyer can make a better deal than a defendant can . How much money the lawyers make for hanging around the courts is a matter of some dispute . Because their clients are poor people with poor relatives , lawyers can rarely hope for more than $250 for a case that goes to trial , and must often make do with $50 . Criminal practice is , however , the one branch of the law where lawyers collect their fees in advance . Not long ago , an older New York lawyer with little experience in the criminal courts had a client who had been picked up in another county for drunken driving , and for whom a conviction at precisely this moment would be extremely inconvenient . He wanted a postponement , but knew of no excuse a judge would have to accept , so he consulted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day . The D.A . heard the reason for the postponement , which was a gorid one . and said , " That 's all right . You just tell the judge you have n't been able to get hold of your witness , Mr. Green . " " But I do n't have any witness named Mr. Green . " The D.A . looked incredulously at the older lawyer 's white hairs and said , " Do n't you know ? It means you have n't been paid . Any judge will give you an adjournment on that . . . . " In Washington , D.C. , these matters are handled more formally : A lawyer still waiting for his fee comes into court and demands an adjournment " pursuant to Rule I of this Court . . . . " Private lawyers are to some extent paid to be sympathetic . Sometimes this sympathy shows in a protective coloration of self-proclaimed corruption , because a criminal likes to hear his lawyer say that he has the D.A . or the judge in his pocket ( and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private lawyers ' relationship with criminal clients is simply a more human relationship than most public defenders or Legal Aid lawyers can maintain . Because the public and agency lawyers maintain an essentially correct rather than cordial manner with their clients . moreover , the legend grows that they do n't really defend , which is absolute nonsense . Indeed , the private lawyer who lives on small fees from poor people is more likely than the public defender to sell his client the need for a guilty plea , partly because he considers usually correctly ) that it is in his client 's best interests , and partly because he does n't have the resources to try cases . Legal Aid and defender offices in vary-ing strengths up to 166 lawyers in Los Angeles ) are supported from tax reve-nues in many states . Where this is the case , the salary scale will be that of the D.A . ' s office , ranging up to $20,600 a year in California . In other states the offices are supported by charity or fed-eral grant . Despite rumors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never urging a man to plead guilty unless he admits his guilt .

Particularly in California , where defenders and assistant D.A . ' s are assigned to the same courtroom for at least a year and see each other daily , the " charity lawyer " often has good working relations with the prosecutor . " He knows you 're not in it for money . " one defender says , " and you 're not going to suborn perjury . He 'll give us his case , where the private attorney will have to make a motion for a bill of particulars , and even then wo n't get as much . " t f the public defender comes troubled to the D.A . to say he 's pretty sure his client is innocent , he will be taken seriously . In the majority of courts in smaller cities . lawyers are simply appointed ( sometimes without any fee whatever I , to meet the constitutional requirements of counsel . Federal courts could not offer fees to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Their total preparation for the defense may be a 10-minute talk with their unwanted client , after which they take a further 10 minutes of negotiation with the D.A .. and the client is usually advised to plead guilty . Still ( though not for the reasons set forth in the Supreme Court 's magniloquentopinions thedefendant is probably a lot better off than if he 'd never had a lawyer at all : He 's not at the mercy of the court ; he 's got a deal . Most important of all , perhaps , his lawyer will know pas he will not ) before which judge he should plead to secure the minimum sentence , and will know how to manipulate the situation so he comes before that judge . American judges have long exercised wide discretionary powers in enforcing the law . In dealing with lesser offenses the system has always relied fundamentally on the judge himself .

A judge in Los Angeles , permanently assigned to this duty , has estimated that he handles 60.000 drunk cases a year , all by himself  --  nearly one An inquisitorial system assumes an efficient and fair administrative procedure in criminal justice . An adversary system assumes that the State may have other goals . Under that assumption , rules were developed to ensure against malicious prosecution . These rules included the defendant 's right to confront and examine his accusers , to produce witnesses in his defense ( by court order if necessary ) and to challenge all evidence against him . He was permitted to have someone speak for him , though until well into the 18th century he was not allowed to give testimony for himself , on the grounds that lie had too strong a motivation to lie . Rules of evidence  --  of what might and might not be heard at trial  --  were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misled by plausible reports of what someone had reason to believe . Only what the witness himself saw or heard could be admitted when serious business was afoot , although even then the system was subject to the fallibility of human perception . ( There is a case on record in Germany where somebody identified an assailant who had hit him in a pitch-black room -- he sheep was thrown wit , and the defendant released , because the proof involved the theft of lambs ) . They refused to permit the prosecution to amend an indictment after it was filed . They severely restricted the use of circumstantial evidence , which creates reasoned suspicion rather than objective proof of the defendant 's guilt . T these principles of Anglo-American criminal justice were laid down before there were such things as police departments or professional prosecutors . when criminal charges were most frequently brought by individuals , who bore the responsibility of gathering the evidence themselves .

Indictments were opened for amendment I making plea bargaining possible ) and rules of evidence were liberalized . Privileges against self-incrimination were held not to apply to fingerprints , blood , urine and handwriting specimens or appearances in police lineups . In many places it became settled doctrine not only that a man could be interrogated by the police , but that his silence in an interrogation could be used as evidence against him , on the grounds that an innocent man will cry out when accused . By the middle 1950's. then , the criminal process operated roughly as follows : The police would be notified of a crime , would investigate on the scene and gather information from witnesses and possible witnesses and from informers . Having found what Justice Holmes once called " the magnetic point " around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suspect . They could then interrogate at length , and use whatever statements they got from the suspect . provided they kept their hands off him and let him eat and sleep regularly . In several Midwestern jurisdictions an American Bar Foundation study found that the police generally regarded three days as a reasonable time for processing a suspected felon before producing him in a courtroom  --  the local counterpart of New York 's 1-A  --  to have a judge rule on whether or not they could hold him . In connection with the arrest , the police would search the suspect and any places associated with him which they regarded as reasonable sources of evidence . In the typical felony case a prosecutor . armed with bundles of evidence gathered by the police ( including a confession ) . would make contact with a defendant when he was brought to court for an appearance between sojourns in a foul local jail , and then he would negotiate a plea of guilty . Where the prosecutor was prepared to offer a suspended sentence  --  freedom now  --  the bargain was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve a prison sentence , the prosecutor was well placed to bargain , because for most crimes the maximum sentences laid down by American state legislatures run from four to ten times as long as those in any other nation in the civilized world . In one recent year . all the courts in England imposed only 588 sentences with a maximum term of more than five years  --  while 18,000 such sentences were handed down in the United States . As early as 1921 , Roscoe Pound , dean of the law school first at Nebraska and then at Harvard , and never one to " coddle criminals , " caught the direction of the wind and did not like it . " The function of securing social interests through punitive justice , " he wrote , " seems to be insensibly slipping away from the courts and hence from law and in substance , if not in form , to be coming more and more into the hands of administrative agencies . " A number of law school professors and appellate court judges ( especially Chief Justice Earl Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of his political career in California , and Justice Felix Frankfurter , who had given 10 years of his life to the fight for Sacco and Vanzetti ) looked at this system of criminal justice , and decided that it had to be changed . Statistically , what they saw was something like this ; Of every 100 persons picked up by the police on serious criminal charges : ? about 30 were released without charges ever having been brought ; ? about 13 were released by administrative process after arraignment but before trial ; ? about 50 were convicted on a plea of guilty ; ? about 5 were convicted after trial ; ? about 2 were acquitted after trial . There is no good reason to believe that innocent people were being convicted in perceptible numbers , that the 50 who confessed had not in fact committed the crimes with which they were charged ( or something very much like it ) . But the adversary system of Anglo-American tradition was being employed in only about seven percent of the cases ; in the rest . the apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an inquisitorial system . And the American people had never expressed any desire for this basic change in the most fundamental institution of government . I n its struggle to return control of criminal procedure from administrative to judicial hands , the Supreme Court has tried four main lines of approach . One was a flat failure , and probably nothing more than a carelessly written opinion , attempting to tighten restrictions on the policeman 's right to arrest without a warrant . The Court overruled itself within two years . The second approach , which now has status only as a gesture ( though it may become more significant in the future ) , involved an effort to give the defense access to the prosecution 's files . The case in which the new rules were announced , however , involved national security ; and Congress the next year changed the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to make sure the Supreme Court would never try that again . There remains , however , a rule requiring the prosecution to make available to the defense any evidence favorable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Green of the A.B.A. Project . " because the defense has no way of knowing about favorable evidence in the prosecution 's files . " At least one committee appointed to revise the Federal Rules has toyed with the notion of giving the defense substantial rights to " discover " the prosecution 's case ; and in New Jersey , where the state supreme court makes the rules for the trial courts , Chief Justice Joseph Weintraub has suggested that some way be found to open up cases before they reach trial . The " pretrial conferences " which these new rules would require , however , are hard to fit into an adversary system ; like similar conferences in civil cases , they would almost certainly turn into private bargaining sessions . There is also more than a little danger in giving either side in a criminal case indiscriminate access to all I he witnesses expected to testify for the other side . ' f he Court 's third attempt  --  a succr form but probably not in substance  --  came 1 , an ft . Wainwright , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes could not be sustained unless the defendant was represented by counsel or had deliberately and knowledgeably waived his right to the services of a lawyer . The real significance of the decision was not its explicit guarantee of representation at trial but its implied guarantee of representation in the crucial period between arrest and trial . " The time a defendant needs counsel most , " a federal judge in Utah had noted in 1952 , " is immediately after his arrest and until trial . " The services of a lawyer in the administrative process of plea bargaining , moreover , does not change the essential nature of the process . Because the overwhelming majority of defendants are guilty  --  and because , at this stage . the defense lawyer has no way of discovering whether in fact the prosecution has enough admissible evidence to convict his client  --  this formal protection seems more likely to produce a reduction in the average sentence than to reverse the course of history . Fourth , and most important , the Supreme Court and some of the state appellate courts have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bar from trials much evidence against defendants that would have been admissible before 1960 . The reasoning offered to support these decisions rests , perhaps unsteadily , on the Bill of Rights of the Constitution . The Fourth Amendment , for example . had been designed to protect citizens from indiscriminate search and seizure by government agents , which was among the most resented features of British colonial rule . What it guaranteed was the individual 's right to sue and collect damages , as John Wilkes had done in London . In 1914. however , the Supreme Court gave the Amendment a new and different interpretation . proclaiming that it formed part of the rules of evidence in the federal courts . If the government was prohibited from making such searches . then it had to be prohibited from introducing the " fruits " it has seized  --  a weapon , say  --  in evidence against the victim . The ruling applied only to actions by agents of the Federal Government , because it had not yet occurred to anyone that the Fourteenth Amendment obliged the states to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed . some very substantial constitutional guarantees . like indictment by grand jury and trial by jury , are not to be found in many state prosecutions . ) T he rule against federal use of illegally seized evidence had a pretty discouraging history , because the states for the most part refused to make a similar interpretation of similar provisions in their own constitutions . The consequence was that federal officers either turned over their evidence to the states for use in state prosecutions  --  or . where state law was not involved . arranged for the local police to seize and then give the evidence to the federal authorities . This was known as the " silver platter " doctrine . In 1949. largely to eliminate the silver platter , the Supreme Court went a step further , and held in Waif v. Colorado that it could , if it wished , apply its interpretation of the Fourth Amendment to the states  --  but it did n't wish . Most states said they did n't wish , either ; and there the law stood when the police of Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mapp ran a boardinghouse. and the police believed that among her boarders was one who ran a gambling den on the premises . They knocked on the door ; Miss Mapp called her lawyer , who told her not to let them in unless they had a search warrant ; she told them to go away ; they did . Three hours later they returned , seven of them , and broke down the door . She demanded their search warrant , and one of the officers gave her a piece of paper which was not , in fact , a search warrant ; she Miss Mapp ' : , or apparently did not know much more aboui illese matters than she did  --  his argument before the U.S. Supreme Court was devoid of suggestion that the Court might have to overrule ll'off 11 . Colorado . But this notion did occur to the Court . After Mop v. Ohio , in 1961 , state police were informed that they , too , could use the physical evidence they had seized only if their search for it had been justilied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the person whose premises were searched had consented , or if the search was incidental to a valid arrest . The rule is strict : The police can not use their discovery of the evidence as justification for the arrest  --  if they did n't know the man was carrying policy slips or a concealed weapon or an envelope of heroin before they searched him , the fact that their guess was right can not be used to make the arrest valid or the search legitimate . How far the rule carried was demonstrated two years after Mapp , when the Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a man arrested after the police broke down the door to his hotel room because they had sme:led in the hall the opium he was smoking . But the Court was even more deeply troubled by the , , se in criminal trials of another kind of eeideii:e : the confession resulting from police interrogation of a suspect . A privilege against self-incrimination in court is not worth much if the proseaitor can introduce confessions made outside of court . There is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refusing to let the prosecution use a confession , if the document for one reason or another looks doubtful . In the 19th century the slightest hint of pressure on the accused was enough to eliminate the confession as untrustworthy  --  for example : " I dare say you had a hand in it ; you may as well tell me all about it " ; or You had better tell all about it ; it will save you trouble " ; or " You had better tell the truth . " In one case toward the end of the century , the U.S. Supreme Court even ruled that confessions could never be admissible in federal trials . This opinion was treated almost immediately thereafter as though it had never been written  --  until today 's Court resuscitated the case as background to its opinions on interrogation in the 1960 's . From 1900 to the early 1930 's the reports of the Supreme Court are almost entirely barren of confession cases . Except for prohibition cases , federal crimes were few and fundamentally uninteresting ; the Court refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even imagined what is now standard operating procedure  --  the petition for habeas corpus brought in a federal district court on the grounds that the state courts have behaved so badly that they have forfeited their jurisdiction over the prisoner . The turning point came with the publication in 1931 of the Wickersham Commission Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement , which found widespread " use of physical brutality . or other forms of cruelty to obtain involuntary confessions or admissions . " This report , shockingly , was the most recent hard information available until the new report of the President 's Commission ; the Chief Justice relied on it just last June . In 1936 , for the first time , the Supreme Court overturned a state conviction because of a coerced confession . The admitted facts were that a bunch of white Mississippians had beaten three Negro suspects with a steel-studded belt until they confessed to murdering a white man . IThe preme court of Mississippi appreived the use of the confessions at the trial because the defense lawyer . while objecting to them , had not formally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the State col -- ceded that its Rangers had taken a Negro prisoner from jail and out to the deserted countryside at night , to ask him questions ; and the supreme court of Texas had found no intimidation . A rape-murder in Indiana in 1947 led to five nights of questioning until three in the morning , two days in solitary confinement in a cell called " the hole , " little sleep , not enough to eat and no chance to speak to anyone except the six or eight police officers who badgered the suspect in relays until he confessed . Throwing out the confession and the conviction in this case . Justice Frankfurter wrote . " There comes a point where this Court should not be ignorant as judges of what we know as men . " Since 1949 the Supreme Court has had no cases where confession was associated with physically brutal treatment  --  either because the police mended their manners or because the state appellate courts no longer passed such horror stories up the chain of command . Still , the confession cases came , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a suspect that since he was n't talking they 'd just have to arrest his sick wife : New York police sent an old buddy . now a cop , to tell the prisoner that he 'd be fired if his pal did n't confess ; Illinois police told a lady that if she did n't confess , and was convicted anyway , the court would take her children from her . B , 1957 the Court had established rules to govern interrogation for use in federal proceedings . Relying on the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure rather than on any constitutional guarantee , the Court ruled , first in a bootlegging case and then in a rape case , that no confession could be admitted if it was the product of questioning that occurred during a period of " unnecessary delay " between arrest and arraignment before a magistrate . In the second of these cases , the " unnecessary delay " had been only two hours ; and because the crime was a rape in a dark cellar , conviction was impossible without the confession . ( Normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defendant goes free ; the State can try him again , omitting the evidence that tainted the first trial , and in a good majority of cases a new conviction is obtained . ) But there was no federal rule which the Supreme Court could apply against state convictions under similar circumstances . Year after year the Court denied the vast majority of petitions for review of cases tried in state courts , and when it did set aside convictions in such cases , it did so on narrowly specific grounds  --  because the defendant was a juvenile , or was illiterate , or had been denied the right to let his wife know he 'd been picked up . And then in 1964 there arrived on the Court 's docket the case of Escobedo v. Illinois . Danny Escobedo was a Mexican-American who was serving a 20-year sentence as an accomplice inthe murder of his brother-in-law . With his sister and two friends , Escobedo had been picked up , questioned and released . lie had consulted a lawyer who advised him not to say anything at all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lawyer came to the police station and asked to see him . The pol ice refused . Presently , Escobedo was confronted with one of the friends , who had confessed to being an accomplice but claimed that Escobedo had actually fired the shot . The trap dosed : Escobedo denounced his friend as the actual murderer , thereby admitting that he himself had been an accomplice . Justice Arthur J. Gold . berg , who wrote the opinion of the 5-4 majority , made much of the fact that Escobedo , not advised by a lawyer , did not know that under Illinois law the man who pulled the trigger and his partner were equally guilty of murder . As a matter of law , all that Justice Goldberg actually said was that a conviction could not stand if the evidence presented to the jury included a confession given by a defendant who had been questioned without a warning of his right to remain silent . and who had been denied his request for the help of his lawyer . But while the Court had always before included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a confession if freely given , Justice Goldberg 's opinion argued that , " A system of criminal law enforcement which comes to depend on the ' confession ' will . in the long run . be less reliable and more subject to abuses than a system which depends on extrinsic evidence independently secured through skillful investigation . " E scobedo raised hopes at the American Civil Liberties Union and fears in police departments and prosecutors ' offices all across the country that the Supreme Court was about to forbid the use of confessions entirely . But because the Goldberg ruling was so strong as a statement of opinion and so weak as a statement of law , nobody had any clear notion of what Escobedo really meant  --  of what the cops really could and could n't do . Controversies over what the ruling did mean , or should mean , divided the bar and produced a spate of private correspondence written for publication . Much of the argument concerned a " Model Pre-Arraignment Code " which the American Law Institute had begun to develop a year before Escobedo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Reporters " ? all law-school professors  --  plus an immensely distinguished " Advisory Committee " of forty . The resulting draft code , published 18 months after Escobedo , followed the letter of Goldberg 's opinion in requiring that anyone who had retained a lawyer was entitled to have the lawyer present while he was being questioned . But it did not insist that the police supply suspects with lawyers , and it provided for four hours of questioning at the station house I tape-recorded and preferably photographed ) without legal representation  --  unless demanded by the suspect  --  prior to arraignment before a magistrate . All four Reporters regarded themselves as liberals ; and in fact their proposed Code was much stricter than the actual practice in any state at that time . But a number of libertarians , led by Circuit Judge David L. Bazelon of the District of Columbia . thought and said that the Reporters were scoundrels for their reliance on the letter rather than the spirit of Escobedo . Bazelon was particularly upset at the failure to require the police to supply counsel to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make up our minds , " he said . shaking his tine gray head sadly , " whether or not in this society we want to trade on ignorance . " One obvious reply is that the rules are laid down to protect the innocent , not to provide the guilty with a better chance of escaping . The fact that Jimmy Hoff a has lawyers who can keep him out of jail indefinitely after his conviction on criminal charges does not mean that th ? State must provide every criminal with a I who can keep him out of j ' lens ? ss is A.L.I . Reporters wrote , ' n , - cc is not a sport or a game , and s is , iness derived from the moral structure of games ... are by no means persuasive .... There is no social interest in preventing suspects from telling the truth . " Nicholas deli . Kaizenbach , then Attorney General , regarded the idea of supplying all suspects with lawyers as preposterous . " There 's only one bit of advice a lawyer who does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  keep quiet , " he said privately . " There 's no need to set up some fancy system of lawyers to give everybody advice  --  just prohibit questioning . " An Illinois judge observed sardonically after Escobedo that any convict whose lawyer had told him to talk to the police could probably get his conviction reversed on the grounds that he 'd had incompetent counsel . T he discussion grew nasty : Those who feared the extension of Escobedo , wrote Pennsylvania professor Anthony G. Amsterdam , were " the comfortable middle and upper classes . . . who imagine themselves always as potential victims of crime , never as potential victims of a police investigation . " Paul Bator , a slim young Harvard professor who was one of the A.L.T . Reporters , dismissed much of the argument for stricter control by the courts with the coin-anent , " MOS t 10f II ss ( ple do n't believe the enforcement of the ( pE1 law serves a social value . " And both , of course , were right . Because Justice Goldberg hail tied his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Escobedo , the Su 's , 1 ( le Court would obviously have to speak again . In June , 1966 , Chief Justice Earl Warren used the case of a confessed kidnapper and rapist to drop the second shoe . Overturning Arizona 's conviction of Ernesto Miranda ( again by a 5-4 majority ) , Warren affirmed Escobedo , but he specifically added that , " Confessions remain a proper element in law enforcement . " Much of the opinion was given over to the Chief Justice 's own proposed code of prearraignment procedure , though he invited the Congress and the state legislatures to make their own codes ? " Our decision , " he wrote , " in no way creates a constitutional straitjacket . " He also announced a willingness to approve any procedures " at least as effective " as his sketched code in safeguarding a defendant 's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination . Warren 's code itself informed police departments that if they wished to use confessions ( or information gathered from interrogation , " the fruit of the poisonous tree " ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not obliged to answer questions , that he had the right to have a lawyer with him during interrogation and that a lawyer would be supplied him if he wished . its inherent ambiguities and because the four dissenting justices two of whom are the youngest of the nine ) are clearly prepared to overturn the opinion if anyone of their persuasion should be appointed to replace a retiring member of the five-man majority ( which includes the three oldest justices ) . Even for the immediate present , the impact of Miranda is uncertain . Anyone . of course , may waive his right to have a lawyer on hand during interrogation . Crime Commission director James Vorenberg commented , the day after the opinion came down , that Miranda " just moves the battleground from the voluntariness of the confession back to the voluntariness of the waiver . " Such battles are fought out , of course , in local trial courts , not in the Supreme Court . " The police , " Vorenberg said , " have done pretty well with these swearing contests over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police will often win the contests because they are telling 1 he truth . Samuel Dash , former Philarlel. phis I ) , A. , now running an Institute of Criminal Law at Georgetown University in Washington , reports that many prisoners reject a police offer of a lawyer : " Most human beings want to be part of the group ; even for law violators , the policeman remains a symbol of society , and they want society to love them . " They also sense , as the lawyers do not , that their last chance of beating the rap is by convincing the police or the prosecutor either that they did n't do it or that they have interesting information to swap in return for a favor , T o date , the experience in states that had es-tablished a Miranda-like rule before Miranda argues that no great changes will occur . The Detroit police report that the percentage of confessions by those arrested fell from 60 to 58 , which is not statistically significant . in the first year after the accused were informed that they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilbur F. Littlefield of the Los Angeles Public Defender 's Office says , " So far as I can see , Dorado ( the California version of Miranda ) has made no difference at all  --  they still cop out all the time . It happens infrequently that people ask to see an attorney . We wish it would happen more often . Last Friday at a quarter to five we did have a call from the forgery division  --  they had an arrestee who wanted an attorney . We sent a man over , who told him about the only thing a lawyer can , which was not to tell anybody anything . " By their nature , moreover , the exclusionary rules cover only those who are to be accused in court ; the police are under no obligation to provide lawyers for people they do not intend to charge . A chunk of the Miranda opinion was devoted to a memorandum from the Solicitor General detailing the arrest practices of the FBI , to demonstrate that interrogation without counsel is not necessary . But in fact the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim of the questioning is to get information about those higher up , and any lawyer the prospective witness might bring would , in fact , be in the pay of those higher up . U ltimately , all that really matters is the effectiveness of an exclusionary rule in changing administrative behavior . The history of police activities after Mapp c . Ohio argues that society is highly resilient , but selectively so , in refusing to change its behavior on orders from appellate courts . Because it ruled that search warrants must specify the evidence sought , Mapp interfered violently with police procedure in three areas : gambling , carrying concealed weapons . and narcotics . In all three , conclusive evidence can usually be got only by seizing people and searching them , or by breaking down doors to catch people before they can dispose of the incriminating material . Immediately after Mapp. a New York judge commented , " The Supreme Court has legalized narcotics traffic . " On gambling , society was prepared to go along with the Court ; nobody was really much interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal pri-ssecution had always been a little dubious ; the important thing , after all , was to get rid of the guns . Either through new legislation ( as in New York ) or through administrative findings as in Chicago ) . the police were empowered to stop anybody anywhere on the streets and frisk him  --  and when they found a weapon they simply took it away . In 1965 , Chicago " burned " more than 6,000 handguns , most of them seized in just this manner . This is illegal behavior by the police  --  indeed . Chicago politely keeps the guns available for a month , in case the people from whom they were seized would like to go to court . to replevin their weaponry ? but even the predom inantly Negro community . which is most often throw the envelopes on the ground . In court , though , the policeman would merely testify that he had seen this defendant throw this envelope on the pavement ; and the judge would convict . News of Mapp spread through the world of narcotics with astonishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for the first time the police found that they had to search  --  quite illegally  --  to get the evidence . Fortunately . the judges had been hearing for years about envelopes thrown on the pavement and were not very sympathetic with the Mapp doctrine , anyway ) ; so the police continued to tell the same old story , and the prosecutors continued to win the same old convictions . This subterfuge could not remain credible indefinitely . however , and it did not help at all in cases where the police wanted to get inside apartments and homes . Few judges were willing to accept a policeman 's statement that the defendant had let him in voluntarily , or that , really , " these places are built so rickety the door just came loose in my hand . " Therefore , in California and New York . two of the states worst hit by narcotics addiction and the crimes it causes ( 60 percent of all New York Legal Aid criminal cases involve addicts ) , the legislature made addiction a kind of insanity , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years . In civil proceedings of this sort , which are supposed to be for the addict 's or the lunatic 's own good , evidentiary rules like those of Mapp do not necessarily apply  --  and the police can proceed , usually , in whatever manner seems best to them . Mapp has , however , made a major change in the way lawyers handle criminal defenses . " When we tried our first criminal cases , eight or nine years ago , " says Boston 's Monroe Inker , " and we made motions for a bill of particulars , motions to exclude evidence , we were regarded as very intellectual . Now , everybody does it . " Two law school professors who have been visiting police stations and courts in the Midwest have found nothing admirable about the usual hearing on a motion to suppress evidence : " Defense counsel often present the motion to suppress orally and without articulating any specific ground upon which it should be granted . The police officer is immediately sworn and cross-examined by defense counsel , who , even without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the propriety of police conduct . . . . The prosecutor is likely to be frantically examining the officer 's written report of the case for the purpose of getting clear in his own mind the circumstances leading up to the arrest and search . " The trial judge never gets it clear in his mind . Most often , if he believes the defendant is guilty . he admits the evidence  --  andhy appellate courts do not have Ihe manpower or , in most cases , 1 he nation , to ccinl rid the rulings of large that the I , , , , per of the police commissioner is 01 much more significance on governmental interference with rights of respectable citizens than appellate-court utterances . " Five years after Alapp " barred " illegal searches and seizures , a federal circuit court found it necessary to order an injunction issued against the police of Baltimore , Md. , after the illegal search of some 300 Negro homes by officers looking for the murderers of a policeman . To everybody but Americans , the use of the exclusionary rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as the Australian criminologist Norval Morris puts it . In his country , and in England . when clearly reliable evidence has been improperly obtained , " the evidence is accepted and the policeman is punished . The whole meaning of the exclusionary rule is that Americans have not developed decent police administrative procedures . " Certainly , the courts will never be able to prohibit questioning by the police . Interrogation , says Chicago Police Commissioner Orlando 1 , V. Wilson , who was an academic criminologist before he streamlined , motorized and computerized the Chicago force , " is the device mankind has used since it learned to talk , the device the courts use , and in many cases the only device there is . " A certain irreducible idiocy underlies the argument of some civil libertarians that a cop who finds a man driving a stolen car does not have the right to ask the man how he acquired the a tragedy were to strike at the family of a writer who is enthused about extending the assistance-of-counsel clause to the station house , would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I he summoning of a lawyer , or at least a clear warning as to the right immediately to consult one , before the police began questioning in an effort to retrieve his child ? " Whatever the courts may say , Judge Friendly added , " society will not long endure " any system that forbids such questioning . The complete exclusion of confessions ( and of their " fruits " ) from criminal jurisprudence would carry two dangers that are seldom mentioned in the press . One , detailed by the A.L.I . Reporters , is the risk of " pressure to deal with the situation by enormously widening and intensifying general surveillance , with all the hidden costs to the quality of life that may be entailed . " Another is a possible lowering of the standard of proof that prosecutors require before taking a case to trial  --  and of the standard required by a jury for conviction . Repeated and widespread exclusion also , ironically , seems sure to bring about an increase in the conviction of the innocent . At least one convicted defendant has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction of the prosecution 's wiretap evidence . never offered at trial ( of course ) , claiming that it would help his case . Defenders of exclusion can land , oddly , do ) demonstrate that it has n't made much difference in the results  --  that , for example , the conviction rate of those arraigned before the California supreme court adopted a Alapp type rule in 1955 was about 86 percent . and remained at that figure while the number of defendants more than doubled in the next six years . The Chief Justice argues t he absence of a need for confessions in a footnote to Miranda pointing out that three of the four defendants whose cases were amsidered in the opinion " were identified by eyewitnesses . " ( Elsewhere in the same opinion , however , he cites Borchard 's Umpiring the Innocent and Frank and Frank 's Not Guilty as sources for concern that the criminal process is sending innocent people to prison  --  and nearly every case in both books involved faulty eyewitness identification . ) A t a time of rising national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities , there is also a great danger in setting up standards that impede the legitimate functioning of the police . No court decisions will have any effect at all on police behavior if the public decides that its protection against crime lies in the police rather than in the law , The overwhelming vote against New York 's Civilian Review Board  --  which was heavily opposed even in some of the Negro and Puerto Rican neighborhoods which were supposed to look upon the Board as their ally  --  indicates that this catastrophic attitude may already be winning many supporters . It is also worth remembering that the adversary system of justice is something less than the noblest creation of man 's intelligence . Guilty pleas , which are the important confessions , are not an excrescence on the system : they are a gesture of acceptance of law , and are by no means to be discouraged . Perhaps the oddest argument offered by the supporters of exclusion is the notion that a guilty man whose lawyer can get him out of it thereby acquires a new respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free in their penthouses testify strongly to an exactly opposite conclusion . A well-staffed police force and a conscientious D.A . ' s office ( especially if it is watched by a professional defender 's office and insulated from newspaper pressure i will do a more accurate job of determining guilt or innocence than can be done in any courtroom . Trial in a modern society is not , can not and probably should not be much more than a last check , by a random collection of citizens on a jury , to make sure nothing has gone wrong with the machine . What the Supreme Court decisions have accomplished is to point up the need for greater professionalism in both the police department and the prosecutor 's office , and for some sort of inspectorate similar to the Swedish Ombudsman  --  a public official fully empowered to investigate citizen complaints and to insist on punishing public servants who have treated people unfairly . Then the courts will be able to retire gracefully from the awkward and fundamentally self-defeating business of excluding good evidence . As the President 's Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice will cost much more money than the nation now spends for this purpose . Nevertheless . if the Supreme Court has shaken up the situation enough to persuade the public to pay the bills for a more civilized approach to crime and conviction . even those who are now most darkly critical of its recent decisions will be glad that the Court intervened . 0
