102 One Christmas in Montana A story by Adrienne Richard Ihad delivered the afternoon prescriptions for Arnstad 's drugstore where I worked in those days , hurrying up Main Street before it grew dark and colder . The store windows glittered with Christmas lights , and the snow was shoveled into huge windrows at the outer edge of the sidewalk . I was thinking about stopping for a hamburger before going home to dinner when I saw Tom Gaskill coming toward me on the street . Tom Gaskill was a cowboy from near Sonnette ; eighty miles south of my hometown , and I had worked with him the past two summers on a cattle ranch . He stopped and greeted me , calling me Pistol , a cowboy name for the boy who works with the men , and then he asked me what I was doing with school out and if I wanted to come out to the ranch for a few days and help drive a herd over to Wolf Creek , where he had feed for them . The herd was already gathered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ten miles , not a big day 's work . Another cowboy was in the Wolf Creek camp , looking after another herd , and Tom and I would drive the rest over there . I was enormously excited , for my single-minded , fourteen-year-old ambition in the winter of 1930 was to be a cowboy and maybe someday a rancher , and my ideal after whom I patterned every thought and gesture was Tom Gaskill . I had reason to love and admire Tom Gaskill . Hewas over six feet tall and well over two hundred pounds , a big man with huge shoulders and narrow hips . His levis always fit him tight , and his blue denim work shirt was always too tight across the chest . He had a large , round head and a broad face , open and freckled , that would have been round , too , if it had n't been so lean and hard , and a big , wonderful grin . The first time I saw him he was topping out a horse in the corral . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never took part in the merciless teasing of the pistol that goes on in a cow camp , Tom knew there was n't much question whether I wanted to or not , just would my parents let me go , and I could leave a message for him at the Milligan House when I found out . I raced home to find my mother , who said it was all right so long as I was home by Christmas and dressed warmly . I was ecstatic . I hauled my saddle and heavy leather chaps to the front porch and stowed my extra shirts and pants and mitten liners and overshoes which fitted over my high-heeled boots into a duffle bag with my razor which I did n't need yet , and I was ready , prancing , when next morning Tom appeared in his Model A coupe . The Sonnette road was covered in snow . The loose layers had blown off , leaving bare the tracks which had been beaten into the frozen 103 surface . The day was gray and still and cold . but the drive passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seriousness of range conditions , the summer drought , and now the early heavy snow . Tom had a modest spread where he lived with his wife and kids . The little house was dominated by a radio with a gigantic horn which brought in Dr. Goat Gland Brinkley loud and clear . A Christmas tree had been erected in the sitting room and decorated with a few ornaments and tinsel ropes , and under it lay a few packages in Christmas paper . Mrs. Gaskill and the kids I did n't notice much . It struck me a little funny that Tom had a wife and kids . In my eyes he was perfect and complete when he was on his horse working cattle on the open range . Early the next morning we got ready for the drive . I put on my long underwear , wool pants , levis and chaps and a work shirt and a wool shirt and melton cloth mackinaw and melton cloth Scotch cap that had a flap from ear to ear , boots and rubber-soled felt overshoes and my big mittens with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it did n't feel particularly cold , although we were saddled before sunup . Tom let the herd of cows and late calves out of the corral , There was an old lead cow , and she immediately struck out , taking first place from the others . As soon as we drove them onto the prairie , the whole herd strung out behind her . The little calves fell behind and the cows went ahead . sometimes bunched behind the lead cow but mostly plodding in single file . They were strung out for almost a quarter of a mile , with Tom and me riding at a walk behind them . The old lead cow seemed to know where she was going , because she hit the trail with little guidance . Once in a while Tom lit out around the herd to turn her one way or the other but not often . The first hour passed , but the sky grew no lighter . The sun did not come up . The ceiling hung low and gray and heavy . The old snow crackled under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold breath eddied around our mouths and the heads of the stock . The little calves were silent . About . ten o'clock it began . The snow fell at first in small , dry flakes , straight down . I watched it gather on the curly , red-brown backs of the calves before me . It was beautiful , The whole world around us , locked in gray and cold , was complete and perfect for me . I was riding my maverick stallion with the man who had broken it for me , the man I admired more thananyone else , driving cattle across the open slopes of my homeland , and I had no room nor need for any other world . When the snow stirred on the brown backs , when the flakes thickened and the wind rose , I still found not a flaw in my perfect realm . The wind was sharp , driving the snow before it in long white strings . It came across the long slopes and frozen , snow-crusted ridges with nothing to stop it . There was no growth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottoms . The pine hills lay south , and north were only more snow-locked slopes and prairies and frozen gumbo hills . Soon we could n't see the lead cow . The snow heaped on the curly rumps ahead of me . I swung my rope , partly to keep my arms warm , and flicked a rump to keep it moving . What would stop us from getting lost , I wondered . We might wander forever and freeze to death , and I looked at Tom , but if any such thought came to him , he never breathed it or looked it . If we were lost , he would know what to do . He would find a creek bottom , make a lean-to of saddles , build a fire , and butcher a calf . I halfway hoped it would happen . " Hold up , Pistol , " Tom was swinging off his horse . I looked around , wondering , until I saw the little rufous carcass stretched out in the snow . The curly flank rose and fell , rose and fill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crusted on the soft cameo ! of the coat and the pubic hairs were a beard of ice . Tom lifted him onto his feet and held him a moment , knocking off the snow and ice , and giving him a slap , sent him ahead . We followed . A few yards farther on , another calf lay in the snow . I jumped down and picked him up , brushing off the snow and ice and letting go with a slap . Another ten feet , a third had sprawled in a drift , stretched out upright like a merry-go-round pony . Tom got down again , and this time he did n't remount . He wrapped the reins around the saddle horn and walked ahead . As soon as I saw him wrapping the reins , I swung down , too , and dallied mine around the horn , and side by side we hiked on . The horses followed , their heads slung low , and the snow Adrienne Richard , who lives in Davenport , Iowa , writes fiction and does reporting chiefly for art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

They have three sons . 104 ONE CHRISTMAS IN MONTANA instantly gathering on the saddles and along the manes where our bodies had given protection . The old lead cow did n't stop . Somewhere a quarter or a half mile ahead . out of our sight , utterly alone in the stinging blizzard , she was breaking the trail to Wolf Creek . She led the way laterally up a long rise with the cows plodding in her hoofsteps and the little calves blindly following . with Tom and me behind . She passed over the ridge and struck a drift . She breasted the drift as it grew deeper and deeper until it broke around her shoulders . She never halted . The cows followed through the white defile she trampled for them . Noon came and went , and along with it my fourteen-year-old hunger pains . We had no lunch , no candy bars , no canteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range a cowboy never took a noon break , and this day was no exception . I wondered how much of the ten miles we had covered . The herd moved more and more slowly . The far side of every ridge was deep in drifts . More and more calves floundered and stopped , and we were continually lifting one out of the drift and setting him going in the beaten track . Tom laid the smallest across his empty saddle . It lay there . half-dead , its flanks slowly and just perceptibly heaving under the snow which gathered swiftly over it . The light began to fail . The gray deepened shade by shade , but the wind continued to whine past my ears , laden with snow . Every so often , Toni held up his mitten and watched the snow collect on the back . " If the wind stays behind us , Pistol , " he told me , " we are all right . " Then he disappeared into the slot ahead . I picked up a calf lying in the trail and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perishability against the vast , inhuman storm , and I knew how easy it was to panic and rush headlong into the drifts , breasting them like great breakers until I could go no further and snuggled , exhausted as the small calf , into the folds of snow . When Tom appeared , he looked better than ever , and he said , " That old lead cow , she 's quite a girl . " We fell in side by side again between the last calf and the horses , and half-walking , half-blown , we went down the trail . Up the rising slope , down through the drifts , along a creek bottom to the rising ground of the next ridge we plodded . It was now night . Four , six , eight o'clock I did n't know ; I virtually did n't manipulate my arms and legs . They moved through the great distance of fatigue like independent mechanisms set in motion long ago . I was aware little by little that 1 moved more slowly , and my brain gradually came into focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted my head from the trail before me , it had stopped snowing , and the darkness was black indeed all around us . Tom said . " There it is . " We had come to the ridge of a long slope , and across the abyss of drifts and darkness shone one small crossed square of yellow light . The shack at Wolf Creek . There was nothing left in me for a wild , cowboy yell , but my spirits came up for a moment above the weariness . The old lead cow broke the drifts for one last time , heading downhill toward the cow camp . It lay protected somewhat under a crescent of cliff . The shack and the sheds , corrals and pens were spread out in the lee of the cliff , and the snow was not deep around them . Tom strode ahead and opened the gate for the herd to plod through . The moment they did so , the little calves bellered and the mothering up began . In the commotion of mooing and little calf bleats , the shack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the snow , and another big cowboy joined us . With a little conversation like " Howdy , " " What took you so long ? " , " A bit snowy under foot , " Red and Tom set to work . Tom led his horse into the shed and unsaddled , and I followed him . I could hardly loosen the cinch and drag the weight of the saddle across the horse 's back . Tom measured oats for his horse . so afterwards I did . Then Tom strode to the trough and swinging an axe , broke the ice . I tottered after him and heaved the chunks nut of the water , but he would n't let me drop them right there . I had to fling them as far as I could so that the cows would n't stumble on them . While we were opening the trough , Red hitched a team to a wagon , and Tom swung sacks of cottonseed cake and bales of hay into the wagon bed . I staggered after him and tried to do it , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with Red driving , we circled the pen , breaking open the sacks of cottonseed cake and snipping baling wire and emptying sacks and bales into the wagon 's wake . I did n't dare stand at the edge because my legs were giving out . After an endless time the job was done , the team unhitched , and the three of us headed for the shack . No human shelter will ever look so good to me as the cowboy shack on Wolf Creek that night . That one-room cabin , with the plank floor and plank wainscoting , with Beaverboard walls and ceiling , a window or two , and the door , was lit with a gas lantern and heated to the point of suffocation by a small iron wood-burning spitand-argue stove and a big black wood-burning cookstove . There were plank shelves for dishes and canned food , and bins by the door for potatoes and onions , and pegs on the wall for clothes , a table and chairs , and one large , sagging , feather-ticked double heti . When we stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They took off their Scotch caps and mackinaws and overshoes and high-heeled boots and levis and shirts and wool pants until they were down to their oatmeal , button-seated , baggy-bottomed , saggy-kneed underwear , and there they stopped . So I shed layer after layer until I looked just like them only smaller . Red had hauled in with us a great haunch of beef , frozen to the marrow , and flung it on the table . As soon as he was down to his long johns , he tackled it with a huge butcher knife and aa story by Adrienne Richard 105 meat saw and sliced a steak as thick as my forearm . Telling me to peel those spuds and stoke the fire , Red stood at the cookstove , showing us nothing but his button-seated rear view and prepared a dinner no gourmet chef will ever equal and no diner appreciate more . He fried thick slabs of home-cured bacon in a huge skillet and then heaped the potatoes I had sliced into an inch of bacon grease and cut the bacon chunks into them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into a pan and pulled bread apart and stirred it in . He freshened the coffeepot by throwing in more grounds and pouring in more water and moving the pot to a hotter place on the stove 's black surface , and then he flipped that steak into the largest skillet of all , heated smoking hot . I put a stack of bread and the bowl of home-churned butter and the canned milk and a bowl of jam on the table . When Red had everything ready , he sliced the steak onto worn tin plates , heaped the edge with fried potatoes and stewed tomatoes , and we pulled up our chairs and fell into it , hunched over it , a slice of buttered bread in one hand , smoking coffee beside our plates , saying practically nothing , just eating and eating and eating until it was all gone . Afterwards , Tom and Red pushed bark their chairs , Toni slapped his chest where his pocket should have been , looking for his cigarette makings , and his eyes met mine in a certain way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and washed the dishes without a word . While I washed , I listened to their laconic , understated , deadpan cowboy talk . I wanted terribly hard not 106 ONE CHRISTMAS IN MONTANA to laugh out loud and be just as straight-faced as they were , but shortly I was doubled up over the dishpan , laughing so hard my stomach muscles , already weary , knotted in unbearable cramps . I wondered where I was going to sleep since there was only one bed , Maybe Red had a bedroll somewhere . I was more than ready when Tom said , " Okay , Pistol , you get in the middle so 's you do n't get lost . " Still in my long underwear , I crawled into the center of the ancient double bed . The coil springs groaned and creaked as Tom , over six feet and two hundred pounds , took one side , and Red , a little shorter and scrawnier , took the other . " Now , Pistol , " Red said , " do n't you do no thrashin ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't notice anything until I heard a scratching . When I opened my eyes , I found the cabin flooded with blinding sunlight , and I saw Tom in his long johns standing at the window scraping away the frost with his pocket knife . Red swung out of bed and leaned over his shoulder . The cabin was icy . " It fell some , " Red said . " You read it and tell me , " Tom said , stepping aside . " I read 63 below . " " That 's what I read . " I read the thermometer myself . There was no mistake . The mercury had fallen to 63 below . We stoked the fires and dressed in the numerous layers , pulling scarves around our mouths and noses until only the eyes showed , and went out . The routine was the same : breaking the ice on the water trough , hitching the team , loading the wagon with hay and cottonseed cake , and driving it in a great circle around the pen . We moved very slowly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my lungs , and my nostrils seemed to stick together after each inhalation . When we finished , Red prepared another monumental meal . This time he scraped away a layer of lard in a crock and extracted pork sausage patties , and he fried them along with another heaping skillet of potatoes and stacks of wheat cakes , hot Mapleine syrup. and coffee . At breakfast Tom said that we would n't be going back that day . We 'd just have to wait till the cold broke . I did n't care if it never did . The days went by , and the temperature stayed in the sixties below . We fed and watered the stock several times each day . Tom checked each animal daily and doctored those that needed it . Red made us boots of newspaper that fitted inside the overshoes , and we wore these instead of leather boots for warmth . We put on tin pants  --  lined canvas trousers  --  when we went out , and we moved slowly and never stayed long . When they were n't being worn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the wall . I listened to Red and Tom making cowboy talk , hilarious tales of past roundups and drives and trips to town and mutual acquaintances , that broke me up over the dishpan or the cards or the checkerboard . The airtight shack grew fragrant with wood fires and leather and horse clothes and men in long underwear . The dashes to the outhouse were the fastest of my career . As Red said , all the constipated people in Montana had to be buried in a sitting position that year , just plumb froze stiff . My spirits sank on the morning 1 awoke in my niche in the featherbed to find the weather noticeably warmer . Tom and I rode side by side on the trail home . It was the same one the old lead cow had broken . We trotted most of the way in the brilliant sun and arrived at Tom 's place just after noon . When we went inside , the house seemed unbearably hot . Tom 's little kids were running around , the presents under the tree were gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas was over , and I thought for the first time of my parents . I asked what day it was , and it was past New Year 's . I had been gone two weeks with no word to anyone , and in a frozen cow camp eighty miles from home , which was in the middle of nowhere anyway , I had had the time of my life . Tom took me into town that afternoon and let me off in front of our ample old house . My mother was hurt and lifted her chin and cried a little that I had n't been there for Christmas . My father and older brother bawled me out for wounding my mother  --  did n't I have any consideration for others  --  but later my little brother asked me how it was out there , and I said diffidently , " A bit snowy underfoot , " in the way , I hoped , that Tom had said it .
