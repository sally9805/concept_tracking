At 6 o'clock every morning last week , the queues began to build up in front of Buenos Aires ' two sparkling new Minimax supermarkets . When the glass doors opened at 7:30 , hundreds of bargain hunters rushed in to buy Argentine beef for 15 a pound ( most B.A. groceries sell it for 30 ) and other foods at 25% to 35% less than standard Argentine prices . Though the second store has been open only three weeks , the success of the two Minimaxes is so certain that their backers-the Rockefeller brothers , plus a group of Argentine financiers-are already building three more . <P> Daily mob scenes in Buenos Aires are part of a revolution in food retailing that is lowering prices and raising living standards around the world . From Singapore to Sao Paulo , the old corner grocery tradition of small volume and high markups is being washed out by the made-in-U.S.A. idea of mass marketing . <P> Slice the Pasta . The supermarkets have grown fastest in Europe 's rich soil . In Florence and Milan , the Rockefellers ' International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italians fondly call " the Americano stores " ; the Americanos have brought down the price of pasta as much as 40% . In Belgium , Chicago 's Jewel Tea and Antwerp 's Grand Bazar company have combined to open eleven supermarkets in the past two years , and last fortnight announced plans to open four more . Not only do these Belgian markets dramatically undersell corner grocers ( examples : 5 v. 8 for a cake of soap . 52 v. 70 for a pound of cheese ) , but they have added a new verb to the Flemish language . It is superen , and it means to take a social hour in the supermarket , usually at night and with the family , piloting a pushcart among mountains of cans and valleys of prepacked meats . <P> Undoubtedly the most successful supermarketeer in Europe is Toronto-born Willard Garfield Weston , 64 , a philanthropic , publicity-shy millionaire who controls the U.S. 's National Tea Co. and Britain 's huge Allied Bakeries . In the last five years , Weston has built a chain of 236 supermarkets in Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new stores a week , and intends soon to absorb two grocery chains in France . <P> Besides all this , Bakery King Weston has gone from batter to wurst by opening 93 supermarkets in West Germany . This chain , manned largely by Germans who learned their trade running G.I. commissaries for the U.S. occupation forces , now grosses some $60 million a year . Unlike supermarketeers elsewhere , Weston does not try to undersell the German corner grocers . Instead , he outsells them by offering a far wider variety of goods , including such recently adopted Teutonic favorites as Wicks Vaporub and Reis Knusperle-which are Rice Krispies that do not go snap , crackle , pop but " knisper , knasper , knusper . " <P> Bumps in the Aisle . The supermarketeers have run into some initial opposition in Europe . In Italy , Communists damn the supermarket as " American monopolies , " and local chambers of commerce have a way of stalling licenses for new ones . In France big stores are taxed more heavily than small shops .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
