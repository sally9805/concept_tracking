Arnold Palmer made $81,000 last year just by playing golf . That did n't even begin to pay the taxes on the money he earned from his Arnold Palmer driving ranges , Arnold Palmer slacks , Arnold Palmer sweaters , Arnold Palmer shirts and Arnold Palmer laundry . <P> But can the son of a greenskeeper from the Pennsylvania coal country find happiness in a world of luxury and high finance ? Apparently not . " First of all , " said Arnie at last week 's Los Angeles Open , " I 'm a golf professional . And secondly , I like to win . " <P> He did , too - for the first time in al most a year . It was a sort of hollow victory , because neither Jack Nicklaus nor Gary Player was entered in the tournament . But it did wonders for Arnie 's pride , and it was worth $11,000 - which automatically ( since it was the year 's first tournament ) put Palmer back into his once-familiar position atop pro golfs money-winning list . <P> The first thing everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golf Course was that he was back on cigarettes , after a year of trying to give them up . He was also belting his drives with fresh gusto , and he was using a new putter . On the first day , he limbered up with a so-so 72 . Next day he cut his score to a five-under 66 , and in the third round he was the old Arnold Palmer . His tee shots carried 310 yds. or more , and his putting was uncanny : twelve times in 18 holes he got down with one putt . Rattling off seven straight birdies-just one shy of the P.G.A . record-he shot a nine-under 62 , opened up a seven-stroke gap on the field . " What 's Arnie trying to do-lap the rest of us ? " demanded Paul Harney , who had won the tournament the last two years in a row . <P> In the last round , Palmer settled for a 73 and a three-stroke victory . " I do n't intend to be a lingerer , " said Arnie , 36 , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Player , " but I do n't see any reason why I should n't be able to play competitively until I 'm 40.
