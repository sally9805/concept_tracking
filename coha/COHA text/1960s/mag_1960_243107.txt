At a House hearing on influence peddling in Washington , an old Washington figure bobbed up last week in a somewhat new role . His name : Thomas G. ( " Tommy the Cork " ) Corcoran , lawyer and onetime brain-truster who had drafted much of the New Deal legislation during the ' 305 . Federal Power Commissioner Jerome K. Kuykendall testified at the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee hearing that a gas-company representative ( later identified as Tommy the Cork ) had tried to influence him in a case involving the Midwestern Gas Transmission Co. , a wholly owned subsidiary of the giant Tennessee Gas Transmission Co . <P> Last fall , Midwestern was trying to get FPC approval to build a 504-mile pipeline from the Canadian border to Marshfield , Wis. , also wanted the FPC to permit a 7% return on its investment . <P> Higher Rates . After the FPC examining staff had recommended a 6% return , Corcoran phoned Kuykendall , although the Cork was not listed as the Midwestern attorney for the case , and pleaded for the higher rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on him ? Answered Kuykendall , a Republican appointed by Ike : " By the time I knew what he was talking about , he had said it . I did n't talk to him . He talked to me . How could I prevent it ? " <P> Corcoran also got in touch with two other FPC commissioners , later called on Kuykendall in his office to make another plea for the rate . The pipeline was approved , but the rate was not set because , explained Kuykendall , the FPC was waiting until all the expenses of building it were in . Kuykendall insisted that there was nothing to hide about the affair , said that he had informed the committee of the calls himself , although not until the story had been printed in a trade journal . <P> Fat Fees . Other records showed that Tommy the Cork was a fairly familiar name to the FPC . Back in 1957 , Tennessee Gas had been granted more than an $8,000,000 rate increase . For Corcoran 's help in getting the increase , Tennessee Gas paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake Arvey , Illinois political kingpin , Democratic national committeeman , and an Adlai Stevenson stalwart in 1952 and 1956 , got $15,000 . Since neither was listed as attorney in the case , the FPC examiner who had recommended the increase wanted to know what they had done for the money . Said Tennessee Gas Vice President Ronald McVey : " When either of them encounters any situation which they believe would affect the company 's welfare , they immediately advise the company and recommend a course of action to be pursued ... He Corcoran keeps the company advised of all governmental developments , be they legislative , administrative , or judicial on both national and state levels . It is my opinion and that of the management that the legal services rendered by these firms are well worth the fees we are paying them . " <P> The FPC ruled that the fees could not be passed on to the consumer , i.e. , included as part of company expense in determining the rate base . To prevent calls and visits such as Corcoran 's , the Harris committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases pending before a commission to seek off-the-record meetings with commissioners .
