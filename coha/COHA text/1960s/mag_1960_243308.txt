As cost-sensitive newspaper publishers have observed for years , there is only one truly basic difference between fresh and used paper : ink . Largely because of ink 's stubborn presence , U.S. newspapers , which pay a near-prohibitive $134 a ton for fresh newsprint , get less than $20 a ton for used newsprint , which is repulped and pressed into a coarse grey cardboard of the sort used to stiffen the backs of scratch pads and freshly laundered shirts . If there were an economic and efficient way of removing the ink , waste paper could be used over and over again . Last week in Chicago , Marshall Field 's Sun-Times and Daily News were both running on newsprint reconstituted from waste . <P> The Field process , developed over the last six years at the paper mill he now owns in Manistique , Mich. , is much the same as dozens of paper reclamation techniques tried in the past . Most of these begin by grinding used ( inked ) newsprint , mixing it with fresh wood pulp , and removing the ink by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used newsprint is low in wood fiber , the tiny tangled threads that make paper strong . <P> <P> The fibers tend to dissolve in the chemical bath , producing a paper with inferior tensile strength and poor printing qualities ; the paper breaks on rotary presses , costs more in time than it saves in price . <P> To get around this problem , the Field mill starts with used slick , magazine-type paper , which is not only cheaper than used newsprint in the Chicago area but has a 30% fiber content compared with newsprint 's 15%-20% and holds up better in the chemical dissolution process . <P> The result is a grade of reconstituted newsprint that is not only stronger than fresh newsprint but saves Field $20 to $30 a ton . <P> The success of the reclamation technique is such that Field is considering building a new $10 million reprocessing plant in the Chicago area to double the Manistique mill 's annual production of 36,000 tons-less than one-fourth of the newsprint needs of the Field papers in Chicago . And queries about the process are coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Field technique might make the difference between profit and loss .
