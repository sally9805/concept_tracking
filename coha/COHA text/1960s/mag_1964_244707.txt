THE CONGRESS <P> Millions remember him mostly from the televised sessions of Democratic National Conventions . He was the hunched-over little hobgoblin who always seemed to be whispering parliamentary advice into the ear of Permanent Chairman Sam Rayburn . He had a big splotchy nose , squinty eyes and a mouth that always made it appear as though he had just eaten a peck of green persimmons . He wore black shoes , black socks , a black suit and a black tie . He was grumpy as all get-out , and he seemed to take a perverse pride in being unpopular . <P> Yet when he died last week at 85 , more than 40 colleagues and President Johnson flew out to his funeral in Elsberry , Mo . Clarence Cannon had been 40 years in the U.S. House of Representatives , was its foremost parliamentarian , and had performed a considerable public service as an Appropriations Committee chairman who spent the taxpayers ' money as charily as if it were his own . <P> The Bloody Ninth . Cannon 's career began in 1911 when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to Washington as confidential secretary to House Speaker Champ Clark . With Clark 's encouragement , he became a specialist in parliamentary procedure , was made the House Parliamentarian , later wrote the House parliamentary bibles Cannon 's Procedure and Cannon 's Precedents . <P> In 1920 , Clark , who represented Missouri 's " Bloody Ninth " district , was defeated in the Harding landslide . In 1922 , Cannon ran for the seat and won . He was re-elected 20 times , and on the day following his last election in 1962 , he filed for his 22nd term . In all those years , he stood free of all political commitments by stubbornly refusing to accept campaign contributions of any size or sort . <P> Targets . In 1941 , Cannon became chairman of the Appropriations Committee , and in that capacity he saw himself as the guardian of the nation 's wallet . " We 've got to keep people from taking more and more money out of the U.S. Treasury , " he stormed . " Every day they devise a thousand new ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made himself a member of every one of his dozen or so subcommittees , so that he could attend their meetings and vote when the occasion arose . Pleas from Presidents to restore money cuts were often ignored ; once Cannon deliberately refused to take a telephone call from President Kennedy , who wanted to cajole him into releasing a money bill . <P> Cannon simply figured that a budget had never been made that could not be cut . To prove it , he spent long nights wearing a black eyeshade , seated behind a gallimaufry of reports , books and papers , studying and slicing . He especially delighted in heckling the military . In an annual spring ritual , he would arise with flailing arms to castigate the Pentagon . Starting with Philip of Macedon 's tactics , he would trace the history of warfare through Henry V down to the first and second World Wars . Military men , he protested , were not susceptible to change-especially changes that might save money . " We had a deuce of a time getting them to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride those horses .
