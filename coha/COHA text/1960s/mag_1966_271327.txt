<P> An orgy ? In Boston ? Er- , ah- , well now , everyone muttered , that would take a little doing . But doing is Sarah Caldwell 's speciality , and last week she led her Opera Company of Boston in the U.S. premiere of Schoenberg 's epic Moses and Aron . For raw power , fireworks and daring , it was a spectacle that made Bunker Hill look like the Tea Party . <P> It was daring to schedule the opera in the first place . Big , sprawling and complex , Moses and Aron demands a range of musical and technical expertise that few opera companies could or would attempt . For one thing , the libretto calls for " an orgy of sexual excess , " in which herds of animals are slaughtered and naked men and women run riot . Composer Schoenberg himself ruefully concluded that it was probably " undoable . " <P> Frozen Blood . Sarah Caldwell began to think so too when , after she scheduled the opera for May , the tenor she had lined up to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program again six weeks ago , and this time the baritone withdrew . Through it all , the 160-voice chorus kept practicing away , running up production costs that ultimately skyrocketed to $300,000 , thus making it one of the most expensive operas ever produced . Finally , Tenor Richard Lewis and Baritone Donald Gramm stepped into the roles of the Biblical brothers , and the promised land was reached . <P> To accommodate the extravaganza in the cramped former movie theater that the Boston Opera calls home , Set Designer Oliver Smith built ramps and platforms around the orchestra pit . To swell the chorus , 40 extras were enlisted from local gyms and off the street ( qualifications : " 6 ft. 2 in. and well built " ) . Everything worked , especially Caldwell 's master stroke of costuming Moses and Aron identically , often pivoting them back to back to underscore the central conflict between the spiritual and material sides of man . A few patrons found the orgy scenes too shocking and tromped out ; but Lewis and Gramm performed magnificently , and the orchestra played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all , the production was further proof of the Boston Opera 's growing reputation as the most inventive and adventuresome opera company in the entire U.S.
