It 's Been a Long Snow D AY by day for a year I sat in a quonset but on an Alaskan hilltop and shuffled papers for the Air Force . I was adjutant of the Bethel Mountain Radar Station , a cluster of shacks topped by a gray radome . Around us humped the foothills of the Alaska Range ; between the foothills were valleys where scrub spruce grew along the banks of cold streams . Over a hundred miles away rose the crags of the Alaska Range , blue-white on clear days . Twice in the summer we were visited by men of the Tommy family . They were Eskimos who wandered in a hundred-mile radius about us , picking a bare living from the land . The commander talked to them and gave them C rations . I sat and dealt with Department of Defense forms and Air Force forms and all sorts of other forms while the days shortened into winter . In December the Eskimos got sick . One of the Tommys , a flat-faced woman of fifty or more , showed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dogs she drove were ghostly in the steadily falling snow . " We have the flu , " she said in the soft , timid voice her family used with white men . i They put her to bed in the dispensary . After a time inside she smelled like any frozen thing thawed out and left too long in the warmth . Her clothes had been tanned with urine . The medic moved from his room next to the dispensary into the common barracks . We would have burned her clothes , but they were warmer than anything we had to offer . The medic gave her a bed garment and we put her clothes in an unheated corner of the supply building . Then we radioed the Indian Affairs Bureau in Anchorage and gave them her vague directions on where to find the rest of her family . The bureau clerk said they would send a government doctor in a light plane as soon as it stopped snowing . I went back to the dispensary to tell the woman . Lying on the cot  --  dark , weathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old wood . She gave me an ingratiating smile . " Mrs. Tommy , " I said , " they 're sending a doctor out from Anchorage to find your family . Everything should be all right . " " Please . . . " she said , and mumbled something . " What ? " " Please  --  my name is Ann . " Her voice was earnest . It seemed really important whether or not I would call her Ann . I smiled . " O.K. , Ann , and how do you feel ? " She shrugged . ' ' Better , I think . " But in the next few days she did not seem to 70 IT 'S BEEN A LONG SNOW get any better . The medic was worried by it . For myself , if getting well had meant leaving a warm bed and decent food and going hack into the cold , I think I would have stayed sick . This was probably the first time in her life she had been served her meals or slept on clean linen . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red tape in the orderly room got too much for me , I would go into the dispensary and talk to her . In a voice still shy , in English full of clumsy phrasings , she could tell me about the barren land around us . She called it the " Hungry Country . " " Long ago , " she said , " when I was young woman , there was much to eat . Caribou , elk , bear . Then animals go away , down to Kenai . My people are sick , many died . Had big tribe here then . Most followed animals . Live in Kenai land now . Some go to towns . Some of us stay . Easier to live when not so many here . " Another time she said , " We take skins to trader on Hoholitna River . He gives us bullets , canned food . We live awhile , but they never last long . I think he cheats . Then we trap , hunt ? hungry most of time . " " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She shrugged . " We live here . " A smile crept onto her face . She savored a happy memory . " Once , three four years ago , I walk over hill and saw caribou in valley below , Too many to count . They walk by for hours . I get my husband and brothers . We killed many , plenty to feed us to spring . " She shrugged slightly and the smile dissolved . " Bears go into cache . Took meat . Soon hungry again . My brother go to cache . Find bear there . Old grizzly . Brother shot it . Bear shouted and run at my brother . Brother has old one-shot rifle , no time to reload . Bear jump on brother , bited arms and head , then it tile . Brother crawl home . Goed out next day to help cut bear up . " She looked up questioningly . " Will they stop flu ? My brother should not die from that . " " The Indian Bureau will do all it can . " I T WAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman made the world I dealt with , the world of hierarchy , regulations , and bureaus , seem like Oz . Particularly now , when the unceasing snow was isolating the station . For everything we got came in by air and we had no instrument landing facilities . We were getting low on food . Our cluster of buildings was becoming more and more a part of the land , as drifting things become a part of the sea . That afternoon I got a teletype message from Division Headquarters , in Anchorage . " Captain Fenner to all subordinate units : It has come to the attention of HQ USAF , Washington DC , that Briggs and Stratton Auxiliary Power Units , all model numbers , are not receiving adequate maintenance throughout the Air Force . Request all subordinate commands check condition of above power units and submit report including present condition of units and corrective measures taken . " 1 read the message twice , then laughed . That type power unit is used to start jet fighters . Although our radar crew was always vectoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen , with our eyes , was an F-86 from Anchorage which had buzzed the bubble the summer before . I sent a message saying we did not have any such auxiliary power units . The next day I got back an answer . " Captain Fenner to Bethel Mountain Station : Report mandatory for all subordinate units . Please expedite compliance . " Captain Fenner was the division adjutant . I had never met him , but all the paperwork that came to me came through him . Once he had sent a notification that HQ USAF wanted each unit to start a driver training course and report on its progress . He had sent a course prospectus out by air . There were lessons on traffic signals , pedestrian courtesy , and road signs . It was a good prospectus , but hardly applicable to us . The nearest paved road was in Anchorage , a hundred and fifty miles over the mountains . I carried the prospectus down to the motor pool and gave it to the . sergeant-in-charge . He promised to have his drivers look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division that so many men had met and that so-and-so was discussed . There were always at least ten men and the prospectus was followed religiously . Two or three months later i asked the sergeant if his men had looked through the book yet . He blushed . " Lieutenant , to tell you the truth one of the trucks started spraying oil the same damn day you brought that book down . The mechanic that was working on the truck got so excited he did n't think to shut the engine off . He just snatched pages out of that book and jammed them into the hole . The pages he left were so smeared with oil we could n't read them . " Inventing a driving course had been fun . Now I invented some power units . " The units were found beside the runway , " my report went ; " to all appearances they had had no maintenance whatsoever . They were rusty , carburetors were clogged , points and plugs were rusty , tires were flat , and the housings In his mid-twenties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training program who , after getting his wings and commission , was assigned to an Alaskan radar site ( several hundred miles from the nearest airplane ) . He has just completed his senior year as a pre-medical student at the University of Minnesota . " It 's Been a Long Snow " is his first published story . lacked paint . Units have been taken to the motor pool for overhaul and repaint . " I signed the message and went in to see Ann Tommy . Lying there under the GI blanket , breathing slowly , she seemed to be getting softer , yet losing weight . She had been all bone and sinew when she came . " Have they found my people ? " she asked . " It 's still snowing . You 'd better start trying to get up . " " I try , but I have never been so weak . " She stirred and fell back . " Maybe I have wait too long to try . You make me soft with care and medicines . " " Maybe we should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pots and pans . " " It would be good , hard work . I would like it . " T HAT afternoon the skies cleared for a few hours and we got word that a cargo plane was coming in from Anchorage . It was about time . Our food was almost gone . Then we got another message . This was an inspection flight . There was no food aboard the plane , only inspectors . Among them was Captain Fenner . I sent word to the mess sergeant to use the raggedest scraps he had for the inspectors ' dinner , and waited for the plane . It would be interesting to see Fenner . He could n't look wholly human . Half an hour later the plane came in low over the hills to the south . It landed and parked . Colonels and majors filed clown the ladder . But no captains . The officers clustered about the site commander and the group went inside . I waited in the cold . Eventually a small , gray-haired man came to the door of the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , gravely . " Ah , you must be the adjutant . It 's nice to meet you . " " It 's nice to meet you , sir , " I said . I was thinking , " What the hell will 1 say about those power units ? " 72 IT 'S BEEN A LONG SNOW early Alaskan night . " I guess we 'll be here all night , " he said . After supper we went to the one-room officers ' club . The commander and the rest of the inspectors had gone to the movie , the sixth showing of " Picnic . " I opened a couple of strong beers and we sat down . I was not very comfortable . Fenner was a rather gray , silent fellow and I 'm not a talker . There was a wide age spread and the big jump from first lieutenant to captain between us . Also I was still afraid he was going to ask about those power units . We had two quiet beers , then three and four . Outside the wind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really like it out here ? " he asked . " It 's good duty . " " You 're not going to stay in the Air Force , are you ? " He shook his head . " No , I do n't suppose so . " After a moment he added , " You do escape a Int of chickenshit out here . " He took inc by surprise . I answered honestly . " I only have to handle it on paper , anyhow , I do n't have to live it . We do n't usually even salute . " " That would seem odd , " he said , almost to himself . T WO more beers . He asked me about Ann . I told him how she had showed up , how non-city Eskimos had no immunity to flu , how her family lived off the land , and I told him what I knew about the Hungry Country . He listened gravely . I felt a bond developing between us . I found myself going on , telling him 1 about myself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me about himself . " I joined up in ' 41 , " he said . " feeling pretty heroic . I 'd had two years of college . After training , they put me in P38s in the Pacific . I got pretty sick of being shot at . I got sick of flying too  --  sitting for hours in a smelly little cockpit . On top of it I developed piles . A lot of us did . I wonder if most people would believe that the occupational disease of fighter pilots is piles . Anyhow , to my amazement , I got out of the war 0 alive . I did n't figure going back to college would help me make money , so I went right into a bank . By the time the Korean war came along I was head teller . Then I was recalled . They made me a supply officer at Yuma , Arizona . By the time the Korean war was over I had been in the service eight years . I figured , ' What the hell , I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beer cans were stacked row on row on the table between us . The bar gave off a pleasant impulse that occasionally comes over me when a new friendship is mixed with alcohol , I blurted out a loaded question . " You know we do n't have any of those silly power units out here . Why did you insist on my making out that report ? " For a moment I was afraid the bond had been broken . I 've nipped off a lot of new friendships that way . He looked at me . I sat there , waiting to resume the role of subordinate . " It 's mutual fear , " lie said finally . " The whole goddam system is based on mutual fear . I was told that all units subordinate to division had to turn in those reports . I had to have a report from each unit in my files . I did n't want to invent a bunch of power units . If you wanted to , that was your business and your responsibility . I 'm trying to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some more officers . One bad effectiveness report  --  that 's all it takes . One guy above you who does n't like you and you 're on the first list for release . Suppose they tossed me out ? Where would I go ? Who 'd hire me ? I 'm forty-three . I 'm an old man on the outside . " He paused . Then he went on , ' ' It 's not very hard to survive , though . All you have to do is stay out of trouble . When you really try to do something is when you put yourself in danger . Submerge , swim along with the rest  --  and get it down on paper , that 's the key . " He leaned forward . " When you got my message , the one saying the report was mandatory , I bet you laughed . I would 've once . ' What a pinhead ! What a blind , bureaucratic clown ! ' I would 've said . But you 've seen me . I 'm no clown . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force . I work with a guy named Norman Parrish . Captain Norman Parrish . He 's no clown . He shot down four Japs in World War II . On weekends he goes off hunting rams , climbs around the mountains all by himself . He 's forty-five years old and he 's tough as hell . He 's a man , not a bureaucrat . And I 'm a man , not a bureaucrat . But add us all up and we 're a bureaucracy . It 's the system . The whole damn world is being sucked up in the system . It 's wrapping us all up in warm , secure fat You know something ? When I sent you that ' report mandatory message , I did n't smile cynically like you would 've if you 'd been sending it . Sending it seemed perfectly natural , not even worth thinking about . " I LOOKED up ; the medic was standing in the door . " Lieutenant , " he said , " they found the Eskimo woman 's family . Two men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They gave them medicine and did what they could before the weather started closing in again . Then they had to go back . " " Did you tell Ann ? " " That 's mainly why I came . The Eskimo woman died a little while ago . " " Died ? She had a warm bed and medicine and she died of the flu ? " " I do n't think it was just flu . She was pretty used up . " We were silent . Outside the temperature was below zero . The wind attacked the building , driving snow into the cracks and pores of the wood  --  filing , eroding . It swept in darkness across the empty valleys , picking at the round bodies of the foothills , battering the peaks of the Alaska Range . Fenner was looking thoughtfully at the dark window . " Who could live ont there ? " I asked . In my mind I began to compose an official letter to the Indian Bureau about the dead woman .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
