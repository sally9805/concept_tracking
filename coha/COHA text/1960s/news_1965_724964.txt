txt What 's ahead . When the political scurrying halts over the one-man , one-vote issue , most of the new political muscle is likely to turn up in the suburbs . Many states are pushing ahead to obey the Supreme Court 's reapportionment edict . What they do is apt to alter the political balance in the nation . Many have hoped ( or feared ) it would make the big cities dominant . But will it ? New analyses show that the big gainers will be the subdrbs , not the cities . Many central cities , indeed , are losing population , which is exploding out to the suburbs . Suburbs are mostly property conscious . And they 're often conservative and Republican , though Democratic strength is mounting . Now under way in the Senate is Round 2 of Illinois Republican Sen. Everett McKinley Dirksen 's fight to dilute the court 's ruling . Mr. Dirksen says he will keep bringing the subject up . His foes say they will keep knocking it down . The next hand the government holds out to crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment is piling up in Washington to help innocent victims of criminal attack foot their bills . The city 's health department has recommended that crime victims in the nation 's capital get free medical attention . Oregon Democratic Sen. Wayne Morse , chairman of a Senate subcommittee on District of Columbia affairs , favors public aid . And some plan may be tried soon on a tentative basis . No permanent program looms , however , until the subcommittee and district officials can study the question closer . Any D.C. program would probably point the way for other crime-wracked cities . The nation 's 3,200 top emergency planners are coming soon to Washington . But any relationship between their visit and Vietnam is purely coincidental . These experts , all high-level civilian executives , meet every three years , emergency or not . Their Oct. 26-27 meeting is one of these regular triennial affairs . They call themselves the National Defense Executive Reserve . Their job is to manage the nation 's economy if a national emergency breaks out.t -- They are set to take up wartime duties at an instant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency  --  not yet anyhow  --  their regular agenda has n't been rewritten around it . Trends . ? ? The post office is slowly going the way of the Laundromat . For 10 months the Post Office Department has tested the idea of self-service . Officials like it so much they are about to set up a ring of self-service branches around the nation . Sites are already being staked out . The first opened last year in Wheaton , Md. , just north of Washington . Two others went into business soon after in Atlanta and Buena Park , Calif . Some 94 percent of the people polled around Wheaton thought it about the best idea since the self-sealing envelope . Each office will stay open around the clock all year long . Inside , a bank of vending machines will disgorge stamps , stamped envelopes , and postal cards . Scales to weigh letters and packages will stand around . Automatic changers will cash bills and coins . Information panels will tell what to do next . And the mail will be picked up often . More fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What kind of photographer policy should the President pursue in private life ? President Eisenhower permitted photographers to take his picture only at the first or 10th tee and the 18th green when he went golfing . When President Kennedy went yachting the Secret Service kept photographer-laden boats far abeam or abaft , Now President Johnson has a problem with boats and photographers , too . They sneak pictures of him every time he goes boating in the narrow lake near LBJ ranch . What bothers the President is the risk of having pictures of him lounging shirtless and soaking up the sun , pop up in the press alongside pictures of the Vietnam war or the Los Angeles riots . People might not understand . He could tell photographers not to picture him in his boat . But that wo n't stop private citizens from doing so and selling them to the papers . The President has n't yet worked out his photography policy . reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . Further reproduction prohibited without permission .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
