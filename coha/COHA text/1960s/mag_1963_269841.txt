Through Nov. 30 . <P> REX CLAWSON-Royal-Athena II , 1066 Madison Ave . at 80th St. Clawson mixes nerve with verve in wax-oil-and-casein commentaries on politics , crime , Mom and libido .

Through Nov. 11 . <P> ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG-Castelli , 4 East 77th St. Newest turn in the Pop cycle is the technique of enlarging colored photographs and transferring them to canvas by a silk-screen color separation process .
