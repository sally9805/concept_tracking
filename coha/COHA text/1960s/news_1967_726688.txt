txt And so , as Mom and Dad sink slowly in the West , we bid a fond farewell to beautiful Expo 67 . But seriously , folks , as Expo prepares to close on Oct. 29 , our family of five satisfied customers would like to suggest an extension of six or seven years . It would take that long for a real Expedition , if you 'll pardon our eight-year-old 's expression . And we ca n't help wishing everyone could visit Expo instead of merely the 300,000 who were there on the Saturday of our recent long weekend . On the first day I did n't have to carry the five-year-old ( 49 pounds ' ladies and gentlemen , and wearing the black tights ) at all . On the second I had to carry her only 300 yards or so . On the third I cunningly tried to forestall a long haul by lifting her briefly without being asked . It was then that her mother reported that her daughter had maturely agreed never to ask to be carried again  --  inquiring only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously , in our Expo personae , she was the Girl , just as the 10-year-old would turn out to be the Humorist and the eight-yearold the Capitalist , at least on this occasion . Of cou.rse , there was some overlapping of roles . It was the Capitalist who looked around at all the " Theme " pavilions with labels like " Man and His World " and " Man and His Health " and said : " They should have ' Man and His Pavilions . ' " And it was the Humorist who held back on buying stamps at the United Nations pavilion until assured that he would not have to pay back the 34 cents by which this purchase , added to his previous purchases , would exceed his $1.67 share of the $5 given to the children by Grandma and Grandpa . I forget who cxnlained that the Girl and the Capitalist would now have to get 34 cents extra , too . The Capitalist , like General Motors , usually has considerable indebtedness but an excellent credit rating . At Expo the souvenir stands required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fondmemories recalled // that he did not follow his frequent practice of buying now and paying later . Every day he channeled our caravan toward the merchandise until , during the final hours , he made the plunge : a shiny white marked-down helmet that said " Expo " on it . Meanwhile , the Girl was buying Asian beads . With the expectation of being brought such a present , she had been content to let her brothers go to Expo without her . She had been invited to a neighbor boy 's house and she would wait for her mother to " tell about everything " at the fair . Movies everywhere But would n't she like to see things for herself , all those wonderful buildings and paintings and machines and movies ? " You mean you 're going to see movies ? " Some kind of decision seemed to be forming beneath her bangs . The neighbor boy wound up taking care of he dog . And movies we did see . At Labyrinth : It took three rounds of pizza to get through the waiting line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with the audience on galleries watching a giant screen on the end wall as images connected and contrasted with those on another giant screen on the floor below . At Kaleidoscope : Mirrored projections put us inside a blaze of shifting color , " not like a real kaleidoscope , " said one of the children . Space trip simulated At the Canadian Pacific-Cominco pavilion : A multiple-screen celebration of youth by Francis Thompson and Alexander Hammid , a tricky step beyond their delightful " Johnson 's Wax " film brought from the New York World 's fair to the UN pavilion at Expo . At the Soviet pavilion : A simulated space ride in padded , seat-belted chairs that automatically tilted  --  with a certain emphasis on Soviet accomplishments . " I think Russia was br , agging in that movie , " said the Capitalist . At the United States pavilion : Among the jaunty , low-pressure , sometimes campy displays of the most powerful nation , a film not about national achievement but about children 's games . A girl-next.door hostess filled a delay by asking members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm from Falls Church , Virginia ? near Washington . " On the escalator , the Humorist said : " Well , the U.S.S.R. is still ahead . " Surrounded by images At the Czechoslovakian pavilion : Marvelous multiple projections on suspended moving surfaces , a whole wall of small squares that became separate images or parts of the same image . Did the girl know what was happening ? " No . " At the Telephone pavilion : The audience stood inside a circular hall , completely surrounded by a film on Canada in Walt Disney 's " Circle-Vision 360 . " Holding the Girl at adult-eye level , I missed a few things behind us , not to mention in front of us . " That was the best regular movie we 've seen , " said the Humorist , one more American boy made blas ? by Expo . Of course there were interludes back at our spotless basement lodgings in a Canadian home . " Take a shower ? right now , " said the parent , interrupting a bit of going-to-bed hilarity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the Humorist . " I 'll get up early , get dressed , and go out to the swing , " said the Girl . The Capitalist was helping her collect soap in Expo wrappers . " If we have breakfast at the same place I 'm going to have fried eggs , " said the Humorist . " A hamburger ? at least that hamburger  --  was n't good enough for breakfast . " As far as food goes , we perhaps did not exploit Expo to the full , partly because the majority of the family was conservative about anything more exotic than French fries . Stopping for one urgent snack squeezed our deadline for picking up some tickets at the Soviet pavilion . Short cut , heir , heh ! So I ran on ahead , craftily leaving the crowded main path and threading through the grounds of the Senegal pavilion . Only a canal stopped me . When I found and crossed the bridge , passing the family from behind , I cheerily explained I was taking a short cut . We got the tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit-down Russian dinner . " One thing good about this meal , it fills you up , " said the Capitalist . I was so glad to hear a kind word for something besides hot dogs that , for a split second , I failed to recognize the trap . Then it snapped shut . " I can hardly eat any more , " he said , and hardly did . One of the other necessities , transport , was taken care of by the free Expo-Express , as well as by Hovercraft , Minirail , and La Balade trailer train . The driver of the latter was a kind of Canadian Jean-Paul Belmondo who paused by two pretty girls at the headquarters of the Expo hostesses and said this was the favorite pavilion of the Balade drivers . Then he turned around and drove by the " Hostesses ' pavilion " again  --  to the huge enjoyment of the Girl , the Humorist , and the Capitalist , as well as other passengers . Then he pretended to start going around a third time . But he turned back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a few moments to go beyond food and transportation to the finer things , such as the remarkable international exhibition of art where the Capitalist immediately said " There 's our puzzle ! " Sure enough , there was MirO 's " Harlequin 's Carnival , " the original of one of the great jigsaw puzzles . " That must be Chagall , " said my wife , looking across the room at another canvas . The Capitalist went over and checked on the signature . " Mom knows everything , " he said . " You just keep saying that and get off that post , " said his mother . She had joined me in noting how the Capitalist seemed to have to test the pedestal of every post with his foot , the texture of every wall with the shoulder of his good jacket . " There 's a Rembrandt , " said someone else . " Is that really what Rembrandt looked like ? " asked the Humorist . " No , it 's what he drew like , " said the Capitalist , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another man thinking it was his father . The man did n't know exactly what to say . But the Capitalist , when he discovered his mistake , did . Turning a filial smile on Dad , he said , " You fink . " Cherchez la cap It was on the pleasant grounds of this gallery that the Humorist noted : " Hey , in this pool there 's 22 pennies and an Avis button . " All things considered , the **25;289;TOOLONG and I could n't get too upset when , on our last night , the Girl dropped the cap of the toothpaste down the drain of the wash basin. , It was n't on purpose , she explained , suggesting that I get it out with a toothbrush and then wash the toothbrush . But I noticed the cap was floating down there in the trap and with Yankee ingenuity I decided to raise the water level till I could reach it . Funny thing , though , when you run water into a Canadian drain , the water does n't rise , it goes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good-by , Expo , " said the Capitalist as we drove away for the last time . " That was funny when you said you were taking the short cut , " said the Humorist . " I thought that driver was going to go past the Hostesses ' pavilion again , " said the Capitalist . It was about time for the Girl to say , as she had in many a marvelous pavilion , " Is it over ? "
