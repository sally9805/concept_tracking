txt A flotilla of rescue craft doggedly patrolled a 20-square-mile area of choppy ocean today in a search for six missing crewmen from the Norwegian tanker Stolt Dagali . In alternating bright sunlight and cloudy gloom , seven Coast Guard cutters and patrol boats crisscrossed a sea heavy with oil slick . Five helicopters circled ! overhead . By nightfall the lost ! men had not been found . A Coast Guard spokesman said that a man could not live lin the chill water for more than half an hour . But the Coast Guard decided to keep one of its cutters  --  the 95-foot Cape Strait ? on all-night duty in the area . The missing men were among 13 aboard the tanker when she was in collision in a ! heavy fog early today with the Zim liner Shalom . The accident occurred off New Jersey , 50 miles southeast of Manhattan . The tanker was torn in two by the collision , and the stern section sank soon afterward .

A tugboat , the Cynthia Moran , circled the deserted hulk , while a salvage crew tried in vain to put a line aboard and tow the section to port . ' Another attempt is to be made // at daybreak . The tanker half appeared to be slowly setting- in the stern . About 100 feet of deck behind the bridge was awash . As night fell , the Coast Guard I cutter Spencer played a mercury light on the shattered tanker . The light reflected on portholes , and the ship for a few minutes resembled a normal outbound tanker . A long oil slick from the tanker stretched back to the collision point . The tanker , gray except for a white bridge , turned slowly in the rolling gray sea .. The Spencer circled her several times while the tugboat made protesting toots on her whistle .

Liner Gets Escort Earlier in the day , as the 327-foot Spencer headed out of New York Harbor , she met the Shalom , inbound about seven miles past Ambrose Light . The captain of the Shalom asked Capt . Lewis W. Tibbetts of the Spencer to provide an escort into the harbor , where she was to meet two tugboats . The Spencer turned and accompanied the Shalom into Ambrose Channel until she was opposite Far Rockaway . The liner , her bow low in the water , moved at her minimum speed of four knots . The captain apparently was fearful that the pressure of heavy swells would crush the watertight bulkheads in the bow if he moved faster . Passengers gathered at the rails of the liner as the two vessels moved slowly up the harbor . Planes Hover Overhead On her mast the flags of Israel and the United States snapped in the brisk wind .

The gash at the front of the vessel spewed water , as the prow rose slowly from each wave . The stern occasionally lifted high enough so that observers could see the tip of her rudder and propeller . The gaping rip on her starboard side appeared to be about 10 feet high . It extended well into the ship . After seeing the Shalom into the harbor , the Spencer turned ' and raced at 20 knots to the search area . The Spencer , normally a weather patrol vessel , had sailed from the Coast Guard base at St. George , S. I. , at 6:30 A.M. with only 90 of her normal complement of 148 men aboard . It 's Rough Down There ' The following account is by George W. Cornell of The Associated Press , who flew over the scene of yesterday 's ship col-lision : In the hazy lavender of morning , a stricken ship and the torn remains of another rode low today in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , its empty and lifeless deck awash , appeared to be slowly sinking , following the rest of her beneath the water . Each pitch sent up a foamy spume , like the last gasps of a living creature . Such was the scene after a fog-shrouded collision in the Atlantic between the Israeli passenger liner Shalom and the Norwegian tanker Stolt Dagali . The liner struggled back toward port , her bow crumpled and split ; the front part of the tanker wallowed hopelessly , abandoned and adrift , her dismembered stern already gone under . From a plane circling overhead , they looked like the expiring victim and the dismal survivor of a wrenching , thundering encounter in the night . " It 's rough down there , " our pilot , Louis Haslbeck , 42 years old , of Little Ferry , N.J. , shouted above the engine roar . " It 's bad . " From high and at a distance , the Shalom still looked her sleek and graceful self , her twin stacks towering above her snow-white hull , the Star of David in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mast . But down closer , one could see the harsh bruising she had taken when she knifed through the tanker . A 40-foot gash rent her starboard bow , near the waterline and blunted her prow . ' Brown oil streaks dirtied the sides of the pearly hull . Tanker Cut Diagonally But her infirmity was little compared with that of the tanker , sliced through her beam . The remnants of her , the forward three-fourths of the vessel , lay 20 miles out beyond the Shalom , about 50 miles al ' together from inner New York Harbor . The tanker was cut diagonally across , the cut angling ' from the starboard afterdeck slightly forward to the port side . The amputated end hung low in the water , rising and falling feebly . Each time it slapped downward , geysers shot upward . Nothing moved on the green deck , except the flooding sea . No flag flew . The bridge was deserted . The antenna stood idle . A lone sea gull hovered over the hulk , swooping low in tentative inspection .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
