txt Phoenix , Ariz. , Feb. 19 ( 4 ) A 7 year old boy who plunged 275 feet down a pipe into a water well kept himself alive today until rescued by listening carefully to his father . The boy , Harry Stage , was in fair condition at a Phoenix hospital with a broken pelvis , broken thighs , and undetermined injuries . He was in the well for 45 minutes . Harry owed his life to the fact that he did n't panic and that he heeded advice called down the 16 inch pipe by his father , Edsel , a driller on the Webb Faubion ranch 25 miles southwest of Phoenix . Breaks Thru Board " He always did mind good , " said Stage soon after the boy had been hoisted up the pipe by a series of lariats looped together . Stage said he was talking to Faubion when- his son climbed a five foot platform and jumped ? on a piece of plywood covering the pipe to an irrigation well . " The boy just vanished , " Faubion said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stage explained . " and this undoubtedly slowed his fall . But he could n't , tread water because of his broken legs and pelvis . " Father Calms Boy " Daddy , get me out of here , " Harry yelled . " Do n't worry , son , and do n't be scared , " his father replied . " We 'll get you out . Just push against the sides of the pipe so you do n't sink . " " Okay , daddy , I will , " came the brave response . Then Stage started to lower himself by the drilling cable , but soon realized he would get stuck in the pipe . Faubion recalled there was a block-and  --  tackle at the Carl Arnold ranch seven miles away . He sped to the ranch and snatched the entire stock of lariats . Looped together , they came to m6re than 300 feet and these were lowered into the pipe . " Daddy , I can hold on to it while you pull me up , " Harry called . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shoulders . " The boy complied and the men started hauling him up . When he reached the top , the boy was quickly put into a waiting ambulance and brought to Phoenix .
