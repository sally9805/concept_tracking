When he fires up a secret still , a moonshiner violates no fewer than eleven federal laws , including one that commands him to display a sign " disclosing his name and occupation . " Even so , moonshiners are tougher to catch than Viet Cong guerrillas . They booby-trap stills , wire the woods with hidden buzzers , warn one another with trained dogs and walkie-talkies . Only the best-trained woodsmen among federal agents can track them , usually at night when both sides flit through the back hills armed to the teeth . <P> In 1958 , Congress tried to give the feds a boost by passing a law that creates a presumption of guilt for anyone caught near a moonshiner 's place of business . Unless he has a good alibi , " such presence of the defendant shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize his conviction . " Last week that law came before the Supreme Court in the case of Jackie Gainey , a Georgia moonshiner who had been nabbed near a still . Upholding the law 8 to 1 , the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moonshiners are " notorious for the deftness with which they locate arcane spots for plying their trade . " Because strangers " rarely penetrate the curtain of secrecy , " it is reasonable to assume that anyone around a still is in on the secret . <P> But Justice Hugo Black was aghast at the decision . In a dissent that ran longer than the majority opinion , Black saw Congress usurping the jury system that he reveres . Congress can " create crimes , " said Black , but the Constitution empowers judges or juries to decide the facts " on their own judgment without legislative restraint . " As for personal experience , drawled Black from the bench , " I come from a part of the country where now and then they had some stills , but I never thought that if I was unlucky enough to be caught around there , hunting birds or something , my presence would be enough to convict me . " <P> Alabamian Black 's home state has , in fact , something more than " now and then " stills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made 619 arrests in the process . The last two revenuers killed in a liquor raid were shot a little more than a year ago in Alabama 's Bibb County . Even so , argued the feds in U.S. v. Gainey , chances that innocent hunters may stumble on stills are " very , very small . Other rural possibilities-a lost motorist or an airman who parachutes to safety-are even more remote . " Indeed , the feds figured the odds against a stranger ever tangling with moonshiners at 100 to 1 .
