Should Be Cut Out ? <P> According to medical statistics , some 12 million Americans have , or have had , ulcers of the stomach or duodenum . <P> Every day , ulcers claim 4,000 new victims ; every year , surgeons put about 150,000 ulcer patients on the operating table . There are half a dozen major types of surgery for ulcers , plus a dozen minor variants . Some of them are al most a century old , but physicians and surgeons still can not concur on which type of operation is the best , or even which is best for any particular patient . <P> Last month specialists in Boston and New York reviewed the whole field in an effort to outline areas of agreement . They succeeded in illuminating the variety of argument . <P> Wanting in Elegance . Nobody knows the root cause of ulcers in the digestive tract , but what happens after the process gets started is fairly clear . Countless cells in the wall of the stomach secrete chemicals , such as gastrin , and hydrochloric acid . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if for any reason-physical or emotional - the stomach cells churn out digestive juices when there is no food for them to work on , they may start digesting a spot on the wall of the stomach itself . The result is a gastric ulcer . More often , the corrosive juices empty through the pylorus into the duodenum , the second chamber in man 's digestive tract , and start eating through part of that . Though duodenal ulcers never lead to cancer , some types of stomach ulcers are associated with cancer . <P> Stomach surgery has developed in a broken-gaited fashion , with surgeons periodically going back to and modifying old techniques . Physicians realized in the 1880s that man can get along , after a fashion , with only a remnant of his stomach . German-born Surgeon Theodor Billroth then decided it was possible to cut out the lower stomach and pylorus and join what was left of the stomach to the duodenum ( see top diagram ) . After this " subtotal gastrectomy , " or " Billroth I , " came a still more daring invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : cutting out about half of the stomach and hitching up what was left to the small bowel , leaving the duodenum dead-ended and dangling ( second diagram ) . <P> After 1930 , these and variant operations were widely used for ulcers . It mattered not that the ulcer might be in the duodenum : the part to cut out , the doctors reasoned , was in the stomach , where the digestive juices were being overproduced . Over the years , doctors concluded that this part was high up in the stomach . Some surgeons went on cutting out not only 50% but 75% to 80% of the stomach . " This , " complains Boston 's famed Surgeon Francis D. Moore ( TIME cover , May 3 ) , " is not only crippling but wanting in elegance of rationale . " <P> Despite such criticism , drastic operations did much good for some patients . The trouble was , no one could tell in advance which patients would die during or soon after the operation , which would develop ulcers again , or which would have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undigested food into their small bowels within five or ten minutes after meals instead of a few hours .
