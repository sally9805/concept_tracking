In the old days , no New England town was complete without its village idiot , but now there are the summer theater managers . How many times , after all , can a man watch Springtime for Henry in his own barn ? But last week one impresario decided that he was not the only unbalanced character in town . After 29 years at Maine 's Kennebunkport Playhouse , Robert C. Currier took an ad in the local paper , put his famous theater up for sale , and explained why . " I have felt for some time , " he said , " that a person must have an examination proving he 's half cracked before he can live in this place . " Currier followed that up by cataloguing the woes of a straw hat manager . <P> George Washington . " It takes 20 minutes to sell two tickets over the phone , " says Currier . " All these people want to do is talk . When they start asking how much the $3.30 tickets are , you really start wondering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here are always so bad . Can you imagine ? She actually thought she 'd been watching a movie . When they see our advance schedule , some customers ask us who wrote To Be Announced . " <P> About 30% of the audience , according to Currier , regularly shows up smashed to the gills . Unselfconsciously recalling the rocky seasons before he joined Alcoholics Anonymous , he says that for years he himself was a drawing card : " They used to come to the Playhouse to see if I 'd fall over the porch banister . " <P> On the wagon since 1953 , he has developed a relatively clear head as well as an unqualifiedly bitter eye . He can not even stand his financial patrons , blue-rinsed resident grandes dames who look like Gilbert Stuart 's George Washington . One of them collects bones . Another once threatened loudly that the improvements-minded Currier must never think of destroying a small , one-story extension that contained the backstage toilets , since " the Gish sisters used them . " <P> Codfish Aristocracy . A master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes them pay $30 a week for room and board , and constantly threatens to fire them-Currier , now 46 , started his theater when he was 17 , and built it into one of the country 's most durable stock houses by the traditional method-milking Broadway cows turned out to pasture ( this season : Under the Yum-Yum Tree , The Pleasure of His Company , etc . ) . But he has also mixed in Wilde , Williams , Sherwood , and Giraudoux , giving the Kennebunkport Playhouse a high reputation among actors , critics , and the sober side of his audiences . Performers are fond of returning there , including Tallulah Bankhead , Henry Morgan , Russell Nype , and Currier 's own sister , Singer Jane Morgan . <P> Directed largely at the year-round residents , Currier 's arrows also twanged toward the summer people , whom he calls " the Codfish Aristocracy ; they come here and rot with cocktail parties , and when they entertain our stars , they do so to show them off as freaks to their guests . " If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1961 schedule , the summer people and the year-rounders will again be watching Edward Everett Horton in Springtime for Henry . Then , if anyone comes along with the $300,000 asking price for the Playhouse , what will Robert C. Currier do with himself ?
