Defense Official Denies Raid Over Laos To the Editor : On April 13 The Times published a dispatch from Saigon under the byline of R. W. Apple Jr . in which he reported on the first raid by B-52 bombers of the Strategic Air Command against a target in North Vietnam . The official communiqu ? of the Military Assistance Command , Vietnam ( M.A.C.V. ) on this raid stated : " U.S. Air Force B-52 's struck in North Vietnam this morning for the first time , hitting the Mu Gia Pass , about 65 miles south of Vinh . " Mr. Apple did not choose to use this official report anywhere in his story . On the contrary , he said that " usually reliable sources said that the ** had not dropped their 750-pound and 1,000-pound bombs in North Vietnam at all , but on a section of Mugia Pass that lies in Laos . " This statement by Mr. Apple is utterly false . The B-52 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North Vietnam only . Mr. Apple wrote further that " these sources said the target had been shifted after lastminute reconnaissance . " This too is absolutely untrue . Mr. Apple then got around to state that " an Air Force spokesman denied the report , " meaning Mr. Apple 's false report . Report Double-Checked Col. William , Director of Information , Seventh Air Force , was the Air Force spokesman queried by Mr. Apple . Colonel reports that after double-checking the fact that the raid had been in North Vietnam only , he went to The Times office in Saigon and informed Mr. Apple his information was absolutely false . Colonel says he tried to impress on Mr. Apple that publication of such a false report would be harmful to the United States . Colonel reports that Mr. Apple thanked him , but stated he was satisfied his " source " was accurate . The end result was that The New York Times correspondent refused to report the official United States communiqu ? on the raid issued by the Military Assistance Command in Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Seventh Air Force , and chose instead to report a falsehood which The Times displayed at the top of Page 1 . I think the readers of The Times have a right to know the truth . ARTHUR SYLVESTER Assistant Secretary of Defense Washington , May 1 , 1966 Mr. Apple did not refuse to report the Air Force communiqu ? or the information provided by Colonel . He took account of the communiqu ? when he stated that the United States planes had dropped their bombs on the Mugia Pass . He additionally reported from other sources that the bombing was in a section of the pass in Laos . He included Colonel 's denial of this report  --  Editor , The Times . ? Memorial at U.N . To the Editor : In the beautiful garden of the United Nations a memorial has been recently erected . This consists in part of a capacious , semicircular stone bench of good proportions , its back handsomely lettered with the name of Anna Eleanor Roosevelt , whom the memorial is meant to honor . Facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to recall the United Nations Secretariat building itself . As efficiently as though it were a permanently drawn window shade , the slab conceals from those sitting on the bench what they would otherwise ? njoy : the beauties of the surrounding garden , and the great-. er glory of its site  --  the sweeping , downstream panorama of the East River . Mrs. Roosevelt is in this instance most unfittingly memorialized . She would never have wished the larger view obscured , as it is by this well-intentioned but unimaginative tribute . FRANCIS STEEGMULLER New York , May 5 , 1966 ? Renaming Clark Base To the Editor : On one of the last occasions I was through Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines , American personnel were confined either to the base or to their quarters if outside the base , in fear of incidents during an antiAmerican demonstration by the local residents . It is to be expected that such manifestations will increase in the future , if only as a reaction against the massive concentration of American presence which Clark Base represents . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve future prospect : , it is suggested that the base be renamed Camp Magsaysay and a token administrative unit of the Philippine forces be included in its control . Any further acts against the installation would then be considered to be against the national patrimony . It seems that such a unilateral step in time would be an economical way to preserve the willing cooperation of such an important ally . I asked half a dozen Americans at Clark Base who Clark was . No one could tell me . IAN ADAMSON ? New York , May 2 , 1966 ? Car Safety Timetable To the Editor : " Why should I buy a new car now when they 'll be a lot safer next year or the year after ? " This question occurs to me as a consumer , and apparently to a lot of other people . As a small G.M. stockholder I hope that the auto makers respond by advancing radically their timetables for making cars safer . That would help my slumping stock . If the studies released to date are correct , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , May 6 , 1966 ? Caliber of C.I.A . Staff To the Editor : While your series on the C.I.A . quite properly notes that it is men , and not the forms of control , which are critical , it failed in one very important sense to follow up the point of that observation . For it is not only the men at the top who count , but perhaps even more importantly , the men in the field . What worries a good many people is the likelihood that C.I.A . personnel practices , geared to a narrow view of national security needs , tend to produce a staff representing a very limited and partisan range of the political spectrum . To the extent that this is the case , the danger of excessive zeal is not nearly so much the result of combining intelligence and operations as it is the product of creating an agency which has a built-in political point of view . The virtues of detachment and objectivity are no less important for an intelligence agency than they are for a court , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timely : " One has to remember that when one 's interest is keenly excited evidence gathers from all sides around the magnetic point . " This danger , Justice Frankfurter wisely noted , " should be particularly heeded at times of agitation and anxiety , when fear and suspicion impregnate the air we breathe . " The fact that there may be liberal analysts in Virginia does not assuage the concern of those who wonder about the kind of men who are planning and carrying out the " dirty tricks . " An article dealing with personnel hiring practices might very well be more significant than further rehashing of adventures which had already largely become matters of public knowl-r edge . JOSEPH L. SAx Associate Professor of Law University of California Berkeley , April 29 , 1966 ? Controls on Hides To the Editor : Your April 26 editorial " Quota on Hides " presents a warped and distorted picture of hide licensing . A more accurate story was carried in The Times news column of March 29 . Export controls were placed on hides and skins because the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have resulted in a projected domestic shortage of 2.7 million cattlehides . The Commerce action was concurred in by the Department of Agriculture . This step did check further increases in hide prices and did strike a blow against domestic inflation in hides , leather and footwear . As Leonard Sloane pointed out in his March 29 news article , recent price increases in footwear were the result of cost increases which had taken place prior to controls . Licensing could not have affected these costs unless hide prices , which on March 1 were 6 to 33 per cent higher than in September , had been rolled back to September 1965 levels . Again , as Sloane Indicated , had the Government not acted , shoe price increases would have been greater ? estimates in trade magazines have indicated 5 to 10 per cent greater . Price increases in footwear have been moderate in view of rising raw material costs . From February 1965 to February 1966 the B.L.S. index on hides rose 92 per cent , leather 15 per cent and shoes 4 per cent . Commerce is reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the all-time peak of 13.3 million last year . Commerce studies indicate that with higher hide prices abroad this will have little or no effect on the dollar value of hide exports for 1966 . Rise in World Demand We were astonished at the comment " packers are talking of slowing the rate of cattle slaughter . . . " Surely The Times does not think cattle are slaughtered for their hides , which amount to about 4 per cent of the value of today 's animal . The Times , of all papers , should have made some effort to understand the economics of the international hide situation . World demand for hides is growing steadily . The United States and Argentina together now export almost 20 million hides a year . Argentina licenses hide and skin exports , holds up licenses when an excess of foreign demand threatens domestic needs , and is reported to he setting up a country-quota system . Most of the important hideexporting countries recognize the limited supply situation in these by-products and regulate their exports to insure domestic needs . To fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian demands are at peak would certainly not be prudent management of our resources . MERRILL A. WA1 so N Executive Vice President National Footwear Manufacturers Association New York , May 5 , 1966 ? Those Atlantic Rowers To the Editor : In your issue of May 3 you ran a news story about two English . journalists who arrived here with the plan to row back to England . In the story you mentioned that " ... two American seamen rowed across the Atlantic in 1896 . " I am an English journalist , too , although I do n't intend to row home , but I feel I must point out that the two seamen who rowed across the Herring Pond in 1896 were Norwegian . They immigrated to ' this country a few years earlier and scratched a living as fishermen . They rowed across the Atlantis and came back by steamer . However , some 240 miles from the North American coast the steamer ran out of fuel ( due to heavy headwinds ) . Undaunted , the Norwegians unshipped their rowing boat and pulled for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent help back to the drifting steamer . After a few more years of living in the United States they both returned to their homeland . ROGER P. SMITH Teaneck , N. J. , May 3 , 1966
