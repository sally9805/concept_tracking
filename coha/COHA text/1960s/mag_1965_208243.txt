Plastered over the windows of an airline ticket office in downtown Rio were defiant posters : IT IS EASY TO DESTROY , BUT IT TAKES 35 YEARS TO BUILD ! WE WILL NOT DIE ! The protests were against one of the most severe economic reforms yet attempted by Brazil 's revolutionary government . In a special decree , President Humberto Castello Branco ordered the country 's big Panair do Brasil airline to cease operations immediately , grounded its planes , and turned over its domestic and international routes to other Brazilian lines . <P> <P> It was a harsh but necessary decision . Among the many things bleeding Brazil is its airline industry . In the early days , the country needed airlines to open up the remote interior . The government awarded routes to anyone with a wing and a prayer , encouraged the lines to stay aloft with subsidies , artificially low fuel prices , and special exchange rates on planes and parts . By 1953 , no fewer than 20 scheduled airlines crisscrossed Brazil with a spaghetti-like network of routes . There are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On some routes , as many as five lines compete for the same passengers , with the result that just about everybody loses money . The subsidies , emergency loans and other bailouts cost the Brazilian government uncounted millions each year . The worst drain was Panair , which has been losing an estimated $1,000,000 a month , and has run up a debt of $66.8 million . <P> Fly Now , Pay Never . Founded in 1929 by a group of New York investors and taken over the next year by the U.S. 's Pan American World Air ways , Panair was once South America 's proudest and biggest airline . It pioneered the first services to the Amazon basin , expanded throughout the country , carried Brazil 's flag to London , Paris , Frankfurt and Rome . As the jet age began , Panair added DC-8s and Caravelles to its fleet of Constellations and Catalinas . <P> <P> Then , in 1961 , bowing to the intense nationalistic pressures stirred up by President Jnio Quadros , Pan American sold its 30% controlling interest to Brazilian investors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a fortune speculating in coffee , quickly put Panair into a financial nose dive . To win friends and influence politicians on other business deals , Simonsen started handing out so many free tickets that on overseas runs as many as 40% of Panair 's passengers were flying now and paying never . <P> Last week one of the line 's four Caravelles was held at the factory in France for nonpayment of repair bills . More than half of Panair 's 25 planes were out of service , and those still flying were often days , not just hours behind schedule . Panair 's 4,500 employees were far more than the company needed , but under Brazilian law it was next to impossible to fire them . <P> Weak as it was , Panair was still something of a national institution , and Castello Branco 's sudden action brought shocked outcries . The governor of Amazonas State declared a state of emergency and flew to Rio to try and plead with Castello Branco . Panair 's directors vowed to appeal the President 's order to the Supreme Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the airline will probably have been torn apart by its competitors and creditors . <P>
