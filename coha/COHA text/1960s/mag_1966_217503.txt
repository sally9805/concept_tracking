The year was 1924 , and an upstart Massachusetts Republican named Joseph W. Martin Jr. , 39 , launched a no-holds-barred campaign to wrest a congressional seat away from a sickly 83-year-old incumbent . " This is not a time for sentiment , " snapped young Joe Martin in announcing his candidacy . " The office of Congressman is a position for one in vigorous health if the people are to be adequately served . " <P> Last week Joe Martin , now 81 years old and himself enfeebled after a dis- tinguished , 42-year career on Capitol Hill* that included four years as Speaker of the House of Representatives and 20 years as Republican leader , went down to defeat in the G.O.P. primary at the hands of an aggressive woman candidate who based her campaign on the same youth-v. - age attack that Martin had used to win his first election . Hennahaired Mrs. Margaret Heckler , 35 , a pert , petite ( 5 ft. 21 in. ) lawyer-housewife from Boston 's upper-class suburb of Wellesley , tossed Martin 's own 1924 quotes back at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service in those years , certainly today it demands even greater vigor . " Peggy Heckler 's only previous political post has been her position since 1963 as the only woman-and the only Republican-on the eight-member state executive council , an elected body that has almost no powers beyond offering advice to the Governor . Heeding her campaign slogan ( " Get a Heckler in Congress " ) , the voters gave her the nomination in the Tenth District , 15,449 to 12,218 . <P> In November , Mrs. Heckler must run against Democrat Patrick Henry Harrington , 46 , a tough labor lawyer with three terms on the Bristol County board of commissioners behind him . Because of redistricting , the Tenth District now has more registered Democrats than Republicans , and Peggy Heckler will need every ounce of her vigor to hold the constituency for the Republican Party . <P> <P> *A term exceeded only by Brooklyn Representative Emanuel Celler , who was first elected in 1922 , and Arizona 's Senator Carl Hayden , who has served in both houses since 1912.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
