He is called a " human treasure " by his fellow Japanese , and few authors have so compellingly evoked the subtle , precise beauty of his homeland . His prose is clear , deceptively simple ; yet the images scattered through his narratives link together to produce deep , sudden insight into the souls of his characters - and of Japan . Until last week , however , Yasunari Kawabata was all but unknown in the West . Then , to the surprise of many , he was awarded this year 's Nobel Prize for literature for his contributions , as the citation put it , to the " spiritual bridge spanning between East and West . " <P> He was the first Japanese ever to win the literary award and the first Asian to be so honored since 1913 , when the Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore was selected . Kawabata , 69 , stepped into the limelight calmly . " I feel I am very lucky , " he told the caller who brought the news . " It is a great honor . " Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " might be made . " For authors , " he said , " honors can some times become unbearable burdens . " <P> Kawabata is well aware of life 's burdens . He was born in Osaka in 1899 , and his father died when he was two . His mother died the following year , and he was placed in the care of his grandparents . By the time he was 16 , they were dead as well . <P> He writes slowly and meticulously . He began perhaps his best-known work , Snow Country , in 1934 and did not consider it completed until 1947 . A bittersweet , erotic story of the doomed affair of a deteriorating geisha and a Tokyo dilettante , the novel shows Kawabata at his best , sensually describing the darker aspects of life , suffering , love and death . Both Snow Country and the later , highly praised Thousand Cranes have been published in the U.S. and Europe . But many of his score of novels are barely known abroad . <P> A Habit of His . For the Western reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Japanese life . Particularly evocative are Kawabata 's descriptions of the look of Japan . " The solid , integral shape of the mountain , taking up the whole of the evening landscape there at the end of the plain , was set off in a deep purple against the pale light of the sky . " His eye for physical description is sharp . " Her skin , suggesting the newness of a freshly peeled onion or perhaps a lily bulb , was flushed faintly , even to the throat . " <P> He can be quietly amusing : " ' One is bigger than the other . ' She cupped her breasts lightly in her hands . ' I suppose that 's a habit of his-one side only . ' " Kawabata is keenly aware of Japan 's historical heritage : " The houses were built in the style of the old regime . No doubt they were there when provincial lords passed down this north-country road . " History , sensuality and the land - all interweave to suggest rather than state the uniqueness of his vision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
