shoulder and smiled a tight-lipped smile . She opened the door . " So it 's you , " she said to Ellen . " I was sure I saw a car go up a while back , but the thought never occurred it might be you . You 're here for the summer ? " " Yes , " Ellen said . " You 're here early . " She glanced at Chris out of the corner of her watery eyes . " Yes , we are . Oh ! This is Chris . We just got married . " She tried to suppress a nervous laugh . " Oh . " " Yes . Last month . Chris , this is Anna . " Anna drew her clasped hands tight against her stomach , so Chris merely nodded and said , in his best country manner , " I 'm pleased to meet you . " " Are your grandma and grandpa up ? " " Not yet . They 'll be here in about a month . At the regular time . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why do n't you come in . It 's chilly out . " " We just wondered if you still have a set of keys to the lodge , " Ellen said . " You forgot yours ? " " Not exactly , " Chris said . " I locked them inside . " " Oh . " " I have n't even seen the place yet , " Ellen said . " I did n't know the door was self-locking , " Chris explained , shifting his weight in uneasiness . " It locked on me . " " Yes , " Anna said . " That can happen . " Yes , it can , he thought , feeling uncomfortable under her eyes . There was something ambiguous and furtive about them , and even when she looked at him directly he felt he was being spied upon . " Well , come in , come on in , " Anna said , and stepped aside for them . Chris let Ellen precede him and went up the wooden steps into the porch , which was large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a work area and storage room than as a porch . Baskets of fruit and vegetables satp101on the floor , and winter clothes and work clothes were draped over the tops of cream cans and heaped in one corner . There were stacks of newspapers , a tractor tire , a washing machine with galvanized tubs , and a butcher 's block with tin cans of sorted nails on it . One narrow path , marked off by frayed rugs laid end to end , led through the center of it all . Anna ushered them into the kitchen . It was also part bathroom . There was a sink , a mirror , a toothbrush rack , and a water heater in the corner to the left . An androgynous appliance  --  half cookstove , half electric range  --  sat forward of the sink , and a cat was on the floor beside it , eating scraps out of a milk carton that had been slashed in half lengthwise . " Sit down , " Anna said , indicating a long table at the other end of the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , staring at the clutter of religious pamphlets on the tabletop , the worn and greasy oilcloth , a lazy susan ringed with glasses of assorted condiments ( which were attracting flies ) , a jug of milk , more religious pamphlets , and a bowl of something brown . There was another cat , a gray one , at the head of the table , sitting in a cleared area where a place had been set , its vibrissae dripping with milk . It tried to lick off the drops , then boxed at its nose , then turned its gold eyes on Chris , unperturbed . " Did you drive all the way up today ? " " Yes , " Ellen said . " And you have n't been in the cottage yet ? " " I have n't . " " Then you must be starved . Let me fix you something . " " That 's all right , " Chris said . " We ate on the road . We have to be getting back . " " Do n't bother , " Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really . " " No bother . " Anna 's voice was prim and unequivocal , like an efficient schoolmarm 's . She went to the cupboard and reached up and her tall , long-waisted body , flat at the chest as well as behind , made a straight , graceful line . Her brown/ish-gray hair was braided , the braids coiled around her head in a crownlike shape , and there was a light shading of hair above her upper lip . Over her black dress she wore a man 's flannel shirt , and she had on brown opaque stockings and squat-heeled shoes . She got down two glasses and wiped them out with her apron , all the while staring at Chris with her magnified , watery eyes , and then set the glasses in front of them and filled each to the brim with milk from the jug . " Have you seen any eagles this summer ? " Ellen asked . Anna clasped her hands in front of her , compressed her prim lips , turned her eyes up , and then looked at Ellen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years ago this May , right after a rain . It was going west toward your bluffs , flyinglow over the trees . " It seemed she had held the answer in readiness for the two years . It was the kind of loneliness Chris had seen only in rural women , an accumulated catalogue of precise detail  --  a reserve that was drawn from for the benefit of others , rather than a state that was inflicted on them . She reminded Chris of his grandmother . It was warm in the kitchen . He unsnapped his jacket , put his elbows on the tabletop , and shifted his weight around on the seat of the chair , absolutely at ease . Anna cleared room for plates , made sandwiches of peanut butter , lettuce , and tomato , and gave them each a portion of homemade applesauce from a crock on the cabinet counter . " How long will you be staying ? " " Probably till Grandma and Grandpa get here . About a month . " " You must come visit us , " Anna said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chris had been in kitchens worse than this ( the other rooms were probably as well-kept and unused as in a museum ; the kitchen was the center of a farm ) but he was afraid Ellen was put off by it , so he ate the sandwich as quickly as he could , and drank down the milk , which  --  hep103closed his eyes against it  --  had small black specks , like soot , skating on its surface . " You really must be starved , " Anna said , and in spite of his protests made him another sandwich . Chris noticed that Ellen was eating slowly , with elaborate daintiness and attention to detail , as she did only when she was famished and wanted to appear polite . They had n't eaten on the road . He was hungry too , he realized , and ate the second sandwich ( bologna and lettuce and mayonnaise ) with a slownessthat was gratifying and almost obscene . " Thank you , " he said . Anna went to the cabinet , pulled open a small drawer that contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pawing through the metallic tangle . Chris judged it would take a half hour . " Here , " Anna said . " This is it . " She held the key in front of her eyes , pointed end up , and stared at it with the fascinationof a child staring at a candle flame . " Yes . This is it . This is the one . " And then she laid it down in front of Ellen . They rose and thanked Anna again for the lunch and prepared to leave , but she became voluble , talking to Ellen about the winter , how severe it had been , and if they had come a few weeks earlier they never would have made it up the hill with a car . Chris went to the doorway , restless , unnerved , anxious to get back to the lodge . Anna seemed to sense this , and turned her eyes on him and began asking what he did , where was he from , was his family Lutheran , did he like the lodge , did he like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept saying , " Well , we better go now , " and edged closer to the door of the porch . Finally he made it there , and he and Ellen were standing on the steps , sayinggoodbye , when they heard a vehicle winding up in low gear and then backfiring as the driver decelerated . " Oh , " Anna said . " That 's Orin . He 'll want to say hello . " They waited on the steps . Headlight beams traveled over a barn , a stone silo , a machine shed , went swinging out over the orchard , then turned and came toward them , blinding ,  |p104and  stopped a few yards away . The lights burned for a while , as though to study them , then went off . A blue pickup . " Ya , " said an elderly , febrile tenor . " Ya . The Strobes . " A tall thin man with stooped shoulders came toward them . His bib overalls were so big at the waist and back and legs that they seemed to be standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of Chris , squinted his pale blue eyes several times , and made a thumb toward the pickup . " Over to Traverse City , oh , thirty-five miles , " he said , as though resuming a conversation in the middle , " over at the cherry factory there , they make this juice . New juice . " He paused , looked them both over , and the yard light glinted off his glasses . " Just this year . Applecherry , they call it . Good juice too ! " he declared , as though they had refuted him . He had a heavy Norwegian accent and his voice kept dipping up spondaic waves of inflection . " They can it there , the big cans you can buy in the grocery store , and they do a good job , I 'll say . " He paused . " You maybe seen it in the store . " These pauses of his you could drive a convoy of pickups through . His long face was weatheredand finely wrinkled , and his lips kept drawing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , they amused him , everything amused him , and any moment he would explain why and everybody could laugh , but meanwhilethey had to be content to watch the creases of humor appear around his pale blue eyes , and watch the gold-filled teeth at the front of his mouth flash in the light each time his lips twitched back . " They got the whole set-up there , for processing it and canning it and all , " he said , and bowed his head and shook it once as though this was hard to believe . " Ya , it 's a thing you should see , a real corker , I tell you . Then they got a storehouse that they stack the cans in for storage , the cases they 're shipped in . Big place . Big as the barn . Bigger , too ! " " Why do n't you make your point ! " Startled , Chris turned to Anna to see if it was actuallyp105her voice that had come out so hard and sharp . Her large eyes were brimming with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his striped cap and scratched at his gray hair , the tentative smile still playing over his face , then slipped his hands under the bib of his overalls and turned and walked toward the pickup . " They do n't want to hear about your cherry factory or your apple juice or your bargains ! " Anna went on . " Here they are , just married , just arrived here , and right away you 're going on about that before you even say hello . What makes you think they want to hear it ? All you know is cherries and hymning and hawing and bargains and sloth ! " Say , Chris thought , and turned again , and saw that the look of contempt in her eyes had grown to fury . He never would have expected that from her . Being Orin 's wife for thirty years ? Living in such isolation with him ? The religiouspamphlets ? Orin , however , did n't seem to hear her , or if he did , it made no difference . He came back from the pickup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and handed Chris a #10 can , with no label on it , that was bent in the center like a stubbed cigarette . " They got all these canning processes they got to go through , and then stacking them in that storehouse they just give the boxes a toss . It makes you hurt to see it , I tell you , but them it do n't bother . They make plenty on it , so all they care is to keep it moving . The buyers , though , they do n't go buying these , " he said , and took the can from Chris and studied it . " Broken cases , they call them , because some of these bonded cans , the juice runs out , you see , and then the labels get dirtied up or come off some of them in the case , but it sure do n't hurt what 's inside the others any . " He squinted at Chris . " You ever had this , this apple-cherry juice ? " " No . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a glass , too , I 'd show you . Good juice , I 'll say that ! Well , partner , what do you think ? " Anna turned and stalked into the kitchen . Orin stood grinningat them . The collie , whining in its throat , came slinkingout of the darkness , ran up to Orin , began nudging at his crotch , and then went up on its hind legs , placing its front paws on Orin 's overalls bib , and tried to lick his face . " Oh , ho ho , " Orin said , scratching its ruff . " Oh , you dog , you . " Suddenly , in an altered tone , he whispered , " Git , now , " and the dog ran off , whimpering . Anna returned with an opener and one tumbler , and passed them through the screen door . Orin sat down on the steps , pierced two triangular holes in the top of the can , poured out half a tumbler , and motioned for Ellen and Chris to sit down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel Anna 's disapproving eyes on his back . Ellen tasted it first . " Oh , it 's great ! " She took another dainty sip . " Here , have some , " she said , and handed the tumbler across to Chris . " Hey , " he said . " It is good . I 've never tasted anything like it . " He finished it off . Orin took the tumbler , rose , shuffled over to an outside spigot , rinsed the tumbler clean , and came back and sat down and filled it to the brim . He held it up to the yard light and studied its color , that of a pale rose . " Good juice , " he said , and drank down the whole glass , his adam 's apple jogging , without a pause for a breath . He wiped his mouth on his sleeve . " Orin , " Ellen said , to fill a pause it seemed would never end , " this is Chris . We were just married . " " Ya , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The partner there  --  " He made a gesture toward Anna with his head . " She mentioned . Chris what ? " " Van Eenanam , " Chris said . " Are you Lutheran ? " " No . " " You could be , with that name , you know . Is your dad Lutheran ? " " No. "  |p107The  vestiges of Orin 's smile went , and his pale eyes narrowed . " You are n't Catholic ? " His accent made it sound like cat-lick . " No , " Chris said . " Ya , them Catlicks , " Orin said , and now his tentative smile seemed a tic or a wince . " They got to have all the women and boose they can get , you know . " He paused and thought this over . " Ruth Sanderson , now , a cousin to old Pete over by Boyne City , she married a Catlick  --  " Chris waited through a long silence to hear the details , the disintegration of personalities , the apparently disastrous outcome . " Ya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . " " Instead of going on about people they do n't know and probably do n't care about , " the voice behind them said , " why do n't you do something useful . Why do n't you drive them up to the cottage ? They 've been locked out since they got here and most likely want to get inside and get things tidied up and get to bed . I 'm sure they 're worn out from the drive . Do you hear ? " " Ya , sure , I 'll give them a ride on up . Right away , too . " This time Orin lifted the can itself to his lips and drank the whole thing down . " Them come in handy , too , " he said , staring at the bent can . " You ca n't ever tell . " He set it down on the steps and slowly rose . " Ya , well , I s'pose we better get you up there , then . " Chris and Ellen stood , turned and said goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was urinating against the side of the house . They turned and said goodbye to Anna , promised to come and visit her soon , and then a metal door slammed and they were lit by headlights . All the way to the pickup , Chris felt , like an extra garment covering him , Anna 's eyes on his back . What was it ? Why was she that way with Orin ? And why had she been so weird with him at first ? And then it came to him.  |p108Anna  did n't believe they were married . Well , Chris thought , as he climbed into the smelly cab of the pickup and settled himself on the seat , straddling the floorshift , that was n't such a strange thing to think . He did n't believe it , either.  |p109Orin  , a brake-jammer , brought the pickup to a sudden halt at the head of the hill . He mumbled something to them , hinting that if he had a jacket he 'd stay , or he 'd have to check some hay , so they got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started across the meadow , the truck jerking ahead in the spasms of a badly accelerated first gear . They watched the headlights go up the meadow , turn off into some trees , and vanish . The sound of the racing motor faded and began to assume the shape of an orange 0 in the night . " Strange , " Chris said . " Very strange . " " Oh , he 's all right , he 's nice . And Anna is , too , really . You 'll get used to them . " " I did n't say they were n't nice . I said , strange . How long have you known them ? " " Since I was a child . " " He works for your grandfather ? " " Just odd jobs . Mostly , he farms his orchards . " " I bet he 's loaded with dough . " " Why do you say that ? That 's what Grandpa says . " " He 's the type . " They turned and started down the driveway toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd left burning . " I imagine Anna and your grandmother get along . " " Not at all . I visit her more than Grandma does . Annap110likes me . When I was a child , I used to walk all the way to their place just for some of her applesauce . " " Her applesauce is all right but , holy god , can she be a demon , or what ? I do n't know how he takes being married to her . " " He is n't . " " What ? " Chris stopped short . " He is n't married to her . " " Are n't they the Clausens , plural ? " " Yes . " " They 're sure as hell not related ? " " No . Orin 's been a bachelor all his life , and Anna was married to his brother , Hans , who was in a partnership with Orin . Hans died quite a few years ago , but Anna 's lived on in the house ever since . I think she owns half the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the word as though revelationhad finally come . " Now I see . Now I understand . " Jesus , he wondered , did he ? They came to the back door of the lodge . " You did bring the key , I hope , " he said . " Yes , but it 's to the front door . We 'll have to go around . " " Oh , my Christ , " he said , " I must be losing my mind ! " " What is it ? " " You have the key , right ? " " Right . " " It 's to the front door , right ? " " Yes , I  --  " " Keep it . " " What ? " " Here . Hold the flashlight , too . " " What is it ? " " Just stand right there , " he said , and took off running . " Chris ! Where are you going ? " " Stay there ! Do n't move ! " He circled around to the front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pane and located thep111hook , lifted it loose , swung the windows out , hoisted himself inside , and went trotting through the building to the back porch . He unlatched the door and swung it open . " Chris ! What did you do ? How did you get in ? " " That window that was broken ? Through it . If I 'd have used my head , we could have got in that way in the first place . We did n't have to go through all that . We did n't need their damn key . " For some reason , he was pleased with himself for the way he 'd got in , and he grinned at her . She blushed , then stooped to pick up the twigs she 'd left by the door . He took her by the wrist and held tight . " Wait , " she said . " We need these for the fire . " " To hell with it . And the chimney screens , too . To hell with it all . " He reached an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a rush of blood dimming his vision and making the veins in his head swell , and though he was afraid he might stumble or drop her , he carried her through the door , kicked it shut behind him , carried her through the porch , kicked that door shut , carried her through the kitchen , holding his breath all the way , through the hall and through the main room , under the approving auspices of the moose , and into the bedroom . He dropped her onto the bed and , hoarsely , with his last reserve of strength and breath , said , " Make it . " The sheets , which she 'd found underneath some beach mattresses and buckskin rugs in a bottom drawer of the dresser , were damp and clinging and smelled of naphthalene . He 'd fallen asleep to the smell and waked to it in the night , and now , as he looked out at the meadow overlaidwith moonlight , the smell seemed responsible for the silver color of the grass and the silver color of the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was higher at its far end and sloped down toward the lodge . Three brushpiles , black against the silver grass  --  the nearp112one looking large as a haystack , the far one small as a bowl  --  stood in a straight row up the center of the meadow . There was a dark rectangular shape against the trees to the left . That would be the pumphouse . What had caused him to wake ? He usually slept a deep sleep , sometimes for eighteen hours , until the clock in his head went off , and he had passed from loving her into oblivionwithout even setting it . Was the marriage , her grandparents , this place , all of it , affecting him that much , upsettinghis sovereign province , Sleep , where he accomplishedeverything he could n't in real life ? Jesus , that would be the limit . But then he heard a sound , metallic as the scene outside , and knew he 'd been waked by that sound . He stopped breathing and held himself in suspension to listen better . Whispering . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marrow . Pang . A note was struck on the piano . Illusion ? Then , bong , another one , in the bass register , followed by some tinkling in the treble keys . Withoutturning to look behind him , he recalled , yes , pregnant women did strange things at strange hours , and just as he was finding some solace in that recollection , the covers , pulled by somebody else , stretched taut . She was in the bed with him . Or better be . He swung around  --  she was there , asleep  --  and for a second he was relieved , and then realized how absurd it was to feel relief . That counted her out . And it would be up to him to go out there and investigate . Why had n't he checked the attic ? He started cursing in a loud voice , using the dirtiest words he knew , and then jumped to the floor and walked all the way into the other room before he realized he was stark naked . It made no difference . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He approached the piano with caution and a sense of reverence . He believed in ghosts . The old trapper returned ? The spirit of his wife as a music-hall matron ? With a scrabbling , whispery noise some keys depressed and there was a dissonant chord . He batted at the air , swinging to check behind him , cry/ing , " Heigh ! Heigh up out of there , you sonofabitch ! Heigh ! " Slowly , he calmed enough to go toward the piano for a closer look , and noticed sliding doors at its front . A player piano . Could the mechanism have been cranked up and chosen this moment to run down ? He slid open the doors . No rolls of music inside . He 'd created such a disturbance that when he came back into the bedroom she was awake , half sitting up , the light from the lamp on the crossbar of the bed shining down on her . She was holding the covers close , either in modesty or in fright . " What is it ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I heard you talking to somebody . " " Right . Myself . " " Could n't you find your way to the bathroom ? " " As if I were going to the john at this hour . " " Were you checking the doors ? Did you stub your toe ? " " No ! " " What 's the matter ? Are you angry with me ? " " No ! " " Yes you are . " - " I 'm not , dammit ! " " What is it , then ? " He stretched out under the covers and stared at the ceiling , trying to decide whether the emptiness he felt was due to the scare he 'd been through , to his impatience at her questions when what he needed was comfort , or to his sense of hurt at having to suffer so many indignities for her sake . He waited for his strength and equilibrium to return . Moths , with wings folded , clung to the beams and bare boards of the ceiling above him . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moth nudge at the back of his mind , testing wet wings . The sensation made him sick . His equilibrium would n't return , he grew weaker , and then his sense of humor , whatever that was and whereverp114it was held , in his chest it felt , gave way and bled from him as he lay there . From such a small thing ? After the unrelentinggamut of the past weeks , from such a small thing ? She put her hand on his chest . " You feel quaky , " she said . " What is it . Tell me . " " Oh , El , I . . . " What ? " What , yes , what ? " Chris ? " " Oh , El , " he began , but the immediacy , the indignity of it caught him up , and he cried , " There are mice in your piano ! " " Oh , I 'm sorry . I keep thinking you 've been here , and know everything . Did they make noise ? I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived there for years . You did n't disturb their nest or hurt them , I hope . " " No ! " he shouted , and snapped off the lamp . " No , I did n't hurt them ! " He turned away from her and was taken by surprise when the meadow silvered even more and began sparkling as he watched , sending out tines and shafts of splintered light . He had n't imagined that the events of the past few weeks had upset him that much . He held himself still so Ellen would n't know he 'd been overtaken by emotion , and tried to purge himself as he had in childhood , but there was no relief now in tears . Springing from a source he was unable to locate or comprehend , they only made him feel more broken.  |p115HE  NEXT DAY , after waking late , they drove seven miles to the village for supplies . Ellen sat behind the wheel and , with an enthusiasm and thoroughness that were almost proprietary , took him on a tour of the dirt streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a squat hexagonal lighthouse , one of the first in the area , that had been constructed in the late 1800 's out of massive fieldstone , and another structure dating from the same time , tiny , wooden , white , with a foundation of similar stone , that was originally the home of the lightkeeper and now housed a small library . There was a Western-style hotel with a high false front and a wooden porch running along its length , but it no longer kept guests , she explained , unless they could n't make it home . HOTEL LIQUOR , its sign read . There was a drugstorethat sold Indian souvenirs ( sheathed with a shingle material that simulated gray stone ) , a general store , a restaurant ( sheathed with the same material but of a sandstonecolor ) , and two other bars  --  all of it within the space of a block and a half . Main Street . Farther down , a Lutheranchurch with a high white spire . The frame houses of the village encircled a small bay which had once been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen off during the Second World War and never picked up again , and now a new cherry factory , built of brick , sat next to the old docks , spilling its vermilionp116waste into the bay . A low modern hospital , also built of brick , stood on a hill overlooking it all . At present the villagewas supported by farmers and a growing tide of tourism ; a ski lodge was under construction nearby , a site for a trailer camp was being bulldozed in a growth of virgin cedar , and the forested land that surrounded the village had been bought up by speculators from Detroit and was being subdivided for summer cabins , a few samples of which were already standing as lures , all of them pre-fab A-frame or flat-roof bungalows that were sleek , style-conscious , pristine , and looked as if they might stand up to the weather for ten years . On a county road of macadam leadingout of the village , some tourist cabins , tiny as toolsheds , were clustered around the newest improvement to the area , a laundromat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAUNDRYMAT . She turned back into town and stopped at the docks . " Come on ! " she said . " Let 's look at the boats ! " She ran ahead on the heavy planking of the old docks . He followed after her with reluctance , giving sidelong glances at the tourist craft , the yachts , the cabin cruisers , and the highly varnished sloops flying triangular flags from tall masts . " Are n't they beautiful ! " she said . " Nice . " " Do n't you like them ? " " Sure . " " I love to sail . I 've been only once . Oh ! Look at this . " She leaped onto the deck of a forty-foot sailboat . " Would n't you like to sail this ? Would n't you like to sail together around the Lakes , out the St. Lawrence , and down the coast ?

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p117She  jumped onto the planking and came to him and touched his shirt front . " What 's wrong ? I thought you liked boats . I thought you liked to sail . " " I do , you know that , " he said , and looked away . Should she be jumping around like that in her condition ? He stared over the water , squinting against the reflected sunlight , and saw that the docks were enclosed by a breakwater of big wooden spiles , whose ends , standing above water level , were sharpened to points a man could impale himself on . " Chris , what is it ? " " That boat 's not yours . " " So ? " " So you should n't be on it . " " Oh , they do n't care ! " " How do you know ? Do you know them ? Are they old friends , old sailing buddies of yours or something ? " " No . " She flushed and lowered her eyes . " Then how can you say they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They just do n't . " Behind her back , a tanned and unshaven face poked out of one of the portholes of the boat . A middle-aged man . Red baseball cap and steel-rimmed glasses . He studied Chris 's face and Ellen 's backside with interest , the inquisitivebastard . " Come on , " Chris said . " Let 's get the groceries . " They walked to the car and drove in silence to the main street . She parked close to the general store , across the street from the library . " Where can I call the watchman ? " he asked . " I still have to do that . " He sighed . " There 's a phone in the store . I 'm going to the library first . Do you want to come with me ? " From the way her voice brightened , he could tell she was trying to draw him out of his dark mood . He stared at the only other vehicle on the street , an old blue Ford with a veil of heat waves hovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same lady , has worked here ever sincep118I can remember .

Then she goes to the shelves , gets out their books on birds , flowers , fossils , and trees , a whole armload , even for her , and checks them out to me without looking up or asking my name .

Whole patterns of thought and reality escape before I can articulate them , and lately I can only say what is n't and not what is . Or is that sophistry ? " She looked at him . Her large eyes were troubled and anxious , and she seemed ready to apologize for what she 'd said , or for falling into one of her verbal states . Then her eyes altered . " Oh , hell , I 'm going to see Edna . That 's her name . " She stepped outside and slammed the door . " You make the phone call . I 'll be right in , " she said , and went running across the street to the library , while he stared after her , uncomprehending , afraid . He started out of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden steps that led to the entrance of the general store , and he was positive their eyes had followed her . Now they were all staring at the ground . A couple of them , teenagers with thick black hair slicked back , had on sleeveless T-shirts and blue jeans , and anotherman , old and toothless , was wearing a plaid lumberman'sjacket and a plaid cap turned off to one side . His tongue hung from his open mouth . In front of the steps , anp119empty wine bottle lay on the ground , flies and gnats orbiting it . As Chris came even with the Indians , he said hello , but they remained motionless , elbows on their knees , studying the ground . He went up the steps and opened the screen door and turned . They were all staring at him . He stepped inside . Six-packs of beer , stacked in chesthighpiles , divided the long room into two sections . There was a meat freezer at the front of the store , and a paint and hardware department at its rear . Storage shelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed on the staggered stacks of beer ; orange workman  --  s gloves , overalls , and children 's toys in plastic bags were piled together with bananas and celery . The clerk , an Indian in a long-sleeved flannel shirt and a bow tie , got up from a chair behind the check-out counter and came over to Chris and offered his assistance . Chris introduced himself and shook hands , and the Indian , who seemed baffled and surprised at this gesture , finally gave Chris his last name . " Attawhisky , " Chris repeated . " That sounds stiffer to take than mine . " The Indian 's reaction was instantaneous and almost surreal . Spokes of wrinkles appeared around his eyes and his long upper lip jerked as if on strings , giving Chris a glimpse of short teeth and a wide band of glistening gums , and then , as suddenly as it had flown up , the Indian 's upper lip fell , his inch-long eyebrows drew down , and he stared at the floor and rubbed his chin ( where a triangle of stubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he were deep in introspection . He lifted his eyes to Chris ; there was hesitance and fear in them . " Hey , " he said . " You drink ? " " Love to , " Chris said . This time the Indian laughed aloud , throwing back his head , showing a greater amount of light-brown gums , and Chris caught the smell of sweet wine on his breath and understood why the man was switching , without transition , from dead earnestness to such hilarity . The Indian 's eyesp120made a furtive search of the store , he moved closer , so close they were almost touching , nudged Chris , and said , " When the boss ai n't around , we 'll sneak some once . " His words came out as spasmodically as his face worked . " Hey , " he said , using the word more as a friendly salutation than as a command for attention . " Hey , you 're a good kid . Good white . New , huh ? " " Yes . " " Cause nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yeah . That 's right . Nobody . Not even the Indians . " He looked over Chris 's shoulder , bent closer to him , and whispered , " Hey , you got a buck ? " " Sure . " " I just got six bits is all . If I had me a buck I could get us a bottle , see ? Just you and me . None of my friends . You see my friends out there ? " Chris nodded . The Indian , copying Chris to an extreme , did big dipping nods . " Yeah , that 's right . They want some , too . " He nudged Chris . " Hey , I 'll pay you back and give you half too , okay ? I get my check the end of this week . " Chris gave him a dollar and told him to keep it , and the Indian became expansive , profuse in his thanks , and offered to show Chris around the store and carry everything he purchased back to the check-out counter . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was waiting for his wife . The Indian winked . " But there 's a phone booth here , is n't there ? " Chris said . " I 'd like to make a call . " The Indian became solemn , walked over to the check-out counter , turned around , swayed once , and with his forefingerbeckoned to Chris . Chris went over to him and the Indian reached behind the counter and set down a Princess phone . " Oh , no , " Chris said . " Thanks . I 'd just as soon use the booth . "  | " No booth . " " There 's no phone booth here ? " " No . " The Indian shook his head . About this he was serious . " Just this ? " " Just it . " Very serious ; his lips pursed tight . " Not a long-distance call , no ? " " No , " Chris said . The Indian pointed to the phone , lining it up in his vision . " That 's it . " Chris took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 843-7448 ) and dialed the number while the Indian , with a gleam of curiosity in his eyes , stood in front of him and watched . " Virgil Weeks here , " said the miniature voice in the receiver . " Mr. Weeks , I 'm unknown to you . My name 's Chris Van Eenanam . I 've just married Mr. Strohe 's granddaughter , Ellen , and Mr. Strohe said for me to call you and say we 'd be up at the lodge for about a month . Okay ? " " Mr. Strohe ? " " From Milwaukee . In the beer business . " " Strohe , you say ? " " He owns the lodge on the lake . You know . I believe it originally belonged to a trapper . " " Oh ! Oh , you mean the old Nicholson place ! Old honeymoonhouse , huh ? Sure , sure , out there on the bluffs there , right ? " " Right . Are n't  --  " " You spending a honeymoon there ? " " Sort of . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are n't you the watchman there ? " " Yes I am , that I am , I am that . " " Oh , " Chris said , and looked up and received a big grin from the Indian . He stared down his nose into the receiver.  | " Oh . Well , I was just wondering if you knew what hap-pened . " " What 's that ? " " That window . " " Which window ? " " The lodge . Front one 's broken . " " Really ? Damn ! I bet it was a nishnob did it . " " A what ? " " One of the nishnobs ! " There were some short metallic barks of laughter , and the voice said , " Little injuns from the reservation over by the county line . Yeah , well , in my business , you know , you got your names for different types  --  your crooks , your petty offenders , your swindlers and whatnot , and I did n't have none for Indians so I made that up myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the ones getting into the summer people 's places and snitchin ' stuff so I thought the name fit perfect , right ? You got anything missing ? " " No . " " Lucky boy ! " " You did n't know about it ? " " What 's that ? " " Window . " " The window ? No , no , it 's news to me . I have n't been up there , oh , I do n't know , since the first of winter , I 'd say . Are the roads still so bad ? " " I thought Mr. Strohe paid you to keep an eye on the place . " " He does , yes , that he does , and every time I 'm out that way , believe me , I drop in and have a look . Except if the roads are so bad . And then it 's no use , because you could n't even get a fool nishnob to go up . They wo n't walk , you know . Got ta have wheels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is I 'm a half-breed myself . Also , I 'm depitty sheriff in this here county  --  your Mr. Strohe knows that  --  and what with car wrecks , gun accidents , people getting lost in the woods ( a bad year for people getting lost ) , oh ,  |p123and  all that , I 'm kept on the go most of the time , usually further south , where more people are . " " Then why take a watchman 's job ? If Mr. Strohe 's paying you to do a job it seems to me you should be doing it . I 'll call later . And I 'm sure Mr. Strobe will be getting in touch with you , too , because he 's going to hear about this , " Chris concluded , as emphatically as he could with the Indian there , and hung up . His hands were trembling . He turned away from the Indian , whom he could n't look in the eye now , walked over to a Pepsi machine , and with a dime sent a bottle rumbling into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood sipping the Pepsi until Ellen came in . He followed her around the store as she shopped , carrying the bottle of soda . He had shopped enough for himself to know what a bore it was , and how futile , too , when you thought of where it ended up , but she went at the task in an absorbedand pleasurable manner , reading labels , checking prices , testing vegetables and fruit , studying different cuts of meat . Whenever she had hesitations , or when there was a question of quality over price , she would turn to him and say , " Will this be all right ? " " Sure . Go ahead . Whatever you want . " He noticed that she always selected the best . He was surprised to see that there was as much available as in a good supermarket , if you looked long enough and in the right places . Besides the liquor . Besides the dry goods . Besides a complete stock of hardware . Once , when Ellen 's back was to the check-out counter , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Chris and Ellen moved around the store , the Indian kept beckoning to Chris , but Chris shook his head and tried to indicate with his eyebrows , Not now , later . So the Indian winked and gave him the O.K. sign , and every time Chris faced the check-out counter he received a wave or a big grin . It began to make him uneasy . Finally , Ellen sensed this silent communication , and turned and caught the Indian with his hand in the air.  | " Do you know him ? " she asked . " We made friends . " " Oh . " She went back to her shopping . Chris felt more and more uneasy and the Indian kept gesticulating . Some townspeoplehad come into the store and as they shopped they gave Chris and Ellen surreptitious looks . Two Indians walked in from the front steps and stood at the Pepsi machine . Chris 's hands were still trembling from the phone call , but there was something more . Was this the first time since they were married that he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed , and worse . He felt that a facet of himself he could n't account for , a double-backed Janus vulnerable from all sides , had detached itself from him and was wandering loose . And he kept turning in circles , glancing over his shoulder , glancing behind , trying to keep this detached part of him , this female Janus , within his field of vision.  |p125Go  up on roof and check screens on chimneys . He got out the ladder and leaned it against the eave . He stepped onto its bottom rung and with bent knees bounced his weight , driving its legs deep into the loose dirt . He climbed the ladder and stepped onto the roof of the dining wing . It had a low pitch , and was covered with wide-tab shingles that looked like hundreds of E 's turned on their backs and arranged in neat rows . The shingles , of asphalt composition , red in color , were littered with bits of twig and pine needles . Sand had blown into the spaces between the tabs and lay there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a miniature copy of the lodge , and it formed an L at the side of the building . He walked its peak to the juncture of the L. The roof of the main buildingran perpendicular to the roof of the wing , slanting down past the wing , and it was pitched as steep as the roof of a barn . From where he stood on the peak of the dining wing , its slanting overhang passed him just above the groin . He hoisted himself onto the main roof , turned toward its peak , and started moving toward the chimney in a bent position , using his hands , like an ape , to help him forward . Sand gritted under his leather soles and he started slipping backward . He threw his body flat to get more resistance and grabbed at the tabs of shingles as he slid along . No handles . It was a ten- or twelve-foot fall , a fall he couldp126take if he was prepared for it and did n't panic , but he did n't care to try . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt ripped at the elbows and finally he came to a stop , flat on his stomach , far below the point he 'd started from . His cheek was resting on his hands . Should he call for her ? He tested with his foot . Extending his leg and toes as far as possible , he still could n't feel the edge of the roof . Lifting his head , he saw that he had bruised some of the shingles black . Damn . Gripping two of the tabs , he got to his knees , splayed his lower legs out in a V , and , using the flats of his calves and the flats of his forearms , he edged up toward the chimney . It was near the peak . He passed the dining wing and when he was close to the chimney he lay down to rest . The chimney , a small brick one , vented the cookstove . It emerged through the overhang and rose five feet above the roof . He would have to stand to see the screen , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimney , pulled himself around so that he was on the area of roof above it , and stood up and leaned against it at an angle . He picked the twigs , dead leaves , seed sheaths , and leaf stems off the screen . It was windowscreen and its mesh was clogged with soot . He slapped it with the flat of his hand . The soot stayed . He picked up a twig and scraped it back and forth across the screen , then slapped it again . Still it stayed clogged . Hell with it . It would be easier to hose it down , or just leave it off until they were ready to go . The heat and smoke of the stove would keep animals away . He uriwired the screen and tossed it to the ground . With the help of the chimney it was easy to make it to the peak of the roof and he sat there for a moment , straddlingthe peak , until his breathing and heartbeat slowed . The fireplace chimney was at the other end of the lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the peak , and walked over to the chimney . It was made of stone , was six feet in breadth at its top , as big as a door , and most of its mass extended beyond the overhang . He looked over thep127edge of the roof toward its base . It was built up along the outside wall of the lodge , its large stones exposed to the weather , and it stood exactly at the center of the building , so that the peak of the roof , meeting at its middle , was like a pointer indicating how well it had been placed . Its screen was of inch-square mesh and did n't need cleaning . He picked off the few twigs that were lying on it and threw them to the ground . This end of the lodge was near the woods and the roof was darkened by leaf shadow . Moss grew on the shingles . He sat on the peak near the chimney , in the coolness of the shade , and stared at the lake . There was a slight breeze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air was damp and smelled of pine and water . He made himself more comfortable , and began rubbing his skinned elbows . Sitting like this in the kitchen . The brightness of the room , the cool shadow lying over his arms , over hers . A smell of water . Some spools on the floor , the thread gone from them . Standing the spools in a tower . Her at the stove . Water being poured , always the sound of water when she was present , water for the drinkingpail , water to cook with , water to rinse the milk from the separator parts , water for dishes , water for baths and washing  --  the smell of water pumped from the well and the sound of it being poured . A sturdy woman . Short and wellbuilt , with a broad forehead and eyes that he watched , so light blue . Shy and wary of him even then , though he was only five . At ease only doing chores or at the stove , her dark hair pinned up for chores and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her hands , broad and strong , moving from vessel to vessel as she worked . Tipping her head back and shaking her hair . Then her eyes on him , then away quick . Rolling a spool toward her . A nuthatch flew from the woods and landed close to the chimney on the log of the eave and clung there , hanging at an angle , studying him with cocked head , then walked around the eave and started tapping at the shingles with its beak , making soft buzzing chins of content.  |p128She  never spoke to him in a raised voice . Seldom spoke to him . His father , large and silent , his brow forever furrowed , spoke only to Grandpa or gave commands : Get away before you get hurt . Do n't do that . Do n't ask . There 's no use trying to tell you , just watch how I do it . Button up your shirt . Stay away from there . And one summer , when Chris fell out of a tree , fell off the drawbar of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of burning trash that his pants leg caught on fire and he had to be taken to the hospital , his father said , What I 'm going to do , I think , is get a new kid . The farm was near the edge of town , and his father told him to keep from underfoot , mix with the town kids , but he liked being alone . Or in the kitchen here . Outside , there was a series of footpaths worn in the grass . One led to the barn and one to the toolshed . Another one , bordered with lilac bushes that spotted it with blossoms , led to the outdoor toilet . Another path led to the chicken coop , and another to his rabbit hutch . Off to the side of the hutch the ground was covered with planks and there were bushes around the planks . A sewery smell rose from the planks . The cesspool . Stay away from there . Standing on the planks one day , he and a boy from town turned a baby rabbit loose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rough boards . It stopped and turned scared eyes on them , and the sunlight made its ears so incandescent Chris could see the delicate veins in them.  --  Oh , look , he said , A halo . Oh . It came from God.  --  No , siree , the boy said . It came from his mother 's cut.  --  Cut ?  --  Just like you.  --  What do you mean ?  --  Your mother 's cut . You came out of it.  --  She does n't have a cut.  --  She does too . Every mother has a cut . They got to have one . That 's the way you get borned.  --  I was n't born from one.  |  --  You were too.  --  My mother does n't have a cut.  --  Yes she does.  --  She does not !  --  You want to bet ? It 's right between her legs.  --  She does n't have a cut there.  --  Every mother has a cut there . Girls too . Even my little sister does.  --  My mother does n't !  --  She does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know she does n't !  --  How do you know ?  --  I looked once . A lie . But , oh , what a hell of a place to hear about it , on those boards . And with all the beauty , all the essence and mystery of it missing . The softening n . The nuthatch came pecking past him , busy , businesslike , unafraid , and climbed onto the chimney and started circling it , its quick beak searching the spaces in the mortar . Rolling the spool toward her . Moving up to it . Rolling it closer . Her at the stove . Rolling it closer . Stopping at her heels . Then his cheek to the floor .... Bare legs , the calves , knees . Moving closer to see thighs . Higher , it would have to be higher . There . A dark line on the white between her legs . A tiny fissure . A hair ? Finally rising up inside her skirt to see . Her scream . Then getting him disentangled , and the blow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter with you ! Do n't you know how terriblethat is ! Do n't you know it 's the worst sin ! " Though he had n't moved , the nuthatch took off with the noisy yank-yanks of fear . He stood . The altitude and sudden change in position made him feel faint and displaced . He made his way slowly along the peak , eased himself into a sitting position , scooted down the roof feet first , lowered himself onto the diningp130wing , and came down the ladder and went into the lodge . He was pale and introverted the rest of the afternoon , and Ellen 's questions and concern irritated him , confused him , and eventually made him angry . He himself was n't sure what was wrong , and he paced around the rooms as though searching for a clue . Finally , he took the key to the pumphousefrom a hook on the kitchen wall and went out the back door . He had only taken a few steps toward the meadow when he saw something that made him stop with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialized . He had left the ladder standing . He went back into the lodge , hung up the key , and walked into the bedroom and lay down.  |p131By  dinner time he was in better spirits . When the meal was finished , he uncovered the furniture in the main room and , under her supervision , began to scoot it back and forth over the board floor , from one corner of the enormous room to the other , arranging and rearranging it to suit her whims . There were several large pieces : three or four stuffed chairs , a plank banquet table , a daybed , a couch . The furniture rumbled and thundered over the floor , and it gave him a strange feeling to make so much noise , with no one present but her , in this big buildingso far from other human life . At last she was satisfied . He decided to add a touch of his own , and went to the piano and took the bearskin rug off its top . He carried it across the room and placed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the fireplace . " Oh , " she said . " We never put that down . " " Why 's that ? " " Grandpa says we 'd wear all the hair off . He wants everything preserved the way it was . He 's very fastidious . " " Oh : " Leave it if you want . " " No . " " I like it there , " she said . " No . Better not . " He carried the unwieldy thing back to the piano . Shep132stretched out on the couch in front of the fireplace , turned on a floor lamp , and started leafing through one of the books from the library . He stared at her for a while , juggling the bearskin , then walked back with it and spread it on the floor . She gave him a curious look , and said , " I thought you decided not to put it there . " " I did . But we must , absolutely must , have it down for tonight . " " Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grinned . She blushed and turned back to her book . " It 's in all the movies , " he said . He went to a wicker hamper next to the fireplace and picked out the thinnest twigs , pencil-size and smaller , snapped them into even lengths , and laid them across the andirons . He broke up more twigs of the same size and placed them in a crosshatch over the first layer . He repeatedthis procedure once more . He broke up larger , dowel-sized branches and laid them in a row over the little ones , and of these he also made a three-layer crosshatch . He put down a row of larger limbs that were sawed to length . He took up kindling the size of his wrist , nine pieces of it ( an odd number being the best for a fire ) , and laid down five sticks , then laid the remaining four over the gaps he 'd left between the first pieces . He took up a scroll of birch bark , tore it into strips , and made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beneath the wood on the andirons . He lit a piece of newspaper , held it as flat as he could at the top of the fireplace , near the flue , and let it burn down until he had to release it . The orange and black papery ash hovered for a while above the wood , dipping down , winging up , and in a sudden swirl was sucked up the chimney . A good draft . He put a match to the birch bark and when the twigs , the branches , the limbs , and the sticks of kindling were lit and burning , reporting and spouting sparks , and the flames had begun to climb the chimney , he laid on three logs.  |p133He  sat on the bearskin rug and watched the flames , feelinghis cheeks grow warm and his pants legs heat up over his shins . She rose from the couch and came and sat beside him . He lit a cigarette and smoked it slow , handing it to her for drags , and when it was smoked down he flipped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they stared at the flames . " What books did you check out ? " he asked . " The usual ones . Birds . Trees . Plants . " " No others ? " " No . Why ? " " I thought  --  " He shrugged his shoulders . " Birds , trees , bees "  --  he made a face and altered his voice to cover his uneasiness  --  " uh , duh , you know . Babies . " " Oh . " She swung her legs around and lay down and put her head on his lap , placing her hands , clasped as in prayer , under her cheek . " I do n't think about that . " Why not ? Should n't you ? " She lifted her shoulders and snuggled closer ; she obviouslydid n't want to talk about it . " What did the doctor say ? " " What doctor ? " " ' What doctor ? ' The one I sent you to . " " Oh , him . Nothing much . " " He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You know . " He was getting irritated . " No . Nothing . " " Well , what did he say ? He must have said something . " " Just that I should be myself , but go easy . Drink a lot of milk . No horseback riding . And that if nothing came up , I would n't have to see another doctor for about two months . " " That 's it ? It 's that simple ? " " He did mention that most women are n't in the shape I 'm in . He said I was very muscular . " " What did he mean ? " " Inside . "  | " Inside ! " " He said I have strong walls . " " He said that ? " " Yes . " " The bastard ! " Her mellow self-satisfied laughter matched the play of the flames . He lit another cigarette and smoked it down . He tossed it into the fireplace . He looked at her face and ran his hand over her hair , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it back from her cheek . He laid the back of his fingertips on her cheek and it seemed more hot ( her temperature ? ) than her hair . Then he turned , easing her head onto the rug , and lay beside her . She moved against him . He kissed her , and for the first time he felt that he was married , that he was with a married woman , his wife , and he savored and prolonged each stage to fill himself with experience , feeling the familiar shape of her mouth , teeth behind lips , the tongue , the curve of her rib cage and firm stomach , her hip , the strength of her legs , the cords in her inner thighs , and then the same curves with no clothes , the closer curves , the aroma of her skin , the feel and texture of it when she was ready , the taste , savoring that , her breasts aroused , one cool and one hot from the fire and both tipped up to him , their texture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him , and he would enter for the first time , now , his wife , wet , the strong legs , walls , and then in a blossoming in his upper consciousness knowing she held his child , a life inside her , there , the nudge of muscle , that kiss , the light of the fire over her hair , her eyes , thighs rising , the points of her hair like stars , like Orion , Oh , love , love , Oh , El , Oh , love , " Oh , El . " " Yes , Chris , yes . " Holding him tight inside , she whispered , " That 's the first time you 've talked to me like that since we 've been back together . " They lay together for a long time in silence . He felt her arms grow heavy and lifted his head and saw that she wasp135asleep . He drew gently out and away from her and got a blanket from the couch and covered her , watching the light from the fire waver over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands still on her , and held himself tense . There was some sound . Someone knocking ? No , it was too faint for that . A woodpecker ? Too metallic . And it did n't move from tree to tree . He strained himself to hear . Nothing now . He went to a front window ( why did n't any of these windows have curtains ? ) and looked out . If there was a moon tonight , it was buried in a cloud bank . The yard was dark . Only the trunks of the birches gave off a pale glow . He went to a back window and looked : a square of light on the ground from the window , a pine seedling standing in a corner of the square . Then the sound came again . It was measured and regular , like the tapping he imagined for himself when a watchman in a Russian story tapped the hour . Or like the tapping of a blind man . It stopped . He felt there was someone watching him as he stared out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was someone he knew . Suddenly he was afraid . Or had he imagined it ? He went toward Ellen to wake her , knelt at her side , reached out his hand , hesitated , then slowly drew away . No . The tapping started again . He pulled on his pants , put on his shoes and a shirt , and went through the kitchen and out the back door . He stood still in the night air , listening , feeling the breeze cool his face . The sound was coming from the woods ahead of him . He walked across the driveway to the edge of the trees . It was too dark to see . He cupped his hands around his mouth . " Hey ! " The echo of his shout carried and carried like a stone skipping over water , growing smaller and smaller with distance , then sank . Silence . And then once more the tapping began.  |p136He  started through the woods , heading in the direction of the sound . Dead leaves , twigs , and mulch crushed underfoot , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapping . Surely not at the moment . He stopped . Was he losing his faculties ? No . There it was again , farther ahead and to his left . He waded through a stand of waist-high underbrush and suddenly was slapped and jumped back . In the darkness , he felt around for the branch that had slapped him , found it , held it out of the way , and went ahead faster , bearing toward the left , feeling his way , one arm raised to shield his eyes . He stopped . It had to be close now . It seemed to originate in front of his face . He held out both hands , took a few steps forward , and bumped into something . A small tree . Then , on the ground in front of him , he saw it . The dim bulk of something big . Motionless . He feinted toward it and made a noise . It did n't move . He edged forward and prodded it with his toe . Hard . He went down on a knee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eroded in it , a fallen limb lying at its side . He squinted his eyes to see better . A wind sprang up , lifting his hair from his forehead , and the tapping began again . He bent his face close . A branch of the dead limb was springing in the wind , wavering tautly and striking the barrel in regular taps . He reached out and grabbed the branch with one hand . It would n't break . He scrambled over on his knees and crouched above the branch and used the force of both hands . It broke with a sound like a gunshot in the still woods . He threw it from him as if it were alive and wiped his hands on his pants . Then he stood and looked around on all sides . He must have wandered into a valley without noticing it . In every direction for as far as he could see there was nothing but darkness and trees.  |p137HE  WOKE THE NEXT morning to the sound of crowscaw , haw , hawing . He lifted himself up in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in a tree at the edge of the bluff , and at that moment , as if they sensed his eyes on them , they flapped off in silence . She was alreadyup . He could hear , through the board wall between the two rooms , her footsteps and some clattering of utensils as she moved around the kitchen . He lay back , pitched his baritone in a high childlike treble , and sang on the same note , " Break  --  fast  --  in  --  behhhhh  --  ed , " letting the last syllabledrop down the scale a third , as in a liturgical chant . " What was that ? " she asked from the other side of the wall . He sang again , " Break  --  fast  --  in  --  behhh  --  ed . " " Oh , " she said . " You ruined it . " A few seconds later she came into the room carrying a tin tray and he scrambled up into a sitting position . On the tray was a plate of buttered toast , orange juice , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft-poached eggs , still steaming , and a steaming cup of coffee . " I was going to surprise you , " she said . " Here , anyway . " She placed the tray on the covers across his lap . " How 'd you know I 'd feel like an invalid ? " " I did n't . You 're my husband and I want to please you . "  | " A glass of water would have taken care of that . " " You have to eat every bit ! " " I will . " " And you have to do it without moving . " " Even my mouth ? " " From bed . " " God , it 's beautiful . It reminds me of the mornings you used to come to my room and wake me . Remember ? " " Of course . " " Will you do this every day ? " " No . Once in a while . Eat , before it gets cold . " He , who had a bad morning stomach , and usually could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything on the tray . She sat on the edge of the bed and watched with satisfaction , with contentment even , it seemed , which was a rare emotion to see in her . When he was finished , she took the tray into the kitchen and he got out of bed and started dressing . Sunlight glowed like new gold on the top of the dresser and lay in bright squares on the wood floor , but a night chill was still in the building . It was so big and barny . He stepped into the main room and stopped at the sight of the bearskin . Should he tell her about the tapping ? Last night he 'd carried her , dead asleep , in to the bed . So why bother her with it now ? He took up the bearskin and put it in place on top of the piano . The glass eyes and open mouth made him uneasy . He shoved its face toward the wall . He went into the hallway that led to the kitchen and tried the bathroom door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's me , " her voice said . He leaned his cheek against the door and raised his eyebrows . " May I visit you ? " " No ! I 'm changing . " He shrugged his shoulders and wandered into the kitchen . The breakfast dishes were soaking in a metal dishpan on the cookstove ( which was still radiating heat ) , and coffee grounds had boiled over onto the stovetop andp139lay there in splotches , shriveled and burned black . The water in the dishpan was steaming , and the pan rocked gently as streamers of bubbles swayed toward the surface , breaking through a film of oil there . He lifted a lid from the cookstove and held a cigarette close to the glowing coals , feeling their heat as icy pain against his fingernails . He jerked his hand out and drew on the cigarette ; it was going . He turned and leaned his rump against the stove and crossed his arms . In a few minutes she came out of the bathroom in the same Levi 's and sweatshirt she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigarette close to his lips and looked her up and down . " What did you change into ? " he asked . " A vampire ? " " My swimsuit . It 's underneath . " " Oh . " " We 're going to the beach . " " It 's too damn cold ! " he said , and rubbed his upper arms , which turned nubbly at the thought . " You at least have to come and see the trail . We can sun-bathe . " " You can , " he said . From a closet in the hall she got out an army blanket , riddled with moth holes , and handed it to him . She stuffed some books and bottles of cream into a terrycloth beach bag , drew its drawstrings tight , and started toward the front door . She stopped and surveyed the main room . " Unbelievable ! " she said . " What ? " " Cleaning up . I hate even the thought of it . " " It 's a chore ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should at least sweep up that glass , " he said . " And I 'll have to fix the window somehow before more sand blows in . Also , I have to mow the damn lawn . " " Oh , God , that can wait , " she said . " It can all wait . Come on . "  |p140He  slung the blanket over his shoulder and followed her out the door and through the tall grass of the front yard , which was wet with dew and dampened his pants legs to the knee . The sun was brilliant and the sky above them and the sky above the lake , all the way to the horizon , was banded with ribs of cirrus . A mist enveloped Manitou Island . " This is it , " she said , and started down the trail . It traveled across the face of the bluff , descending at a gentle angle , passing through ground hemlock and trees , then cut back in the opposite direction and descended again in a switchback pattern . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was slashed deeply into the clay of the bluff , so deeply that at certain points ( where the terrain was especially precipitous and she was on a switchback beneath him ) her head was moving just below his feet . It grew steeper . They entered a thicket of evergreen , where pale ferns grew against a bank of dark moss , and for a while they were walking on a level . Dried tufts of grass , fine as cornsilk , drooped from the face of the bluff . Dead branches had dropped onto the trail over the winter , and as he went along he picked them up and tossed them to the side . " Oh , come on ! " she cried , and took off running and got several switchbacks ahead of him and started grabbingtree trunks and swinging herself around corners . She disappeared into a thicket . He continued at the same pace , clearing up the branches as he went , and came to a large birch log , part of a dead tree , that lay directly over the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the print of her foot where she had leaped it . He could n't budge it with his hands . He put down the blanket and braced his back against the bluff and shoved with his legs . The log started rolling , slowly at first , but picked up speed , went crashing through underbrush , then one end flipped up high and there was a WHOMP and splintering as it struck a tree . On the next switchback , he moved half of it off the trail again.  |p141The  face of the bluff grew more and more gravelly , the trees thinned , and he came to an area that was absolutely barren . The trail cut back at the edge of the wash . He eased himself forward and looked over the edge ; a long fall , a Niagara fall , with the regular creases of erosion streaming downward like water . He glanced over at the island of cedar , which was above him now . No sign of Mr. Woodchuck . He turned away , went shuttling back and forth in a slow descent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few oaks growing among them , and then the trail led across a wooden footbridge that spanned the wash where it was narrow and sliced into a deep ravine . Now the ground was soft , sandy , and he could hear waves and smell water  --  the fresh smell and the other smell underlyingit , always present if the body of water was large enough , and which gulls ' cries , to him , embodied : a smell of decay . At the base of the bluff the trail branched to his left over a plateau of clay and gravel washed from above , to his right over a manmade ramp of piled stones , and straight ahead down a sandy cliff covered with small aspens . He took the branch to the right , over the stones , and when he came through the last of the trees the sun on the sand blinded him . He blinked rapidly , trying to get his eyes to adjust , and looked up and down the beach . The water was breaking in small waves , scudding evenly up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four or five pointed rocks , large and black , stood above the level of the water and the low waves exploded and foamed around them . There was an undulationof dunes in all directions and the dunes nearest the woods were covered with grass . He did n't see her anywhere . He went toward the rocks ahead . At first the sand was packed , but soon he was moving through it with the effort it took to move through the sand of his dreams . He stopped and looked around . Behind him , in a flat area enclosed by trees on three sides , he saw her lying on her back . " Holy Christ ! "  |p142She  sat up , startled , propping herself on an elbow . He walked over and dropped the blanket and started to circle around her , making sounds that bordered on astonishment and the obscene . " What is it ? " she asked . " What 's wrong ? " " Where did you get that ? " " What ? " " The fig leaf and bottle caps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scant . " Oh , " she said , and lay back again , positioning the beach bag under her head . " Is that all . I do n't know . I 've had it for a while . " " I 've never seen you in it . " She lay silent , eyes closed against the sun , her skin glistening with lotion , her palms turned up . He walked around her once more , trying to see her with a detached eye . " I bet you got it in New York . " " The sun 's great , " she said . " Come lie beside me . Take off your clothes . " " I do n't want to take my clothes off . " " There 's nobody around . " " As if I gave a diddly shit . " " Just your shirt , then . I love to see you tan . " " You got that thing in New York , did n't you ? " " I do n't remember . " " Why ca n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you ? Why do you have to be so goddamn evasive ? " " I do n't remember . Really . " " There 's been a hell of a lot lately you do n't remember , " he said . " A hell of a lot . " He turned away and started down the beach , heading toward the cove where he 'd seen the wreck . Detritus . Weathered boards , driftwood , ship 's timbers , cans and bottles , a cardboard ice-cream container , a scattering of bleached paper and bits of colored plastic , pieces of rusted tin , feathers , a dead gull  --  a collage of sea wash , a gallimaufry of it . He went down close to the waterlineand walked on sand that was wet and firm and printedp143with sandpiper tracks . There was a maroon chair cushion snagged on a rock , slogging in the water , the cotton waddingcoming out of it like sheep fat . Then the beach turned rocky  --  gravel and stones stretching from the treeline to the water  --  and he came over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wheeled off on creaking wings , crying . His left boot sank as if in quicksand . He tugged at it , startled , and it came loose with a sucking sound . He stepped up on a stone . A small stream was trickling through the rocks . He followed the stream up to the edge of the trees and saw that a bowl-like pool had been scooped out in the smooth stones . He went down on his knee and put his hand in the water and jerked it out as though shocked . It was so icy it felt electric . Could you drink from it , he wondered , and looked up the beach in her direction . He had come a long way , and she was no longer in sight . He walked another quarter of a mile to the cove and stared out at the wreck . It did n't look as tempting as it had from a distance ; just a dark area , about fifty feet out  --  an oblong of water stained pinkish-orange . Hell . Maybe the edge was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back in her direction , and then walked toward the trees , up a slight rise , in order to see it better . No difference . Just a meaningless blur . Damn . Goddamn . Goddamn it , goddamn her , goddamn everything . He sat on a boulder and covered his face with his hands and listened for a long while to the sound of waves near him and the sound of gulls in the distance . Then he rose and walked back up the beach to the sheltered area where she 'd been sunbathing . She had spread out the blanket and was lying in the center of it , still in the suit , still on her back . " Saint Lawrence , " he said . " What 's that ? " " A martyr . They put him in a fire , were roasting him to get him to renounce , and he said , Turn me over . I think " What 's the matter ? " " Nothing . " " Why the small voice ? " " It 's how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What 's that got to do with a voice ? " " I do n't know . " " You feel like shit , do n't you , about what I said . " " No . Just exhausted . Drained . " " Oh , " he said , and the anger went out of him . " It 's probablybecause of the way you came down the trail . Maybe you should n't do that any more . " " No , it 's good exercise . I think it 's just that the sun 's getting to me . " " Then you 're ready to go up ? " " Soon . Not yet . " " I am . " " Do n't you like the beach ? " " Yes . " " It 's almost always this deserted . Once in a while somebodywanders past . " " I looked at the wreck . " " What did you think of it ? " He shrugged his shoulders . " It 's a wreck . When it 's warmer , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't tell from shore . " He lingered beside her . A conversationlike this , he realized , could only take place outdoors , under an afternoon sun . " Well , " he said , " I guess I 'll go up now . " " Go ahead . " " Do n't you want to come ? " " Soon . " With the toe of his boot he moved a rock around beside the blanket , then pressed it into the sand . " El . " " Yes ? " " Do you love me ? "  | " Of course ! " She shielded her eyes to see him . " Why ask such a thing ? " " You have n't said it since we 've been married . You used to . " " I did n't think I had to . I thought it was assumed . " " It 's not bad to hear now and then . " He stood a long time in silence to give her a chance to say it . " Well , hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is there anything I can carry ? " " No . Thanks . " " The blanket ? The bag ? " " No , I 'll get it . " " Fine , " he said . " You do that . " He stalked over to the plateau of clay and gravel and started up the trail . It was steeper than he anticipated , the switchbacks longer , more formidable and tortuous , and before he got to the footbridgehe put his hands on his thighs and started pushing down on them to get more leverage . Even so , he soon had to stop and lean against a tree . Out of shape . Too many smokes . No physical work . Not for years . Unless you counted sex . Might as well count it . Hey , where were the lungs ? It was like sucking air into a cistern . Come on , alveoli , get hold of it . Do your stuff . He wiped his forehead with his sleeve , shoved off from the tree , and continued climbing upward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cramp and flutter of muscle . Think good things . Exploring wilderness . Lewis and Clark . Come on , troops , this last hill and we 'll have it made . Oh , ho , Onward Christianso  --  o  --  ol  --  diers , marching as to  --  000 war ! . . . Forging new trails .

Up Matterhorn with no sweat . Up Everest for the first time . Up  --  Oh , shit . He stopped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOUND DEADAT ALTITUDE OF 60 FEETp147He made it to the top , finally , after several more rest breaks , and stood at the edge of the bluff with his fists on his hips , looking over the lake . In the straight rays of the sun the water was pale turquoise and was now so calm he could see the sand bottom , the refracted light lying in ribbons along the sand , the submerged rocks and the places where there were pebbles instead of sand ( which his mind recorded as no good for swimming ) , and the light-green areas where plant life grew . It was worth the climb , once the climb was made , just to look down on it . The air was sweeter here , less cloying and dense , and it was tranquilizing to stand at ease and breathe it . His heavingchest gradually quieted . His calf muscles , however , which were badly overworked , kept fluttering , and he felt as exhausted as if he 'd done a day 's hard labor in a half hour . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his eye and turned just in time to see the woodchuck disappear into the island of cedar . The fatigue left him . He hurried over in that direction . Starting where the yard ended and the meadow began , a strip of thick brush grew along the edge of the bluff . He followed the brush until he felt he was in line with the high dorsal of clay that curved down to the island of cedar . He turned and pushed through the brush , scratching his forearms , and came to the edge.  |p148He  'd misjudged . A little more to his left . He sidestepped over toward the dorsal of clay , and saw that it did not , as it seemed to , extend all the way up to the lip of the bluff . There was a drop of at least six feet down to it , and the peak of the dorsal was pointed , as sharp as the mountain peaks on dimensional maps . He tramped on the sod at the lip of the bluff . It seemed well anchored and secure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of big grapevines , hanging loose . There were no toeholds on the dorsal of clay , though , just small streaks of erosion as fine as the lines of valleys on those maps . A popple sapling grew a few feet back from the edge of the bluff . Getting a good grip around its trunk , he lowered his legs over the bluff , then let himself slide down until he was hanging by one hand , and pedaled his feet around to find footing . Concave under there . He could just touch the face of the bluff with his boot . He tucked his head to look below . Not much of a drop , but it would be hell to straddle it . He searched out a big root with his free hand , tugged on it as hard as he could , then grabbed it with both hands and slid down quick to solid ground . Keeping hold of the root , he turned and put an arm over the dorsal of clay , gripping it with his elbow as though it were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might well be so long as it kept him from rolling down the side of the dorsal and into the big wash ) , and started moving ahead , stomping footholds into the steep slant of the dorsal 's side . The island of cedar was about seventy feet away and after a while , as the base of the dorsal began widening to meet the island , the going was easier , and finally he let go with his elbow and went in a dead run down to the flat sandy area in front of the cedars . A fire had been built there . Scorched and half-burned logs were lying around . On the other side of the island of trees , to the left of the big wash , there was a smaller wash , less eroded and precipitous , with a healthy stand of trees growing in it , and hep149imagined that was the approach people used to get here to build a fire . Or whatever . He climbed onto the island of cedar . It was virgin land . Dead skeletons of cedar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the live ones , which grew so thickly it was difficult to move through them . In the places where sunlight pierced the maze of trunks and interlocking boughs , moss grew ; not in flat patches , but in high , bulbous mounds , and on the trunks of the trees and on the moss , too , were spots of fungus the color of copper oxide . There was no grass , just the moss and a layer of needles three inches thick . It would be impossible , he decided , to find a parked automobile in this tangle of growth , much less a wary animal , and then he saw , through a gap in the branches ahead , a mound of dirt . It looked freshly grubbed up . Twisting around , shouldering his way through the scratchy boughs , he worked his way down to it . A cavity large enough to be the entrance to a den had been dug into the earth , but if the woodchuck had originally planned a den here , he must have abandoned the idea . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hole and kicked around to make sure this was n't a false bottom of dirt hurriedly pushed into place to deceive him . No . Then , with his foot , he tested the ground in the vicinity of the digging but it , too , was solid . Elusive Mr. Woodchuck . He sat down in the open , mossy area next to the mound of dirt and lit a cigarette . A small birch trunk that lay in front of him , half buried in the needles , had split so regularly with age as it settled into the earth that it seemed someone had sawed it in sections . He kicked it and pieces went flying like splashed liquid . It was just a roll of bark rotted to sawdust inside . He looked at the sky . The cirrus clouds were gone , replaced by mounds of cumulus moving in from the lake . He put the cigarette between his lips and lay back with his hands behind his head . He liked feeling hidden . He watched the cumulus clouds move ponderously in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . From where he lay , isolated , it seemed a performance staged especially for him . He listened for the woodchuck , for any unnatural noise , but heard none . There was only birdsong , birdsong , the kyriology of it , and the sound of wind in the boughs . Like dresses rustling . Crinolinedskirts of crepe and silk . Bustles . A gathering of women at a costume ball holding their voices to a whisper . Their full-length and expensive skirts brushing against other skirts . Crinolines . Satin and taffeta . Perfumed breath . He wanted to stay here . He stood up and ground out the cigarette . Why should that thought terrify him ? He worked his way through the trees and jumped onto the area of sand . Who 'd built this goddamn fire ? He kicked the logs into the wash . He started up the dorsal of clay , and then stopped , remembering the easy way up , the wooded wash on the other side of the island of cedar . A flat shalelike rock was imbedded in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its surface was covered with fossils shaped almost like snails . He tried to lift it loose and the top layer snapped off like wood shingle . There were fossils beneath the layer that had snapped off . He dug all around the rock , driving clay under his nails , and saw that there were about ten seams , ten layers in all , and most likely each of them was covered with similar fossils . She would want to see it . He looked toward the lodge and the trail . No sign of her . He lifted the rock loose , then set it back in place . A boulder the size of a tub , up in the wash close to the bank swallow holes , had caught his attention . Most of the boulder 's surface was exposed , and it clung precariously to the face of clay , ready to roll . He started climbing , stomping footholes and grabbing hold of occasional roots for safety , and by slow process made his way up to the boulder . He kicked and dug above it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a deep seat , and settled himself into it and shoved at the boulder with his feet . It began to give ,  |p151a  wet rim showing around its base , and he pushed with all his strength , his leg and back muscles trembling , and at last it broke loose . It started slow , thumping the ground  --  a stream of sand and gravel trailing behind in a small landslide  --  and picked up speed , taking longer leaps , thudding with each one , crashed through a silver maple as if it were sage , struck a rock , chips flying , went high in the air and came down with a shock he could feel , and rumbled down a gorge out of sight . He listened to the retreating noise of it , and then heard a loud report , like muffled thunder , and wondered what it had hit . Not the bridge , he hoped . Loose clay and pebbles were still sliding in its path , shifting down the face of the bluff . He heard chattering and looked up ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curious , nervous , and withdrawing them quick . He spotted another boulder , a smaller one , farther away near the center of the wash , and it also looked ready to take the trip down . He started toward it . The face of the wash grew steeper , almost vertical it seemed , and the clay beneath his footholes slipped away several times and he had to throw himself flat and grab at rocks to keep from sliding . He began kicking holes straight into the face of clay with his toes and taking sidesteps to each new one . He kickedseveral times . Ze gods are angry at me because they knew . He stepped over to it . Ze gods are angry at me because they knew . The driving rhythm of the song would n't leave him . He kicked again . Ze gods are angry at me because they knew . What the hell came next ? He could remember hearingit only once . It must have been a popular song at the time . It came over the radio . Ze gods are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in the front seat , singing along with the radio in the car . His mother and aunt were in the back , and he stood between them with his elbows on the front seat so he could see out the windshield . It was spring . A gravel road . The green fields going past . Ze gods are angry at me because they knew.  | " Stop , " his mother said . " Here ! Stop ! " The car slowed and swayed in the loose gravel of the road , pressing him against the front seat , and the adults got out , leaving the doors open , the radio playing , and ran into the ditch , where a high yellow spray was growing , and picked handfuls of it , all that was in sight , until the ditch was green . Then they came back to the car , laughing , and loaded it in his lap . It was mustardseed . Then what ? What was said ? What ? The car took off and the men began singing again , loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me because they knew . The mustardseed in his lap , the smell and color of it . He stopped . At this slow rate , picking his way along , it would take another five minutes to get to the boulder . And where would he be then ? In the middle of the wash , at its steepest point , with nowhere to rest and his energy gone . He sent some rocks near his hand rolling down . He looked up and judged he was near the intersection of the meadow and yard . To his left , a small birch with trembling leaves jutted over the edge of the bluff , looking frail as a fern , delicate as a web against the sky , a thing to be photographed . The erosion would take it next , he thought , and just then Ellen appeared beside it and put her hand on its trunk . " Hey ! " he called . " Get back from there ! " She looked over the edge and located him , about fifty feet below her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ! It 's all eroded underneath . I can see roots hanging down ! " " It 's safe , " she called . " I always stand here . It 's my thinking place . " " Maybe it was safe before , but it 's not now . " " What are you doing down there ? " Good question . " Looking around . Exercising . Trying to get back in shape . Have you ever climbed along here ? " " Once . When I was young . " " It 's a gas . " " Are you going all the way across ? "  | " Not now . I have to go back and pick something up . I found something for you . " " What ? " " Wait and see . " He was tired of shouting up to her . He took a few sidesteps , then stopped and looked up . " Really , El , I do n't think you should be there . The thing you 're standing on is just an overhang of sod . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move back ? " Her head disappeared . With footholes already dug , the return trip was speedy and effortless , and he picked up the fossilized rock , crossed over the dorsal of clay , and walked up the easy slope of the other wash . When he came around to the yard , she was sitting cross-legged close to the birch , several feet back from the edge of the bluff , the beach bag and the blanket beside her . He handed her the rock . " Oh , yes , " she said , turning it in her hands . " You 've seen that kind before ? " " Yes . I have lots in the attic . " " What is it ? " " I forget the name . It 's very common here . " " But look . " He sat down and took it from her . " It 's all in layers . There are fossils along every layer . " " I know . It always comes that way . " " Oh . " He was disappointed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times she 'd seen them . He gave it a toss and it went clattering down the wash . " Do n't do that ! " she said . " Why did you do that ? " " You said you have lots of it . " " Keep it for yourself . " " Sure . " He took out a cigarette and smoked in silence , staring down at the lake . The sight of the water , the clear air , and the taste of tobacco interwove in a way that , for some reason , aroused him sexually . " I 've lost all time sense , " she said . " What 's that ? " " I 've lost all time sense . Just yesterday we were in thep154minister 's office , but this morning is months distant . It 's as if the accident just happened and I 'm alone again . " " What do you mean ? This morning was great . Breakfast in bed . " " That 's miles away . I ca n't remember the last time I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when we first got here . " " When we got here was nice . That 's closer . The plants and flowers . " " You were happy . " " Yes . But now I 'm alone . " " Why , when I 'm here ? " " It 's an inborn thing I do n't think anybody can change , and it 's been with me all the time , even before the accident . It 's as if I grew up alone , in a room by myself . The first time my life is n't solitary or bottomless is when I met you , and even though that was three years ago , it 's as if you just walked into the room and touched my hair . " " Then you are n't alone . " " I feel I am . It 's impossible to explain a feeling so basic . And now that my time sense is gone , everything is confused . I guess it 's time for lunch . Do you want lunch ? " " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's been here every summer , and I keep looking everywhere , expecting to see him . Whenever I go outside , I 'm surprised he 's not there .

" " You 've been quiet . " " Then that must be confused with something else , too , " she said , and picked up the beach bag and the blanket . " Because I feel as if I 've been talking every minute since I got here . " She turned away and walked toward the lodge , trailing the blanket behind her like a lost child.  |p155Noodle  soup from a package , sandwiches , tea , and a total silence between the two of them as they lunched in the sunlit dining wing . When he was done , he got out the power mower and saw that it was not self-propelled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to start . Winter was still in its piston . Ka-slog , Ka-slog , slogslog-slog , it went , then screak , screak , as the flywheel slowed and pok ! kicked back . Finally he got it started , got the carburetor adjusted  --  for density of smoke it seemed , in the case of this machine  --  and wheeled the noisy thing around to the front of the lodge , feeling already the flat sense of deafness that would remain with him as long as the motor was going , making his mind feel insulated and insular , a satellite gliding above the grass , following the orbit the lawn mower made . By the time he cut a swath out to the bluff , staying a distance from its edge , and cut another swath back to the lodge , describing a long rectangle , he was able to gauge the speed at which the grass demanded he travel  --  the cautious plod  --  and his mind was freed . How 's the weather in the head ? Bad . What 's the matter up there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows ?  |p156With  a tinny sound the blade sent a branch flying through the air .

How could he say that marriage was right for him ? Where did the pressure really fall ? She knew that he loved her and would many her if she asked him to . And now he was responsible for her , and a child besides , before he 'd learned how to take care of himself . And what was marriage ? A sculpture ? Hell , if it was what he 'd felt for the past weeks , this alternation between terror and rage , could he take it ? Better let that one go . She came back from New York quiet and reserved , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain , and he could never see her as the person he had known , perhaps because she was n't . Even the color of her eyes had changed from light blue to blue-green . " Guile , " he said ,  |p157when  he saw it . He 'd been East to visit her once , just once , and that was a disaster ( let that go , too ) , and since her return they 'd been skimming along the surface of the present , which was so damn thin , enjoying themselves most of the time , true  --  those beautiful days at the Blackstone  --  but shying from any topic that was painful or touchy . Evading everything of importance . What was important ? Her . Why was it that when you cared for a person it sometimesmoved you further apart ? He felt closer to her , much closer in many ways , that first morning they talked in his room . Was it the year , that whole space of a year between them  --  was that it ? The unknowns that were possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended to make her more mysteriousand desirable , if one cared to be frank , but in direct proportion to the relationship growing between him and this new Ellen , he was beginning to miss her , in retrospect , during the time she was away , and starting to hate that year . And from the hour of their marriage it seemed every conversation caused further uncertainty and confusion , until he sometimes felt he was with a stranger . And he 'd been a bit subdued and weird himself . Had she changed that much ? She was changed , of course , and changed even more by being pregnant , more than she might know or admit  --  the way she carried herself , and looked at him , the way her eyes were growing larger and more round  --  but the same persons they were when they met still resided in each of them , did n't they ? So where were those people now ? He skirted the trunk of a birch . And what about their love ? His love , he should say , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried in him and had nothing to do with her feelings . Why , when he loved her , did he act the way he did ? Like that girl on the bus . He 'd almost forgotten about that . Jesus , look at that . She did n't even know about that . That was desecration of both of them , of three of them , for God 's sake . And whatp158would the beast in him do turned loose in the city again ? When he was alone in Madison , he 'd run through so many women he realized he was on a new one every third week . He never used the word love to get through to them , or the emotion , just sex , unabashed sex , sex as a club , the women whipping posts of his despair . He remembered them as short , tall , plump , dark , skinny , nice , or as those thighs , this mouth , her mound of Venus , that action , with pity or shame or disgust with himself , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell was he thinking of ? What a hell of a thing to be thinking of . Soon they would have a child of their own , a child , and he would be responsible for doctor bills , hospital bills , food , clothes , a home , security for him . Love . Seeing it as him , he grinned , then turned solemn . He had the fellowship , he 'd have to work hard to keep that , and he 'd have to put in more hours at his job . But would that be enough ? She was Spartan by nature , hoarding even , but , as her grandfather pointed out , the luxuries were there when she wanted them . Like this lodge . He could n't allow her to work , his pride would n't permit it . Maybe he should just chuck school and go into business , what the hell , he knew he could get a good job . But could he stand permanent work ? Better let that one go , too . Play it by ear , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that too much ? Like the way he eased into marriage , his mind a blank ( except for that minister 's thing about lust , the bastard ) , without going into this before . But did you need to if you were in love ? He 'd never thought much about an actual child and , hell , when you came right down to it , there was no way of really knowing whether it was his child or not . No , if he doubted that , even suspected it , he never would have married her . Still , dammit , there was no way , no absoluteHe killed the motor . Its last sounds went ringing throughp159the trees . He lifted his eyes toward the woods , as if to see the sound go , and saw a sight as remarkable as that would have been . She was sitting beside the small birch , her head bowed , her legs hanging out of sight over the edge of the bluff . He hurried out and came up behind her . " El , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Should you be sitting there ? I told you it 's all eroded underneath . " He took a couple of stiff sidesteps and looked over the edge . It was steeper here , a sheer drop for sixty feet , and then the tan face of sandy clay fell away in a sharp slant , and he could see , far below , the trail the tumbling boulder had left , growing fainter and fainter toward the bottom until it was no longer visible . Far below that was the border of trees and the faint line of the beach . He stepped back . " Hey , look , " he said , and ran his toe along a line behind her , where the sod had parted and dropped down , putting the overhang she sat on a few inches below the rest of the lawn . " El , look . The damn thing could give way . " She would n't turn to him . " El ? What 's the matter ? " There was no sign of response . He moved closer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Not even a movement . " You 're worried about your grandparents , are n't you ? " There was a slight movement of her head that to him , an experienced observer of her , signified that she was shaking it no . " Uncertain about the future ? " Again she indicated no . " Me ? " He squatted beside her and reached over her shoulder and turned her face toward him . She averted her eyes , and the tears that had been gathering in them spilled over her lashes and slid down her cheeks . " That 's what it is , is n't it ? It 's me , is n't it ? " " I want to fall off and roll all the way down and kill it ! " He threw an arm around her and pulled her onto thep160lawn and pinned her by the arms . She struggled against him , arching her body up , and cried , " I do n't want to be pregnant ! I want to destroy it ! " " Ellen ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it ! I 'm oppressed by it , smothered , trapped ! I 'm not ready ! " " You are too . You 're the most capable person I know . You can  --  " " I do n't want to waste my life ! I do n't want to turn into a do-nothing housewife like every other housewife in the world ! " " You wo n't ! " " How can I help it ? It 's starting already and it 'll get worse ! I 'm not doing anything . " " What do you mean ? You 're making me happy . " " Oh , Christ , I 'm ugly and miserable ! " " You 're not . You 're not even showing it , you know that . You 're prettier than you 've ever  --  " " Inside ! I 'm miserable inside ! " " You 're not . " " I 've been miserable for weeks ! " " See , you should have talked . " " What could I say ? What ? It 's growing inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  and there 's nothing I can do ! It 's ruling my life . That 's not fair , it 's not right . I want to destroy it ! " " You have no right to want to destroy it ! It 's a part of you ! " " If it 's a part of me , it 's a part I do n't want ! " Her eyes altered , the color of her flesh changed , and she started choking . He released her wrists and she covered her face with her hands and rolled on her stomach . All his arguments , justifications , platitudes , and sanctimonious advicefell from him . It was the life inside her that bound them together , he was responsible for that life ; and she did n't want it . There was nothing he could say . He ran his hand over her hair and onto her back , feeling , through the thick opposing ribs of her sweater , the strongp161ribs of her back heaving against his hand , falling , and again heaving up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , " he said . " Do n't . I 'll make it all right . Do n't . Please . " He still had the money . He would get an abortion . Why fight it ? Why not acknowledge his fears , and admit that her grandparents were right , that she was right ; that they had done the wrong thing . That he was not meant to be her husband . After the abortion , he would let her divorce him , and leave . Few people knew they were married , and nobody else ever had to . But how let her go ? He sat for a long time , subduing his emotion , resigning himself to the decision . Then he said , " Ellen , here 's what we have to do . First  --  " He was unsettled to see that his hand was still lying on her back and patting her , like a life in itself . He moved it away . " Ellen , here 's what we have to do . Are you listening ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was asleep . He lifted her in his arms and her eyelids fluttered and she murmured , " I 'm cold , I 'm cold , I 'm cold . " He carried her to an elm halfway to the lodge and laid her down on a wooden bench beneath its overhanging branches . Then he ran into the lodge and came back with the army blanket and covered her with it and tucked it around her feet , along her sides , and , more carefully , around her neck , staring at her parted lips and pale face , where lozenges and diamonds of sunlight were sliding from side to side . He sat on the ground next to her and lit a cigarette , staring at her face . How let her go ? Dear El , I ca n't stand to see you in torment , and I do n't know what I 'd do if you ever hurt yourself .. . Mentally , he erased that . El , my wife , I want to call you wife once more .. . No . Dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How ?  |p162He  had to . He could n't stand to see her spirit broken . Oh , El , I .. . His mind gave out . He smoked down the cigarette and watched her face become composed and flood with color , and her serenity in this state of sleep , from which he was excluded , made him absolute about his decision . He put out the cigarette . Since there was nothing more he could do at the moment , other than keep an eye on her , he started up the mower and began again around the rectangle . When he came to the part of the yard where the bench was resting , he hesitated , then thought , Well , what 's the difference now , and mowed around the bench , behind it , and under it . She slept undisturbed . It was turning dark when he finished . He walked the mower around to the back porch and , using the toe of his boot , a semicircular collage of slick mulch and wet seeds , he pressed the metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed down to half speed , the metal slipped off to one side and a shock leaped up his leg . He hopped away , shaking his foot as though it would come out his pants leg . Jesus ! Could n't a thing like that ruin you ? He pulled out the choke and with his hands on his hips watched with satisfaction as the mower died in a profusion of its own blue smoke . Then he remembered her alone out front and took off running . She was awake , sitting up , the blanket wrapped close around her . He went toward the bench , exhausted , depressed , partially deaf , the nerves of his hands still vibrating at the frequency of the mower , and when he placed his palms on the edge of the bench to ease himself beside her , he discovered they were spongy and numb , as though deadenedwith novocaine . He lowered his body with careful slowness onto the bench , feeling broken as an old man . He rubbed his palms on his thighs . She was staring straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake , which was darkening as the sun went down . Night insects were filling the woodsp163with song . He was about to put his arm around her when her lips compressed and a tear started down her cheek . That was it . " Ellen , " he said , " I 've come to a decision . What I 'm going to do , I think , is  --  " " The flowers ! You mowed down all the flowers ! " she cried , and let her head fall against his chest , sealing his words inside him.  |p164XENOPTERYGII  . What ? Billiards being racked , crackedinto with a cue . The apex of a triangle blasted to bits . A row of bombs erupting below . No , a taxi trying to park on the roof of a skyscraper , backing around to the retaining wall ( black lines scratched on air , not brick , look ) , backing through it without feeling the bumper touch and starting down , making a single , slow , end to end revolution in the air as . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumbling down a trough into the bin . A smell of smoke , stuttering light , sirens , ladders , and four or five firemen in slickers and hats falling past his open window . Archaeopteryx . Broadside from a battleship . The flash and shock of it followed by silence like a . . . Check trajectory . + what ?  --  whom ? The flash and boom again and a piece of it , a circle of force hitting flat . Across him . A piece . Ah ! Anent : Every even number is the sum of two odd primes . Peace ! Peace ! He lifted himself on his elbow and a flash of light at the bedroom windows blinded him . Blackness . Gradually a faint sign of motion ( from his retinas ? ) began to show in the blackness , as though it were composed of fluttering particles , and suddenly the air of the room went compact as a clap of thunder hit , then the whole of it came rolling over the lodge and the bedsprings trembled . He 'd never felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close . Wasp165that ozone he smelled ? Again the yard was lit , with a light so brilliant every color bleached blue-gray , so that it seemed he was staring at the birches and elms and grass and bushes on a television screen  --  all blue-gray , all of it  --  instead of seeing the real thing , then blackness , a blacknesshe 'd known only at the back of closets , impenetrable . He waited . There was a dim arc of light far out on the lake . Finally , the shattering eruption of thunder . Then a blinding cat-o ' - nine- tails was strung along the edge of the bluff , and it felt like the impact would bring in the front windows . " Are you awake ? " she asked . " Does this happen often ? " " No . Never this bad . I keep trying to focus on something when the lightning comes , but I ca n't . Everything jumps toward me and is one-dimensional . " " Are you scared ? " " A little . " He felt around in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . " I do n't really mind , though , " she said , " as long as we 're safe . I 've never seen such violence . " " You sound as if you like it . " " I do . It 's beautiful to watch . " " We 're not that safe without lightning rods . " " Oh . " " No , not really . I hope the rain comes soon . " " Why ? " " This part of the storm will probably let up . " " But I love it . " " You would n't if one of those bolts came through the window . " " Is that possible ? " " Of course . But there 's nothing we can do except wait it out . If one 's coming my way I want to see it . " They moved up and sat with their backs against the log framework at the head of the bed.  | " Is it really that dangerous with no lightning rods ? " " Oh , I guess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as  --  " A fine tracery of light vermiculated the woods , illuminatingher face , her wide eyes , and along with the thunder that came instantaneously there was a sharper crack , a splintering , then a groan of split wood , a sound of branches crashing against leafy branches , a long series of crashes  --  a large tree  --  then the wallop as it hit earth . " As I was saying , it 's not so bad with all these trees around , as long as none of them fall on the lodge . That one , for instance , could have brought in the roof . " " In Milwaukee , one fell on my bedroom . " " While you were in it ? " " Yes . I was asleep . " " You were n't hurt ? " Her face was lit as if by arc light , her skin stained ashygreen , her lips violet , and in the ensuing blackness her profileclung to his retina . Thunder . " No , " she said . " It did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof was damaged . " " When was this ? " he asked , curious , but also trying to keep her mind off the afternoon , and the evening , too , when she 'd cried herself to sleep . " Just before I left for New York . I saw it as an augury . I almost did n't go . " " Why did you ? " " I ca n't answer that . " He watched the storm , the alternation between the blindingflashes , when the lawn and the trees framed in the window were bleached of color , and the blindness of the dark . After a long silence , he said , " It 's impossible for me to imagine you during that year . Once in a while a scene comes to me , and I see you happy , a free spirit , doing everything with total interest  --  running down streets , going through those shops in the Village , hurrying toward a restaurant or a movie house , always toward light , and Ip167always see a smile on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see terrible things . " He tried to isolate one that would n't shock her . " Like the time I came out . " " Do n't think of that . Please . And do n't think of that year in those terms . It was n't that liberating or romantic . I was in torment most of the time . " " You think I was n't ? " There was no response , naturally , and he was furious with himself for bringing her back to the point he wanted to lead her from . Well , hell , since they were here now he might as well go on ; he might as well tell her about the decision he 'd reached that afternoon and get it over with . But where should he begin ? And what if she agreed ? " There it is , " she said . " What 's that ? " " Your rain . " Random drops , like paws pattering over the shingles above them , the drops growing larger , their sound slowly moving across the roof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full force , driving down , and the whole buildingfilled with its roar . " God , " she said . " It 's like under a waterfall ! " " Barrels of it , " he said . " Cats and dogs . " " Pitchforks and hammer handles . " She laughed . " Where did you get that ? " " On the form . " The lightning , which struck with less frequency and farther in the distance , was too faint to illuminate the yard or the room , but the room itself seemed to be taking on brightness , or else his vision , now that it was n't being assaulted every few seconds , was beginning to adjust ; he could make out the humps of their toes under the quilt . Suddenly she screamed and started struggling under the covers . " El ! What is it ? " " Something 's crawling on me ! Ahh ! Get it off ! "  |p168He  fumbled around at the center of the bed , found the switch to the lamp , and snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . It was on my hair . Ah ! There it is ! " She turned and slapped at her back , and he saw the shiny dust from a moth on her shoulder . He picked the insect off the sheet by its wings and held it up . " Awk ! " she said . " A moth ! " ' What 's the matter with moths ? " " I do n't know . I ca n't stand them . Look ! There 's another one ! Get rid of it ! " He batted it off the bedcovers . " For God 's sake , " he said , you scared hell out of me . Why ca n't you stand them ? " " I do n't know . They 've never bothered me before . But now I feel the same way about them that those stupid women do about mice . There 's something unwholesome about them . They give me gooseflesh . There 're some more . Get them ! " There was a flyswatter hanging from a nail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down and stood up in bed , and slapped at the moths as they wobbled in clumsy orbits around the room . She covered her head with the quilt , and kept crying in a muffled voice , " Get them out of here ! I ca n't stand them ! " He killed all the ones in the air , then slapped dead several more that were clinging to the boards of the ceiling , and flipped them off the quilt onto the floor . They kept appearing and wobbling toward the lamp , apparentlycoming from other parts of the lodge . He continued swinging at them , and after a while it became ludicrous . " There 's one , " he said , and slapped the quilt across her buttocks . " O000 ! " she cried under the covers . He slapped the quilt some more , saying , " There 's one . There 's another . There 's one coming under the covers . Watch it ! " Highly excited , trying to entertain her , he slapped all over the ceiling and bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ooo ! God , El , you should see ! " he cried , and his dramatics , to him , were so convincing that he began to scare himself . Then he remembered the night he 'd felt a scro/fulous , mothlike thing opening inside his head , and in his stimulated state of mind he imagined larvae and eggs encasedunder his skin , and started itching all over , scratching at his arms and stomach and head and scrotum , and slapped in a fury at the new moths that came flapping into the room as if drawn to him . Finally he threw down the swatter , shut off the lamp , and jumped between the sheets and covered his head like her . " Jesus , " he whispered . " There 's a squadron of them out there . Where the hell do they come from ? " " I do n't know , and I do n't want to know . " " The storm must have stirred them up . " " Did you kill them all ? " " Just about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm staying under here all night . " " You 'll get aspix  --  afsix  --  " He could n't say the word . " Asphyxiated . " " That 's right . " " I do n't care . I 'd rather go that way . " " Moths ca n't hurt you , for God 's sake , " he said . Then , in a lower tone , as much for his own edification : " What makes you afraid of them ? " " I do n't know . It must have something to do with being pregnant . " " Oh . " " Hold me . " He moved over and took her in his arms , and she positionedher head under his chin , cheek against his chest , and put her hands on his shoulders . The rain was still falling in a torrent on the roof . She moved her body closer and murmured , " I love rain . I love to hear it . " And in a few moments she was asleep . Her regular breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife .. .  |p170Just  as the sun was rising , he woke . He dressed and went outside . The air was rinsed clean and there was a pleasant smell to it somewhat akin to the smell of laundry bleach . The lake was calm , placid , glasslike , but it showed the signs of a storm ; it was murky with sediment , and for a hundred yards out the water was stained beige from clay that had washed down . The yard was littered with fallen limbs . He gathered up armloads of them , carried them around back , broke them into even lengths for the cookstove , and put them in a woodbox in the back porch . He found a Swede saw and went into the woods and located the tree felled by lightning . It was an ash , splintered and truncatedten feet from its big base , too large a tree to cut up without a power saw . He pruned off some of its smaller branches and dragged them through the weeds and underbrushto the back of the lodge . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went into the kitchen . She had just risen and was sleepy-eyed . " Where 's the sawing trestle ? " he asked . " The what ? " " The sawing trestle , log cradle , whatever you want to call it . It has another name , too , I think . " " You mean a saw ? " " No , no , no . It 's about the size of a sawhorse . Two big X 's at each end . " He crossed his forefingers to illustrate.  | " You lay a log in the crotch of the X 's and it 's held solid while you saw it . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " You mean your grandfather does n't have one ? " " I 've never seen anything like it . " " How does he saw wood , for God 's sake ? " " On a stump or somewhere . Orin cuts all the big trees . " He shook his head in disapprobation and clucked his tongue . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place like this , where nothing but wood is burned , and not have a sawing trestle . " So he went out in the woods , found a small straight maple about the diameter of his bicep , sawed it down , dragged it to the lodge , sawed it into four posts of uniform length , a little over three feet , sawed notches into the center of each post , and bolted two of them together in the shape of an X ; then the other two . He nailed board braces across the bottom of the X 's , and had a sawing trestle , which he used to cut up the branches of the felled tree . He stacked the pieces of wood pyramidically in the sun to dry , and when she called him , for the third time , to come in for breakfast , he went in for breakfast . After breakfast he straightened up the workbench in the back porch , which he 'd noticed was in bad disorder when he searched for the bolts , and as he was arranging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sorting their contents , he came across a box of glazier 's points . He cleaned up the rest of the back porch , rearranging things to suit his conception of orderliness , and on a high shelf above the workbench discovered several panes of glass and a can of glazing compound . He opened the can ; the gray compoundwas still oily and pliable . He took a pane of glass around to the front of the lodge and saw , as he suspected , that it would fit in the empty sash without cutting . Standard size . He pulled out the old glazier 's points with a pair of pliers , scraped out the hardened putty with a bradawl , and installed the new pane of glass , wedging it firm againstp172the sash with the points , and then sealed it evenly with the glazing compound . He started gathering up the tools and material he 'd set on the ground and noticed , next to the foundation of the lodge , a dead bird , its skull bare and white , the bones of its skeleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been diving toward the light on the other side of the lodge . Ants were threading in and out of its empty eye sockets . He looked through the window and saw her lying on the couch in the main room , paging through a book . He picked up the bird by a claw , ran toward the woods , and gave it a hard toss , and it went spinning into the brush . He came back , picked up his equipment , and put it all in its proper place in the back porch . He went through the kitchen into the main room . She was n't on the couch . He knocked at the bathroom door and , when there was no response , pulled it open . Empty . He ran around to the bedroom . Empty . He swung open the front door and saw nothing but the lawn , the bluff , the lake . " Ellen ! " " Here . " Her voice came from the attic . He went up the steps on weak legs , deciding that now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a close eye on her . He found her in a storeroom . Its low ceiling took the steep pitch of the roof , and unless he stood in the center of the room he had to stoop . The air was stifling near the board sheathing and the ends of shingle nails showed through the boards . She was sitting on the floor next to a large box , picking rocks out of it one by one and studying them with interest . He squatted down beside her . " This is my rock collection , " she said , without looking up . " I did n't realize I had so many . I came up to get the binoculars , but I suppose we better clean the downstairs before I start watching birds . Here . " She handed him the binoculars and started shuffling through a pile of dusty books . " These are mine , " she said . There were old Zanep173Grey 's , adventures of girl campers , adventures of twins , adventures of teenage detectives , and paperbacks about nurses . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is my favorite of these . " He looked at the cover . Black Beauty . " I read it the year after the accident . It 's the saddest story I know . At home , before they built the country club , a neighbor lady who owned that land had a horse . She was too old to care for it herself , and her children lost interest in him after a couple years , so she let me handle him . I exercised him every day and fed him vegetables from the house . He was an old pinto with front legs close together  --  sign of a bad heart  --  and high withers , a mean , ugly thing , and his name was Sam . But I loved him and thought of him as Black Beauty . That 's when I was in the sixth grade . I hated myself . I hated other girls . My hair was short and curly , I was flat-chested , and I had big feet . I only had one friend , a girl friend , and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barefoot in some mud  --  we never played dolls , she hated them , too  --  she said , Oh , Ellen , look ! You have such big feet . ' I never talked to her again . " She took back the book . Her expression and voice had altered , as though she 'd returned to her speech patterns and appearance at that age . She showed him inflatable beach toys that were hers at one time , gull feathers she collected one summer to make an Indian headdress , some paintings she had done ( one of the birch at the edge of the bluff ) , a piece of plywood with the Lord 's Prayer glued in place , letter by letter , with alphabet macaroni , a plastic boat and old clothes , and with each object there was a story . It was humid and close in the room , but he began to feel another kind of closeness , internal and claustrophobic , as though these effects were closing around his soul , smotheringand constricting its substance . He found it hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him , and he began to edge away from her , staring from herp174face to the effects with wide eyes , trying to get her attention. . . and about the same time , when I was in the eighth grade , a new boy started attending our school . He was good-looking , a show-off , and his family was so rich they sent him to school in a limousine . Naturally , every girl wanted to go with him . At that time people looked on me as the silent , aloof scholar , but it was only a facade to cover my fear and self-importance . Anyway , for a while  --  I 'll never be able to fathom this  --  the boy went with me . I do n't even know if I liked him , but he was in such demand he was status . Once when I was at a football game with him , he said , for no reason , I do n't like you . " Why ? ' I asked . I do n't know . I just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above me , and sat beside a girl he knew I despised , and put his arm around her . What are you doing ! ' I said . Turn around , ' he said . I do n't like your looks . ' I had a paper cup of soda in my hand . I threw it in his face . He was mostly worried about his new jacket , but everybody else was shocked that I , the quiet  --  " " Do n't ! " he said . " What ? " " Stop ! " " What 's wrong ? " " Do n't talk any more . " " Why not ? " " I ca n't stand to hear that stuff . " " Why ? " " Because I was n't there ! I was n't with you then !

Mice had discovered the shelves where the food was stored and had , as a reminder of their feasts , deposited an array of commas ; potatoes had sprouted through a gunnysack in the back porch , the moths had multiplied , webs had been spun , eggs laid , red ants had found a hole in a log through which they entered in single file , following an established route , and went toward a box of brown sugar ; and the honeycombs of wasps , that frail architecture , had been fashioned in the eaves . Now it was their duty to clean it away . They wrapped rags around brooms and knocked down the cobwebs , standing on stepladders and tables to reach them . He swept up the glass and most of the sand in the main room , and she got out a vacuum cleaner and started to vacuum with a passion , vacuuming even the logs and the chinks between them , vacuuming the moose , vacuuming the possum . Keeping her in sight , he began to swab the windowsills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Near the end of the day she turned to him with weary eyes , her hair tied up like a peasant 's to keep it clean , wisps of it drooping over her brow , and said , " It 's never been done this thorough . "  |p176They  were half finished with the main room . They went to bed early , overwhelmed by the work they 'd done and , worse , by the work that was yet to be done , too exhausted to eat dinner . She immediately fell asleep . He was tired , but each time his mind started going below the border of sleep , a surge of energy , like electric current , swept up his spinal column and jarred him awake . Several times he heard himself crying out . He thought of the lodge standing unoccupied and the life that had continued inside it . The tenacious insects . The mice . Now his body lay in its blackness . And his living self , his flesh and reflexes and brain , lay inside the sack of his body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light at his center kept the outer layers from closing around him in sleep . And what was sleep ? Who was here to observe for eleven months the minute movement of insects and animals in the lodge ( how complex the patterns they were erasing with a broom ! ) , but , more important , who was there to observe what happened when the mind , overtaken by sleep , went empty ? Scientists could record and report on the life in the lodge , but no scientist , no researcher , not even the REM men knew what happened in sleep . Who could say ? Not them . Not you , the sleeper . You especially , taken under by the sea of it , what did you know ? What happened in that blacknessother than dreams ? And what were they ? Caravans of the past trying to cross the present into the future ? An adjustment of daily perceptions of the external world ( unreality ? ) in order to fit it within the unique world ( reality ? ) of the mind ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electricity , stored during the day in the roots of the hair , held in check by the power of logic , and then going wild at night in a miniature version of electric shock to keep you sane ? Delirium caused from sleeping on the left side ? Active particles of energy you were too lazy to release ? Dissociation ? Orgasm of the gray matter ? New ideas strangling memory to make room for themselves ? A crossing down into the realm of death ? Dis/sonant harmony of the blood vessels , unheard during the day , setting up sympathetic vibrations in the brain which were translated into pictures , like that birch glade seen while listening to Shostakovich ? Instant psychotherapy ? Orders beeped down from superior creatures in UFO 's ? What ? And what could happen while you were unconscious , vulnerable , impotent , without a mind to respond ? Could n't something unknown enter that dark place ? And what if it did ? Who would you wake as ? Jesus , was n't he responsible , now especially when he had dependents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How did you do that without knowing , for the past eight hours , what went on there ? What if some morningyou rose out of sleep and did n't know whether you were a blade of grass , bug , dew , circle around the moon , man , or a molecule of air ? With that thought he lay awake until the sun began to glow gold on the surface of the lake , and then he got out of bed and went into the kitchen and made breakfast for them both . They worked again cleaning the lodge , but at a slower , more resigned , and reasonable pace , napping in the afternoonsor going to the beach to sun themselves . In the evenings they read . They drove to the village often for supplies and always stopped at the post office , a frame building that had once been a Catholic mission , to see if any mail had come for them in care of General Delivery . But who would they hear from except her grandparents ? He wanted to hear from somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was presided over by the moose to the corners of the dining wing , and it took three days . Then they mopped all the floors . He plugged the hole in the log ( entry and exit of the ants ) with plastic wood . He wirebrushed the chimney screen he had thrown down , and put it on a shelf in the back porch . He replaced the soap dish that had come loose in the shower . He went around to each window , working from the inside where he could watch her , and checked thep178hooks that held the sashes firm , and tightened or replaced the screw eyes on some of them . " Why are you always singing ? " He turned quick , taken by surprise , and found her standingbehind him . " I 'm singing ? " he said . " Lately you 've been humming or singing , even whistling sometimes , no matter what you 're doing . " " Oh . " " Do n't look that way . I love it . I 've never heard you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was n't aware that he 'd been singing . He looked at her . " Why are you ? " she asked . " To keep the spirits away . " " What ? " Her eyes widened , and he saw in their depths the familiarterror start rising . Her parents . She thought he meant her parents . " No , no , no , " he said , " I 'm just joking . You know . Deep woods , primitive life , evil spirits . All that . " He put his tools on the windowsill and took her in his arms . " Why does anybody sing ? " " Yes , " she said . " Why ? " " Because they 're happy . " " Are you ? " " Of course . I have what I always wanted . " " And that 's why you sing ? " " You make me sing . " " That 's what I wanted you to say in the first place ! " " It 's true . And if I 'm doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I must be happier than I realize . " " That 's even better , " she said , and put her arms around his neck . " Now growl for me . " It was a thing she had heard him do in the mornings , unconsciously , when he lay half asleep , and she liked the animality of it . He growled.  | " Now carry me , " she said . " What 's this ? " " Carry me . " " Where ? " " You know . " He lifted her in his arms and carried her into the bedroom , and afterward , when their bodies and hairlines were wet with sweat , she took him by the wrists , and said , " No , you ca n't move , " and lay on top of him . They slept together the rest of the afternoon . When he woke , he finished fixing the windows . He became more particular and concerned about the condition of the lodge . He bought a new latch for the back door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He put a new screen in the lower panel of the front screen door , and planed down the door at a point where it was binding with the jamb . There was a metal shelf in the kitchen , which accommodated the detergent , the cleanser , the Brillo pads , and dishrags , and it was beginning to rust and sag down . He undid the screws that held it in place , wirebrushed it clean in the back porch , gave it a new coat of enamel , and reinstalled it , inserting shims of tin under its bracket so it rested level . As he was tightening the last screw , surveying his handiwork with satisfaction , he noticed a piercing acid smell and turned around and saw her at the stove , cleaning the oven . " Jesus , " he said , and went to her and took the jar of ovencleaner away . " Jesus , you should n't be doing that . " " Why ? " " The fumes . Look . It says use only in well-ventilated places , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You better go in the other room . I 'll do this . " She went into the main room , and he began wiping the jellied layer of grease and cleanser off the walls of the oven . The smell was so toxic that when he held his face close to the stove , his eyes began to water , his nose and lungs burned , and he felt lightheaded . Why in the hell was shep180doing something like this ? When he first turned toward her , her head was inside the oven . Jesus God . He opened the windows and the back door , and went to work again , trying to keep back from the smell , but he got whiffs of it , and every time it stung his nasal membranes he remembered her at the oven , and suddenly he felt feverish and so weak he could n't grip well with his fingers . He finished the job and went into the main room , pale and drawn , and lay down on the couch . " What is it ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rank smell . " Again that evening he had trouble getting to sleep . What had he decided about dreams ? About his spirit ? Where was his soul ? At his center  --  in his mind , his medulla , his marrow ? In his right auricle ? Or was it square , resting behind his lungs like an X-ray plate , as the nuns used to depict it on the blackboard ? They made an outline in white chalk . With delicate strokes of colored chalk they drew twining vines and flowers inside to show purity and innocence . The state of grace . Then sin . They erased the flowers . They made gashes with drops of blood dripping . Sin . They slashed in ugly asterisks . Then they stomped it with a chalk eraser , chalk dust smoking , drying your throat , until the square was a solid slab of gray . Mortal sin . The death of the soul . Then they erased it . Ah . Now it was fluttering like paper above the flames of Hell , burning eternally but never burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest grant unto them , 0 Lord , and let the perpetual light shine upon them . Eternal rest grant unto . . . Oh , are you there , lilies and roses of my soul ? With each succeeding day , it seemed that his dreams , more and more , were chasing him , pursuing him to his last point of consciousness ; when at last , with difficulty , he fell asleep , and then woke , the dreams mingled with his thoughts , tainting the reality around him , and finally overtookhim so completely he went unconscious against hisp181will . He began waking in the warm forenoons with a painfulheadache . " Are you all right ? " she would ask , watching him pick at his lunch with a glazed , abstract look in his eyes . " Yeah . I think I 'm on the trail of a solution to that fourcolorthing I told you about . Ideas come to me best when I sleep like this . " " Oh , that 's great . " " Yeah . " Every time they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : an extension cord , nails and bolts , ash trays , safety goggles , a caulking gun to use for sealing the cracks around the fireplace chimney , a towel bar , utensils and trinkets that he gave her as gifts  --  small articles for the most part . But one day he walked up to her while she was shopping , showed her a double-bitted ax , and gave a big grin . " What do you want with that ? " she said . " We have an ax . " " A little one . Not one like this . To do real timber work you need an ax like this . That three-pound thing back there is only good for kindling . This is what we need . " He bought it . He bought other articles , most of them for Ellen or for the lodge , but one day he bought himself a twenty-five-cent balsa airplane , a dogfighter , and flew it in curves and loops in the meadow all that afternoon . She was outside watching birds . She had found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now she spent whole afternoons in the meadow or in the woods surroundingit , watching birds , and he was at his wit 's end to keep her under surveillance and at the same time ( since once in jealousy he told her that birds bored him ) to be unobtrusive about it . When it grew dark she studied the field guide , foxed and dog-eared from an adolescent phase when her love for birds had begun . All her interest centered on birds . She talked about their coloring , their songs and calls , the way they flew and perched , and how their bodies were shaped  --  " Like long slender ovals , " she said . " And theirp182legs stick out of their bellies . No wonder they lay eggs . " Her eyebrows drew down and her brow furrowed . " Do n't you see the logic in that ? " The birds seemed to sense her interest . They were drawn to her . Once she wondered aloud if she would ever see a cedar waxwing , and that afternoon seven of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in a cluster , so close to a window that there was no need for binoculars . Then she said she would like to see a flicker close up and find out whether its speckles were really speckles or just the way its feathers were fitted together . A few mornings later , when she lifted a lid off the cookstove , a flicker stared up at her from the grate , and stood still long enough for her to study it . Then it flew up into the kitchen , fluttered against the windows of the dining wing , and finally she called to him and he came into the room , and together they gave the bird exit by way of the back porch . He went up to the roof and put the screen back on the chimney . She became quiet and meditative , drawing more and more into herself , and seemed content to read and add birds to her growing life list . He was greatly relieved , believing she had purged herself and somehow found peace , but then he noticed , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretive quality , as though she were listening to instructions  --  intricatelydetailed , seductive , wise , and irrefutable  --  onwhat she was to do . He became more watchful and disturbed . Or was it a look all pregnant women wore , that hint of the Mona Lisa ? How should he know when he 'd never lived with a pregnant woman ? Unless she was aroused , she was shy of her body , he noticed , more shy than before they were married , and she would n't let him watch while she undressed . Almost every night , lying under the covers , , he held her at bay , teasing her about her shyness ( his was as bad ; he could n't go to the john if he thought she could hear ) , and suddenly became the gentleman and turned his back on her , the voyeur in him thrilling at the sight of thep183miniature woman , framed in a pane of glass , who , nervously , as quickly as she could , stripped naked , held crossed arms over her breasts ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the room and flipped off the light . When the next storm came in from the lake , turning the outdoors black , then blinding , then black , then splitting the sky with thunder , rain falling , branches falling , she went up to the attic and came down with an armload of games  --  Parcheesi , Chinese checkers , Bridge-It , chess , Monopoly , Yahtzee , all of them  --  and placed the pile in front of him and asked him to take his pick . Trying to be kind after his outburst in the attic , he asked her if these , too , were a part of her childhood . " Oh , no , " she said . " I never really cared for things like this . Grandpa got most of them . He loves games . " He looked up quick but her face registered nothing . A fact . " Oh , " he said . They lay down in front of the fireplace , where a high blaze was burning , and played each game once , except Monopoly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it would make him think of money and he was trying desperately not to think of that . Since it was still too cold for swimming and since the lodge was cleaned and repaired , there was little to do , other than sunbathe on warm days , so they spent most of their evenings and many afternoons playing the games . She had remarkable luck , uncanny luck , and he lost so many times he became a bad sport . He refused to play Yahtzee with her , he ruled it out , because it was based on throws of dice . The same with Parcheesi . Chinese checkers bored him , and Bridge-It , where you constructed a bridge of interlocking blocks from your side of the board to your opponent 's side , was almost the same game , but it went much faster , and since it depended less on luck than the other games ( and since Monopoly was out ) , they played it most often . He tried to plan far ahead to block her bridge , using math to gauge probability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game that she invariably made one practical move and ruined his calculations.  |p184They  started playing chess . He considered himself a good amateur but soon discovered that they were almost evenly matched ; she played intuitively and there was no pattern he could depend upon . If she beat him , he insisted that they play for two out of three games . If she won two , they played for three out of five . This went on for several days . They played everywhere . On the beach , or on a broad stump in the front yard . In the dining wing after meals . His insomnia was growing worse , so they also played in bed every night . She began to notice the patterns in his attack and defense , and after that they were no longer evenly matched . And when he tried to play intuitively , like her , he was lost . One night , when they were lying in bed , she checkmated him in five moves . He slapped the men off the board . They stared at one another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them began to laugh at the theatrics of it . Chuckling , he gathered up all the men and said , " All right . One last game . This is the championship . " She was tired , but she consented , finally , and when in exactly the same number of moves he was checkmated again , he picked up the board with most of the men still on it and with a roar threw it into the main room . That was the end of the games . They went to the beach . They sunned themselves . She watched birds . He cut wood , gradually stripping the felled ash down to a branchless log . He flew his dogfighter in loops and ovals in the meadow , watching its red-tipped wings scroll the air in patterns he tried to repeat . She cooked meals . They ate them in silence . The feeling between them , however , remained close , perhaps because of a drive neither could control ; their sexual appetites were insatiable , as though it were necessary to counterbalance the year apart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times in succession , wherever the desire overtook them , on the couch , in bed , in the meadow , on the kitchen floor , on the banquet table , and after these apostrophes of tenderness ( with an underlying violence that gave thep185tenderness an edge ) he would usually have to carry her , dead asleep , into the bedroom . She needed to sleep more and more . She napped every afternoon , and some days slept for eighteen hours . They lay in bed until early evening and watched the sky , streaked with violet , go crimson and orange behind the long line of Manitou . He could n't nap , and now that there were no more games , he was alone at night with his insomnia . He found it more comfortable to sleep facing away from her . One evening as she was preparing dinner , simmering sauerbraten on the stove , he burst into the kitchen . " What 's the matter ? " she said . " You look like you 've seen a ghost . " " Well there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Porcupines wo n't hurt you . They 're so bashful around people  --  shy and bumbling and harmless . " " Who 's worried about it hurting me ? The next one I see I 'm going to pick up a stick and beat it to death ! " " That sounds just like you , " she said , without a trace of irony , and turned back to the sauerbraten . Her reaction fascinated him ; he wanted to learn as much about himself as he could . " What 's like me ? That I would want to kill it ? " " No . The way you said that . About picking up a stick . "  |p186UNKNOWN  AND OMINOUS , sending out waves of warningthat grew stronger and stronger , washing at his consciousness , some dark thing was overtaking him . What was its shape ? He was helpless against it . He grasped at details of the dream  --  a wall of glass , a desktop covered with light , a profile  --  but they were sensitive to examination and vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on his elbow , he saw a woman 's body silhouetted against a blended background of water and sky , her long hair streaming off to the left , rippling , caught up in a wind . She was at the edge of the bluff . He threw back the covers and jumped out of bed and his knees gave out . Why had n't he told her he 'd let her go ? He made it to the front door , wide awake now , and flung it open . She was running toward him over the lawn , leaving a trail of green footprints in the silver covering of dew . " I thought you 'd never wake to see it ! " she cried . " Look at the sky ! Look at the water ! They 're transparent . " His eyes flew up , blinded by the bright sun , by the brilliantreflection of light on water , and he said , " Sky . Oh . " " But look at it ! " She came up the steps onto the cement landing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their nakedness . " It 's as if I 've seen through to everything , " she said . " I 'm lucid as the day . Ca n't you tell ? Ca n't you feel ? Is n't it great ! "  | " Yes , " he said , squinting over her shoulder , the tops of his eyes and his forehead hurting from the light . " No , no , no . I mean  --  You know what I mean . Every-thing . " " What ? What 's that ? " This was it . She 'd divined his thoughts about the abortion and parting , and believed it was the best thing to do . " You know , " she murmured . " What ? " She held him close , laughing , her breath passing over his neck , the faint sensation of it repulsing him , causing a slow trail of gooseflesh to travel along his nape . Excited , laughing , she finally admitted , " I ca n't say it ! " " Come on , " he cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " She raised her lips to his ear and whispered , " Being pregnant . " " What 's this ! " " Yes , yes , being pregnant ! It 's the most natural way to be . It 's the ultimate I can do as a woman . It 's the greatest gift I can give you . And now I ca n't imagine just being married to you , just being your wife , and not being pregnant . Is n't that great ? " He could n't speak . He reached up and pressed her head against his chest . He wanted to respond , but until he understoodwhat had him in its possession he did n't want her to see his face . Pale , with cold staring eyes , it had a stony set to it , as though he had n't heard what she 'd said . And then the corners of his mouth lifted in a detached , ironic smile.  |p188Very  early in the afternoon , when she lay down to take her nap , he drove to town by himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .22 caliber carbine and three boxes of shells . He looked in the bedroom . She was still asleep . He laid the long red and black carton on the banquet table in the main room , opened it , and took out the new rifle . He lifted it up and down to feel its balance again , ran his hand over the length of it , over the walnut stock , the smooth blued ejecting mechanism , the walnut handgrip , the barrel , and then sighted out a front window . He took up the booklet of manufacturer 's instructions and studied it . He was n't familiar with the workings of this rifle , it was a new model , but the minute he saw it he knew it had to be his . Its design appealed to him that much . The instruction booklet and the pictures on the carton  --  black silhouettes of African beasts  --  were unequivocal : this rifle was patterned after big-game guns . Following the manufacturer 's instructions , which he 'd memorized , he untwisted the magazine tube underneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared the loadingport , and slipped several shells into the slot with care , wondering if they could explode dropping on top of one , another , and pressed the springy cylinder back into the magazine , twisting it to lock it . He snapped down the cocking lever , hearing its metallic echo come off the log walls , glanced at the safety button again , and slammed thep189lever back into place , seating a shell in the breach . He went into the bedroom . She was curled up under the quilt , half asleep , her drowsy , pink-rimmed eyes turned toward him . " Hey , " he said , and held it up . " Surprise . " " A gun ! " She struggled into a sitting position , and the startled expression on her face satisfied something in him ; he was a bit afraid of it , too . " Where did you get that ? " she asked . " In town . At the store . " " Why did you get it ? " Avoiding her eyes , he examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusting elevation . " How much did it cost ? " " About sixty bucks . " " Sixty dollars ! " " Why ? What 's the difference ? " Compared to what her grandfather had , his money meant nothing ; it was something to get rid of . " You had sixty dollars ? " " I wrote out a check on my account . " " I thought we were saving that . " " We need this , " he said , patting the stock . " What for ? " Suddenly he was confused and indignant , and a fever spread through his cheeks . He thought it was obvious why they needed it , that the reason should be absolutely clear , but when he tried to tell her no words came . " Why ? " she asked . He shrugged his shoulders . " We just need it . That 's all . In a place as wild as this , you need one . " " Can we afford it ? " " I still have a couple hundred dollars in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's my savings account , too . " " But you 're so funny . " She was smiling and shaking her head from side to side . " Why buy a gun ? "  | " Because I wanted it . Ca n't I spend my money the way I want ? " " Of course , " she said . " You know what you 're doing . " His eyes traveled over her face nervously , with suspicion , but she stared back at him with an open look , having meant no more and no less than she said . " Are you worried about money , or something ? " he asked . " Sometimes I wonder how much we have . That 's natural , is n't it ? You 've never really told me , and you 've been buying so many things . We 'll need a lot of money in a few months . " He went to the closet and took a bankbook from the inner pocket of a suit jacket , where he kept it hidden . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He tossed the book on the bed . " That should be enough to get you started . " She opened the book , and he watched her eyes widen as she studied the amount , which he knew to be $3,768 and some odd cents . " Where did you get this ! " " Where do you think ? Working . Saving . The year you were away . Last year in Chicago . " " You 've been so frugal and considerate . " " And there 's my fellowship , " he said . " You 're fantastic ! " " Hell . " " Are you sure you do n't have anything more in abey-ance ? " " The part-time job . I can put in as many hours as I want . " With a big smile on her face , she got out of bed and put her arms around him . He swung the rifle barrel off to one side . " You 're so kind , " she said . " You 've thought of everything . You 're so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , stepping back from her and jogging the rifle in his hand . " I 'm going to show you how to use this . "  |p191Kee|ping  the rifle pointed toward the lake , he fixed a matchbook cover to the bark of a broad-based maple about a hundred feet from the front door . He returned to the lodge and sat down on the steps beside her , in the shade , holding the rifle upright . " Now , " he said . " Have you ever fired a .22 ? " " I 've never shot any kind of gun . " " Rifle , I keep telling you . " " Rifle . " He then explained what drill sergeants in the Army sometimes made trainees do if they referred to their rifle as a gun . " But that would hardly apply to me , " she said . " I mean , anatomically . " He gave her a weary look of long-suffering . " Rifle , " she said . " Well , " he began , " in the hierarchy of firearms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the .22 is the smallest and least powerful of all , next in rank to a pellet rifle or BB gun . But you should never , never underestimate its fire power or potential . It has a range of one mile , that 's a straight line from here to Orin 's , and its bullet  --  these long rifles especially  --  can pierce a 2 x 4 like it 's butter . I 've seen a .22 , in the hands of an expert , drop a horse in one shot , and it can maim a man for life , or "  --  he snapped his fingers  --  " kill him like that . Ruby shot Oswald with a pistol that was a toy next to this piece . " " I 'm already afraid of it . " " There 's no need to be afraid . It 's not that dangerous if it 's handled right . It 's a deadly weapon , true , but it 's as safe as the person whose hands it 's in , " he said , a trifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he gave lectures . Maybe he should be a teacher ? " First , before you fire , you should always make sure there 's a solid background just beyond your target to stop the bulletin case you miss  --  trees , an embankment , a hill , anything like that . Now . Let me show you how it works , and how to handle it so you wo n't have to be afraid . " He explained in detail every part of the mechanism ; he showed her how to load and eject shells , how to aim and fire ; he demonstrated the proper way to carry the rifle when she walked in open fields or through woods , or with anybodyclose . It was cool in the shade , and a breeze came from the woods behind them and set into gentle stirring and susurrus the leaves at the tops of the trees . As he was nearing the end of his lecture , he broke off in midsentence ; he thought he 'd noticed , mingled with the smell of pine and leaf from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced stages of decay . He turned in the direction of the dining wing , and said , " What 's that ? " " The safety button . " " No , no , no . That smell . Do n't you smell it ? " She tested the breeze , her nostrils flaring . " A bad smell ? " " Like something rotting . Have you thrown out some meat we did n't finish ? " " Never . I use everything up . " " You smell it too , then , right ? " " Sometimes . Faintly . " " Good . For a minute , I thought I was imagining it . Anyway , here , let me get the elevation adjusted for this distance. "  |p193He  braced his elbows on his knees so that the barrel would n't sway or dip , snapped off the safety , and fired . " Ah ! " she cried . " It 's so loud ! " " That 's just an echo you get from the lodge . If you shot over the wash it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the matchbook cover , saw where he had pierced it , and reckoned the elevation was too high . He adjusted the screw , fired several more times , and then handed the rifle to her , barrel pointing up , but kept a firm grip on it . " You know how to use it now , " he said . " But before you start firing , just let me say this once more : it 's a deadly weapon . " He let her take it . She followed his instructions , confusing none of the procedures , raised the rifle , blinking her eyes in anticipation , and jerked back the trigger . She missed the tree . Which delighted him . " Do n't be afraid of the sound , " he said , trying to suppresshis amusement . " It ca n't hurt you . " " But it 's so loud ! " " You 'll get used to it . And squeeze the trigger like I told you , otherwise you 'll always fire to the right and every whichway . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overcome her fear of its report , and learned to hold the stock close against her shoulder and cheek and squeeze off each round . She hit the matchbook cover a couple of times . He told her to eject the shell quicker , because it could freeze in the chamber , and suggested she was taking too long to aim . " Once you 've got it in your sights , squeeze off . Otherwise you start getting wobbly and insecure . If you 're holding the rifle right , the same way each time , you can trust your aim . Here , " he said , and took the rifle from her . He tore the cover off another matchbook , fastened it to the tree , and came back to the steps . From a standing position , ejecting as quickly as he could , he fired off five rapid shots , and went out and got the matchbook cover and handed it to her . Three bullets had ripped through the center ofp194the cover in nearly the same spot , making a small cloverleaf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ! " she said . " Where 'd you learn to shoot like that ? " " My father . " He walked out to the tree and put the matchbook cover back in place . He unscrewed the magazine tube below the barrel , loaded the rifle again , and passed it to her . She fired slowly and deliberately , taking careful aim each time , and began to improve and grow more confident . Placing his locked hands behind his head , he lay back on the steps and watched her face . She was enjoying this . He smiled . Dark leaf-shadow rocked across his face in a cooling motion . The leaves of the small birch at the edge of the bluff started trembling in the breeze , their light undersides catchingthe sun , and then the smell of carrion came , stronger this time , and Chris turned toward the dining wing . Orin was standing next to the steps . Chris sat up and made an inarticulate noise that was meant to be a greeting . Orin 's pale blue eyes were squinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his front teeth kept flashing as a tentativesmile played over his face . He nodded hello to Chris . Chris touched Ellen on the shoulder , and said , " Uh .. . We have company . " " Oh ? " She turned . " Oh , Orin . Oh , hi ! How are you ? " " Ya , " Orin said , and turned his gaze toward the tree and squinted even more , so that his weathered cheeks drew up . " Ya , I thought I heard one of them hammering away up here . " He broke into a breathy , almost soundless chuckle of " Ya ha ha ha ha ha , " and then shook his head to one side as though to break it off . " Ya . " Chris took the rifle from her . " I just got it , " he said . " It 's a new model . Would you like to see it ? " " No , " Orin said . " No , ho ho ho , no , I got plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother you ? " Orin raised the bill of his striped cap , revealing the fullp195length of his long , amused face , and made a thumb toward the meadow . " Oh , " he said , " I was driving this way , just over to the hayfield down the hill . Good first cutting , too , I tell you ! Till that rain come . " He lowered his head and shook it once . " Some rain that ! " His brow furrowed with a look of perplexity , as though there were something incomprehensibleabout the rain , and he lifted his face to them . Again , he shook his head . " Then the other rain come right on top . " He hooked his thumbs under his suspenders and stared at the ground for a long time in silence , and Chris began to feel he was missing the import of this whole conversation . " Ya , well , " Orin went on , " we turned the windrows again , oh , here a few days back , a side delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be dry soon , I 'd say . Maybe now even . " He squinted at them . " Still good hay ! " he said , as though they 'd claimed that it was n't . " Would you like to come inside , Orin ? " Ellen asked . " And have something to drink ? " He gave her a critical squint . " Not boose ? " " Oh , no . We have lemonade or orange juice or soda . Or milk if you like . " " Sure , " Orin said . " I think soda maybe . " She opened the screen door and Orin followed her into the lodge , going across the main room with his stooped , slow-moving shuffle . Chris ejected the live ammunition from the magazine , put the shells back in the box , and brought the shells and the rifle inside and laid them on top of the piano . He went into the kitchen . Ellen was telling Orin , apologetically , with a flush of embarrassment , that she realized the only soda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chris wondered . Because it was a mixer , and she knew Orin would have nothing to do with booze ? Or because she had developed an uncommon taste , a constant craving , for the bitter acidy liquid , and always kept a stock of it in the refrigerator ? Women . They looked on everything , even external objects , as personal exposure.  |p196From  Orin 's circumlocutious answer , it was impossible for Chris to tell whether or not he 'd drink the stuff . Ellen apparentlyunderstood him better , however , because she said , " Oh , good , we 'll all have some then . " She got out the soda , took down two tumblers for her and Orin , knowing that Chris preferred to drink from the bottle , and Chris got out an opener and snapped off the caps . It gave him such pleasure opening bottles , he should have been a bartender , he thought . Orin made it understood , somewhat more clearly this time , that he did n't care to drink from a glass either , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three caps into the wastebasket . Their clatter against metal made the silence in the kitchen more marked . Ellen suggested that they move to the dining wing and sit . " Oh , no , " Orin said , and leaned with one elbow on the refrigerator top . " No , the partner , she 'll have supper . " He stood in silence , staring at the floor , his lips twitching back in the hesitant half-smile . He tilted the soda bottle at an angle , studying the sediment at its bottom . Chris could n't wait to see his expression when he tasted it . " Sardines , " Orin said . A simile of the sediment ? His talk constantly baffled Chris , who never knew what to say to him and thought it best to just listen until he came to his point . If he had one . " You 're having them for supper ? " Ellen asked . Orin looked up . He seemed startled by such a direct question , so contrary to his manner of talk . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he finally cut short with a shake of his head . He stared at the bottle again , swirling it a little to see the sediment . " Ya , " he said . " Sardines . " He sighed . " Well , you know , you got to eat them fish now and then they say , Catlick or not . I got me this case , oh , back here in the winter months , from this fella over by Sutton 's Bay , and he said they were the best . Ya , ha ha , he said . " Orin shook his head . " You ca n't ever tellp197about what these fellas say . " In the pause that followed , his expression turned solemn . " They 're the best sardines I ate . Ya , I 'll probably have some with my meal tonight maybe . " He stared a while at the floor , and then his brow furrowed deeply . " That Hank Olsen now , there 's a good fella you got to admit . He goes to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Sunday I been , and I do n't miss . That new preacher though ! " Orin clucked his tongue and his silent ruminations about the new preacher made his half-smile start working again . " Olsen , " he said , and tipped his head in the direction Olsen must live , " he 's the fella turned my hay , his side delivery , and he 's got him a new baler . Good rig too . " He closed one eye in an auspicious way , and declared , his voice rising into a high whine with emphasis , " I tell you there 's money in that , that baling business , there 's good money in it ! " He looked at the bottle of soda . " Ya , well . " He swirled the soda around , put the bottle to his lips , and started chugging without pause , without change of expression , and then set the bottle down , empty , on the refrigerator top . " Ya , " he said , " you should see that baler go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to a new company , too , in some deal , like those Co-op tractors you seen around . Well , my partner , she has the supper there , so I got to get . " He readjusted his cap and stood motionless . Then a broad grin appeared on his face , and he turned to Chris . " Say , " he said . " What would you think about playing farmer ? " " What do you mean ? " " When that baler gets going , that Olsen , he do n't stop , I 'll say that for that fella . " " You mean you need help ? " " Well , you got to think of rain with the lake so close . It could rain again hard as before , and they say if you pile your bales two together and one on top it 'll keep the moistureout of the sides , and the sides , open like that , are the worst for spoilage , you know . " He did his skeptical shake.  | " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what they say . Olsen , now , he says it too , so I do it , and I ca n't say I 've had any spoilage yet to speak of . Ya , then I haul them in the barn . " " And you want help ? " " It 'll probably be a nice sunny day tomorrow , that 's what the weatherman says , and you probably would n't mind being out in that sun , huh ? " " If you need help , I 'd be glad to . " " That is , if you do n't mind the working part of it . " " Oh , no . I 've done it before . " Orin went to the door and opened it ; when he felt he 'd terminated a conversation , the conversation was over . He walked out the door , saying , " Well , I do n't expect you to work for nothing , you know . I pay , too . " Chris followed him outside , and said , " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his pickup at the head of the drive , once more clasping his hands under the bib of his overalls . " No , " he said . " No , I always pay . " The admission seemed to cause him immense pain . " It 's up to you . I 'd as soon do it just for the exercise . " Orin laughed aloud . " It 's more than that , I tell you ! " " I know . I used to live on a farm . " " Can you get up at seven ? " " Sure . " " Then I 'll come up the hill about then , seven or eight , and give a honk and we 'll go down there and see what 's doing . " " Okay . " " These are big bales . This Olsen , he makes them big and tight . " He squinted at Chris , and the smile starting playing over his face . " You say you handled bales ? " " Yes . " " It 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whistle , I better tell you that . " " You mean I should wear gloves ? " Chris had seen thep199sharp stubble at the side of a bale , with the weight of the bale behind it , take the flesh off a man 's hand . " Ya , " Orin said , heading toward the pickup . " Ya , I think you might as well bring some , if you like , if you got a pair . " And with his hands clasped over his chest , Orin proceeded toward the pickup with the slow even shuffle that made it seem his overalls were standing still while he glided ahead inside them.  |p200CHIUS  COT UP at six , as the sun was rising , and built afire in the cookstove to drive the chill from the kitchen . He made his own breakfast , cleared away the dishes , washed them , put them in the cupboard , and sat down at the table in the dining wing and began to read a paperback Western , feeling the sun warm his back as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen wandered in from the bedroom , wearing a full-length nightgown she never wore at night , her hair stringy and tousled , her eyelids swollen , her hands hanging limp at her sides . " Did you eat ? " she asked . " Yes . " " I was supposed to make breakfast ! " she said in a belligerentpout , an early-morning mood . " I did n't want to disturb you . You looked so peaceful . " " Do n't stare at me like that . I 'm ugly ! " " I love the way you are in the morning . Absolutely  --  " " Do n't even look at me ! " She went into the bathroom , and he heard running water and the sound of her brushing her teeth , a morning ritual that had to be performed before she could turn human , and soon she appeared with her hair combed and her face shiningfrom washing . She made herself a bowl of cereal , sat across from him , and began to eat in isolated irritation . " Put more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's good for you . " She poured on more milk . He was growing restless ; even the Indian battle he 'd reached in the book could n't hold his attention . He looked at the clock again . It was close to nine and he still had n't heard the honk of a horn . He wondered if Orin had dismissed him as being inexperienced , an incompetent , and the thought infuriated him . It also disappointedhim . He wanted to work , he wanted the pure physicality of it , the mindlessness , he wanted to test his animal self , to sweat in the sun . He closed the paperback and laid it on the tabletop . He looked at the clock . Past nine . He turned to her and saw that she was emerging , at last , from her morning mood . " Maybe he wo n't show up , " she said , and smiled . " Then we can go back to bed . " " Do you need more sleep ? " " Mmmm , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not sleep . " There was the buzzing drone of a weak horn . " Oh , hell , " she said . She hurried to the door with him and they kissed . " I feel you 're going off to war , " she said . " It 's only a few bales . " " I do n't want you to leave me . " " You 'll have to get used to it . It 'll be like this every morning , once we get back . " " No , it wo n't , I wo n't allow it . " " What can you do ? I 'll have to work . " " But you 're my husband . " " That 's why I 'll have to work . " The horn sounded again . " El , let go of me . He 'll think I could n't get up at seven -- pardon , nine  --  and that 's already one count against me . " " Show them how to do it . " " If I remember . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p202They  kissed again , a more prolonged kiss . " Go , " she said . " You have to go now if you 're ever going . " " I do n't want to . " " I know . " " Goodbye . " " Goodbye . " He ran up the slope of the driveway to the waiting pickupand got into the cab , redolent of manure and more personalsmells , and slammed the door . Two shiny baling hooks lay on the cracked vinyl of the seat . " I was wondering if maybe you forgot , " Orin said . " I 've been up since seven . " " My pigs , " Orin said . He popped the clutch , jerked ahead for a few yards , and then evened out in second gear and drove along the woods at the edge of the meadow , past the first , the second , the third brushpile , past the pumphouse , and went down a sand road through a strip of trees , climbed a low hill , and came onto an open rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals in a closing concentric pattern , described over and over , as though it were a thing to be memorized , the shape of the field . A red baler , pulled by a John Deere , was moving slowly down an outer windrow , the fast arm of its packer slamming down hard , and a new bale dropped from the chute at its back . Orin drove through the field , and hearing the sound of high stubble under the tires Chris cranked down his window in order to smell hay . When Orin was close behind the baler , driving down the space between two windrows , he buzzed his horn . The man on the tractor turned and waved and hit the clutch , and Orin switched off the ignition and coasted to a stop behind the tractor . Chris and Orin each picked a baling hook off the seat and stepped outside , and the man on the tractor , who was dressed in a gray cotton work suit and a gray cap , shut off the engine and placed his hand on a fender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , middle-aged wrestler-type with small eyes , a broad nose with nostrils the size of dimes ,  |p203and  pale eyebrows that were almost invisible on his wide pink face , and he came toward them in a flat-footed step , rocking from side to side . He put a hand to the bill of his cap , and said in a raspy baritone , " Yo there . " " How 's it seem ? " Orin asked . " Not so perfect , not so perfect , she 's pretty damp in some of them low spots yet , but she 'll go , the sun 's gettin ' to her . I been keepin ' them old bales short as the machine 'll do ' em , but some urn ' 11 still weigh in mighty heavy  --  ninety pound or more by guess . " He glanced at Chris . " Also , there at the first , the right-side twine was n't tyin ' so good so some of them bales back where I started , well , you 'll see they 're loose on one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable to hold . So you 're goin ' to have to watch it for them buggers on that side . " He glanced at Chris again , and then went back to the tractor , took a grease gun out of its toolbox , and started greasing the baler . Orin showed Chris how he wanted the bales stacked ; two standing on end , their tops tilted toward one another so they touched , forming an inverted V ; and then a third bale laid , twines up , across the tops of the other two . " Yup , " the man said behind them . " That 's the only way to do it . Otherwise you get damp and rain in them open sides and they rot out to holy hell . " " Oh , ya , " Orin said , turning to Chris . " Hank , this here is  --  Well , you better tell him . This here is Hank Olsen . " Chris hung his baling hook over his shoulder , went up to Hank Olsen , introduced himself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pudgy and damp , and Chris did n't receive the vise grip he expected . Olsen gave Chris a quick survey from head to foot . " Say , boy , " he said , " it do n't look like this work is right up your alley . " His laugh made a loud racket . Right up yours , Chris thought , and walked over to a bale , slammed the hook into it , let the bale drag behind him as he walked toward another , which he grabbed by the twine ,  |p204dragging  the two of them , one in each hand , over to a third . He raised the bales in his hands upright , leaned their ends together , then hefted up the third and slammed it flat on top . He proceeded around the edge of the field , leaving a pyramid every few yards . The tractor started up again , and soon the packer on the baler was battering at the hay . Chris estimated that the field was at least ten acres in size , and he made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went , while Orin made a few neat pyramids along one edge . The bales began to grow heavier for Chris . Sweat came out on his forehead , and now , as he went to lift the third bale into place , he had to give it a helping boost with his knee . When he 'd worked his way around to the pickup the second time , he took off his shirt and threw it into the cab . With each circuit he made of the field , two more , three more , he moved closer and closer to its center , so there was less walking to wear him down , but the weight of the bales grew so bad he felt he could n't lift another one . He stopped and stood at the top of a small hill , breathing hard , his Tshirtsoaked , the hook hanging at his side , and saw that Orin was sitting on the running board of the pickup , in the shade of its cab , fanning himself with his cap . Chris judged they had worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started off again , hooked a bale , dragged it with effort to the next bale , and used what felt like the last of his strength to lift the third bale on top . He hated the regular metallic tamping of the baler , the sight of its feeder teeth picking up a windrow and conveying it into the machine , and he willed it to break down . He began to see it as an enraged beast resurrected from prehistoric time by a man as bestial and mad , gobbling hay up its maw , banging at it in a frenzy of sex and letting it drop , egglike , out its ass , banging continually , destroying everything in sight , an insatiabledevouring thing out to do him in  --  and his hate for it grew to such a pitch it became a positive force to work with . He slammed his hook into the bales of the beast , killingthem , and made form , made pyramids of its disorder.  |p205Ze  gods are angry at me because they knew . He hooked a bale . Ze gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two together . Ze gods are angry at me because they knew . He stacked a third on top . I stood at heaven 's portals but that was too high for any mortal such as I . . . That was it . That was the rest of the song . But what had been said that afternoon ? Oh , hell , did it make any difference now ? He 'd only remembered it because of the smell of mustardseed in the hay . He worked faster , in a fury , for another half hour , and then had to go over and sit in the shade of the pickup , where Orin was again fanning himself . The baler was finishing up the field . Good . Good riddance . There were only about fifty bales left to stack . Olsen switched off the power take-off , shifted the tractor into a higher gear , and drove over to the pickup and stopped . " Hey ! " he called to Chris over the low chug of the two-cylinder John Deere . " I thought you was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another rackety laugh . To Orin he called , " Hokay ! I 'm goin ' now and catch that corner six . " Six broken bales , pray God . He drove to the corner of the field and disappeared in a strip of trees , and soon Chris heard the baler hammering again . Continuing to hammer . Without let-up . Six acres . " It 's no good , you know , with no cap like that , " Orin said , and gave Chris a furrowed look of concern . " A fella could get sunstroke . " He pointed with his hook toward the unstacked bales in the center of the field . " We 'll pile what we can of those there in the pickup now and haul them in , and what few are left we better stack them up . " They got approximately half of the unstacked bales into the pickup . Then Orin sat behind the wheel and followed Chris around with the pickup while he stacked up the remainingbales . Chris climbed into the cab , exhausted , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which vantage point Chris got a longing glimpse of the lodge ,  |p206but  no Ellen , and then they turned and went down the rutted hill to the first crossroads and drove up to Orin 's farm . Orin pulled around to the back side of a large gray barn and parked at the bottom of a dirt ramp , with retainingwalls of stone , that led up to the second story of the building . " If them doors are slid back , " Orin said , nodding toward a pair of big doors at the head of the ramp , " them on the rollers there , a fella can drive this rig here right inside . " Chris got out and rolled back the doors . Inside the loft it was cool and dark , and the darkness seemed intensified by the smell of dust , the fine dust from hay , dust that had gathered for ages . One half of the loft , to the right of the alleyway Orin had parked in , was piled high with bright straw , and the floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray , decaying bales of hay . Orin was staring at these , as though contemplating whether or not to remove them . " Ya , well , " he said , " we 'll want to put those on the pickup here on these , and it 'd be best , I s'pose , if we started our pile way there at the back . " He walked out of the hayloft . Chris unloaded the bales from the pickup and carried them , one by one , to the far end of the loft , walking thirty feet each time over the layer of broken and decaying bales , stumbling and getting his feet hung up . When he was done , he went outside , into bright sunlight , and started looking for Orin , wondering if they were finished for the day . He found Orin on the opposite side of the barn , on his knees , pulling up weeds from along a fence line . " These ragweed sure are some nuisance , " Orin said , without lookingup . " You ca n't stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull them up and scythe them out but they still come up every spring here just like wildfire . Well , you can use them , too . Your pigs , you know , they like their greens , and they ai n't so particular , not like your stock are . " He was putting the weeds he pulled up into a five-gallon bucket . Chris got down on his knees and started to help . Orin settled back on his haunches to watch , and then , in a rare sudden move/ment , lifted his chin high and turned his head to one side as though attempting to catch a faint sound . " Ya , " he said . " There 's that crittur again . " He gave his skeptical shake . " No , I do n't know about that stock , whether it 's worth the monkeying to keep it or not . And then the hay you got to have . I think maybe pigs are better . I 'm trying them once , and come fall I might get rid of this few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , a few weeks I guess , I come out and found this crittur keeled over in the back of the barn , bloated up big as a bathtub . Must have been something he ate . Now pigs , you know , they ai n't so sensitive that way . " He gave another shake . " Good crittur , too ! Healthy all along and then just dead like that . No , you ca n't tell . " " Did you have the vet out ? " " Now pigs , there 's going to be a market change on them they say , and then they 're something a fella can haul himself from place to place in a pickup if he wants . That crittur ! He was a real corker , a fat one , a nice steer all right , would have made good beef , but you ca n't sell them or butcher them up when they go like that , that 's for sure . I drug him off behind the tractor . He 's up at the edge of your woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's him now , I s'pose . Ya , ha ha ha , I would n't doubt but what you get a sample of him too when the wind 's switched your way . Well , the crows , they 'll have a feast this summer , I 'll say that . " He laughed and shook his head . " Them crows ! " When the bucket was packed with weeds , Orin picked it up and went toward the barn , and Chris trailed hesitantly after , wondering for the first time about the man 's sanity . Orin , stooping down , entered a low door next to the silo , and Chris , stooping also , found himself in a dim room filled with milking machines and coolers and cream cans covered with dust . He went through the room and came into the cow barn , which had been divided into two sections by two long rows of square wooden pens . One set of pens stood higher than the other on the milking platform above the gutter , and there was a narrow walkway leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pens and many of the sows had farrowed . The sound of piglets , their persistent bicker and squeal , echoed in the concrete area of the barn , and now and then there came , undercutting this sound , the great low grunting huff of a big sow . The baby pigs , front legs bent back , snouts against the bellies of sows , were busy feeding , butting and tossing their heads , switching tits , nudging and pawing at one another , squealing  --  continually squealing and scrambling over the backs of siblings in a senseless pushiness that Chris had never liked . Orin moved slowly up the walkway , distributing with parsimony into each pen , as though they were plated with gold , a few of the ragweeds . There was a larger pen of good-sized gilts and barrows , and Orin tossed the biggest share of the weeds in to them . He came to a pen where a sow lay flat on her side , her flank heaving , her breath escaping in a belabored wheeze that ended in a whine of pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose I should have somebody take a look at her if she do n't come through pretty soon . She 's way past due and I 'd hate like the dickens to lose them pigs . This is her first and sometimes on their first they  --  " A prolonged squeal , like the shriek of a rabbit , pierced the underlying sound , and Chris ran down a few pens and saw a baby pig under the split hoof of a sow , his pink gums and tiny teeth bared in pain , his legs pawing the air . " Jesus , " Chris said , and slapped the snout of the sow . " Hey ! Suey ! Get up out of there ! Heigh ! " He kept slapping her snout , and she tossed her head up and down but would n't budge . He punched the front of her neck with his fist . He jumped inside the pen , landing on spongy straw , and kicked her hind leg . She lifted it as if in irritation , and the small pig went scrambling away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that Orin was watching , leaning his elbows on the upper board of the pen . " Jesus , " Chris said , out of breath . " Jesus , did you see that ? "  | " A fella should watch his tongue , " Orin said , and then stared at the sow for a long time in silence . " Oh , ya , " he said . " They 'll do that . Pigs , you know . " He picked up the bucket and walked out of the barn . Chris climbed from the pen , feeling weak all the way to his marrow , and followed Orin around the stone silo , around the barn , and up the ramp into the hayloft . Orin set down the bucket . " Good , " he said . " You got them bales . " He took a pocket watch out of his overalls bib . " Ya , " he said , and glanced out the big door toward the sun . " Eleven forty-five . Fast day . " Oh , God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? Orin got into the pickup , Chris climbed in beside him , and they backed out of the barn and drove up the hill to the lodge . Chris hopped out , feeling lighthearted and relieved , and was about to thank Orin for the exercise . " Eleven forty-five , " Orin said , squinting out the windshield . " About twelve . So I guess I better wait till one . Then I 'll come by and give a honk and maybe we can stack up a little of that other six . "  | " Eat slower , " Ellen said . Though he was ravenous , he ate slower , but not because of her admonitions ; when he came into the lodge , he 'd drunk a quart of water from the refrigerator and now its coldness was starting to cramp his stomach . She stood behind him and massaged the muscles of his neck . " It 's not there , " he said . " It 's everywhere . It 's my arms and legs ; it 's my back . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did n't you wear gloves ? " " Of course . But I might as well be barehanded the way they cut into your fingers . " " Maybe you should n't go back . You 're not used to it . " " Bull , too . I 'm going back . It 's a rural custom to break in a new man by seeing how far you can push him , even if you have to kill yourself doing it . Well , with Orin , there 's no worry about him killing himself . Unless it 's from overtaxinghis brain figuring out how to get me to do somethingwithout actually saying I should do it . At home we worked hard too , but everybody worked together and there was n't this god-awful feeling of being driven . We had lunch breaks between meals , and on some days , if it was real hot , we drank ice-cold tomato juice spiked with beer and then napped under a hayrack out in the field . I do n't mind the work . It was that damn pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A fella should watch his tongue . ' God ! And do you know what else that crazy bastard did ? You know that rotten smell ? That 's a dead steer , for Christ 's sake . He found it dead and just dragged it up to the woods . Did n't even have a vet out . Jesus ! The thing could have died of anthrax for all he knows . " " What 's that ? " " A disease that can spread like the plague . There 's an inoculation for it , but I doubt if Orin 's ever taken the trouble or money to have it done . The stuff is deadly to stock . It can kill off a whole herd in days . And it can kill people , too , damn easy , if they come in contact with an animal that had it , or if it gets into drinking water . Thank God the pumphouse is where it is . " He shoved away his plate , still hungry , his stomach still cramped , and went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his stomach , being of the persuasion that the best way to treat an ailment such as the cramps was to force the pain to its maximal limit and get it done with . She straddled his rear and massaged his back . Because of his anger , he was tense , unable to relax , and this compoundedhis discomfort and exhaustion , but after a while the action of her hands soothed him , he loosened up , and the gentle warmth he felt above his buttocks as she rocked forward and back began to arouse him . Just as he was about to turn over , unzip his fly , and let her mount him and do all the work , Orin 's horn buzzed . He cursed and got out of bed and she followed him to the back door . " Did I once say Anna was a demon ? " he said . " He 's the demon . " " I know . I feel guilty about not visiting her . She 's so alone there . " " Right . With him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickup and got inside and they drove over to the six-acre field , a triangular field on the slope of a hillside . Chris started around it , stacking the bales , going uphill and then downhill , while Orin workedp212back and forth along one end at his steady pace . There was no baler here for Chris to hate , no machine to drive him forward in fury , and the sun was hotter . His fatigue became so great he felt his bones were of lead , heavy improbablethings to move , much less work with ; he had shin splints , stomach cramps , and the exertion of lifting seemed to have worn his shoulder blades down to sharp points , because they were cutting into his back . When they were half finished with the field , Orin got in the pickup and drove off . Chris continued to stack the bales , dropping some of the top ones now , too weak to place them securely on the inverted V 's . After fifteen minutes had passed , Orin returned in the pickup , drove over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a can of apple-cherry juice , one of the dented ones , and poured them each a coffee cup full . The juice was worse than nothing . It made Chris 's parched mouth so full of fuming cottony stickiness he had to keep it open for a while , like a dog , to get his breath . He had only one desire : to finish this field and go back to the lodge and drink a gallon of water , even if it made his insides blow up . So while Orin sat on the running board of the pickup , drinkingjuice , Chris stacked the remaining bales . He was done . He was too fatigued to appreciate it . He wanted to see Ellen , and be pampered and nursed by her . He wanted his gallon of water . He walked over to the pickup , hung his hook on its sideboard , and said , " Well . That 's it . " " Ya , " Orin said . " Well , now we 'll go get the tractor and see if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What others ? " " Over to that ten we got this morning . " " What do you mean ? It 's all stacked . " " It 's up now , ya , and it 'll be pretty safe if worst comes to worst , but that 's just temp'ry , you know , just in case a big rain comes through again before it 's in . No . " He shook his head as though this was momentous . " No , I think maybep213while it 's still light we ought to try to get some of that in the barn where it would n't get wet , no matter what come . " First , since it was standing ready in the six-acre field , they loaded the pickup . They drove back to the farm and into the loft and , while Orin was hitching a hayrack behind the tractor , Chris unloaded the bales from the pickup . He went outside , got onto the waiting hayrack , and they started off , Orin 's collie barking them all the way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run back to the farm . They drove to the field beyond the meadow . As Orin guided the tractor among the pyramids , Chris disassembled them and threw the bales onto the hayrack , a higher lift than the previous lift to place the third bale , and when the bales on the rack needed straightening , Orin stopped and they did it together . They loaded the hayrack seven layers high , and drove back to the farm . Orin backed the pickup out of the barn , he backed the loaded hayrack inside the loft , unhitched it , invited Chris to hop on the drawbar of the tractor , and drove around to a machine shed of corrugated metal . Waiting there was another empty hayrack . Chris hitched it up and they went back to the field and started loading again . Chris was beyond second wind , exhausted to senselessness , his fingers numb , nerveless , curved like pawls to fit the twines , and sometimes now , when he tried to toss a bale up to Orin , it fell back down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the third or fourth time that particular bale had been handled , not counting the rearranging that was done on the rack , and for what ? The fury renewed his energy , and they got the rack loaded , and drove back to the farm . Orin backed a two-ton truck with high sideboards out of the machine shed . They returned to the field and loaded the remainder of the bales onto the truck . The truck was half full . There were no more bales . Chris climbed up into the high cab , drowsy with relief , expecting to see Ellen in the next few minutes , but Orin , instead of taking him top214the lodge , drove over to the six-acre field . Here , with Chris working from the ground again , they loaded the truck full . Once more Chris expected to be dropped off at the lodge , but Orin drove to the farm , backed the truck into the machine shed , and the two of them went out again in the pickup ( the dog chasing them to the crossroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loaded it . There were about five pyramids left in the field . " These few that are here now , " Orin said , speaking for the first time in several hours , " I can get these by myself sometime . " So Chris was more than amazed when Orin drove back to the farm . " Ya , well , here we go , " Orin said , and walked into the hayloft . They began to unload the bales from the rack . Chris stood on the load and threw down to Orin , and Orin carried the bales to the end of the loft and stacked them . Chris threw down fast , hoping to wear Orin out , but Orin continued to work at his steady pace , and when the unstacked pile of bales grew large , he said , " Ya , I s'pose we better change now , do n't you think ? I know it 's hard going , giving them bales a toss way over here . " It was harder walking over the bales , floundering into gaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He rested most of their weight on his thighs , bouncing the bales forward with his legs , and that helped . Dust and pollen rose from the hay , filling the loft , and it became difficult to breathe . Chris spat up black . Dusk started to descend and , since the big door of the loft faced east , soon it was almost impossible to see . Now they would have to quit for sure , for good , Chris thought , and then Orin got off the rack and switched on a set of overhead lights . They finished unloading and stacking the bales . Then they went down to the pig barn and drank from a hose . Orin backed the second hayrack into the loft and they started unloading it . Orin kept working at his steady pace , ' silent , his weathered face set . Bales were dropping from Chris 's hands and he had to stop and knock his knuckles together to get feeling back in his fingers . His legs werep215turning watery and he stumbled over the stacked bales often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris ; he would toss down a pile of bales , hop onto the stack and help Chris arrange them , and then return to the rack and toss down another pile . It was more than testing a new man , Chris realized , as he stared at the set of Orin 's face . Orin hated haying as only farmers hate the particular tasks demandedyear after year , over and over , by the cycle of Nature . He hated it with the same passion that Chris hated the baler . He hated it so much he wanted to finish in one day . Even taking into account all the times Orin had rested and copped out , Chris had to admit that the lean , elderly man must have muscles of steel ; he kept up the same pace , not even breathing hard , all the while hating this goddamnhay . Chris got another wind , the one that cross-country milers apparently get , and was able to keep up with Orin . He tried to calculate how many bales were left , so he could last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were thirty extra ? Then there was the truck . And then the pickup . He said to himself , I 'll carry five more bales , and when that was done , he said , I 'll carry five more bales , and the incantation kept him going . Then he began to see the bales in terms of time , as the minutes consumed in handling each bale , each bale a solid slab of time , wasteful , useless , used-up time , a time when he could have had a beer , a smoke , listened to wind , walked the beach , fired the rifle , slept , a time he could have held Ellen , kissed her , and , as the stack grew , a time they could have made love , many times they could have made love , a day of it , smelling of one another , and suddenly he felt light-headed and dizzy , in vertigo , spiraling down through hours of time , time stilled forever and stored away in squares , time he should have spent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolation was she , what was love , moreover , when everybody knew where this waste , this spiraling downward went ?  | " Orin , " he called . " Orin , I think you 're going to have to give me a hand . " One of his legs had plunged through a space between the bales and he was wedged in up to the crotch , too weak to lift himself.  |p217Dam|p  with sweat , they worked until eight o'clock . Orin confirmed the time with his pocket watch . He sighed . He went to the doorway , looked out at the gathering darkness , and then squatted down with his back against the doorjamb and tilted up the bill of his cap , exposing one half of his face to the light from the loft . He sighed again . He was finished with haying once more . He was at his ease . He began to reminisce , giving long genealogies ( " Ya , that was Ralph 's cousin , the son of Les , who married the Loomis girl . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chris , but Orin spoke of them as though they were familiars , and as universally known as the dramatis personae of a Shakespeare play ; and Orin 's talk became more maundering , reaching back into the regions of the dead , exhuming names of those who were related to him , those he respected or did n't like , those who had temper or humor , beauty or arrogance , all of them gone , " just the old bachelor left now . " And Chris realized , from his knowledge of farmers and what they divulged , that Orin liked him . Why ? Because he 'd helped him through the ordeal of haying ? Because Orin needed to pass these people on to somebody he thought would be walking the earth when he was n't ? And so , although Chris was impatient to leave , to wash off the nettles prickling him everywhere , and was famished and exhausted and wanted above all to get back to Ellenp218and eat a big meal and go to bed with her , he stood in respectful silence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a half hour , for longer , pinned like a fly by his desire not to offend . Finally there was a long silence from Orin . He took out his watch again . " Well , " he said , " let 's see if we can figure this time here . " " No , no , that 's all right . " " Nine thirty to eleven forty-five  --  twelve , say . That 's about two and a half  --  Nov you tell me if you think I 'm all wet on this . Then about one thirty to eight , that 's six and a half more , so , ya , that makes nine , I guess . Does it ? " " Really . You do n't have to pay me . " " No , ho ho ho , no , I always pay . " Orin squinted and his smile started working . " Now what would you say is a fair price for you ? " " If you want to pay me , let 's settle it some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay , for cherry pickers or any of them , and aha ha , you ca n't tell what you 're getting with that bunch , well , I s'pose it 's not like wages in the city , either , but the least I pay a fella is a dollar a hour . Now doing this hard work like baling is , when a man knows  --  " " Fine . A dollar an hour 's fine . " " Well , " Orin said , prolonging the word as he rose to his feet , " that 's up to you . If that 's what you want then , you come on inside , in the house here , and the partner , she 's the one with the money , she 'll give you a check . " He shook his head . " Them Indians , they want cash . Boose . " He turned and walked away . Chris followed him around to the house , through the clutter of the enclosed porch , and into the kitchen , where a place was set at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had somehow removed and hung up his cap without a pause in his gait , and now a white indentation was visible in his forehead ; above that , his brow was ivory . He went directly to the stove and lifted the lid off a kettle . Chris could smell the odor of cooked meat and onions , and felt weak from hunger . " Nnnnn , " Orinp219said . " Stew . " He looked at Chris , as though contemplating how much Chris could eat , and then said , " Want some ? " " No , " Chris said . " No , no thank you . " He was salivating . " Ellen expects me back . I 'm already late . " He swallowed with difficulty . Did she know how hard he 'd worked ? Did she understand ? She better have something filling and substantialready for him when he got back . Orin gave his head a toss in the direction of the living room . " The partner there , she 'll make you out your check then . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Make out a check for this boy for ten dollars ! " He carried the stew to the table and set it down . He laid two pieces of homemade bread on a plate and started spooning stew over the bread , and Chris saw whole carrots , small onions cooked whole , large chunks of potato and big squares of beef , all in a thick steaming broth , and he started tremblingfrom hunger and had to hurry into the living room . Anna was lying on a couch in her black dress and flannel shirt , on a layer of many blankets and quilts . Pillows of . different shapes and colors were arranged under her upper body , and beneath her head was a silver-colored cushion that Chris recognized as the cover for a tractor seat . She stared at him with her large watery eyes , looking frail and vulnerable . " The doctor says I 'm to lie down often , " she explained . " At least five times a day , and today was hard . I guess I 'm getting what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so used to seeing the lake from the bluffs , up high looking down on it , and this noon I visited a lady in town , she 's ill , and her house was smack at the edge of the bay . Seeing the water straight out from me instead of from a height , the way I 'm used to it , it looked right at the level of the house , higher than the house when you looked way out , and I got this close feeling I was going to be engulfed . My heart 's weak , and it started beating so bad I had to get up and leave . I felt  --  " Her eyes grew wide as a child 's and started moving from side to side as though searching the interior ofp220her mind , and then , with a quick girlish gesture of her hands , she described a large shape in the air , and said , " I felt my heart was that big . Ten dollars ? " she asked in a sudden , apprehensive manner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Placing one hand on her forehead , she sat , paused for a while on the edge of the couch , and then slowly rose and walked across the room , her hand still pressed to her brow , and stopped in front of a rolltop desk . The pigeonholes of the desk were stuffed with letters , papers , electrical wires , tools , pens , and rolled doilies , and there were stacks of religious pamphlets and ledgers lying on its top . Anna took out a heavy black book the size of a spiral binder , a payrollcheckbook , opened it , and asked Chris how to spell his name . She wrote out a check in a bold , backward slant , and handed it to him . In the left-hand corner of the check , over an etching of a barn , he saw , in large black letters , CLAUSEN BROTHERS . " Thank you , " he said . " Thank you very much . " " I 'm sure you earned every penny of it . " " I needed the exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , and went across the room to the foot of a stairway and placed her hand on the top of its newel-post . " You 'll pardon me , but I have to go to bed now that he 's had his meal . He 'll give you a ride up . " " Thank you again . " She smiled her tight-lipped smile , in which there was kindness , and said , " You 're probably the one that deserves to be thanked . " She started up the steps , and then stopped and turned . " You and Ellen must come down some day and visit . " There was a plea in her large eyes , and she seemed to be trying to communicate more . She disappeared up the steps . Chris folded the check and put it in his shirt pocket and walked into the kitchen . Orin was sitting at the table reading a newspaper , stroking a tortoiseshell cat that lay in hisp221lap . Chris was anxious to leave , to get the ride up , but he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to rest . Giving himself a chance to rest . Orin kept reading the paper , releasing an occasional sigh , and then he got up  --  the cat leaving him in a leap  --  and went out to the porch and came back with a chunk of wood and dropped it into the cookstove . For morning ? He went to the sink in the corner , where two bare pipes came through the ceiling and traveled along the wall on either side of a mirror , and studied his eyes in the mirror , pulling down their lower lids , and then washed his hands , then his face , apparently caught up in a ritual that made him oblivious of Chris , and then reached up to the front of his mouth , took out the gold-filled teeth , and dropped them into a glass of water . He sprinkled some powder into the glass , took down a toothbrush , and stirred the teeth with the toothbrush . Chris sat in astonishment , unable to move , convinced that Orin did n't realize he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front of his mouth a few times and laid it down . He smoothed back his graying hair , sighed , and turned to Chris . " Ya , " he said , " I guesth it'sth about that time . " He went to the door of the living room . " You can let yourthelf out . I guesth you know the way up by now all right , aha ha . Maybe you want a ride up ? " His brow furrowed , and he squinted out the window . " Well , there'th sthill sthome light to sthee by . " It was too preposterous . Chris covered his mouth , and the first spasm of laughter escaped in a blast of air at the back of his nose . Giddy from hunger and fatigue , his laughter grew . He covered his face , unable to stop , and turned sideways in the chair . He sat up straight , put a hand on his stomach , and tried to talk . " Brrah  --  HAW ! " He turned sideways again . The laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , his diaphragm heaving , jarring the words out . Finally he said , " No , it 's a great night ! " He was convulsed again and doubled over . " I 'll walk , I 'll walk , let me walk ! " And then , as suddenly as the laughter had over/taken him , it left . He wiped his face and stood up , pale and weak , and said to Orin , who was staring at him in bewilderment , " I 'll be damned . " He turned and went out the porch , through the farmyard and orchard , through the meadow , and through the woods , so angry at being denied the token kindness of the ride that there was no effort to walking , and so hungry and exhausted he felt at the point of tears . He came down the driveway to the lodge , went into the back porch , and took off his shirt . He was removing his pants when Ellen opened the kitchen door . " What are you doing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burrs and beards of hay and other shit . I have to wash it off . I have to eat . What are we having ? " " You look tired . Your eyes are terrible . " " I asked what we 're having ! " " It 's a surprise . " " Surprise , hell ! What is it ? " " You 'll see . I went into town . Mmm , you look strong . Kiss me . " " Do n't touch me ! " he cried , and threw down his boots and stomped past her , naked , his existence narrowed to two things , the shower and the dinner , the shower first ( #1 ) , and then ( #2 ) the dinner , his mind fixed on #1 , shower , his perceptions so narrowed that the only things he saw or comprehended on the way to the bathroomwere the boards of the floor . He spent a long time under the shower , regulating the water so that it was cool , then warm , then cool again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times , working up a heavy lather each time and rinsing it off , well . Still the sting of nettles stayed on some patches of his skin , mostly across his back . He rubbed his back against the wall of the shower . He soaped the wall and rubbed his back against it again . He rinsed his back . It did n't help ;  |p223the  nettles still stung and itched . Maybe they were scratches . He shut off the water . While he was toweling himself down , the door opened and Ellen handed him clean clothes , and said , " Take your time . It 's not quite ready yet . " " Not ready ! You 've had all day , for Christ 's sake ! " " The food is ready but , you know-everything else " Her voice was moving around the kitchen and he did n't catch all this . It moved closer to the bathroom door , and said , " Besides , it 's just a little after nine . That 's the fashionable hour . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just a second . Take your time in there . " " I 'll come out when I damn well please ! " He finished dressing . The clothes felt medicinal on him , like clean sheets when it was humid . He sat on the lowered lid of the toilet stool and pulled on his boots . Only now did he look in the mirror . His eyelids were red and swollen from the dust and chaff , and his corneas were pink , interlaced with a brilliant mesh of red traceries . He hated his face . He brushed the wet hair off his forehead and stepped out of the bathroom . The kitchen was dark . There were candles going in the dining wing . She took him by the arm and led him to the table , which she had covered with a white cloth . In front of his place at the head of the table , on an oval platter , was his favorite dish , a large pork roast , its fat crisped brown , a ring of parsley surrounding it . On their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat , mounds of creamed cauliflower , and fried apple rings . There was a bowl of salad with cucumber slices , quartered tomatoes , and whole green olives ( another of his favorites ) tossed in with crisp lettuce . Next to the salad bowl was a bottle of wine . She had arranged a centerpiece of wildflowers . " El , " he began . Then the candle flames parted , and there seemed to be more and more candles burning , all of their flames arrayed around the dining wing , encircling him andp224Ellen , and finally the cause of the distortion , the tears in his eyes , brimmed over and slipped down his cheeks . " Chris , what is it ? " " It 's so beautiful , perfect  --  " He sat down in a chair and covered his face . " Do n't , " she said , touching his shoulder . " Do n't . I 'll think you do n't like it . " " You 're so good to me ! Why are you so good to me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She brought him some Kleenex and he blew his nose hard , several good blasts . They laughed . She sat down and he carved the roast , cutting it in thick slices , and laid the meat on their plates . He poured a small amount of wine in his glass , held it to the candlelight , swirled it , smelled its bouquet , and lifted the glass to his lips and let the wine rest on his tongue . It was a mixture of sparkling Burgundy and champagne , the perfect choice for his thirst and the meal . They looked at one another and smiled shyly . He poured them each a glass of wine and they reached for their forks . " Wait , " he said . " Do you  --  ? " She understood what he meant , and placed her hands in her lap and bowed her head . " Bless us , 0 Lord , and these thy gifts , which we are about to receive from thy bounty , through Christ , our Lord . Amen . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one I know . " " I love it . It 's perfect , too . " They began to eat . A great residue of grief remained in him , and he felt as he had in childhood , when , after a lecture or physical punishment , he 'd been forced to eat through tears . The feeling did n't hamper his appetite , however , as it had then , and the food was as perfect and delicious as it looked . They made toasts . They toasted themselves . They toasted their friends . They toasted her grandparentsfor the gift of the lodge , and they toasted Orin forp225the meal , which his ten dollars would nearly pay for . They toasted themselves again . They toasted the deer head above them and they toasted the moose . He wanted to toast their child , but was afraid , so he waited for her to propose the toast . She did n't . In spite of all he ate , three times the usual amount , the wine went to his head . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when he was entertaining Ellen . At home , with his parents , he had had plain serviceablemeals like Anna and Orin . On the fumes of the wine , images of his parents rose in his mind ; his father 's gravity and commands , his mother 's dark hair , her eyes , her voice and her gestures , her cheeks , lips . Had they in their lives had a meal like this ? Could his mother , skillful as she was in the kitchen , ever prepare such a meal ? Could she prepare it so that each dish would complement the other dishes , as Ellen had , and could she do it with such confidence and taste ? Would his parents ever see or understand even this much sophistication ? Would they know , like Ellen , to pick only the best ? Or would his mother watch the newspapers and TV spots for bargains ? She always searched out the products on sale . Bargains . Cut-rate . Price slashed . Cheap . Christ , it depressedand shamed and humiliated him for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their quality , and then not have the knowledge or finesse to serve them up with taste . He began to sense the pressure , the pain , the residue of grief rising , but this was a grief he felt Ellen should never see , so he excused himself and got up from the table and locked himself in the bathroom . After he 'd sat for a long time on the closed-down lid , biting a towel to stifle the sound , Ellen tapped on the door . " Chris ? Are you all right ? " He removed the towel and steadied his voice . " Yes . I think . What I did , I think , was eat too much . "  |p226RISING  EARLY the next morning , Chris drove in to thevillage alone and found that they 'd received their first mail , a package about the size of a shoebox with a first-class letter taped to its top . It was addressed : ELLEN STROHE Van Eenanam , The STROHE LODGE , PYRAMID BLUFFS , Mica . The return address was given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He picked up the groceries they needed , plus three boxes of shells , and brought it all back to the lodge and gave her the package . She tore the letter off the package , tore open the envelope , and read the letter through . " Oh , God , " she said , and tossed it aside . It was less than a page long , written on a sheet of monogrammed stationery in cramped , spidery handwriting . He picked it up . " Do you mind ? " he asked . " Of course not . " She was busy opening the package . Well , dear , how do you find connubial life ? You certainlyare in the ideal setting and your Grandpa and I hope that throughout your life you are mindful of the fact that you were fortunate enough to have a place to go to begin it . We continually thank our Creator for the gift He bestowed in leading us There  --  we can hardly wait to come up ourselves ! It will be only two weeks ! Write and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you found everything  --  no trouble I should imagine . I 'm enclosing some clippings I think you should both read  --  also sending along some ofp227your wedding announcements . I went to a printer and had them printed up myself , not some stationery shop where there 's such little selection , and I picked out the paper and type face myself and composed it  --  quite some experience ! I 've already sent off several hundred myself  --  the names are in the box so we do n't make repeats  --  and you 'll find another two hundred enclosed you may send to whomever you like  --  to what relatives of his you care to and friends . I assume , Ellen , that you are familiar with the proper manner of addressing announcements . If not , you 'll find instructions enclosed . It 's a pity they could n't be invitations . Love to you dear  --  and see you soon ! GrandmaP.S . Drop a line and let me know you got this . You know the shape the mails are in . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the slanting , energetic hand of her grandfather : You 're up in the woods there so watch it with those smokes . Appended to her letter ? Some balls . Chris picked up the newspaper clippings , which Ellen had glanced at and tossed aside ; one was on birth control , one on the Kirtland 's warbler , and the other on the increasing divorce rate among couples under twenty-five . " Prophecies ? " he said . " Or hints ? " " Put them away , " she said . " Burn them . " " What about the bird one ? " " Keep it . " He laid them all down on the work counter , and watched as she stripped the last layer of paper ( there were four or five ) off the box and opened it . She took out an announcement . It was of heavy eggshell paper and the family crest was embossed on the overleaf . She opened the card and studied it , and a smile appeared on her face . " Not so bad , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to bet there 'd been a hassle with the printer . Not all announcements were that detailed or couched in such a cold , factual tone , were they ? Did n't they usually say , are pleased to announce the marriage of ? " Well , " he said . " I guess that makes it official . " " The license did . You signed away your freedom then . " " The hell I did . " She turned to him with hurt eyes . " Did n't you want to ? " " Oh , of course , " he said . " Of course . " He ran his fingertipover the raised engraving . " Where 'd she get all the info ? " " Before we left , she had me write it down . Should we make out a list now ? " " Why not ? You start . " She took the box of announcements to the table in the dining wing , took a tablet of paper off the windowsill , took her fountain pen from her purse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The sun was pleasantly warm . As her hand traveled across the tablet in her large and rapid handwriting , he watched the point where the shadow of her pen met the pen 's nib , and the black shadow of the pen , darker than the shadow of her hand , began to take on the appearance of a reservoir from which she drew thep229lengthening list of names . In his mind he went over possible recipients . There were a few friends in Madison ( she was most likely listing them ) , a couple of acquaintances in Chicago , a couple of professors there , his boss at the accountingfirm ( a bonus ? a raise ? ) , two uncles he 'd lost touch with ; his parents . He picked up an announcement and examined it again . " Wait a minute , " he said . " I 'll be damned ! " He looked up and found her studying him with puzzlement . " Your name 's Strohe , " he said . " Why Strohe ? " " It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , are n't they your mother 's parents ? " " Yes . " " Then why Strohe ? " " Grandpa had it changed . " " Why ? " " I do n't know . I guess he figured he and Grandma were my parents . Legally , they are . " " When did he change it ? " " Shortly after the accident , I guess . I 've always thought of it as my real name . " " What was your father 's ? " " Cutler . " He saw the terror start in her eyes and , though he wanted to learn more , he placed the announcement on the table and turned and looked out the window , making it understoodthat he would not pursue the subject . He listened to the nib of her pen moving over the bulk of the tablet . It stopped . " I think my father 's name was changed , too , " she said . " I think I remember an argument about it . I think originallyit was Cotler . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon he heard the sound of her pen moving once more . He felt , like a cloud shadow passing over him , a wash of the terror she must feel . He stared at a birch , at the meadow , at a stump closep230to the dining wing that had a heart-shaped hole in its center . Her pen continued to travel over the tablet , but with longer pauses between names . There was an extended silence . " I have a few over fifty , " she said . " Are you ready ? " He did n't know an uncle 's address . Together they tried to recall any friends she might have overlooked . They wondered how many people would save their announcements and count backward from the date the child arrived . " All of Grandma 's cronies will , " she said . " But the time from the marriage to the due date is close enough to nine months . The child could just be a few weeks premature . They 'll never know for sure . They 'll be frustrated as hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go on , " she said . " Who else do you have ? " He could n't think of anybody else . He made up some ringers to tease her . He suggested sending one to the local grocer , to Reverend Nelson Hartis , to Orin and Anna , her grandparents , the Pope . In the end , when he was done amusing himself , she counted up the actual number of names he 'd been able to add to the list . There were five . " You should send one to your parents right away , " she said . " And you should put a note in it . " " Come on , " he said . It was like the protest of a child told to do his homework . " You must . You 're right here now . Here 's the tablet . " " Oh , come on . They do n't care . " " Of course they do . Here 's a pen . " He sat with the pen in his hand , staring at the tablet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dear Mom and Dad , I know it 's been a long time , and perhaps I 've been remiss in keeping in touch , butHe tore off the sheet of paper , wadded it in a ball , and held it in his free hand , squeezing and kneading it.  |p231Dear  Folks , Quite a while back , when I was a junior there at Madison , I met a girl by the name of Ellen , and I might haveHe 'd never even mentioned her name . He ripped off that sheet and wadded it up and held it in his hand . He sat for a long time , staring at her as she addressed the announcements , and then wrote : Surprise ! I 've gone and done it . I bet by now you thought nobody would ever catch me , but this one did . You 'd love to meet her . She 's a beautiful girl , a great girl , and I know you 'd like her . We plan to move to Chicago soon and hope to drop in at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded the note , put it in the inner envelope of the announcement , sealed the envelope , put this in the outer envelope , sealed that envelope , and then addressed it to his parents . She looked up . " Did you finish ? " " Yeah . " " You did n't seal it ? " " Yeah . " " I wanted to read it . " " It 's nothing . Just a note . I said maybe we 'd stop and see them on the way to Chicago . Explain things . " " We 'll have to . I 'm really excited about meeting them . " He felt uneasy . He picked up the balled pieces of paper , took them to the cookstove , dropped them inside , and set a match to them . When he was certain they were burning well , he replaced the iron lid . For a long time he stood and looked toward the dining wing , staring at her head bowed over her address book and the announcements , at her hair shielding her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he started prowling around the kitchen , picking up cups , ash trays , an asbestos pad , thep232coffeepot  --  picking up objects and moving them aside as if he expected to find something under them . He came across the three newspaper articles . Mindlessly , he read them through . He read them through again , with as little comprehensionas before . He turned them over . On the back of one he saw : Recovers Wallet Lost in Sea 4 Years AgoFrom Tribune Wire **25;10569;TOOLONG , England , March 15  --  Derek Jones , a truck driver , thought he had seen the last of his wallet when it fell into the sea here four years ago . But today the wallet was washed up at a spot only a mile away from where he had lost it . A fellow worker found it , remembered Jones had lost a wallet and returnedit . Everything inside the wallet was intact.  | " Hey , " he said . " Let 's go to town . " She looked up from the couch where she was lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor lamp , paging through a book on birds of prey . " What do you mean ? It 's after eight o'clock . " " I know , I know , but it 's Saturday night ! " " There 's nothing to do there , even on Saturday . " " Let 's go see . " " I 'd rather spend the night with you , alone . " " Oh , come on , " he said , and pulled the book from her hands and placed it , covers splayed out , across the arm of the couch , and dropped onto the cushion beside her . " We have n't been out since we came up . " " Are you bored with me ? " " No , no , for God 's sake . I just want to get out . I want to take you out . Do n't you want to come ? " He stroked her hair , her forehead , her eyebrows , and then took her by the chin and kissed her . " Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You have to promise we 'll be back early . I 'm tired . " " Sure , sure , sure . We will . I just want a couple of beers . " She went into the bedroom and in a few moments reappearedwearing clean Levi 's and a cotton jersey patterned with broad horizontal stripes of maroon and forest-green ; it fit close at the neck , had three-quarter-length sleeves , was long and tubelike , and hung below her hips.  | " Why are you wearing that thing ? " he asked . " I like it . " " You wear it all the time . " " It 's perfect for up here . " " It makes you look  --  " With interlocked hands , he pantomimeda massive stomach . " You know . " " I am . " " But you 're not even showing it . Why wear a thing like that ? You look like you 're trying to hide something . " " It 's comfortable . " She went into the bathroom . He paced around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose of the possum , flicking the coon , and paced through the hall and into the kitchen , around the kitchen , and around the dining wing , and back into the main room , slapping the backs of furniture , setting a rocker going , patting his palm along the split-log mantelshelf when he passed the fireplace , and then went into the hall and stopped at the bathroom door . " What are you doing in there ? " . Her voice was made flat-sounding by the small bathroom , and he heard a barely distinguishable phrase , as though her mouth were full or distorted , that sounded like , " Planningto make it . " " What P Talk louder . " " Putting on makeup . " " For that place ! " " I always wear it . Even here . " " Here ? What the hell for ? " " You . " " " Oh . Well , I never noticed it . " " I 'm subtle . " " ' Subtle ' ? How about sneaky ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I amHe lit a cigarette , and paced around the kitchen , movingp235aside cups and other objects , and then began tapping the top of the cookstove with the handle for lifting lids . He saw the newspaper clippings on the work counter . He picked them up , dropped all three of them inside the cookstove , and made a fire of them . He lit another cigarette from the stub he was smoking , which had turned hot and weedy-tasting , and tossed the stub into the cookstove . She came out of the bathroom with her hair done up in a French roll , a style that emphasized her eyes , which had grown more and more round as the life inside her grew , and she had applied more eye liner and mascara than usual , which made her eyes look even larger . " Nice , " he said . " You look almost too nice to take out . " He studied the front of her jersey , where she had also grown , and frowned . " Are you wearing a bra ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate it . It 's spoiled me , not having to wear one . They 're unnatural . " " Why not just go nude ? " " Do n't be extreme . You ca n't possibly know how terrible they feel . " " I 've had on a jock . " " They 're an imposition of society . They 're worn for everyonebut the wearer . They 're ... " " Hey , " he said , imperative now . " Let 's go ! " They drove in and parked on the main street , a few automobilesdown from a blue neon sign , with some of its tubes gone bad , that read : Holding her by the elbow in a courtly , country manner , he led her up the sagging steps onto the wooden porch ofp236the bar and opened the door . The smoke-filled room was big , like half a ballroom partitioned off , and they were struck by the odor of flat beer , beer breath , fish and wet wood , and the harsh metallic smell of cigarettes and cigars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As they stepped inside , everybody at the bar  --  a small U-shaped counter that jutted from the right wall of the room  --  looked up ; they were mostly elderly men , one with a long vermiculateface and a baseball cap whose bill was tipped so far back that the gray of his crewcut was visible to the center of his head , one in a hunting vest and hunting cap with a cigar in his mouth , one wearing an engineer 's striped cap and a plaid jacket , one old woman , and a few middle-aged men , interchangeable with the middle-aged men in any other small-town bar . There was a row of black-topped tables along the left-hand wall , and a family of Indians , including the grandfather , the parents , and three small children , sat around a table in a dark corner of the room . " Do you want to sit at the bar ? " he asked . " Sure . " They mounted the high , plastic-topped stools , and he rubbed the toe of his boot back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with small sticks of split pine and matched a wainscoting of split pine that lined the walls of the room . There was one small mirror , a round one , too high for anybody to see in it , mounted on the wall above the back bar , and above the mirror was a varnished bass on a wood plaque , with the tackle it had been hooked with still dangling from its lip . Some teenagers , drinking Cokes , were playing pool at a scaled-down pool table at the rear of the room . There was a bowling machine along one wall . The bartender , a squat , heavyliddedman with fleshy lips and a high wave of black hair oiled in place , pushed himself off from the bar and wanderedover to them . Chris ordered two drafts . The bartender asked for their I D 's . They pulled out all the identification they had on their persons ( everything but passports ) andp237placed it on the counter . The bartender fiddled around with the cards , comparing descriptions and pictures on different ones , checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picked up a flashlight and went through the same business again . Then the bartender let out a long rattling belch right in front of Ellen , said , " Hunh , " shoved the cards toward them , and drew two drafts . " Bring me a bottle of Auld Meister while you 're at it , if you 've got it , " Chris said , and turned to Ellen and smiled . " And also a shot of V.0 . " The bartender wandered off . " You 're not going to drink hard stuff , are you ? " she asked , imploring . " One bracer . " " You know how you get . " " Bull . " He downed his draft . He downed the shot , and chased it with half a bottle of Auld Meister . He looked at the Indians . The grandfather and the parents were drinkingdraft beer in withdrawn silence , staring at the tabletop , and the children , also silent , ate from a bag of potato chips in the center of the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling the thick taste of it crowdinghis mouth , and Ellen continued to sip at her draft . The elderly men at the bar were speaking to one another in subdued voices and giving him and Ellen unguarded stares . He ordered another beer , and drank half of it . " It 's time we faced this damn thing , " he said . " What ? " " What ? What ? That year apart , that whole wasted year , what the hell do you think what ? " " It 's a futile thing to talk about . " " It 's a futile talk to think about . " " Do n't be angry . " " Oh , hell , no . I 'll just be a pleasant old hick like the rest here . " He ordered another bottle of Auld Meister . The alcohol was beginning to have its effect . He found himself staringp238at details for too long a time . At the blue label over the top of his cigarette pack . A crack in the polished wood of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . A pin in her French roll . The bartender 's high , oiled wave of hair . The stripes in her jersey . His elbow slipped off the bar . He ordered another beer . The more he drank , the saltier and less satisfying his cigarettestasted . So he smoked more . And the more he smoked , the better the beer tasted . He wanted another shot to wash the thickening saliva from his mouth . The teenagers had finished with the pool table and were playing the bowling machine ; the crash of the pins , and then the clack clack clackclackclack as the counter racked up the score . " Want to play some pool ? " he asked . " I do n't know how . " " Come on . I 'll show you . " He went to the table , put two dimes in the holes of its metal feeder , jammed the feeder forward , and sent the balls rumbling around to the back of the table . He piled the balls into the rack , placing the eight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scooted the rack forward and back several times , getting a tight one , and lifted it away . " I 'll break , " he said . He found a stick that was the right weight and had a tip he liked , but was slightly warped , and chalked it up . He went to the end of the table and positioned the cue ball with the end of his stick and shot , sending balls caroming off cushions , kissing , cracking into one another , and made two stripes and a solid . He sank two more stripes and blew a straight-in shot . He rubbed the sticky end of the cue in a fold of his shirt . " Your shot , " he said . " Try to make any of the solid-colored , ones . " She stood erect , holding the end of the cue stick high , swung it from side to side , and punched the cloth . " No , no , no , " he said . " Here . Take another . This way . "  |p239He  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he 'd shown her how to use the rifle , but she could n't learn to grip it so it slid free through her curled forefinger , and she persisted in swinging it from side to side . He had less patience than when he was teaching her to handle the rifle , and finally , to simplify things , he showed her how to use crow 's feet . She improved , and when they finished the game she 'd made two balls . " I like it better now , " she said . " Let 's play again . " He got two dimes in change , got change for the cigarette machine , got a beer , and learned from the bartender that there was no talc . Piss . He set his beer down on a table , went over to the cigarette machine , put in the proper change , and jerked the plunger above his brand . How beautifulit would be to call somebody long-distance . He clawed around in the metal tray of the machine for his matches . Why did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them fall on the floor where you could see them ? At last he located them back in a corner , where they always were . The cover of the matchbook said , ivr.AKE $100A WEEK WEARING SHOES WE GIVE YOU ! Jesus , why not ? Hewent back to the table and racked the balls . She would n't break , so he broke again but nothing fell . Now , as he walked around the table , he found himself doing sudden sidesteps to catch his balance , and his eye was going bad ; the stripes and the dots on the balls pulsed toward him , and every time he shot , even straight-in , the balls appeared to travel on parabolas . He shook his head to clear it . She made two balls while he made four . He watched her bendingunder the light , her lower lip bit in concentration , the stripes in her jersey moving as she moved . Sweet Jim True 's . The low lamp over the pool table . The room dark and the green cloth lit . Sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players ' thighs were in light . Then dipping their faces into the light for a shot , rising , and again their thighs lighted . Lynn , with long black hair , across from him in the booth , talking in anger , her highp240white teeth showing in the dark . Brown eyes . Only the third time they were together , but she was scolding and berating him as though he were an old lover . The first time they met , in this neighborhood bar , she gave him an animal stare so straightforward and open he could see down to her innards . He went to her and began talking about sex , the only subject after such a stare , and at one point he said that he thought women were untruthful about how often they wanted it . " Maybe some are , " she said . " But I 'm not . I know , for instance , that when I walk down the street and see certain men , you know , nice ones , I 'd like to just go up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different or childish that way , but that 's how I am . " Then she suddenly had to leave , saying she was already an hour late for dinner with her fiance and her fiance got nasty when she was late , and there was a flurry of address and telephone-number taking , and she set a date for Chris to come over for dinner . He arrived that night , and during the dinner she talked on and on about sex , as though it were a new fashion in clothes , and finally she said that her fiance could n't satisfy her , and nobody had , not even a thirty-year-old Frenchman she 'd lived with for two weeks in Key West for precisely that purpose . She lowered her eyes . " I think I 'm frigid . " She talked another hour on the topic , and then said , " How old are you ? " " Twenty-two , " he answered . " You look like a boy . You are n't virgin , are you ? " His sudden laughter made him cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another hour of it , and after a bottle and a half of wine , he said , " All right . I 'm going to fix you up . " She stood as though in fear , and he rose , a little clumsily , and realized again how tall she was , well over six feet , half a head taller than he , and he tried to calculate how long her black hair , which hung loose and unpinned and reached to her buttocks , would have to be . Two and a half feet ? Three ? Concentrate , you ass . He maneuvered her to a couch and began gently , holding back with effort because she was his first woman since he 'd moved to Chicago . She was flat-chested and slowp241to arouse . He began to make her respond with no theatrics , of her own accord , when the telephone rang . It was her fiance . She cooed into the phone and said suggestive things . He left the couch and went over to the table and finished off the wine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " No , no , not tonight . I 'm just exhausted . Well , you know why . What ? You think I 'd lie to you ? Oh , hon , I just ... " When she finally hung up , he said to her , " That was nice . " She turned away . " I do n't know what it is . He 's no good for me , but he 's a lawyer , and rich , to tell the truth , and , I do n't know , maybe I need the security or something . In many ways , I 'm a child . I 'm funny that way . " He went to the couch and began in earnest and was nearly there , her bra to her ampits , her Levi 's unzipped , when she said , " No , I ca n't do this . I ca n't do this to him . " She rearranged and refastened her clothes and lay on the couch biting her lower lip , and when he saw her nervousness and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been , he grabbed her Levi 's at the waist , unzipped them , and pulled them off while she kept kicking her long legs and saying , " No , no ! No , I ca n't ! " He did n't bother to take off the rest of her clothes or undress himself . She was small and close for her size , virginlike , ridgy , and this excited him so much he could n't hold back . " Are you there ? " he asked . " Are you there ? " But he was done . Her eyes were squinted shut and she was biting her lower lip more rapidly and harder . " Oh , Christ , Jesus , " she whispered . " Almost . I could feel it , it was so close . I 've never felt it . " Which revived him in an instant . And since she was already so high , he moved only a few times before her body stiffened , made a few weak convulsions against him , and then went limp as the whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened , he started for water , but then her eyelids fluttered , and she said , " Yes , that was it . I 've done it . I 've made it . " He stayed the rest of the night , and in bed took her up higher steps , and each time , at the end , she went unconscious . As the sun was lighting her curtains , she said , " You 're not twenty-two . "  | " The hell I 'm not . It 's hell to be that old . " " You 're not , " she said . " You 're nine . You 'll always be nine . " " What 's that ? " he said . " A slighting reference to how I do it ? " " Nobody could do it , who was any older , the way you do it . " She was gone when he woke , but there was a meal laid out for him and a note that read , " Thank you . Thank you for beauty . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always claimed to be busy or exhausted . He remembered the time her fiance called , and then his brain , always behind his body by at least a season , began slowly slogging along : Was she engaged ? If she 'd lived with a Frenchman in his thirties , you mean he could n't have done as much for her ? or more ? And then there was her admission about wanting to walk up to men on the street , and was n't that what she 'd done , more or less , with him ? Did she get her kicks from pretending to each he was the first ? A snapper ? Or did she really flip out like that ? The unconscious part was n't an act , he was sure . He kept calling her and she finally agreed to meet him , for an hour , in the neighborhood bar . He went there early and got drunk , and watched the faces and thighs moving under the light . When she arrived and sat in the booth , in an obvious hurry to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . She said she was like a child , she told him that , she warned him about that once , and then she accused him of raping her when she was practicallymarried . He claimed she was n't even engaged . She showed him a ring . He called it fake . They cursed one another , and it ended with her calling him a shit-face drunk , and him calling her a kike . " It 's your shot , " Ellen said . " What ? " " You 've been staring at the table for two minutes . You ca n't be planning that far ahead . " " Right , " he said , and now he had the confidence and clear eye , and the steadiness too , that comes with just enough anger and drink , and he began to slam the balls home ,  |p243sinking  all of hers after he 'd made his own and the eight , clearing the table . " What are you doing ? " she said . " Is that the right way  --  " " Forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cue . " Let 's get the hell out of here . " He drove home wildly , squalling around curves on the county road , going eighty on the gravel roads , jerking the wheel and throwing the car into hazardous rear-end drifts , and achieved his effect : she was so terrified she sat in silence the whole way . He brought the car to a sharp , dipping halt at the back door of the lodge . She sat motionless , silent , staring through the windshield . " All right , I have just one question to ask , " he said , overarticulatingbecause of the booze . " Just one question . And I want an honest answer . No evasive crap this time , okay ? " He listened for a long time to the sound of night insects , waiting for her to speak , and sensed that she knew the reason for his anger . " You understand ? " " Yes . " " I just want you to tell me this , just this one thing . How many guys did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Please . " " Come on , come on , give me a straight answer ! " " Does it matter ? " " You 're goddamn right ! " he cried , beeping the horn as he slapped his hand down . " Tell me ! " " Please , Chris . " " Tell me ! Just tell me how many , for Christ 's sake ! " She lowered her head and murmured , " Two . " " Well , two . Well , thanks . Thanks very much , dear Ellen . That 's all I wanted to know . Thank you very holy Jesus ratshitmotherfucking much . " He got out of the car and slammed the door and went into the lodge , switching on lights . He walked to the piano , grabbed up some shells that were scattered over the bearskin , loaded them in the rifle , and cocked the piece . He went to the back door and stepped outside . She was comingp244toward the lodge in her sad sashay , her head bowed , and when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was pale , a white oval against the dark . " Chris , " she said , her voice tremulous . " What is it ? " " See you around , " he said , and walked past her in the direction of the meadow . He heard sounds behind him , as though she were trying to speak , and then the door of the lodge closed . Silence . Silent night , holy night . . . The grass was black underfoot . There were stars . All is calm , all is bright . . . He entered the tall grass of the meadow , and made his way to the first brushpile . He sat down on a branch and faced the lodge , holding the rifle between his knees . The bedroom light went on . He saw her , through the uncurtained window , ease onto the edge of the bed , and bend over , her face in her hands . Silent night , holy night .. . She threw herself on her stomach and hugged a pillow to her breast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virgin Mother and Child . Holy  --  She rose up suddenly , as though in determination or anger , and began to undress . She threw her striped jersey toward the main room . She took off her bra . He got up and went toward the lodge . When he came to the perimeter of the square of light that the bedroom windowprojected onto the lawn , he stopped . She was no more than fifteen feet away , standing at the dresser , naked , studying her face in the mirror . How many others , he wondered , had stood here this way , at one time or another , and watched her ? Watched him ? He skirted the illuminated area of the lawn , moving closer . The bedroom light went out . A large , slanting birch rose out of the ground three feet from the corner of the lodge . The first charack of the rifle startled him , startled the darkness , but he continued to fire until he 'd emptied the shells from the magazine , , five rounds , into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palely lit with stars , his mind still on Lynn , he was unable to sleep . His mind replayed their three meetings , three spools turning in unison , over and over , with diminishing . coherence and sense but with such persistence he felt he was missing the point . He grew both angry and aroused and the two forces locked within him as if in copulation . Her black hair , her teeth showing in anger , her teeth on her lower lip , her eyes going back in unconsciousness .. . Or was that a part of the act ? No , he was sure it happened . Or was it  --  ? No , it made no difference if it did or not . Or did it happen only once to women , one time or one night under signs and conditions that could never be repeated ? Who knew ? Maybe it happened to Ellen ? In his arms ? No . In New York ? Who were those two ? Did she think of them as he did of Lynn ? How did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fight . Or forget . Or  --  The black hair , the teeth , the eyes , revolved again around a single center . What ? Who ? No , who were they ? Those two ? Where did they live in the city , what did they do then , what were they doing now , what were their names ? Were they married ? " Ellen ? Are you asleep ? " " How do you expect me to sleep after that ? " Her voice was pale as the night , throaty and several tones lower than usual , with fear or emotion.  |p246He  began to question her about the two . She evaded his questions , and kept saying it made no difference because there was no pleasure in it , only agony , which he did n't believe , and her evasiveness made his anger grow and lift away from the coupling force . Then she asked him if he had n't slept with other women that year . He could n't answer . He felt up against a blank wall . Finally he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while to her heavy , irregular breathing , he said , " But you were the one that left . " " Damn you ! Ca n't you get off that ? " " Stop screaming in my ear ! " " Ca n't you get off it ? Have n't you met my grandparents ? Did n't you see how they used my own parents against me ? Can you imagine growing up under that , a child ? That and their religion and principles , ' they call them , that they forget about if it 's expedient . Married , Ellen ? You want to get married ? ' They acted amused ! They pretended I was too young and naive , too stupid to even think of such a thing . They took me apart ! They put me together so they knew how to take me apart . I did n't know what I wanted . I did n't know who I was . They reduced me to nothing ! I had to go just to get away from them . They 're sick ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , too . I just wanted peace , did n't any of you understand ? Just some quiet . Just a few minutes ' quiet to stop and think . " " So you had to go to New York ? " " Yes ! " " And you had to play around ? " " What do you want ? I came back , did n't I ? I love you . I came back . Do I have to live the torture of that year all over just for you ? What do you want to know ? What will help ? Do you want to know I was out of my mind and ready to die ? And I would have if I had n't loved you and believed in your love . " " What do you mean ? " " I had pills . "  | " From a pusher friend ? " " A girl friend , a girl friend , for God 's sake ! And there were the rivers . I used to go to the docks and stare at them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night ! I did n't even care if I was knifed ! I was alone ! I did n't have you ! " He felt that the marrow had emptied from his bones , and his chest and forearms cramped with anxiety . Was n't it wrong for pregnant women to get so emotional ? She held his child . Did she ? She held a child . A life . He resolved not to upset her again , to put this from his mind , but images of Lynn came to him , and images of her , his El , covered by another body , biting her lower lip as Lynn had , and he arranged and rearranged his racked frame under the covers , trying to formulate some solution , the sequence of words that would make his feelings logical and clear , and he began a fluent and moving speech of his love for her , of how it bridged the past , all that had happened , but the images returned , obscuring his words , reducing them to blur , and he saw hordes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with Ellen 's face or with features of Lynn 's and Ellen 's body , and finally he had to get up and go out to the refrigerator and drink some ice water . And as the water poured down his throat , he felt he was a creature without substance , a transparent anxiety with burning ears that the water would run out of , and it was almost impossible to swallow . His insides were dried from the beer and he drank too much and went back to bed feeling bloated . He tossed under the covers , half awake , half in the region of dreams , still trying to formulate the speech that would clarify his feelings and cure him of this torment . The speech seemed to lack only a minor piece , a wedge of silver , a word of ruby , to make it whole , and he searched for it with all his strength . Then he felt her body on top of him . " Lie still , " she said . " Lie still . Nothing 's important except our love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that.  |p248Nothing  matters but this . " She kissed him on the lips . " This . " With the pressure of her body against his body , the pressure of her lips against his lips , a sudden blackness came , and he dropped into sleep as though the back of his mind had gone out.  |p249SING  ALL of his strength to do it and a little adrenaline besides , but trying to make it appear as effortless and dignified as possible because he thought she was watching him , he dragged a large piece of beached timber onto a shallow sand dune , dragged it to the edge of a small depression , and let it drop . He picked up the other end of the timber , swung it around so that it was parallel with the depression , and upwind of it , and lowered it toward the sand , slowly squatting with a straight back . Concentratingso much on form , he got one hand pinched under the timber . In a subdued panic ( he had to get it out of there and meanwhile not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he worked his fingers free and stood up . Actually , she was n't even watching him . She sat on a low boulder a few yards away , in her bikini , her long legs crossed at the ankles . They were the only people on the beach , as usual , and he was wearing street clothes and his leather jacket . It was still too cold for swimming . They should have gone somewhere anonymous and simple , like Niagara Falls or Baraboo , as he 'd suggested . The gesture of coming here would n't appease her grandparents in the least . It would only make them feel more manipulative and powerful . Or antagonize them more . He looked toward Manitou . How far out did her grandfather own ? Was the water his , too ? Was n't there a three-mile limit ? He 'd saidp250to Chris , " That beach is mine , rightly , so if anybody comes along you do n't like , run them off . " He kicked sand along the bottom edge of the timber . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulled up the biggest clumps of dune grass that were growing there , and tossed them off to one side . He moved his hand in sweeping arcs across the sand , smoothing it , and lay on his back . It worked . The strong northwesterly wind blowing in from the lake was all but silenced . That and the continuous sound of whitecaps breaking on the beach ( he could hardly hear them any more , either ) had made conversation with her an effort , and without conversation he 'd moved from anger to a point of cold detachment . With his interlocked hands resting on his stomach , he stared up at the bright blue cloudless sky and waited for her to come to him . Every few moments , like an afterimage to a dark thought that had crossed his mind , a gull would glide into sight high above  --  widespread wings motionless , alert head shifting from side to side , searching , searching  --  and then vanish . He waited five minutes and she never appeared . Angry and impatient , he lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into sight , she turned toward him as if he 'd caught her at something . " Ellen ! " She smiled and her mouth moved in an answer , but because of the distance between them and the wind , blowinginto her face , blowing her hair back over her bare shoulders , he could n't hear a word . He lay down again . After two more gulls passed overhead , and then the first streamers of a cloud , her face suddenly appeared in the expanse above him , startling in its hugeness . " So here 's where you were , " she said , and sank into the sand beside him in a cross-legged sitting position , facing the lake , almost in profile . " As if you did n't know . " " I did n't . I saw you moving some wood around , and thenp251you were gone . I did n't know where . Really . " She put her hand on his thigh . " I missed you . " " Sure . " " I did . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , " she said , and held out her hand . In the cup of her palm there was a flat , oval rock , slightly larger than a silver dollar . Its gray surface , polished by waves , divided by hairlike white lines into interlocking hexagons , was translucent , and he could see , inside each hexagon , a black nucleus with ivory striations radiating out from an opaque center . " See the symmetry , " she said . " It 's amazing . And the colors ! You would n't think anything so perfect could come in a natural state . It 's like a Miro . " He turned his head away . " It 's a Petoskey stone , " she said , her voice almost lost in the wind . " I found it along the waterline . " He watched a plump , wet-looking sow bug , harried by five or six ants , crawl ponderously toward the underside of the timber , but his attention was focused in the opposite direction , toward her . Sand trickled out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing his field of concentration . " I better go make dinner , " she said . " Sure , " he said . " You go make dinner . " The sow bug lost its footing and dropped onto the sand on its back . The ants hurried down the timber in single file and gathered around it , tentative , testing it with their antennae , backing back , advancing . " Do you want me to stay ? " she asked . " No . You go make dinner . " " If you want me to stay , I will . But when you 're like this there 's nothing I can do . " " Not any more . You 've already done it . " " You 're being unfair , " she said , but there was hesitancep252in her voice and she seemed ready to apologize for saying it . " How so ? It happened . " " It happened , true . But it 's over . " " I just remembered something . " He paused to give her a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You said that when you went to New York , the one thing you knew in spite of your confusion was that you loved me , right ? " " Yes . " " You said that that kept you alive there . " " It did . " " You just said that last night to shut me up . " " I did notl " " Shit , too . One of the first letters I got from New York started , Chris '  --  you did n't even bother to put in the Dear  --  Chris . " ' He cleared his throat in a falsetto . " ' There 's no denying the new freedom of spirit I feel , and I shall not allow myself to perpetrate the false conception , in my letters or in any of my emotions , that things between us are the same as they were . They are n't , and I know now they will never be . " ' The way he quoted from the letter , in a mincing voice meant to approximate hers , hinted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over and over , until it was branded into his mind . " Remember that ? " She nodded . " How do you explain that ? " She shrugged her shoulders . " Was it after your first lay ? " " Please . " " Then how do you explain it ? " " I ca n't take what I was feeling then and transfer it to now . " " But just last night you said that above everything else then you knew you loved me . That sure as hell is n't what you were saying in that letter , is it ? Is it ? " This time she did n't nod , and all the color in her face , as though everything in her was retreating , went.  | " And when I came out to see you , you would n't even let me touch you . You  --  " " I was still working things out . " " Is that why you asked me to leave an hour after I got there ? " " You were there almost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Christ , and you were so nasty about it I did . " " Swearing at me , saying you never  --  " " I felt bad about that , I felt I should apologize , and I came all the way in from the airport to do it and there you were carrying on a pleasant talk with a new friend . At three in the morning . " " I told you about him . I 'd just met him in the Square , and he stopped in purely by accident after you left . If you think  --  " " That 's not what I think ! I figure you have more taste than that . I mean that you threw me out and then invited him , a goddamn stranger , in for a talk . And you threw me out again , with him still there , and I had to walk around those goddamn little streets at three in the morning and find a cab back to the airport . That was lover ' " I was just beginning to find some peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even remember his name  --  he was too inconsequentialto affect it . But you could . And I needed peace before I could be sure I loved you . " " Last night you said you knew you loved me ! How does that fit ! " She pushed her hair back over her shoulder , and after a long silence said , " It does n't . " " You know what it looks like ? Like you went out there for kicks  --  try a few new ones in for size  --  and got bored with that and figured I might have enough money to keep you happy , so you figured , well , since I planned to marry him once , what the hell , I might as well do it before he shacks up with a better piece . " " I was pregnant ! "  | " Pregnant ? Who knows who from ? " " You do ! " " Hell . " " That 's one thing you have to believe . You have to . " He was alarmed by the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were a threat . " The year was torture , you know that . It was even worse than after the accident , but it had to be lived through . I got free of my grandparents . The confusion left . The only thing that stayed was your love . It was the only real thing I had . And have . " Her statement , and the dignity with which she made it , satisfied his vanity so much he could n't remember what he was trying to get to the bottom of . The anger went out of him and he felt closer to her . She pulled up a narrow blade of dune grass and sliced down the center of it with her thumbnail . Without moving her head , she reached over her shoulder and brushed at an insect on her back . The unguarded quality of these actions made him conscious of how near she was to being naked . That goddamned bikini . " But you did get your kicks , " he said , enraged . " It never occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then why did it ? " " At the time , you wanted me to go . You even saw me off . You were great about it . The first letter I got from you said , Seeing you leave with such a purpose , I do n't feel left alone . After I watched your bus leave , I circled the whole town on foot until late at night , the places we 'd walked , and was n't sad . " ' It shamed him to hear this hyperbolic lie quoted back to him word for word . " That was before I came to see you and was told to leave . It was also before you started putting it to  --  Oh , hell . " He was done . The more he talked , giving substance to grievances and fears that were before only shadows , the worse he felt . Most of his accusations could be directedp255against him , and that made him feel unjust , self-indulgent , and sick with himself . The air was taking on the disturbing quality  --  stuffy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on when he talked blindly , emotionally , without mercy or reason , until he felt himself emerge from the blindnessof the emotion as if from a disease , with a new sense of vision , seeing clearly but seeing no logic or purity in anything that had gone before or could possibly come after , and feeling too impotent and debased to care either way . " You never deceived me about your feelings , " she said . " What 's that ? " He remembered the girl on the bus and felt afraid . " You never deceived me about your feelings . You always said you loved me and wanted to marry me . If you did have any doubts , you kept them to yourself . I admired that . Maybe I felt that no matter what I did you 'd be waiting . " " And by Christ you did it ! " he shouted , blinded again . She lifted her face and looked out across the lake . " I suffered for it then and you 're making me suffer now . All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then why did you repeat it ? " She turned , her eyes large and imploring . " Why did you repeat it ? " he said . " There were two . I mean , there were two you told me about , so as far as I know you repeated it and repeated it and repeated it ! " " You think I 'm lying ? " " No , " he said , freeing himself from her eyes . He felt guilty for what he 'd kept from her . Also , he again sensed some dark thing in the background that might be impossible to cope with if it were brought into the light . " Because of my state of mind , " she said . " What ? " " It happened again because of my state of mind . " " What was that ? " " I felt I 'd lost you . I was in agony . " Prepared to treat this with irony , he looked up and saw ap256tear spill over her lower eyelash and , darkened with mascara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wanted to forget all of this and simply take her in his arms . Then he remembered the speech he 'd been working and reworking the night before . It seemed irrelevant after what had been said , but he decided to say it anyway . " I do n't want to think about that year or what happened during it . But it makes a barrier between us . " He paused . The speech no longer seemed coherent or moving , and he tried to recall the details that had made it so . " If there 's a barrier between us , it 's of your own making . I 've never felt it . " " It 's not that way at all ! " he said , angry at her for interrupting . " I said I do n't even want to think about it ! But it stays there , it 's in my mind , and when I think I 've forgot about it , there it is again ! It cuts me off from you . I have to strain my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then my feelings for you are crushed . Killed . They ca n't get past the barrier . Can you imagine how much more I could love you if it was n't there ? " Though he 'd told her the problem instead of the speech that was meant to resolve it , it had its effect . She was crying . Good Christ , maybe now he could drop the damn subject . " I have n't ever felt you 're distant ! " she cried . " But if you think about it that much in silence ! If it makes you feel the way you say it does ! If that 's how things are , how can we ever be happy ? " He stood up . Everything around him  --  the sun , the sand , the water , the air  --  looked extraordinarily bright . The wind was blowing as strongly as before . Its sound got between him and his thought and made his head ache . He looked at the timber . Some of the sand he 'd kicked along its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing under the timber , drifting the loose sand into low , narrow , barely perceptible streamers . The sow bug was gone . Under its own power ? Or had it been carried off ? It upset him notp257knowing what had happened to it , and the uncertainty made him feel anxious . He was n't sure what he had said to her or why he had said it . And what was it she had said ? Was it possible that now , at last , she was his wife ? The Petoskey stone was beside her , indenting the sand where she had dropped it . With her legs drawn up , her arms around her legs , and her head resting on her knees , she was crying , her ribs showing whitely through her tanned back each time she gasped for air . He knelt beside her and tried to take her in his arms . Mea culpa , mea culpa , mea maxima culpa revolved and revolved in his mind as though the sentence were linked at each end . He tried to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hair from her cheek . He stroked her hair . " Do n't , " he said . " Please . We can be happy . I 'm positive of that now . Do n't even think about it . We can be happy . " " I do n't know what to believe , " she said . " I do n't know what to believe any more ! " " Believe I love you . " " I do n't know whether to believe that ! " He looked out at the lake and saw what Anna meant about seeing it on a level ; it looked tipped up toward him . He felt as threatened as Anna must have felt , and wanted to run for high ground . Far out , an ore boat was moving toward the north . A gull was bobbing on a near wave . The maroon chair cushion had moved down the beach and was imbedded in sand a few yards away . Why did objects look so stark , sharply defined , dissociated from their surroundings , yet filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you loved ? " Let it go , El . Like you said , it 's over . " " But is it ? " " Yes . Really . Believe me . " " I want to . " " Do . " He kissed her forehead along the hairline , tasting salt ( how did tears get there ? ) , and embraced her with suchp258strength her chest could n't heave . She began to quiet , but his grip did n't relax , and now he felt he was holding her close for his own sake . He watched the ore boat , high at port and stern and with a long level central hull , like a barge with watchtowers at each end , move along the line of Manitou . He looked for the gull . It was gone . Then he suddenly drew back from her , and placed his hand on her shoulder in a different way . " Somebody 's coming , " he said . With the back of her forearm , she wiped away the last of her tears . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tousled by the wind , his feet bare and his pants legs rolled up , was walking down the beach in their direction , trailing a branch behind him . He stared at the rocks along the waterline as he walked , studious , self-absorbed , and when he came even with them he gave a glance in their direction , shy , doe-eyed , ingenuous , questioning , and then turned his eyes back to the water as if in embarrassment . In silence , they watched him go down the beach , leaving a wavering line in the sand with the branch , a reminder of his passing . He walked along the rocky part of the beach , growing smaller and smaller as they watched , and then went around the cove and disappeared . They turned and looked at one another , holding themselves silent to preserve what they felt , and then kissed . He stood up and took off his jacket and shirt . He sat down in the sand , pulled off his boots , pulled off his socks , stood and dropped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went running into the water , its chill making them cry out , and he dove into a wave and swam until he became accustomed to the cold , and then turned in her direction and treaded water . She dove under and surfaced close to him , her hair wet and flat against her skull . " It 's not so bad , " she said . " It 's not that bad . " He paddled up high and a wave crashed past him . " Not if you keep moving ! " he cried , exuberant from the cold . And then , as he stared at her while she treaded waterp259beside him , he had a sudden flash , like one of those pictures within a picture , of a miniature body treading water inside her . Oh yes . The child . " I have to go back , " she said . " Why ? It 's great . " " I should n't stay in too long . " " Why ? " " The coldness , I guess . It 's just something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the shore in an even , overhand crawl , and then stood in shallow water and started to walk toward the beach , taking quick side steps off sharp rocks , her knees giving as waves hit . He swam after her , still exuberant , feeling he 'd mastered the water , and ran up the beach beside her . She had the blanket wrapped around her and was shivering , her neck muscles twitching , jerking her head to one side . Her lips were blue . " I 'm freezing , " she said . " I 'm freezing now ! " " There 's a cure for that , " he said , and reached through the blanket and grabbed the top of her bikini and pulled it down , hooking his thumbs in the belt of the briefs as he reached them , pulling both pieces down around her ankles . She stepped out of the bra and briefs and he , on his knees , kissed her . " Is anybody coming ? " he asked . " No , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked up and down the deserted beach , and then removed the blanket . He took her in his arms and laid her on the hot sand and covered her with his body , feeling the hard nubs of her gooseflesh against his skin . " Now , " he said . " Now are you cold ? " " No . A little . No , not now . " He saw sand and dune grass and felt he could count the grains of sand below the curve of her shoulder and throat , each was so individually clear as they made love , and he realized she was seeing sky , the bright blue sky he 'd been staring at , and there was the feeling of freedom and open/ness , of sky , in her body , in its growing lightness of motion , and then all the space of sky came . They lay in silence , still linked , with the wind blowing over them . She kissed his shoulder . " I have a confession , " she said . " What ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sand ? " " Inside . " " Oh . It hurts ? " " Some . At first . I do n't mind . I love it . You put it there . "  |p261Mea  culpa , mea culpa . . . The wind had slackened . The air was dark . There was something at his back and a suffusion of warmth along his stomach . He had fallen asleep on top of her . Startled , he lifted his head and found her staring at him . " What is it ? " he asked . " I do n't feel alone . " " What 's that ? " " I 'm not alone any more . " She kissed him . They made love again , with renewed energy , and emerged from it in a changed mood , both of them cheerful , cleansed , laughing . They dressed . She packed her things into the beach bag , and he folded the blanket and draped it over his shoulder . The bronze channel on the lake was widening as the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We 'll have steak . " " Do we have steak ? " " I got it for you . " He put his arm around her waist , and they started toward the trail . " Oh , God , " he said , and stopped short . " What is it ? " " I must be losing my mind . I damn near forgot . " He trotted over to a leaning , weathered post , **31;10596;TOOLONG thought of pain and suffering as a principality , lying somewhere beyond the legitimate borders of western Europe . The government would be feudal and the country mountainous but it would never lie on his itinerary and would be unknown to his travel agent . Now and then he received postcards from this distant place . There would be a view of the statue of Aesculapius in the public gardens with some snowy mountains in the distanceand on the back of the card this message : " Edna is under sedation most of the time and has about three weeks to live but she would like a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying and mailed them off to that remote and quaint capital where the figures on the Rathaus Glockenspiel were crippled , where the statues in the park were the grotesques pain can extort from the imagination , where the palace had been converted into a hospital and rivers of blood foamed underp51the arched bridges . He was not meant to travel here and he was surprised and frightened to wake from a dream in which he had seen , out of a train window , that terrifying range of mountains . When Tony had been in bed for twelve days Nailles 's inexperience with grief was ended . He would not have gone so far as to say that fortune was dealt out like the peanuts at the end of a child 's birthday party , but he felt vaguely that one had one 's share of brute pleasure , hard work , money and love and that the rank inequities that he saw everywhere were mysteries that did not concern him . Lucky Nailles ! Now his son lay close to death . This did not come like a new fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was to learn the obsessiveness of suffering . When he woke in the morning his first thought was that he might hear Tony 's step on the stairs . Whatever occupied him  --  drink , play , work or money  --  was merely a distractionfrom the consuming image of his lost son , gripping a pillow . Having observed the obsessiveness of pain he went on to observe the gross jealousy of a man who feels that his luck has run out . Why , of all the young men in Bullet Park , should Tony have been singled out to suffer a mysterious and incurable disease ? It was not a question that he asked himself but a question forced onto him pitilessly by the world as it appeared to him from the first thing in the morning until dark . Cheerful and thoughtless laughter on the station platform merely made Nailles wonder angrily and bitterly why the sons of his friends were free to walk and run in the light whilep52his son lay imprisoned . Lunching with friends who spoke inevitably about the successes of their sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem physically alienated from the company . Seeing a young stranger run down the street he wanted to call after him : " Stop , stop , stop , stop . Tony was once as strong and swift as you . " Having been a patriot about his way of life he found himself involved in subversion , espionage and vengefulness . " Do you know anyone named Hammer , " Nellie asked one evening . Nailles explained that he had met the Hammersin church . " Well she called this afternoon , " Nellie said , " and asked us to dinner . I do n't approve of asking strangers to dinner but perhaps they come from some part of the world where this goes on . " " It does seem strange , does n't it , " Nailles said . " We just said hello on the porch . Perhaps they 're lonely . . . " He was not thinking of the Hammers ' probable aloneness but of his own . It was the image of Tony in bed that broke down his rigid sense of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was more suffering in life than he had been led to believe and might n't it be generous to overlook Mrs. Hammer 's importunity and accept her invitation . " If we 're not doing anything else why do n't we go , " he said . " It would be neighborly and we can leave early . " A few nights later then they drove up to Powder Hill . It was a starry night  --  Venus blazed like a light bulb , and going up the walk to the house Nailles bent and kissed his wife . Hammer let them in and introduced themp53to his wife and the other guests . Marietta Hammer seemed absentminded , unenthusiastic or perhaps drunk . One of Nailles 's great liabilities was an inability to judge people on their appearance . He thought all men and women honest , reliable , clean and happy and he was often surprised and disappointed . He could see at once that the optimistic estimate of the Hammers that he had made in church might have to be overhauled . There were three other couples  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be no maid . Hammer mixed the drinks in the pantry and Marietta excused herselfand went into the kitchen . " Have you known the Hammers for long , " Eliot asked the others . " I do n't really know them at all , " Mr. Taylor said . " I have the Ford agency in the village and when he came in to buy a car he asked me for dinner . I figure they 'll be a two-car family  --  everybody on Powder Hill is  --  so I 'm really here on business . " " I sold them their deep freeze , " said Mr. Phillips . " I sold them the house , " said Mr. Hazzard . " Is n't it a lovely house , " said Mrs. Hazzard . " The Heathcups lived here until he passed away . " " He was such a nice fellow , " said Mr. Hazzard . " I 've never understood why he did it . " " Let 's see , " Hammer said , coming in from the pantry . " Bourbon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you in , Mr. Hammer , " asked Mr. Hazzard.  | " I 'm president of Paul Hammer Associates , " Hammer said . " We do just about everything . " Marietta Hammer laughed . Her laughter was meant to discountenance her husband . It was a musical laugh  --  half an octave  --  but it was , Eliot thought , the kind of laughter one hears in women 's clubs , at bridge parties and in those restaurants that feature rich desserts . It had no power of sexual arousal as laughter often does . Her blond hair , her earrings and her dress were all long and she had a definite beauty  --  the kind of beauty you might see on a magazine cover , but it would be an old cover in a dentist 's anteroom , a little worn and dating from the year before last . She went into the pantry and helped herself to more whiskey . Taylor did not conceal the fact that he was there on business and during cocktails he spoke of the interesting discounts he could offer Hammer when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner , as things went in Bullet Park , was n't much . There was some kind of goulash or stew and Marietta picked at it with such obvious distaste that Eliot wondered if Hammer had n't cooked the meal . " Well I do n't suppose you 've been in Bullet Park long enough to form any judgments but we do hope you like the place . I 've always found it a very nice community . " " We 've only been here two weeks , " Hammer said . " If you want my opinion , " Marietta said , " I 'll be happy to give you one . I think it stinks . It 's just like a masqueradeparty . All you have to do is to get your clothes at Brooks , catch the train and show up in church once ap55week and no one will ever ask a question about your identity . " " Please darling , " Hammer said . " Not tonight . " " Oh what 's wrong with you , " she asked . " What are you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you sore because I bought this dress ? Is that your trouble ? Do you think I ought to buy my clothes at Macy 's or Alexander 's or someplace like that ? Do you think I ought to make my own clothes , for Christ 's sake . So it cost four hundred dollars but it looks good on me and I need something to wear . And I do n't have many clothes . Well I do n't have very many clothes . All right I do have a lot of clothes and I 've said something stupid and now you 're going to gloat over it . Oh Jesus , I wish you could see your face . You make me laugh . " " You can get nice couturier dresses at Ohrbach 's , " Mrs. Taylor said . " Not tonight , sweetheart , " Hammer said . " You 're a doormat , " she went on . " You 're a henpecked doormat and do n't try and blame me for it . You 're the kind of a man who thinks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wealthy , passionate and intelligentblonde will fall in love with you . Oh God , I can imagine the whole thing . It 's so disgusting . She 'll have long hair and long legs and be about twenty-eight , divorced , but without any children . I 'll bet she 's an actress or a night-club singer . That 's about the level of your imagination . What do you do with her , chump , what do you do with her besides tying on a can . What is a hen/pecked doormat up to . Do you take her to the theater ? Do you buy her jewelry ? Do you travel ? I 'll bet you travel . That 's your idea of a big thing . Ten days on the Raffaello , tying on a can morning , noon and night and drifting into the first-class bar at seven in your beautifullycut dinner jacket . What a distinguished couple ! What crap . But I guess it would be the France , someplacewhere you can show off your lousy French . I suppose you 'd drag her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old haunts . I feel sorry for her , I really do . But get this straight , chump , get this straight . If this blonde showed up you would n't have the guts to take her to bed . You 'd just moon around , kissing her behind pantry doors , and finally decide not to be unfaithful to me . That 's if a blonde showed up , but no blonde is going to show up . There is n't any such blonde . You 're going to be lonely for the rest of your life . You 're a lonely man and a lonely man is a lonesome thing , a stick , a stone , a bone , a doormat , an empty gin bottle ... " " I think we 'd better go , " said Mrs. Taylor . " Yes , " said the Phillipses , and there was a rush for the door . " Good night . " " Good night . " " Good night . " Lying in bed that night Nailles thought : Hammer and Nailles , spaghetti and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romeo and Juliet , block and tackle , thunder and lightning , bacon and eggs , corned beef and cabbage , hamp57and cheese , curb and snaffle , shoes and socks , line and sinker , true and false , sharp and flat , boots and spurs , snorkel and flipper , fish and chips , white tie and tails , bride and groom , dog and cat , sugar and cream , table and chair , pen and ink , stars and moon , ball and chain , tears and laughter , Mummy and Dad , war and peace , heaven and hell , good and evil , life and death , love and death , death and taxes . . . He slept and dreamed . He dreamed that they were in a small country church that they sometimes attended in the summer . The church was cruciform and had a threadbare green carpet . There was a sharp and depressing smell of ecclesiastical varnish . The occasion was a funeral and the coffin stood before the chancel but he could not remember whose soul it was they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover who was missing . Charlie Estabrooke ? But he was on the left with his wife . Bailey Barnes ? Bailey was on the right with his whole family . Alex Kneeland ? Eddie Clapp ? Jim Randolph ? Sam Farrar ? Dave Poor ? Rick Rhodes ? Jim Stesse ? And Roger Cromwell ? When he saw that the congregationwas intact he realized that the funeral must be his own.  |p58When  Tony had been in bed for seventeen days there was a spell of fine weather and Nailles woke one morning feeling wonderful . It was about six . The sun had not yet risen but the sky was brilliant . He shaved and bathed and bounded into Nellie 's side of the bed and taking her in his arms he thought she seemed a much younger woman than he knew her to be . They seemed in their loving and being loved to have put down the accumulationsof time , as if their baser qualities , like some stern presence , had gone off for an hour or so , leaving them free to sport and revel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw looked like a paradise . It was not , he knew . Septic drain fields lay under the grass and that flock of cardinals in the fir trees might have lice , but while the brilliance of their plumage and the clarity of their singing had nothing to do with peace on earth , love or bank deposits , it gave him such a feeling of exaltationp59he threw his arms apart as if he were going to embrace the landscape and the birds . " Oh I feel so wonderful , " he said . " Something seems to have happened while I slept . I feel as though I 'd been given something , some kind of a present . I feel that everything 's going to be the way it was when it was so wonderful . Tony will get up today or perhaps tomorrow and go back to school . I just know that everything 's going to be wonderful . " Nailles ate a big breakfast and then went up to Tony 's room . That neither he nor his wife nor his son had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it flew up to his nose , cutting and strange . The shades were drawn . Tony slept . He slept in his underpants and his shoulders were bare . His skin was a liverish color . His hair was mussed and had not been cut for a month . He embraced his pillowwith desperation . " Wake up , Tony , " Nailles said . " Wake up . It 's a marvelous , marvelous morning . Wake up and take a look . " He raised the shades and a brilliant light poured into the sickroom . " Look , Tony , see how bright everything is . Nobody can stay in bed on a day like this . It 's like a challenge , Tony . Everything 's ahead of you . Everything . You 'll go to college and get an interestingjob and get married and have children . Everything'sin front of you , Tony . Come to the window . " He took his son by the hand and drew him out of bed to the window and stood there with an arm around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all is . Does n't it make you feel better ? " Tony dropped to his knees on the floor . " Tomorrow , Daddy , " he sobbed . " Maybe tomorrow . "  |p60Nailles  felt , like some child on a hill , that purpose and order underlay the roofs , trees , river and streets that composed the landscape . There was some obvious purpose in his loving Nellie and the light of morning but what was the purpose , the message , the lesson to be learned from his stricken son ? Grief was for the others ; sorrow and pain were for the others ; some terrible mistake had been made . Tony was sobbing violently and then he spoke  --  he howled : " Give me back the mountains . " " What , Sonny , what did you say ? " " Give me back the mountains . " " What mountains , Sonny , " Nailles asked . " Do you mean the mountains that we used to climb ? The White Mountains . They 're not really white , are they ? Rememberhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fun , was n't it ? Are those the mountains you mean ? " " I do n't know , " Tony said . He got back into bed . " Well I have to go or I 'll miss the train , " Nailles said . " I 'll see you tonight . " Nailles , waiting that morning for the 7:56 , fended off any questions about his son 's health by saying that he had mononucleosis . He stood on the platform between Harry Shinglehouse and Hammer . Nailles and Hammer read the Times . Shinglehouse read the Wall Street Journal . Since the dinner party Nailles and Hammer had said good morning but not much more . They sometimes took the same train in the morning but Nailles had only oncep61seen his neighbor on the 6:32 home , when Hammer was asleep , either drunk or weary or both . He had a black dispatch case in his lap and was humped unconscious over this in a position that seemed desperate and abject . What is the pathos of men and women who fall asleep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poleaxed and lost ? They snore , they twist , they mutter names , they seem the victims of some terrible upheaval although they are merely going home to supper and to cut the grass . Nailles watched his neighbor and when he did not wake up at Bullet Park he shook his shoulder and said : " Time to get up . " " Oh thank you , " said Hammer . It had been their only conversation . This morning they nodded to one another and read their folded papers as down the tracks came the Chicago express , two hours behind schedule and going about ninety miles an hour . Nailles grabbed for his hat , folded his paper and shut his eyes because the noise and commotion of the express was like being in the vortex of some dirty wind tunnel . When the express had passed he opened his eyes and saw the train helling off into the distance , gaily waving a plume of steam like a pig 's tail . He had started to read the Times again when he noticed that Harry Shinglehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed his position but he was not on the platform . Looking back to the tracks he saw a highly polished brown loafer lying on the cinders . " My God , " he finally said . " That fellow . What 's his name . He was sucked under the train . " " Hmmmmm , " said Hammer , lowering his paper.  | " Shinglehouse . He 's gone . " " By Jesus , so he has , " said Hammer . " Shinglehouse , " Nailles shouted . " He 's dead . I mean he was killed . " " What 'll we do , " said Hammer . " I 'll call the police , " Nailles said . " I 'd better call the police . " There was a telephone booth at the end of the platform and he ran to this and got the police . " Patrolman Shea speaking , " said a voice . " Look , " Nailles said . " This is Eliot Nailles . I 'm at the station . The Chicago train just came through and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get it , " said the patrolman . Nailles had to repeathis story three times . The 7:56 came in and everyonebut Hammer and Nailles boarded it . A few minutes later they heard the siren and saw the lights of a police car . Two policemen ran out onto the platform . " He was standing right there , " Nailles said . " There 's his loafer . He was standing right there and the train came through and he was gone . " " Where 's the body ? " " I do n't know , " Nailles said . " Well I guess you two had better come back to the stationhouse with me for questioning . " " But we have to go to work , " Hammer said . " I have a meeting . " " So have I , " Nailles said , " and anyhow we do n't know anything about it . Why do n't you call the railroad po/lice ? " This was a shot in the dark but someone had to do something to make that moment continuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them picked the shoe off the tracks and they went back to the patrol car . Suddenly Hammer began to cry . " There , " Nailles said . " There . It 's all right . Was he a friend of yours ? " " No , " Hammer sobbed . " I did n't know the poor bas-tard . " " There , there , " Nailles said , putting an arm around Hammer . They were merely acquaintances but the casualtyhad thrust them into an intimate relationship . Hammer controlled his sobbing but Nailles kept an arm around his shoulders and this curious couple were seen by the passengers of the 8:11 . Nailles and Hammer rode into the city together , stunned by the mysteriousness of life and death . The evening paper carried the story . The vanished man had been unemployed and had left a wife and three children . He had once run for town council on the Republicanticket and had formerly been in advertising . Nailles wanted to call the widow but he could think of nothing to say . The next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express train that usually took him to his office . The local that he traveled on made twenty-two stops between Bullet Park and Grand Central Station . The dirty train windows and the overcast sky seemed to have eclipsed his spirits . He remembered Shinglehouse'sp64loafer . He felt peculiar . He read his Times but the news in the paper , with the exception of the sporting page , seemed to be news from another planet . A maniac with a carbine had massacred seventeen people in a park in Dallas , including an archbishop who had been walking his dog . The usual wars were raging . The Musicians ' Union , Airplane Pilots , Firemen , Circus Performers and Deckhandswere all threatening to strike . The White House secretary denied rumors of a fistfight between the President , the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense . Drought threatened the wheat crop . An unidentified flyingobject had been seen in Ohio . A hairdresser in Linden , New Jersey , had shot his wife , his four children , his poodle and himself . A three-day smog in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nailles felt uncheerful and tried the naive expedientof bolstering his spirits by assessing his good fortune . Had he been indicted for grand larceny ? No . Had he been murdered in a park ? No . Had he been trapped in a burning building , lost on a glacier , bitten by a rabid dog ? No . Then why was n't he more cheerful ? The train stopped at Tremont Point , Greenacres , Lascalles , Meadowvale and Clear Haven . The trip seemed intolerable , but why ? He had made it a thousand times . Why should this link between his home and his office seem torturous ? His breathing was heavy , his palms were wet , there was a quaking feeling in his gut and the dark rain seemed to beat upon his heart . When the train reached Longbrook , Nailles suddenly grabbed his rain/coat , pushed his way past the oncoming passengers and left the car . The train coasted on and he found himself alone in a suburban railway station at half past eight in the morning . Nailles 's sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rhythms of his world , and one of his principal bridges  --  that between his white house and his office  --  had collapsed . He stepped out of the rain into the waiting room . What he needed was guts but where could he find them ? He could not summonthem , that much was clear . Could he develop them in a gymnasium , win them in a lottery , buy them from a mail-order house or receive them as a heavenly dispensation ? There was another local in fifteen minutes and commuters had begun to gather for this . Nailles boarded it , trying to sell himself a specious brand of cheerfulness . He stayed on that local for two more stops and got off again . Station by station he made a cruel pilgrimage into the city . After dinner that night Nailles poured a strong whiskeyand took it up to Tony 's room . He sat in a chair besideTony 's bed as he had done so many times in the past when he used to read to the boy Treasure Island . " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Did you eat any supper ? " " Yes . " " There was a long thing in the paper on Sunday about how your generation thinks the world is terribly compro/mised . Do you think the world is terribly compromised ? " " No , I do n't think it 's compromised . " " You do n't think this has anything to do with your trouble ? " " I love the world . I just feel sad , that 's all . " " Well I suppose there 's plenty to be sad about if you look around , but it makes me sore to have people always chopping at the suburbs . I 've never understood why . When you go to the theater they 're always chopping at the suburbs but I ca n't see that playing golf and raising flowers is depraved . The living is cheaper out here and I 'd be lost if I could n't get some exercise . People seem to make some connection between respectability and moral purity that I do n't get . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that I claim to be pure in heart . That does n't follow . All kinds of scandalous things happen everywhere but just because they happen to people who have flower gardens does n't mean that flower gardens are wicked . For instance , Charlie Stringer was indicted last year for sending pornography through the mails . He claims to be some kind of a publisher and I guess dirty pictures is his business . He lives in one of those Tudor houses on Hansen Circle and he has a pretty wife and three children . Flower gardens . Trees . A couple of poodles . The critics would say : Look , look , look what a big facade he 's constructed to conceal the fact that he deals in obsceneness and corruption , but what 's the point ? Why should a man who deals in filth have to live in a cesspool ? He 's a bastard for sure but why should n't ap67bastard want to water his grass and play softball with the kids ? " We talk an awful lot about freedom and independence . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't guess you could avoid using words like freedom and independence . The President is always talking about freedom and independence , the army and navy are alwaysfighting to defend freedom and independence and on Sundays at church Father Ransome thanks God for our freedom and independence but you and I know that the blacks who live in those firetraps down along the river do n't have any freedom or independence in the choice of what they do and where they live . Charlie Simpson is really a great fellow but he and Phelps Marsdenand a half a dozen other prominent and wealthy men around here make their money in deals with Salazar , Franco , Union Miniere and all those military juntas . They talk about freedom and independence more than anybody else but they furnish the money and the armamentsand the technicians to crush freedom and independencewhenever it appears . I hate lying and I hate falsehoods and when you get a world that admits so many liars I suppose you 've got something to be sad about . I do n't , as a matter of fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . What I wear , what I eat , my sex life and a lot of my thinking is pretty well regimented but there are times when I like being told what to do . I ca n't figure out what 's right and wrong in every situation.  | " The newspapers are sometimes very confusing . They keep running photographs of soldiers dying in jungles and mudholes right beside an advertisement for a **27;10629;TOOLONG ring or a sable coat . It would be childish to say that the soldier died for emeralds and sables but there it is , day after day , the dying soldier and the emerald ring . And homosexuality . You read a lot about that these days and it bothers me . I wish it did n't exist . Before I joined the Chemists Club I used to have to pump ship in Grand Central and I almost never went into those choppers without getting into trouble . Once when I was going up the stairs this guy came along and took my arm . I had on a Brooks suit and a Locke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stuff on was to make my intentions clear . So I walked away from him . I did n't hit him . I did n't see his face . I 've never seen any of their faces . The only reason I joined the Chemists Club was so that I could have a place in midtown where I could pump ship without getting into a moral crisis . Of course I 'm not really a chemist and pushing mouthwash is n't a very inspiring life but when you think of the things we need you realize that someone has to make them . I mean razor blades and soap and bacon and eggs and gasolineand train tickets and shoes . Somebody has to make all that stuff . Tony ? Tony ? " Tony slept . Nailles finished his drink and looked lovingly at his mysterious son . Tony was born in Rome , where Nailles had worked as a chemist for FAOU . Nailles had taken Nellie to the international hospital across the river late one afternoon . The doctor was a very fat man . He timedp69Nellie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half past ten . When Nailles returned he was taken into an office to have his blood typed . There was no explanation . Later a friend appeared with a bottle of scotch and a package of American cigarettes , both of which were difficult to get at the time . The nuns seemed to have no objection to their drinking ; in fact they brought them glasses and ice . Nailles 's friend left at midnight . The doctor came in at three . He was sweating and seemed worried . " Is she in danger , " Nailles asked . " Yes , " the doctor said harshly , " she is in danger . Life is dangerous . Why do Americans want to be immortal ? " " Please tell me , " Nailles said . " I will tell you that when this is over I would advise her not to have any more children . " There were some peacocks in a park across the street . They began to shriek as the sun rose . This sounded to Nailles portentous . The doctor came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said to Nailles . " Divert yourself . Breathe some fresh air . " Nailles walked down the hill to St. Peter 's and said his prayers . Then he climbed the stairs to the roof where all the gigantic saints and apostles stood with their backs to him . He had liked the city of Rome . Now it seemed sinister ; the city of the wolf . Rome would kill Nellie . The bloody history of the place seemed to have some bearing on her life . Rome would murder Nellie . He walked across the city on foot , trying to sweat out his pain . In some back street he encountered an old man selling phallic symbols and death 's heads . He walked top70the zoo and had a Campari at the cafe . Beside the cafe was a cage of carnivorous birds , tearing at raw meat . Leaving the cafe he saw a hyena ; then a cage of wolves . When he got back to the hospital a nun told him that he had an eight-pound son and that his wife was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the waiting room . He saw Nellie and his son that night and Tony seemed to him then to be brilliant , impetuousand strong . Much later they had discussed the possibility of adopting a brother or sister for Tony , but a foundlingwould have challenged Tony 's sovereignty and this was something they did not want . He had no way of judging his worth as a father . They had quarreled . When Tony was nine . He had suddenly given up all his athletics and friendships and settled down in front of the television set . The night of the quarrel was rainy . Nailles came into the house by the kitchen door . Nellie was cooking . Nailles kissed her on the back of the neck and raised her skirts but she demurred . " Please darling , " she said . " It makes me feel as if I were in a burlesque skit . Tony 's report card is on the table . You might want to take a look at it . " Nailles mixed a drink and read the report . The marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the dining room , crossed the dark hall to the living room where Tony was watching a show . The tube was the only light , shifting and submarine , and with the noise of the rain outside the room seemed like some cavern in the sea . " Do you have any homework , " Nailles asked . " A little , " Tony said.  | " Well I think you 'd better do it before you watch television , " Nailles said . On the tube some cartoon figures were dancing a jig . " I 'll just watch to the end of this show , " Tony said . " Then I 'll do my homework . " " I think you 'd better do your homework now , " Nailles said . " But Mummy said I could see this show , " Tony said . " How long has it been , " said Nailles , " that you 've asked permission to watch television ? " He knew that in dealing with his son sarcasm would only multiply their misunderstandings but he was tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home at half past three , pull your chair up in front of the set and watch until supper . After supper you settle down in front of that damned engine and stay there until nine . If you do n't do your homework how can you expect to get passingmarks in school ? " " I learn a lot of things on television , " Tony said shyly . " I learn about geography and animals and the stars . " " What are you learning now ? " Nailles asked . The cartoon figures were having a tug of war . A large bird cut the rope with his beak and all the figures fell down . " This is different , " Tony said . " This is n't educational . Some of it is . " " Oh leave him alone , Eliot , leave him alone , " Nellie called from the kitchen . Her voice was soft and clear . Nailles wandered back into the kitchen . " But do n't you think , " he asked , " that from half pastp72three to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to spend in front of a television set ? " " It is a lot of time , " Nellie said , " but it 's terribly important to him right now and I think he 'll grow out of it . " " I know it 's terribly important , " Nailles said . " I realize that . When I took him Christmas shopping he was n't interested in anything but getting back to the set . He did n't care about buying presents for you or his cousins or his aunts and uncles . All he wanted to do was to get back to the set . He was just like an addict . I mean he had withdrawalsymptoms . It was just like me at cocktail hour but I 'm thirty-four years old and I try to ration my liquor and my cigarettes . " " He is n't quite old enough to start rationing things , " Nellie said . " He wo n't go coasting , he wo n't play ball , he wo n't do his homework , he wo n't even take a walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he 'll grow out of it , " Nellie said . " But you do n't grow out of an addiction . You have to make some exertion or have someone make an exertion for you . You just do n't outgrow serious addictions . " He went back across the dark hall with its shifty submarinelights and outside the noise of rain . On the tube a man with a lisp , dressed in a clown suit , was urging his friends to have Mummy buy them a streamlined , batteryoperateddoll carriage . He turned on a light and saw how absorbed his son was in the lisping clown . " Now I 've been talking with your mother , " he said , " and we 've decided that we have to do something aboutp73your television time . " ( The clown was replaced by the cartoon of an elephant and a tiger dancing the waltz . ) " I think an hour a day is plenty and I 'll leave it up to you to decide which hour you want . " Tony had been threatened before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . At the thought of how barren , painful and meaningless the hours after school would be the boy began to cry . " Now crying is n't going to do any good , " Nailles said . The elephant and the tiger were joined by some other animals in their waltz . " Skip it , " Tony said . " It is n't your business . " " You 're my son , " Nailles said , " and it 's my business to see you do at least what 's expected of you . You were tutored last summer in order to get promoted and if your marks do n't improve you wo n't be promoted this year . Do n't you think it 's my business to see that you get promoted ? If you had your way you would n't even go to school . You 'd wake up in the morning , turn on the set and watch it until bedtime . " " Oh please skip it , please leave me alone , " Tony said . He turned off the set , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You come back here , Sonny , " Nailles shouted . " You come back here at once or I 'll come and get you . " " Oh please do n't roar at him , " Nellie asked , coming out of the kitchen . " I 'm cooking veal birds and they smell nice and I was feeling good and happy that you 'd come home and now everything is beginning to seem awful . " " I was feeling good too , " Nailles said , " but we have ap74problem here and we ca n't evade it just because the veal birds smell good . " He went to the foot of the stairs and shouted : " You come down here , Sonny , you come down here this instant or you wo n't have any television for a month . Do you hear me ? You come down here at once or you wo n't have any television for a month . " The boy came slowly down the stairs . " Now you come here and sit down , " Nailles said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've said that you can have an hour each day and all you have to do is to tell me which hour you want . " " I do n't know , " Tony said . " I like the four-o'clock show and the six-o'clock show and the seven-o'clock show ... " " You mean you ca n't confine yourself to an hour , is that it ? " " I do n't know , " Tony said . " I guess you 'd better make me a drink , " Nellie said . " Scotch and soda . " Nailles made a drink and returned to Tony . " Well if you ca n't decide , " Nailles said , " I 'm going to decide for you . First I 'm going to make sure that you do your homeworkbefore you turn on the set . " " I do n't get home until half past three , " Tony said , " and sometimes the bus is late and if I do my homework I 'll miss the four-o'clock show . " " That 's just too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . " " Oh leave him alone , " Nellie said . " Please leave him alone . He 's had enough for tonight . " " It is n't tonight we 're talking about , it 's every singlep75night in the year including Saturdays , Sundays and holidays . Since no one around here seems able to reach any sort of agreement I 'm going to make a decision myself . I 'm going to throw that damned thing out the back door . " " Oh no , Daddy , no , " Tony cried . " Please do n't do that . Please , please , please . I 'll try . I 'll try to do better . " " You 've been trying for months without any success , " Nailles said . " You keep saying that you 'll try to cut down and all you do is to watch more and more . Your intentionsmay have been good but there have n't been any noticeable results . Out it goes . " " Oh please do n't , Eliot , " Nellie cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ca n't you see that he loves it ? " " I know that he loves it , " Nailles said . " That 's why I 'm going to throw it out the door . I love my gin and I love my cigarettes but this is the fourteenth cigarette I 've had today and this is only my fourth drink . If I sat down to drink at half past three and drank steadily until nine I 'd expect someone to give me some help . " He unplugged the television set with a yank and picked the box up in his arms . The box was heavy for his strength , and an awkward size , and in order to carry it he had to arch his back a little like a pregnant woman . With the cord trailingbehind him he started for the kitchen door . " Oh , Daddy , Daddy , " Tony cried . " Do n't , do n't , do n't , " and he fell to his knees with his hands joined in a conventional , supplicatory position that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Eliot , Eliot , " Nellie screamed . " Do n't , do n't . You 'll be sorry , Eliot . You 'll be sorry . " Tony ran to his mother and she took him in her arms . They were both crying . " I 'm not doing this because I want to , " Nailles shouted . " After all I like watching football and baseball when I 'm home and I paid for the damned thing . I 'm not doing this because I want to . I 'm doing this because I have to . " " Do n't look , do n't look , " Nellie said to Tony and she pressed his face into her skirts . The back door was shut and Nailles had to put the box on the floor to open this . The rain sounded loudly in the yard . Then , straining , he picked up the box again , kicked open the screen door and fired the television out into the dark . It landed on a cement paving and broke with the rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the stairs to her bedroom , where she threw herselfonto the bed , sobbing . Tony joined her . Nailles closed the kitchen door on the noise of the rain and poured another drink . Fifth , he said . All of this was eight years ago.  |p77Tony  had gone out for football and had made the secondsquad in his junior year . He had never been a good student  --  he got mostly C 's  --  but in French his marks were so low they were scarcely worth recording . One afternoon when he was about to join the squad for practice it was announced over the squawk box that he should report to the principal . He was not afraid of the principal but he was disturbed at the thought of missing any of the routines of football practice . When he stepped into the outer office a secretary asked him to sit down . " But I 'm late , " Tony said , " I 'm late for practice al-ready . " " He 's busy , " the secretary said . " Could n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tomorrow ? " " You 'd be late for practice tomorrow . " " Could n't I see him during class time ? "  | " No . " Tony glanced at the office . In spite of the stubborn and obdurate facts of learning , the place had for him a galling sense of unreality . A case of athletic trophies stood against one wall but this seemed to be the only note of permanence . Presently he was let into the principal 's office and given a chair . " You 've failed first-year French twice , Tony , " the principalsaid , " and it looks as if you 're going to fail it again . Your parents expect you to go on to college and you know you have to have a modern-language credit . Your intelligence quotient is very high and neither Miss Hoe nor I can understand why you fail . " " It 's just that I ca n't say French , sir , " Tony said . " I just ca n't say any French . My father ca n't either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The principal switched on the squawk box and said into it : " Could you see Tony now , Miss Hoe ? " Her affirmative came through loud and clear . " Certainly . " " You go down and see Miss Hoe now , " said the principal . " Could n't I see her after class tomorrow , sir ? I 'm missingfootball practice . " " I think Miss Hoe will have something to say about that . She 's waiting . " Miss Hoe was waiting in a room whose bright lights and pure colors did nothing to cheer him . It would soon be getting dark on the playing field and he had already missed passing and tackle . Miss Hoe sat before a large poster showing the walls of Carcassonne . It was the onlyp79traditional surface in the room . The brilliant , fluorescent lights in the ceiling made the place seem to be a cavern of incandescence , authoritative in its independence from the gathering dark of an autumn afternoon ; and the power to light the room came from another county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen . The chairs and desks were made of brightly colored plastic . The floor was waxed Vinylite . " Sit down , Tony , " she said . " Please sit down . It 's time that we had a little talk . " She might have been a pretty woman  --  small-featured and slender  --  but her skin was sallow and in the brightnessof the light one saw that she had a few chinwhiskers . Her waist was very slender and she seemed to take some pride in this . She always wore belts , cinctures , chains or ribbons around her middle and she sometimes wore a girlish ribbon in her brown hair . Her mouth , consideringthe strenuous exercise it got in French vowels , was very small . She wore no perfume and exhaled the faint unfreshness of humanity at the end of the day . She lived alone , of course , but we will grant her enough privacy not to pry into the clinical facts of her virginity or to catalogue the furniture , souvenirs , etc. with which her one-room apartment was stuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the legitimateanxieties of her condition . There were four locks on the door to her apartment and she carried a vial of ammoniain her handbag to throw into the eyes of assailants . She had read somewhere that anxiety was a mani/festation of sexual guilt and she could see , sensibly , that her aloneness and her virginity would expose her to guilt and repression . However , the burden of guilt must , she felt , be somewise divided between her destiny and the news in the evening paper . It was not her guilt that had caused the increase in sexual brutality . She had come to feel that some disorganized conspiracy of psychopaths was developing . Weekly , sometimes daily , women who resembled her were debauched , mutilated and strangled . Alone in the dark she was always afraid . Since she frequentlydreamed that she was being debauched by some brute in a gutter she had to include guilt along with terror . " When were you born , Tony , " she asked . " May twenty-seventh . " " Oh , I knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're Gemini . " " What 's that ? " " Gemini is the constellation under which you were born . Gemini determines many of your characteristics and one might say your fate ; but Gemini men are invariablygood linguists . The fact that you are Gemini proves to me that you can do your work and do it brilliantly . You ca n't dispute your stars , can you ? " He looked past her through the window to the playing field . There was still enough light in the air , enough color in the trees to compete with the incandescence of their cavern ; but in another ten minutes there would be nothing to see in the window but a reflection of Miss Hoe and himself . He knew nothing about astrology beyond the fact that he thought it to be a sanctuary for fools . Hep81supposed that she might have read in the stars ( and he was right ) that it was her manifest destiny to be unloved , unmarried , childless and lonely . She sighed and he was suddenly conscious of her breathing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meager front . It seemed intimate  --  sexual  --  as if they lay in one another 's arms , and he moved his chair back suddenly , scraping the legs on the Vinylite . The noise restored him . " I 've talked this over with Mr. Northrup , Tony , and we 've reached a decision . Since you seem unable to manageyour own time with any efficiency we are going to give you a little assistance . We are going to ask you to give up football . " He had not anticipated this staggering injustice . He would not cry but there was a definite disturbance in his eyeducts . She did n't know what she was saying . She knew , poor woman , much less about football than he knew about French . He loved football , loved the maneuvers , the grass work , the fatigue , and loved the ball itself  --  its shape , color , odor and the way it spiraled into the angle of his elbow and ribcage . He loved the time of year , the bus trips to other schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more naturally to him than anything else at his time of life and how could they take this naturalness away from him and fill up the breach with French verbs ? " You do n't know what you 're saying , Miss Hoe . " " I 'm afraid I do , Tony . I 've not only talked with Mr. Northrup . I 've talked with Coach . " " With Coach ? "  | " Yes , with Coach . Coach thinks it will be better for you , better for our school , better perhaps for our football team if you spent more time at your studies . " " Coach said this ? " " Coach said that you were enthusiastic but he does n't think that in any way you 're indispensable . He thinks perhaps that you 're wasting your time . " He stood . " You know what , Miss Hoe ? " he asked . " What , Tony , " she said . " What , dear ? " " You know I could kill you , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She stood , hurling her chair against the walls of Carcassonne , and began to scream . Her screaming brought Mr. Graham , the Latin teacher , and Mr. Clark ( science ) running . She stood at her desk , her arm outflung , pointingat Tony . " He tried to kill me , " she screamed . " He threatened to kill me . " " There , there , Mildred , " said Mr. Graham . " There , there . " " I want a policeman , " she screamed . " Call the police . " Mr. Clark called the office through the squawk box and asked for the secretary to call the police . Mr. Clark picked up Miss Hoe 's chair and she sat in it , trembling and breathing heavily but sternly as if she were about to upbraid an unruly class . Tony simply stared at his hands . Then in the distance they heard the sound of a police siren that seemed , excited and grieving , not to come from the autumn twilight but from some television drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outp83nothing so simple as poor French marks and a mistaken threat . Tony was Miss Hoe 's long-lost brother who had just returned from his travels with the news that their beautiful mother was a well-known communist spy . The science teacher would have been Miss Hoe 's husband  --  a dreary failure whose business misadventures and drinkingbouts had brought her to the brink of a nervous breakdown  --  and Mr. Clark came from the FBI . Thus , juxtaposed for a moment by the sound of the siren , they seemed about to have their dilemma interrupted by an advertisement for painkillers or detergents , until the policecame in , asking , " What 's up , what 's going on here ? " Vandalism had been their guess , although it was the wrong time of day  --  but vandalism was the usual complaint . Why did kids want to rip the lids off desks and break windows . Miss Hoe raised her head . Her poor face , shining with tears , was ugly . " He tried to kill me , " she said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Clark . " Now Mildred . " " Do n't I have any protection at all , " she cried angrily . " Are you all going to stand around and defend this murdereruntil I 'm found some night with a broken neck ? How do you know he does n't have a knife . Has anyone searched him ? Has anyone even asked him a question ? " " You got a knife , Sonny , " one of the police asked . " No , " said Tony . " You try to kill this lady ? " " No , sir , " said Tony . " You try to kill this lady ? "  | " No , sir . I got angry at her and said that I 'd like to but I did n't touch her . I would n't ever touch her . " " I want something done about this , " Miss Hoe said . " I am entitled to some protection . " " You want to file charges against him lady ? Felonious assault , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All right . I 'll take him down to the station and book him . Come on , Sonny . " The corridor was crowded by this time with teachers , secretaries and janitors , none of whom knew what had happened and all of whom were asking one another what it was . Tony and the police had gotten to the end of the corridor and were about to turn out of sight when Miss Hoe cried : " Officer , Officer . " It was a frightened voice and they turned quickly . " Could you take me home , will you drive me home ? " " Where do you live ? " " Warwick Gardens . " " Sure . " " I 'll just be a minute . " She got her coat , turned off the lights and locked the door to her classroom . She came swiftly down the hall , through the crowd , to where they waited . She got into the back seat of the car and Tony sat in front between the two police . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Hoe said . " I do appreciate it , but I 'm terribly afraid of the dark . When I go into the cafetorium for my lunch the first thing I think of is that it will get dark in four hours . Oh , I wish it would never get dark  --  never . Ip85suppose you know all about that lady who was mistreatedand strangled on Maple Street last month . She was my age and we had the same first name . We had the same horoscope and they never found the murderer ... " One of the police walked her to the door of the WarwickGardens and then they drove to the police station in the center of town . Tony explained that his mother was in the city but that his father usually came out on the 6:32 . " Well , the judge wo n't be here until eight or later , " one of the police said , " and we ca n't book you without the judge but you do n't look very desperate to me and I 'll remand you in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lady seemed a little hysterical . . . " It was , of course , the first time Tony had been in the police station . It was a new building , not in any way shabby , but definitely grim . Fluorescent tubing shed a soulful , grainy and searching light and an extraordinarily harsh and unnatural voice was coming from a radio . " Five foot eight , " said the voice . " Blue eyes . Crooked teeth . A scar on the right side of the jaw . A birthmark at the back of the neck . Weight one hundred and sixty pounds . Wanted for murder ... " They took down Tony 's name and address and invited him to sit down . The only other civilian in the place was a shabbily dressed man who wore a stained , white silk scarf around his neck . His clothing was greasy and threadbare , his hands were black but the white silk scarf seemed like a declaration of self-esteem . " How long do I have to stay here , " he asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in. "  | " What did I do wrong ? " " Vagrancy . " " I hitched a ride on Twenty-seven , " the vagrant said . " I asked this guy to stop the car so I could take a piss and as soon as I got out of the car he drove away . Why would he do a thing like that ? " The lieutenant coughed . " Well you do n't have long for this world , " the vagrant said . " You do n't have long for this world with a cough like that . Ha . Ha . A doctor told me that twenty-eight years ago and you know where the doctor is now ? Six feet under . Pushing up daisies . He died a year later . The secretof keeping young is to read children 's books . You read the books they write for little children and you 'll keep young . You read novels , philosophy , stuff like that and it makes you feel old . You fish in the river ? " " Some , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could . The vagrant offended his nose , his sight and his sense of the fitness of things , not because of his manifest eccentricity but because he had heard the story so many times . They were all alike , the roadside vagrants , they suffered a sameness greater than the intellectual and sumptuary sameness of the businessmenwho rode the 6:32 . They all had theories , travels , diets , colorful pasts , studied conversational openings , and they usually wore some piece of soiled finery like the white silk scarf . " Well , I hope you do n't eat the fish , " the vagrant said . " That river 's nothing but an open toilet . All the shit from New York City comes up the river twice a day on thep87tides . You would n't eat the fish you found in a toilet , would you ? Would you ? " Then he turned to Tony and asked : " What you here for , Sonny . " " Do n't tell him , " said the lieutenant . " He 's not here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I be friendly , " the vagrant asked . " Perhaps if we had a little conversation we might discover that we have some interests in common . For instance I 've made a study of the customs and history of the Cherokee Indians and a great many people find this interesting . I. once lived with them on a reservation in Oklahoma for three months . I wore their clothes , observed their customs and ate their food . They eat dogs , you know . Dogs are their favorite food . They boil them mostly although sometimes they roast them . They . . . " " Shut up , " said the lieutenant . At quarter to seven they called Nailles , who answeredand said that he would be right over . When he strode into the station and found his son there his first impulse was to embrace the young man but he restrained himself . " You can take him home , " the lieutenant said . " I do n't think anything much will come of this . He 'll tell you what happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tony told his father what had happened as they drove home . Nailles had no counsel , advice , censure , experienceor any other paternal qualities to bring to that crazy hour . He understood the boy 's deep feelings about beingp88dropped from the squad and he seemed to have shared in his son 's felonious threatening of Miss Hoe . A little wind was blowing and as they drove , leaves of all colors  --  but mostly yellow  --  blew through the shaft of their headlightsand what he said was : " I love to see leaves blowing through the headlights . I do n't know why . I mean they 're just dead leaves , no good for anything , but I love to see them blowing through the light . "  |p89It  was an autumn afternoon . Saturday . Below the house , near the grove of dead elms , there was a swamp where a flock of red-winged blackbirds nested each spring . According to the law of their species they should have turned south in the autumn but the number of bird-feeding appliances in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instincts and they now spent the autumn and winter in Bullet Park in utter confusion . Their song  --  two ascendingnotes and a harsh trill like a cicada  --  was inalienably associated with the first long nights of summer but now one heard it in the autumn , one heard it in the snow . To hear this summery music on one of the last clement days of the year was like some operatic reprise where the heroine , condemned to death , hears in her dark cell ( Orrido Carcere ) the lilting love music that was first sung at the beginning of Act II . The wind that day was west/erly and after lunch one heard the thump-thump-thump of a base drum from the football field where the band was warming up for a home game . Tony , after having been dropped from the squad , did not , of course , spend his spare time studying irregular verbs . Instead he read poetry as if he shared , with the poets , the mysterious and painful experience of being forced into the role of a bystander . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so obtuse as to protest but he was uneasy . He might say that poetry was one of the most exalted of the arts but he could not cure himself of the conviction that poetry was the demesne of homely women and morbidly sensitive men . As soon as Tony heard the bass drum that afternoon he went upstairs and lay down on his bed . Nailles was worriedand called up the stairs : " Tony , hey Tony , let 's do something , shall we ? Let 's go for a ride or something . " " No thank you , Daddy , " Tony said . " What I think I 'll do is to go into New York if you do n't mind . I 'll go to a movie or maybe see the basketball game . " " That 's fine , " Nailles said . " I 'll drive you to the train . " At three the next morning Nailles woke . He got out of bed and started down the hall towards Tony 's room . He felt very old , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong man  --  snow-covered mountains and beautiful women  --  in exchange for the anxieties of some decrepit octogenarian who feared that he had lost his false teeth . He felt frail , wizened , a shade of himself . Tony 's bed was empty . " Oh , my God , " he said loudly.  | " Oh , my God . " His only and dearly beloved son had been set upon by thieves , perverts , prostitutes , murderers and dope addicts . He was , in fact , not so much afraid of the pain his son might know as of the fact that should his son endure any uncommon pain he , Nailles , would have no resources to protect him from the terror of seeing his beloved world  --  his kingdom  --  destroyed . Without his son he could not live . He was afraid of his own death . He went back down the hall , closed the door to the room where Nellie slept and went downstairs , where he telephoned the New York City bureau of missing persons . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had no record of anyone like Tony . He gave them his number and asked them to call if there was any news . He drank half a glass of whiskey and then walked around the living room saying , " Oh , God , oh , God , oh , God . " Then he went upstairs , took a Nembutal , got into bed and lost consciousness a few minutes later . Nailles woke at half past seven and went back to Tony 's room , which was empty . He then woke Nellie and told her the boy was missing . He telephoned the missing persons bureau but there was still no answer and when he telephoned the police they had no news . The next train from New York was the 8:10 and having absolutely nothing else to go on he settled for a kind of specious , single-minded hopefulness . Tony would be on that train . He felt that if he hoped strenuously enough for the boy 's return the boy would appear . He drove to the station and when the train came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women who travel on Sunday mornings and who invariably carry paper bags . Nailles embraced his son , embraced him until his bones cracked , and asked : " Oh my God , why did n't you telephone , why did n't you tell us . " " It was too late , Daddy . I did n't want to wake you up " " What happened ? " " Well , I was feeling blue about football and I thought I 'd buy a book of poetry so I went into a bookstore and there was this nice lady  --  Mrs. Hubbard  --  and we talked and then I asked her if she 'd have dinner with me and she said why did n't I come to her apartment  --  she called it her flat  --  and she 'd cook me dinner and so I did . " " Did you spend the night with her ? " " Yes . " Nailles knew that his son was a mature male and he had no reason to protest that the boy had acted as one ; but what sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bookstore and hustle him home to bed ? " Was she a slut ? " " Oh , no , Daddy , she 's very nice . She 's a widow . She graduated from Smith . Her husband was killed in the war . " This irritated Nailles . She had given her husband to her country and thus he must give his son to her . He somehow thought it the responsibility of war widows to remarry hastily and not to parade their forlornness throughout society , stressing the inequities of warfare . Ifp93she was attractive , intelligent and clean why had n't she remarried ? " Well , we ca n't tell your mother . It would kill her . We 'll have to make up some story . You went to a basketballgame and it went overtime and you spent the night at the Crutchmans ' . " " But I 've asked her to lunch . " " Who . " " Mrs. Hubbard . " " Oh , my God , " said Nailles . " Why did you do that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have many friends and you 've always told me that I should ask people to the house . " " All right , " Nailles said . " This is our story . You went into a bookstore and you met a lonely war widow and you asked her to lunch . Then you got some dinner somewhere and you went to a basketball game and you spent the night at the Crutchmans ' . Right ? " " I 'll try . " " You 'd damned well better . " Nellie embraced her son tenderly . He said that he had invited a widow for lunch and Nailles explained that Tony had spent the night at the Crutchmans ' . The boy might possibly dissemble but he was incapable , Nailles knew , of a forthright lie . " How are the Crutchmans , " Nellie asked . " I have n't seen them for so long . Do they have a nice guest room ? They 've always urged us to use it but I always like to come home . I suppose we ought to send them something.  |p94Do  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could write them a note . " " Oh , do n't bother , " Nailles said . " I 'll send them some-thing . " After breakfast Nailles asked Tony if he wanted to cut wood but the boy said he thought he 'd do his homework . The word " homework " touched Nailles  --  it seemed to mean innocence , youth , purity , simple things  --  all lost in the bed of a sluttish war widow . He felt sad . He cut wood until it was time to bathe and dress and then he made a drink . Nellie was cooking a leg of lamb and this humble and innocent smell filled the kitchen . He looked at Nellie for some trace of suspiciousness , reflection or misgiving but she seemed so unwary , so truly innocent that he went to the stove and kissed her . Then he went to the living room window and waited . Tony parked the car in the driveway and opened the door for Mrs. Hubbard , who got out laughing . She wore a gray Chesterfield with a velvet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broad arc , striking the ground like a walking stick . Her right arm was hooked rakishly in Tony 's and she seemed propelled forward partly by Tony , partly by the umbrella . She was shorter than he and looked up into the young man 's face with a flirtatiousness that angered Nailles . She wore no hat and her hair was a nondescript reddish color , obviously dyed . Nailles , at a glance , put her age at thirty . Her heels were very high and this made the calves of her legs bulge a little . Her face was round and flushed and Nailles won/dered . Indigestion ? Alcohol ? He opened the door and welcomed her politely and she said : " It 's simply heavenly of you to take pity on a poor widow . " " We 're delighted to have you , " said Nailles . Tony took her coat . " How do you do , " said Nellie . " Wo n't you please come in . " She was in the living room to the right of the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took in presentingher house , her table , to someone who was lonely shone in her face . " What a divine house , " said Mrs. Hubbard , keeping her eyes on the rug . Nailles guessed that she needed glasses . " Can I get you a Manhattan , " Nailles asked . " We usually drink Manhattans on Sunday . " " Any sort of drinkee would be divine , " said Mrs. Hubbard , and Nailles made for the pantry . Tony asked if he could help and Nailles thought that he could help by throwing her out the door but he said nothing . " Did you find the train trip boring , " Nellie asked . " Not really , " said Mrs. Hubbard . " I had the great good luck to find an interesting traveling companion  --  a young man who seems to have some real-estate interests out here . I ca n't remember his name . I think it was Italian . He had the blackest eyes . . . Hmm , " she said of a novel on the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Nellie said . " I mean if you know the sort of people he describes you can see how distorted his mind is . Most of our set are happily marriedp96and lead simple lives . I much prefer the works of Camus . " Nellie pronounced this Cam00000 . " We have a very active book club and at present we 're studying the works of Camus . " " What Camus are you studying ? " " Oh , I ca n't remember all the titles , " Nellie said . " We 're studying all of Camus . " It was to Mrs. Hubbard 's credit that she did not pursue the subject . Tony got her an ashtray and Nailles looked narrowly at his beloved son and this stray . His manner towards her was manly and gentle . He did n't at any point touch her but he looked at her in a way that was proprietoryand intimate . He seemed contented . Nailles did not understand how , having debauched this youth , she had found the brass to confront his parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immoral ? But his strongest and strangest feeling , observing the boy 's air of mastery , was one of having been deposed , as if , in some ancient legend where men wore crowns and lived in round towers , the bastard prince , the usurper , was about to seize the throne . The sexual authority that Nailles imagined as springing from his marriage bed and flowing through all the rooms and halls of the house was challenged . There did not seem to be room for two men in this erotic kingdom . His feeling was not of a contest but of an inevitability . He wanted to take Nellie upstairs and prove to himself , like some old rooster , that the scepter was still his and that the young prince was busy with golden apples and other impuissant matters.  | " How did you lose your husband , Mrs. Hubbard , " Nellieasked . " I really ca n't say , " said Mrs. Hubbard . " They do n't go in terribly much for detail . They simply announce that he was lost in action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what a divine old dog , " she exclaimed as Tessie came into the room . " I adore setters . Daddy used to breed and show them . " " Where was this , " Nailles asked . " On the island , " said Mrs. Hubbard . " We had a largish place on the island until Daddy lost his pennies and I may say he lost them all . " " Where did he show his dogs ? " " Mostly on the island . He showed one dog in New York  --  Aylshire Lassie  --  but he did n't like the New York show . " " Shall we go in to lunch , " asked Nellie . " Could I use the amenities , " asked Mrs. Hubbard . " The what ? " said Nellie . " The john , " said Mrs. Hubbard . " Oh , of course , " said Nellie . " I 'm sorry ... " Nailles carved the meat and absolutely nothing of any interest or significance was said until about halfway through the meal when Mrs. Hubbard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelous to have a joint for Sunday lunch , " she said . " My flat is very small , as are my means , and I never tackle a roast . Poor Tony had to make do with a hamburger last night . " " Where was this , " Nellie asked  | " Emma cooked my supper last night , " Tony said . " Then you did n't spend the night at the Crutchmans ' ? " " No , Mother , " Tony said . Nellie saw it all ; seemed to be looking at it . Would she rail at the stranger for having debauched her cleanly son ? Bitch . Slut . Whore . Degenerate . Would she cry and leave the table ? Tony was the only one then who looked at his mother and he was afraid she would . What would happen then ? He would follow her up the stairs calling : " Mother , Mother , Mother . " Nailles would telephone for a taxi to take dirty Mrs. Hubbard away . Nellie , her lunch half finished , lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed my grandmother 's trunk . We always used to play it when Tony was a boy and things were n't going well . " " Oh , let 's , " said Mrs. Hubbard . " I packed my grandmother 's trunk , " said Nellie , " and into it I put a grand piano . " " I packed my grandmother 's trunk , " said Nailles , " and into it I put a grand piano and an ashtray . " " I packed my grandmother 's trunk , " said Mrs. Hubbard , " and into it I put a grand piano , an ashtray and a copy of Dylan Thomas . " " I packed my grandmother 's trunk , " said Tony , " and into it I put a grand piano , an ashtray , a copy of Dylan Thomas and a football . " " I packed my grandmother 's trunk , " said Nellie , " and into it I put a grand piano , an ashtray , a copy of Dylan Thomas , a football , and a handkerchief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Nailles , " andp99into it I put a grand piano , an ashtray , a copy of Dylan Thomas , a football , a handkerchief and a baseball bat . . . " They got through lunch and when this was over Mrs. Hubbard asked to be taken to the station . She thanked Nailles and Nellie , got into her Chesterfield , went out the door and then returned saying : " Oops , I nearly forgot my bumbershoot . " Then she was gone . Nellie cried . Nailles embraced her , saying : " Darling , darling , darling , darling . " She went upstairs and when Tony returned Nailles said that his mother was resting . " For God 's sake , " said Nailles , " please do n't ever do anything like that again . " " I wo n't , Daddy , " said Tony.  |p100O  n the night but one before Tony was stricken with what Nailles insisted was mononucleosis , Nailles and Nellie had gone to a dinner party at the Ridleys ' . The Ridleys were a couple who brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to marry and conceive , rear and educate children was like the manufacture and merchandisingof some useful product produced in competition with other manufacturers . They were not George and Helen Ridley . They were " the Ridleys . " One felt that they might have incorporated and sold shares in their destiny over the counter . " The Ridleys " was painted on the door of their station wagon . There was a sign saying " The Ridleys " at the foot of their driveway . In their house , matchbooks , coasters and napkins were all marked with their name . They presented their handsome children to their guests with the air of salesmen pointing outp101the merits of a new car in a showroom . The lusts , griefs , exaltations and shabby worries of a marriage never seemed to have marred the efficiency of their organization . One felt that they probably had branch offices and a staff of salesmen on the road . They were very stingy with their liquor and when they got home Nailles made a nightcap for Nellie and himself . Nailles put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses flashed a double beam of light . He seemed , to Nellie , fussy that night as he measured out the ice and soda and she noticed a large lipstick stain along the side of his mouth . He would have exchanged an innocent kiss behind a pantry door and this did not worry her but the streak of crimson made him look ridiculous . His procreative usefulness was over  --  she thought  --  but his venereal itch was unabated  --  he scratched himselfwhile she watched  --  and she wondered if there was n't some massive obsolescence to the overly sensual man in his forties ; some miscalculation in nature that left him able to populate a small city with his unwanted progenerativeenergies . Later , when Nailles lurched over to Nellie 's side of the bed she did n't actually kick him but she made it clear that he was unwelcome . Now Nailles had no use for men who were afraid of women . He had grown up with a man who suffered from this terrible infirmity . His name was Harry Pile and Pile had been afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally with his mother  --  a large , big-breasted , impetuous woman who fired out contradictory corn/mands , broke her husband 's spirit and thrashed her only son with a thorny walking stick . When Pile was eight or nine years old he fell in love with a girl named Janet Forbes . She was intelligent and responsive and yet in some way formidable . Her shoulders were broad , her voice was a little gruff for a girl and her uncle , Wilbert Forbes , had discovered a mountain in Alaska that bore his name . That Harry 's beloved shared her name with a mountain seemed to hint at some snowcapped massiveness , some inaccessibility that both pleased and frightenedhim . In school and college he invariably fell in love with women distinguished by their independence and intractability . He first married a high-spirited and beautifulyoung woman who gave him three daughters and then ran off with an Italian waiter . This deepened his fears . For his second wife he chose a woman so preternaturallydemure , wistful and shy that it seemed he had outmaneuvered his fears but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of anxiety . In the meantime the three daughters of his first marriage had grown up into argumentative , robust and determined young women and when he once tried to correct the eldest she picked up a china lamp and smashed it over the top of his head . It was Pile who swept up the pieces and retired in defeat . Pile was afraid of his secretary , afraid of his receptionist , afraid of strange women approaching him on the sidewalk . In his thirties he was taken ill and when Nailles went to visit him in the hospital he found , of course , that Pile was afraid of the nurses , afraid even of those kindly and mater/nal volunteers who sell cigarettes and newspapers . He failed rapidly and when Nailles last saw him he was emaciated and barely able to speak . When Nailles asked if there was anything he wanted he shook his head . When Nailles asked if there was any friend he would like to see he merely sighed . When he finally spoke it was in a hoarse whisper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . It was one of the last things or perhaps the last thing he said , since he died that night . Nailles was not afraid of Nellie but he bothered her no more . Frustrated , angry and indignant he went into the guest room and slept there . If you met Nailles on a train or a plane or a bus or a boat and asked him what he did he would describe himself as a chemist . If you questioned him further he would say that he worked for the Saffron Chemical Corporation but that was all you would get out of him . He had majored in chemistry at college but he had not taken a graduate degree and his chemistry was dated . He worked for Monsanto in Delaware for five years and then he worked for three years analyzing chemical fertilizers for the Food and Agricultural Offices of the United Nations in Rome . Saffron hired him when he returned to the United States . Saffron operated a small laboratory in Westfield but it was basically a manufacturing firm that produced a patent floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tudor , and Spang , a mouthwash . Nailles was principally occupied with the merchandisingp104of Spang and he was definitely restive about this . It seemed to reflect on his dignity . He had argued with himself frequently on this score . Would he be more dignifiedif he had manufactured mattresses , depilatories , stained-glass windows or toilet seats ? No . In the TV commercialsfor Spang , boxers in the ring objected to one another 's bad breath . Bad breath came between young lovers , friends , husbands and wives . In a sense this was all true , he told himself . Bad breath was a human infirmitylike obeseness and melancholy and it was his simple task to cure it . Sexual compatibility was the keystone to any robust marriage and bad breath could lead to divorce , alimony and custody suits . Bad breath could sap a man 's self-esteem , posture and appearance . Suspecting himself to be a sufferer , the victim would mumble into his shirt , hoping to divert the fumes downward . Bad breath recognized no class . Nailles had read in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his love . Bad breath could come between the priest and his flock , Nailles had observed when Father Ransome breathed on him as he reached for the chalice . In Nailles 's mythology the nymphs complained among themselves about the bad breath of Priapus . Bad breath drove children away from home . The wise statesman in his councils was not heeded because his breath was noxious . Bad breath was a cause of war . Saffron was a paternal organization . A kindly old man named Marshman was president and majority stock owner and in the last year his son Michael had graduatedp105from college and joined the firm . He was energetic , full of ideas and detestable . He had the products appraised by a firm of motivational psychologists . They concluded that the formula for Spang was too bland . Cleanliness was associated  --  so they claimed  --  with bitterness , and the sales of Spang would increase if its taste was more unpleasant . The laboratory had been asked to work up a new formula and on the day after the Ridleys ' dinner Nailles drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . He rinsed and spat , rinsed and spat . His taste was not especially keen and when he chose a formulait was guesswork . He started back to Bullet Park at about four . His mouth was stinging and he stopped at a bar on the road for a drink . There was nothing to recommend the place from the outside . It was shabby but when he stepped into the dark room he found himself in one of those quiet bars where the customers sit in a palpable atmosphere of sanctuary . The bartender wore a rented yellow jacket . Four men at the bar were drinking whiskey . One of them was feeding potato chips to a mongrel dog . " I never get any further than Southwark , " one of them said . " Southwark is the only place I ever get to any more . " There seemed to be some metric regulation to the pace of the talk . It was emotional , intimate , evocative and as random as poetry . They had come from other places and would go to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoonthey seemed as permanent as the beer pulls . " I 'll buy a free drink for anyone that can tell me what kind ofp106dog my dog is , " said the man with the potato chips . There were no takers and so he answered the question himself . " My dog is half beagle , " he said , " and half Irish setter . " Nailles ordered a martini , which marked him as a travelerand a stranger . " I had this girl who used to say hello , " one of the men said . " You ever know a girl like that ? " There was no answerand he went on . " She used to say hello all the time . I used to go over there on Thursday nights after supper . Her husband bowled on Thursdays . She was usually in a bathrobe or something like that and she 'd give me a big kiss and start saying hello . So then when I was getting undressed she 'd kiss my ears and everything and keep saying hello , hello , hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then when we came to the main feature she 'd keep on saying hello only louder and louder and finally she 'd sort of yell hello , hello . Then afterwards she 'd light me a cigarette and get me a drink of whiskey  --  she always did that  --  and she 'd keep kissing me and saying hello . Then when I got dressed and kissed her good night she 'd keep on saying hello . I suppose she must have said something else but I honestly ca n't remember her saying anything but hello . " " The things my wife used to say , " the fourth man said , " I would n't want to repeat . She was very gentle-spoken and everything but when she got into bed she 'd say anything . Worse than a whore . I used to wonder who taught her to speak like that . I mean it was n't me . It used top107make me jealous and I have a very jealous nature . She was a beautiful woman and she loved to put it out and if she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was away from seven in the morning until half past six and when she would n't put it out I figured she must be getting it somewheres else . I suffered awfully from jealousy . I would n't hire a detective or follow her around or anything like that but I just wanted to be sure , if you know what I mean . So then I hit on this idea . The Thing . Has she got the Thing on . If she 's got the Thing on she 's planning to put it out . She kept the Thing in the medicinecabinet and it was very easy for me to find out where it was . So , one night I came home and washed my face and I chanced to look in the medicine cabinet and I saw that the Thing was n't there . I thought I had her . So I went downstairs , very angry , and I asked her what kind of a day she 'd had and she said she went shopping . She did n't buy anything but she spent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck me she was looking at something else . She went on cooking and I asked her where the Thing was , why did she have to wear the Thing in order to go shopping . So then I hollered at her and called her names and she cried and cried and said she had the Thing on because we did it in the morning and you know she had me there because I could n't rememberwhether or not we did it in the morning . So then I apologized and she stopped crying and we had dinner but she would n't let me touch her and I was still suspicious . Jealous , I mean . So about a week later she wasp108going to visit her sister in Detroit . Her sister is very immoral . I drove her out to the airport and kissed her goodbyeand when I got home that night I opened the medicinecabinet and there was the Thing . So I met her at the airport when she came home and everything was fine but that night while I was brushing my teeth I opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd left one Thing at home to deceive me and bought another Thing in Detroit . So then I asked her why she had to buy a Thing in Detroit and she began to cry and said she 'd bought a new Thing that afternoon because there was a hole in the old Thing . So then I asked her if she 'd bought it at the drug store and she said yes and I said I 'm going to find out the truth and I called the drug store and asked them if she 'd bought a Thing that afternoon . They told me they did n't keep a record of those purchases and that the afternoon clerk had gone home so I asked for his telephone number , the number of the clerk , and they gave it to me and I called him and he said he could n't remember , it was a busy afternoon and he could n't rememberevery purchase that was made . She was still cryingand naturally I felt a little cheap but I still was n't sure about what was going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late and I was getting dressed to go to work and a button pulled off my jacket and I went to this box where she keeps needles and threads and I opened it up and there was another Thing . So I took it into the bedroom and I showed it to her and I asked her how the hell many Things did she have to have and she pulled thep109blankets up over her face and did n't say anything and I went to work with a button off my jacket . About a week after that they put the pill on the market and she threw away all her Things and started taking the pill and so , of course , I never knew . We got divorced six , seven months later . " Nailles had a second drink and went back to the road . The conversation at the bar had disconcerted more than it had amused him . What about the man on the bowling team ? Did he know or care how his wife spent her Thursdaynights ? Nailles was monogamous  --  incurably so  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with Nellie the first time he met her and the success of his marriage was not an affair of the heart  --  it was a matter of life and death . He remembered a recent Saturday afternoon when she had fallen asleep in his arms . Holding her he had experienced a sense of being fused as heady as total drunkenness  --  a sense of their indivisibility for better or for worse , an exalting sense of their oneness . Her breathing was a little harsh and he was supremely at peace . She was his child , his goddess , the mother of his only son . When she woke she asked : " Did I snore ? " " Oh , terribly , " he said , " you sounded like a chain saw . " " It was a nice sleep , " she said . " It was nice to have you in my arms , " he said , " that was very nice .... " When he got home that afternoon he mixed them both a drink and going upstairs to wash his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and detestable purpose as had the stranger in the bar . Then he wentp110downstairs and asked Nellie what sort of a day she 'd had . " I went shopping , " she said . " I did n't buy anything . I just looked at dresses . Everything was the wrong size or the wrong color . " " Would you come into the living room for a minute . There 's something I want to ask you . " She followed him into the living room and he shut the double doors into the hall so their voices would n't be heard by Tony . In the natural course of events and in a society whose sexual morals were empirical , Nellie , as an attractive woman , had been approached by a number of men . The following things had happened . One Saturday night at the club the Fallows had introduced her to a young house guest named Ballard . He asked her to dance and when he took her in his arms she felt a galvanic flash of sexuality , much stronger than anything she had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally disturbed . They moved absentmindedly over the floor . If he asked her to go out with him to his car she could not have refused and why should she ? She was in the throes of the most profound sexual attraction of her life . He did n't ask her to go out . He did n't have to . They were both pale . He simply gave her his arm and they walked off the floor but as they passed the bar someone shouted : " Fire , fire , fire ! " The bar began to fill up with smoke and the drinkers poured out into the corridor , jostling the lovers . Then down the hall came Nailles , carrying a brass fire extinguisher , and plunged into the smoke-filled room . The band went on playing but all of the dancers left the floorp111and crowded in the doorways . The fire department was there in a few minutes and the bartenders , coughing and weeping , began to carry the bottles out into the hallway , two by two . A white canvas firehose was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under control without having to inundate the place . When Nailles finally came out of the gutted room , smeared with soot , Nellie ran to his side and said : " Oh , my darling . I was worried about you . " Then they went home and she never saw or thought of Ballard again . Among the village libertines was a man named Peter Spratt although he was naturally known as Jack . His wife was a heavy drinker and there was endless speculation about whether his philandering had begun with her drinking or vice versa . At parties he often took Nellie aside and spoke about what he would do if they were ever left alone . She was not offended and was sometimes provoked . He borrowed Nailles 's hedge clipper on Saturday . At Monday noon he rang the bell . Nellie answered the door . He stepped into the hall , put the hedge clipper onto a chair and giving Nellie an amorous and penetratinglook that made her head swim said : " Now I 've got you alone . " Whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nailles was upstairs in bed with a bad cold . " Who 's there , dear , " he asked , " who 's there , sweetheart . " He appeared at the head of the stairs in his bathrobe and pajamas . " Why Jack , " he said , " why are n't you working . " " I thought I 'd take a day off , " Jack said . " Well have a drink , come in and have a drink . " Nelliep112got the ice and the two men had a drink . Spratt never tried again . Another philanderer in the neighborhood  --  Bob Harmon  --  hadseveral times asked Nellie to lunch with him and at a time when she was bored with Nailles and his worries about mouthwash , she accepted . She was thirtyeightyears old and what harm could there be in flirting over a restaurant table with a good-looking man ? They met in a midtown bar and instead of taking her to a restaurant he took her to an apartment . Here was all the paraphernalia for a seduction , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank a glass of wine while he began to tell her how barren his life had been until he met her . He had still not moved towards her when either the caviar sandwich or something she had eaten for breakfast started a volcanic disturbance in her insides . She asked the way to the bathroom , where she remained for the next fifteen minutes , racked with cramps . When she reappeared she was quite pale and shaken and said that she would have to go home . He seemed , if anything , glad to see her go . So her chasteness , preserved by a fire , a runny nose and some spoiled sturgeoneggs was still intact , although she carried herself as if her virtue was a jewel  --  an emblem  --  of character , disciplineand intelligence . When the extremely shabby scene in the living room ended , Nellie went upstairs and washed away her tears . Then she served dinner so that Tony would not suspectp113there was anything wrong . At the end of dinner Nailles asked : " Have you done your homework ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I had two study halls . " " Shall we play some golf ? " " Sure . " Nailles got some putters and balls out of the hall closet and they drove to a miniature golf links off Route 64 . The links , Nailles guessed , had been built in the thirties . There were deep water traps , bridges and a windmill . The place had long ago gone to seed and had then been abandoned . The water traps were dry , the windmill had lost its sails and the greens were bare concrete but most of the obstacles were intact and on summer nights men and boys still played the course although there were notrespassingsigns all over the place . There were no lights , of course , but that was a summer night and there was light in the sky . A little wind was blowing from the west and there was thunder across the river . When Nailles described the scene to himself , as he would a hundred times or more , his description followed these lines . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing on psychological motives and mouthwash . If I had n't gone to Westfield none of this would have happened . Tony led off and I remember feelingvery happy to be with him . I taught him how to putt and he has a nice stance . I gave up golf four years ago but I thought I might take it up again . We would play together . I know he is n't handsome  --  his nose is too big and he has a bad color  --  but he 's my son and I love him.  |p114Well  , it was windy and there was some thunder on the other side of the river . I remember the thunder because I remember thinking how much I liked the noise of thunder . It seems to me a very human sound , much more human than the sound of jet planes , and thunder always reminds me of what it felt like to be young . We used to belong to the country club when I was a kid and I went to all the dances  --  assemblies  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ' Rain ' and The Red , Red Robin '  --  and so forth I remember what it felt like going to dances when you 're seventeen and eighteen , but thunderrefreshes my memory much better . It is n't that I feel young when I hear thunder , it 's just that I can remember what it felt like to be young . We shot the second hole at par and on the third hole you 're supposed to make your ball loop the loop through an old automobile tire . I had some trouble with this . Tony made it in par but I was two over and still trying when Tony said : You know what , Dad ? ' and I said , What ? ' and he said I 'm going to leave school . ' " Well this got me off-guard . It really spilled me . The idea had never crossed my mind . The first thing I figured out was that I must n't lose my temper . I must be reasonable and patient and so forth . He was only seventeen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a character in a play . Then I tried to act the part . What it really felt like was that patience was this big woolly blanket and I was wrapping myself up in it but it kept slipping . So I said very patiently , Why , Tony ? ' and hep115said because he was n't learning anything . He said that French was all grief and English was even worse because he read more than the teacher . Then he said that astronomywas just a gut course and that his teacher was senile . He said that whenever the teacher turned off the lights for a film strip everybody took naps and threw spitballs and that once the teacher cried when they piled out of the class in the middle of a sentence . He said that when he got to the door he looked back and saw the teacher crying . So he went up to him and explained that they did n't mean to be rude , they just did n't want to be late for the next class , and then he said that the teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , he loved them all . Then Tony said he did n't think too much of a teacher who cried . Well , then we played the fifth hole where you have to get your ball through a gate . I did this in par but he was three over and we went on talking . I said that he had to get his diploma . I asked him what he was planning to do without a diploma and he said he thought he might do some social work in the slums . He said there was this place for children with disturbed parents and he thought he might work there . Well , I was having trouble with my patience , my woolly blanket . It kept slipping . I said that if he wanted to do social work that was all right with me and I felt sure it would be all right with his mother but first he had to get his diploma . I said I guessed that social work like everything else needed training and preparation and that after he got his diploma I and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he could get training as a social worker . So then he said he could n't see what was the good of a diploma if he was n't learning anything . He said it was just a phony , just a phony scrap of paper like a phony treaty . Then I said that phony or not you had to observe some of the rules of the game . I said that trousers , for instance , were n't perhaps the most comfortableform of clothing but it was one of the rules of the game that you wear trousers . I asked him what would happen if I went to the train bare-ass and he said he did n't care if I went to the train bare-ass . He said I could go to the train bare-ass as far as he was concerned . By this time we 'd stopped playing and that was when these other men , men or boys , asked if they could play through and we said yes and stood aside . " It was windy , as I say , and there was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course was failing so you really could n't see the faces of the men who played through . They were high school kids , I guess , slum kids , hoods , whatever , wearing tight pants and trick shirts and hair grease . They had spooky voices , they seemed to pitch them in a way that made them sound spooky , and when one of them was addressing the ball another gave him a big goose and he backed right into it , making groaning noises . It is n't that I dislike boys like that really , it 's just that they mystify me , they frighten me because I do n't know where they come from and I do n't know where they 're going and if you do n't know anything about people it 's like a terrible kind ofp117darkness . I 'm not afraid of the dark but there are some kinds of human ignorance that frighten me . When I feel this I 've noticed that if I can look into the face of the stranger and get some clue to the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , it was getting dark and you could n't see the faces of any of these strangers as they played through . So they played through and we went on talking about his diploma and the rules of the game . I said that whatever he wanted to do he had to train himself for it , he had to prepare himself . I said that even if he wanted to be a poet he had to prepare himself to be a poet . So then I said to him what I 've never said before . I said : I love you , Tony . ' " So then he said , The only reason you love me , the only reason you think you love me is because you can give me things . ' Then I said this was n't true , that the only reason I was a generous father was because my own fatherhad n't given me very much . I said that because my own father had been so tight was why I wanted to be generous . So then he said : Generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew I was very generous . He said that he heard about how generous I was practically every day in the year . So then he said , Maybe I do n't want to get married . I would n't be the first man in the world who did n't want to get married , would I ? Maybe I 'm queer . Maybe I want to live with some nice , clean faggot . Maybe I want to be promiscuous and screw hundredsand hundreds of women . There are other ways of doing it besides being joined in holy matrimony and fill/ing up the cradle . If having babies is so great why did you only have one ? Why just one ? ' I told him then that his mother had nearly died when he was born . I 'm sorry , ' he said . I did n't know that . ' So then he said that I had got to understand that he might not want to come home at dusk to a pretty woman and play softball with a bunch of straight-limbed sons . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saint or a drunkard or a garbage man or a gas pumper or a traffic cop or a hermit . Then I lost my patience , my woolly blanket , and said that he had to get off his ass and do something useful and he said : What ? Like pushing mouthwash . ' Then I lifted up my putter and I would have split his skull in two but he ducked and threw down his club and ran off the links into the dark . " So there I was on this ruined miniature golf course having practically murdered my son but what I wanted to do then was to chase after him and take another crack at him with the putter . I was very angry . I could n't understand how my only son , whom I love more than anything in the world , could make me want to kill him . So then I picked up his putter and walked back to the car . When I got home I told Nellie that I 'd had a fight with Tony but she sympathized with him , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Then I had a drink and looked at television  --  there was n't anything else to do . I sat there in front of the set until about midnight when he came in . He did n't speak to me and I did n't speak to him . He went upstairs to bed and I went up a little later . " He 's been in bed ever since . "  |p119When  Tony had been in bed twenty-two days Nellie received a letter from a cleaning woman named Mary Ashton who had once worked for her . Mary had been intelligent and industrious but she had been a thief . She had first stolen two small diamond rings that had belonged to Nellie 's mother . Nellie never wore the rings and she did not accuse the maid of the theft . Good cleaningwomen were hard to find , Mary was poor and deserving , and Nellie thought of the diamonds as a bonus . A month or so later a pair of gold cufflinks vanished and Nellie fired the maid . She did not mention the cufflinks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen the typewriter ? ) on good stationery ( stolen ? ) . The letter read : " Dear Mrs. Nailles : I know that your son is sick and I am very sorry to hear this . He is one of the nicest boys I have ever known . In the village there is a guru or faith-healer who calls himself Swami Rutuola . He curedp120my sister of arthritis last year . He works part time for Percham , the carpenter , but he 's usually at home in the afternoons . He does n't have any telephone but he lives upstairs over Peyton 's funeral parlor on Hill Street . " This combination of theft and magic disturbed Nellie . She and Nailles gave a cocktail party that afternoon and she did n't have a chance to show him the letter . The party was excellent . It is difficult to praise a cocktail party but as a hostess Nellie deserved praise . There was no fatuity in the pride she took in her house . The pleasantrooms seemed to be partly illuminated by her graces . The sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The food and liquor were splendid and nothing banal , boring or asinine was said . Charlie Wentworth , sitting close to Martha Tuckerrnan on the sofa , shared with Martha a flash of immortal longing . Looking into one another 's eyes it suddenly seemed to them both that a life together would be paradise . They would laugh at one another 's jokes , warm one another 's bones , travel to Japan . Martha left the sofa then and joined her husband at the bar . This was the closest anyonecame to adulterous passion . The only difficulty was that Nailles had a circular driveway and without Tony  --  who was , of course , in bed  --  to direct traffic , the parking was haphazard . Nailles spent the last half hour of the party either moving cars or asking people to move them . Everyone had gone by eight . They had some scrambled eggs and sausage in the kitchen and Nellie showed Nailles the letter.  | " Oh , my God , " he said , " she was the one who stole , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe the Swami 's an accomplice . Magic is the only thing we have n't tried but I 'm not up to it . " Nailles 's struggle to get into the city on the train had become so acute that he finally had gone to Dr. Mullin , * who prescribed a massive tranquilizer . He took this each morning with his coffee , telling Nellie that it was a vitaminpill . The tranquilizer gave him the illusion that he floated upon a cloud like Zeus in some allegorical painting . Standing on the platform waiting for the 7:46 he seemed surrounded by his cloud . When the train came in he picked up his cloud and settled himself in a window seat . If the day was dark , the landscape wintry , the little towns they passed shabby and depressing , none of this reached to where he lay in his rosy nimbus . He seemed to float down the tracks into Grand Central , beaming a vast and slightly absentminded smile at poverty , sickness , wealth , the beauty of strange women , the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nellie was waked by the sound of gunfire . There had been riots in the slums and she wondered for a moment if the militants had decided to march out of the ghetto and take the white houses of Chestnut Lane by force . Nailles was not in bed and she went to the window . What she saw was Nailles in his underpants on their broad lawn , firing his shotgun at an immense snappingturtle . The sun had not risen but the sky was lightp122and in this pure and subtle light the undressed man and the prehistoric turtle seemed engaged in some primordial and comical battle . Nailles raised his gun and fired at the turtle . The turtle recoiled , collapsed and then slowly raised itself up like a sea tortoise and began to lumber towards her husband . She had never seen , outside a zoo , so big a reptile , but it was Nailles , not the reptile , who seemed out of place in the early light . It was the turtle 's lawn , the turtle 's sky , the turtle 's creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . He fired again and missed . He fired again and she saw the turtle 's huge head swung to one side by the charge of buckshot . He fired again , put his gun on the grass and picked the turtle up by its jagged tail . " Oh darling , are you sure it 's dead , " she called down from the window . " Yes , " he said . He seemed surprised to see her at the window . " It 's dead . Its neck is broken . " " Where do you suppose it came from ? " " The bog , I guess . It must be a hundred years old . I got up to go to the bathroom and I saw it crossing the lawn . At first I thought I was dreaming . The shell must be three feet long . It could hurt a child or kill a dog . I 'll bury it later . " In the bedroom Nailles , his right ear ringing from the gun and his right hand shaking a little , knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand was tremblingso that the tranquilizer fell to the floor and rolled under a piece of furniture . Nailles waited until Nelliep123had left the room . He bent a metal coathanger into the shape of a hook and lying on the floor he tried to recapturethe pill . The piece of furniture  --  a dressing table  --  was flush to the floor and darkness concealed his pill . He hooked two pennies and a button . He then took the lamps off the top of the dressing table and moved it away from the wall . It was a heavy piece of furniture with loaded drawers and was a struggle to move , and when he got it away from the wall there was no pill but there was a crack in the flooring into which it must have fallen . He ran his coathanger along the crack but his only catch was dirt . The thought of taking the train without a pill gave him all the symptoms of panic . His breathing was quick and his lips swollen . The place pain took in his memory was curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now the agony , confusion and humiliation of getting off at Greenacres and again at Lascalles , of getting off at Clear Haven and again at Turandot  --  returned to him with nearly the intensity of fact . He could not do it . Courage had nothing to do with his suffering . If he forced himself to go to the station he knew he would be unable to board the 7:46 . Cold baths , self-discipline , prayer , all seemed like the moral paraphernalia of his first year in the Boy Scouts . He had to get into the city to fend for Nellie and his son . If he could not get into the city they would be defenseless and he imagined them as besieged by enemies  --  cold , hunger and fear  --  refugees from a burned city . He took a cold shower on the chancep124that this might help , but water had no calming effect on his image of the 7:46 as a portable abyss . He did n't know what hours the doctor kept but he knew that he had to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office was in a development of two-story apartments called garden apartments although there were no gardens to be seen . He rang and a man in pajamasopened the door . " I must have the wrong address , " Nailles said . " You looking for the doctor ? " " Yes . It 's terribly important . It 's an emergency . It 's a matter of life and death . " " You got the right place but he 's not in practice any more , " the stranger said . " The county medical society closed him down three weeks ago . He 's doing laboratory work in the city . " " What happened ? " " Pills . He was giving out all sorts of illegal pills . But I 'm right in the middle of my breakfast . . . " " I 'm sorry , " Nailles said . He could drive into the city , or could he ? He could take a bus . He could take a taxi . A man spoke to him from a car parked beside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God yes , " Nailles said , " God yes . " " What was he giving you ? " " I do n't know the name of it . It was for the train . " " What color ? " " Gray and yellow . It was a capsule , half gray and half yellow . "  | " I know what it was . You want some ? " " God yes , God yes . " " I 'll meet you in the Catholic cemetery , out on Laurel Avenue . You know the one I mean . There 's a statue of a soldier . " Nailles got to the cemetery before the stranger . It was an old-fashioned place with many statues , but the monument to the soldier stood a head taller than the host of stone angels and was easy to find . Gravediggers worked in the distance . Nailles had guessed that graves were dug by engines , but these men worked with a shovel and pickax . He passed an array of motley angels  --  some of them life-sized , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they blessed with half-furled wings , some of them clung with furled wings to the cross . The soldier wore the uniform of 1918  --  a soup-plate helmet , puttees , baggy pants , and he held in his right hand , butt to the ground , a Springfield , bolt-action , 1912 . He had been carved from a white stone that had not discolored at all but it had eroded , obscuring his features and his insignia so that he looked like a ghost . The stranger joined Nailles , holding a few tulips that he must have stolen somewhere . He put these into a container in front of the ghostly infantryman and said : " Twenty-five dollars . " " I 've been getting a big prescription for ten , " Nailles said . " Look , " the stranger said , " I can get ten years in jail for this and a ten-thousand-dollar fine . " Nailles gave him the money in exchange for five pills . " You 'll need some more on Monday , " the man said . " Meet me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a pill into his mouth but he needed water . Rainwater had collected in one of the commemorative urns or ewers and he scooped enough up with his hand to get the pill down . Driving to the train he waited for the pill to take hold , for his cloud to gather , and by the time he got to the parking lot it had begun its wonderful work . He was moderate , calm , a littlebored and absentminded . He forgot to put a quarter in the parking meter but when he had completed his painlessjourney into the city he telephoned Nellie and asked her to try the guru.  |p127Ater  lunch Nellie poured herself a whiskey . I should go to a shrink , she thought , until she remembered the doctor circling his invisible dentist 's chair . She hated him , not for his real-estate business , but because she had always felt vaguely that in any crisis psychiatry could be counted on to work a cure , and he had taken this solace out the door with him . She remembered that the cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite disinfectanthad been a chemical , advertised to smell of mountain pine woods , but this imitation of the sweet mountain air was so crude , flagrant and repulsive that it amounted to an irony . Snowcapped toilet seats . Eliot had asked her to see the guru and so she went . The slums , the oldest part of the village , were down along the banks of the river . She never had any reason to go there . She had read in the paper that women were mugged and robbed in broad daylight . There were knifep128fights in saloons . The rain was heavy that afternoon ; the light narrow . All rain tastes the same and yet rain fell for Nellie from a diversity of skies . Some rains seemed let down like a net from the guileless heavens of her childhood , some rains were stormy and bitter , some fell like a force of memory . The rain that day tasted as salty as blood . So down into the slums went Nellie , down to Peyton'sfuneral parlor . This was a shabby frame building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the dead ( murdered in knife fights ) entered and departed for the black cemetery at the edge of everything . There was a door on the left leading , she guessed , to the rooms upstairs , and she opened this onto a bare hallway with a staircase . The strangeness of this environment disturbed her deeply as if she inhaled , in the rooms of her own house , not only the buttressed proprieties but an essence that conditioned her chromosomes and lights . The alien reek of the hallway  --  the immemorial reek of such places  --  seemed to strip her of any moral reliability . She looked around for something familiar  --  a fire extinguisher would have served  --  but there was nothing in the hallway that belonged to her . Had one of the legendary rapists she read about in the evening paper approached her she would have been helpless . She was lost . She was frightened . Her instinct was to turn and go ; her duty was to climb the stairs ; and the division between these two forces seemed like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight into the force of sepa/rateness in her life . She seemed to be saying goodbye to herself at a railroad station ; standing among the mournersat the edge of a grave . Goodbye Nellie . She had no role in this place and she felt it keenly . Census taker ? Relief worker ? An advocate for planned parenthood , distributing free pills ? An adviser to unwed mothers ? Lady bountiful dividing the proceeds from the church bazaar ? She was none of these . She was a woman with a sick son , looking ( at the advice of a thief ) for a magician . I am a good woman , she thought . This foolishness was unintentional  --  compulsive  --  she seemed helplessly to ridicule herself . I 've never once run over a squirrel on the highway . I 've always kept seed in the bird-feeding station . She climbed the stairs . There was a window at the head of the stairs where someone had written on the dirty glass : " Sid Greenberg chews and smokes . " There were two doors off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Temple of Light . " There was music beyond the door  --  singing  --  the voices compressed and funneled through a radio . She knocked and when there was no answer she called : " Swami Rutuola , Swami Rutuola . . . " From behind the second door there was a loud sound of giggling  --  lewd or alcoholic  --  and then a woman imitatedNellie 's accent . " Oh Swermi Rutaholah , Oh Swermi Rutaholah . . . " A man joined in the giggling . They must have been in bed . " Oh Swermi . . . " the woman said . She was nearly helpless with laughter . Nellie knocked again and a man asked her to come in . She stepped into a roomp130where a light-colored Negro was tacking upholstery webbingonto a chair frame . There was a smell of shavings . Which came first , Christ the carpenter or the holy smell of new wood ? There was an altar in the corner . A votive candle burned in a display of wax flowers . Wax flowers meant death  --  death and Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . The voice was high , definitely accented . Jamaican , she thought . The face was slender and one of the eyes was injured and cast . A war , an arrow , a stone ? This eye , immovable , was raised to heaven in a permanent attitude of religious hysteria . The other eye was lively , bright and communicative . " I 'm Mrs. Eliot Nailles , " she said . " Mary Ashton gave me your name . My son is sick . " " Would you like me to come with you now ? " he asked . The voice was a very light singsong . " Oh yes , " she said , " if you could , if you think you can help him . " " I can try , " he said . " I 'll just wash my hands . I do n't have a car and it 's most difficult to find a taxi in the rain . " She described Tony 's trouble and some of its history as they drove back to her house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a rootless speech , aimed at fastidiousnessor elegance . She took him up to Tony 's room and asked if he 'd like a drink . " Oh no thank you , " he said , " I have something within me that 's much more stimulatingthan alcohol . " " Is there anything I can do ? "  | " I would like to be sure that we wo n't be disturbed . " " I 'll make sure of that , " said Nellie and went down and poured herself another drink . " My name is Swami Rutuola , " he said to Tony , " and I 've come here to help you , or that 's what I hope to do . First I will tell you about my eye . When I was fifteen years old I had a most unfortunate impulse to steal a bicycle . It was a bright-red English Schwinn with threespeedgears . It was irresistible . I hid it in the cellar . When my father found it he beat me most severely and then went with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who owned the bicycle had no wish to prosecute me but my own father and mother insisted that I be taken to court . They were afraid I would become a thief if I were not punished . They were gentle people and I think I have finally come to understand them but they were very frightened of everything . I was sentenced to six months in the reform school in Livertown . Among the prisoners , as is so often the case , were some gangsters who operated a government within the prison government . They were exceedingly brutal and in order to protect myself I developed a limp . I thought that if I limped they would not subject me to their brutality but one day in the mess hall I forgot to limp and when they saw how I had deceived them they beat me up . I was two weeks in the infirmary and as a consequence of their savagery I lost the use of my left eye . I mention all of this because I have observed that when men and women talk with one another they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with their voices and since one of my eyes has no means of communication some people find it very disconcerting . I will hold my head in the shadow while we talk so that you will not be perplexed by my bad eye , but before we do anything else I would like to tidy up your room . Godliness is next to cleanliness  --  is that what they say  --  or is it the other way around ? "  --  " I think it 's the other way around , " Tony said . The swami began to gather the clothing that hung on chairs and doorknobs . He found a laundry bag in the closet and stuffed the soiled linen into this . He hung a jacket on a hanger , treed Tony 's shoes , closed the closet door , and gave the chair cushions a shake . " Well that looks a little better , does n't it , " he said . " Another thing I would like to do is to burn some incense if you do n't object . " " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tony said , " but I do n't really like incense . Any kind of perfume . I never use after-shave lotion . I like to smell perfumeon girls but I do n't like it when it 's all over the place . I do n't like the way department stores smell . " " I think I know what you mean , " the swami said , " but this is n't sweet or strong . It 's sandalwood . It has a clean smell . " He took a narrow stick of incense from his pocket and lighted it . " That 's all right , " Tony said . " I was born in Baltimore , " Rutuola said , " to poor people , but the hardships of my race are well known so I wo n't bother you with them . I went to school until thep133eighth grade and I can read very well but I can not do much arithmetic . My father was a carpenter and when I was paroled from reform school I went to work for him . It was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position with the New York Central . It was not a distinguishedposition . What I did was to clean the toilets in Grand Central Station eight hours a night , five nights a week . I mopped the floors and so forth but what I spent most of my time doing was wiping off the walls the writingpeople had put there . The walls are white and you can write on them easily and after a Saturday night those walls would absolutely be covered with writing . At first I was troubled by this and then I realized that these peoplewrote on the walls because they had to . They hated to have the writing erased as if it seemed to be some part of them . They 'd carve their messages in the wooden doors with a knife . You could n't put them down as freaks because there were thousands of them and it gave me a very deep insight into how lonely and horny mankind is . So then one night  --  one morning , really  --  it was after three o'clock , it was closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up to me and said help me , help me , help me , I think I am going to die . He was a well-dressed man but his face was very gray . So then I said a patrolman came through the concourse about now and I could go upstairs and get him and he could call an ambulance . But then he said do n't leave me , I do n't want to die alone , so then I said let 's go up to the concourse together then , I 'll help you . So then I took his arm andp134we went up to the concourse very slowly  --  he was groaning  --  butwhen we got there there was n't any patrolman around , there was n't anybody around , and he said that he had to sit down and we sat down on some stairs . It was very gloomy and cold and bare and empty there but that great big colored picture that advertises cameras was lighted . It was a picture of a man and a woman and two children on a beach  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in the distance , were all these mountains covered with snow . It was a beautiful happy picture but it seemed more beautiful because the concourse was so cold and bare and had nothing happy about it . So then I told him to look at the mountain to see if he could get his mind off his troubles . So then I said let us pray and he said he could n't remember any prayers and I realized I could n't remember many prayers myself so I said let 's make up a prayer and then I began to say valor , valor , valor , valor , over and over again and in a little while he joined me . So then I said some other words and he said them along with me and then he said that he felt better and after a little while he said he thought he 'd take a cab to a hotel and get some sleep and he said goodbye and I never saw him again . A few weeks later I came out here to work with Mr. Percham who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lets up . Nailles comes home . Swallows and blackbirds hunt in the early dark . The wind is out of the northeast and coming up the steps he can distinguish the sounds made by the different trees as the wind fills them : maple , birch , tulip and oak . What good is this knowl/edge for his son or himself ? Someone has to observe the world . The steady twilight seems like a sustained note , perfect in pitch . Nellie tells him that the guru is upstairs but that he can not be disturbed . Nailles drinks heavily and after dinner Nellie says she is going upstairs to lie down . She makes Nailles promise not to disturb the guru . He gives her a kiss and picks up a novel to bolster his self-control . " In the little town of Ostervogen in northern Denmark , " he reads , " the following events took place in 1869 . One morning in January a young man could be seen walking down the main street . The polish and elegance of his boots and the cut of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Paris . He was bareheaded and wore on his left hand an enormous signet ring , engraved with the crest of the Von Hendreichs . It had snowed during the night and the roofs of the little village were white . Maidservants were sweeping the dry snow off the walks with brooms made of twigs . The young man  --  it was Count Eric von Hendreichs  --  stoppedin front of the largest residence and consulted a heavy , golden pocket watch . A moment later the bells of St. Michael 's church rang eleven . As the last vibration of the bronze bells died on the cold air the young man ran lightly up the steps of the house and rang the bell . A maid wearing the apron and ribbons prescribedfor servants at that time answered his ring , gave him a shy smile and dropped a deep curtsy . She was a pretty young woman but even the voluminousness of her costume could not conceal the fact that she was pregnant . He followed her down a dark hall to a large draw/ing room where an old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostess affectionately in French and accepted a cup of tea . I can only stay a moment , ' he said . I 'm taking the stage to Copenhagen and the eveningpacket to Ostend . ' Quel dommage , ' said the old woman . At her side was an embroidery frame and below this a gilded basket heaped with hanks of colored yarn . She reached into the basket , extracted a small ivoryhandledpistol and shot the young count through the heart ... " Nailles slams this book down on a table and picks up another called Rainy Summer . He reads the first sentence : " It was a very rainy summer and the ashtrays on the tables around the swimming pool were always filled with rainwater and cigarette butts . . . " He throws this book across the room . The doorbell rings . Nailles opens it and sees his neighbor Mrs. Harvey . Why is her face wet , he wonders . Beyond her shoulder he can see stars in the sky . Can she be crying and why is she crying ? It is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nailles says . " Please come in. , , " I do n't think I 've been here since I solicited for the mutual fund , " she says . She is crying . " I 'm soliciting again . " Red Cross , thinks Nailles , Muscular Dystrophy , Heart Trouble ? " What is your cause tonight , " Nailles asks . " The Harvey family , " she says . " I 'm soliciting for Dads . " She laughs ; she sobs . " Please come in and sit down , " says Nailles . " Let me get you a drink . "  | " Well it 's a long story , " she says , " but I guess I 'd better tell it if I expect your help . I guess you know that Charlie'sa junior in Amherst . He went down to Boston and took part in a demonstration . He was arrested and spent a couple of nights in jail but they let him off with a fine and suspended sentence . Then two weeks ago the draft board changed his classification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report for induction the day before yesterday . I mentioned the fact that he was going to be inducted when I was at the beauty parlor and the woman beside me  --  I do n't really know her  --  told me there was a psychiatrist in the village who makes a specialtyin drilling young men in how to disqualify themselves for the army . He charges five hundred dollars . I thought of speaking to Dads about this but it seemed dishonest . Charlie does n't want to be a soldier but he does n't want to be a liar either . I mean it seems like killing yourself in order to avoid getting killed . Anyhow I did n't mention this . He was supposed to report for inductionon Thursday and on Wednesday Dads went to the savings bank and took out three thousand . It was all we had . He gave Charlie five hundred in cash and the rest in a certified check . We never once discussed his plans . After supper he went upstairs and packed a suitcase and came down and Dads drove him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even say goodbye . Dads said he did n't dare say goodbye because he would start crying . I suppose he 's in Canada or Sweden but we have n't heard from him . Well a day later a man came to Dads 's office  --  a man from the government  --  and saidp138that he knew Dads had taken three thousand out of the bank in order to enable his son to emigrate . Dads and I thought our bank accounts were private but evidently not . He said that he wanted to see Dads at home so Dads took an early train today and the man drove over  --  the government man  --  from the county seat where his office is . He first accused Dads of assisting a draft evader and then he said he was going to make it short and sweet and he took a cigarette out of his pocket and put it on the table and said that Dads was under arrest for the possessionof dangerous drugs . The cigarette was a marijuana but it was the first one Dads had ever seen . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spent a year and a half in a POW camp in Germany , eating rats and mice . He wanted the younger generation to learn what it was all about . So then Dads called the lawyer here  --  Harry Marchand  --  and they all drove over to the county seat and Dads was arrested for the possessionof drugs and put into jail . They set the bail at two thousand and because this is the end of the month we simply do n't have it so I 'm going from house to house trying to raise it . " " I think I have two hundred upstairs , " says Nailles , " if that would help . " " Oh it would help . " In the dark bedroom Nellie asks who is downstairs . " It 's Grace Harvey , " Nailles says . " I 'll tell you about it later . " When he opens the wall safe and takes out the money she asks : " Is the swami finished ? Are you paying him ? "  | " No , " Nailles says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Would you like me to write a receipt , " Grace asks . " No . Of course not . " " I 've done the mutual fund for five years , " she says , " but I never thought I 'd be going from door to door collectingbail for Dads . " By now Tony 's room smells strongly of sandalwood . " Ever since my experience in the station , " says the swami , " I have believed in prayer . As I am not a member of any organized religion you might well ask to whom it is that I pray and I would not be able to answer you . I believe in prayer as a force and not as a conversation with God and when my prayers are answered , as they sometimes are , I honestly do not know where to direct my expressions of gratitude . I have cured several cases of arthritis but my methods do n't always work . I pray they will work for you . " Your mother has informed me that you were an athleteand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as a spiritual cheerleader . Cheers do n't make touchdowns , do they , but they sometimes help . I have all kinds of cheers . I have love cheers and compassionate cheers and hopeful cheers and then I have the cheers of place . In the place cheers I just think of someplace where I would like to be and then I keep repeating to myself a description of the place . For instance , in a place cheer I 'll say that I 'm in a house by the sea . Then I pick the time of day and the weather I like . I 'll say that I 'm in a house by the sea at four in the afternoon and it 's raining . Then I'llp140say that I 'm sitting in a kind of chair , a ladderback chair , and I have a book in my lap . Then I 'll say that I have a girl I love who has gone on an errand but who will return . I say this all over and over again . I say that I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's raining and I 'm sitting in a ladderback chair with a book in my lap and I 'm waiting for a girl I love who has gone on an errand but who will return . There are all kinds of place cheers . If you have a special city you like  --  I like Baltimore  --  thenyou pick the time of day and the weather and the circumstances and you repeat all of this . Now will you do what I say ? " " Yes , " says Tony , " I 'll do anything . " " I want you to repeat after me whatever I say . " " Sure , " says Tony . " I am in a house by the sea . " " I am in a house by the sea . " " It is four o'clock and raining . " " It is four o'clock and raining . " " I am sitting in a ladderback chair with a book in my lap . " " I am sitting in a ladderback chair with a book in my lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone on an errand but who will return . " " I have a girl I love who has gone on an errand but who will return . " " I am sitting under an apple tree in clean clothes . I am content . "  | " I am sitting under an apple tree in clean clothes . I am content . " " That was very good , " the swami says . " Now let 's try the love cheer . Repeat Love a hundred times . You do n't really have to count . Just say Love , Love , Love until you get tired of saying it . We 'll do it together . " " Love , Love , Love , Love , Love . . . " " That was fine , " the swami says . " That was very good . I could tell that you meant it . Let 's see if you can sit up . " " It 's crazy , " Tony says , " I know it 's crazy but I do feel much better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nailles hears them chanting HOPE , HOPE , HOPE , he has another whiskey . Was he a voodoo priest ? Would he put a spell over Tony ? Since Nailles claimed not to believe in magic why should magic have the power to frighten him ? Out of the window he can see his lawns in the starlight . HOPE , HOPE , HOPE , HOPE . Their voices sound like drums . His lawns and the incantations came from different kingdoms . Nothing made any sense . " Now try and sit up , " the swami tells Tony . " Sit up and see if you can put your feet on the floor ? " Tony stands . He has lost all weight and muscle . His ribcage shows . His buttocks are wasted and there are red sores on his back . " Take a few steps , " the swami says . " Not many . Just two or three . " Tony does . Then he begins to laugh . " Oh I feel likep142myself , " he says . " I feel like myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sad any more . That terrible feeling has gone . " " Well why do n't you put on some clothes and we 'll go down and see your parents , " the swami says . Tony dresses and they go down together . " I 'm all better , Daddy , " Tony says . " I 'm still weak but that terrible sadness has gone . I do n't feel sad any more and the house does n't seem to be made of cards . I feel as though I 'd been dead and now I 'm alive . " Nellie comes down the stairs in a wrapper and stands in the hall . She is crying . " How can we thank you , " Nailles asks . " Can we get you a drink ? " " Oh no thank you , " says the swami in his thin singsong voice . " I have something within me that is much more stimulating than alcohol . " " You must let me pay you . " " Oh no thank you , " the swami says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I must give it away . You can however drive me home . It is sometimes most difficult to get a taxicab . " So that was it . Tony went back to school ten days later and everything was as wonderful as it had been , althoughNailles , each Monday morning , continued to meet his pusher in the supermarket parking lot , the publictoilet , the laundromat , and a variety of cemeteries.  |p143My  first knowledge of Nailles ( Hammer wrote ) was in a dentist 's anteroom in Ashburnham . There was a photograph and a brief article about his promotion to head of the Mouthwash Division at Saffron . The article mentioned his years in Rome and that he was a member of the Bullet Park Volunteer Fire Department and the Gorey Brook Country Club . I did n't know then and I do n't know now why I singled him out for my attentions . There was the coincidence of our names and I liked his looks . It was n't until some months later that I made my decision . I was sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book . I was alone and it was at a time when the regard for domesticity had gotten so intense that the natural conditionof singleness had become a sore point of suspicion . One appeared on the beach perforce with one 's wife , one 's children , sometimes one 's parents or a brace ofp146house guests . One seldom saw a lonely man . It was a beautiful beach and I remember it clearly . We traditionallyassociate nakedness with judgments and eternity and so on those beaches where we are mostly naked the scene seems apocalyptic . Standing at the surf line we seem , quite innocently , to have strayed into a timeless moral vortex . The judgment that afternoon seemed to have been evangelical and the only sound of sadness was the wailing of some child who was afraid of the waves . Presentlya faggot came along the strand and stopped about ten feet from where I lay . This was a direct consequence of my being alone . His walk was not incriminating but it was definitely smug . His body was comely and tanned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amorous and slightly cross-eyed gaze and then hooked his thumbs into his trunks and lowered them to show an inch or two of backside . At the same time another man appeared on the scene . He was a good deal older than the faggot  --  forty perhaps  --  and had the bright sunburn of someone whose days or hours on the beach were numbered . He was in no way muscular or comely  --  a conscientiousdesk worker with a natural stoop and a backsidebroadened by years of honest toil . With him were his wife and two children and he was trying to fly a kite . He was standing leeward on the dunes , the kite would n't rise and the line was snarled . The faggot threw me anothersidelong glance , gazed out to sea and gave another absentminded pull at his trunks . I got to my feet and joined the man with the kite . I explained that if he stoodp147on the crown of the beach the kite would likely fly and I helped him to unsnarl the line . At this the faggot sighed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended that he should , but the filament of kite line in my fingers , both tough and fine , that had quite succinctly declared my intentions to the faggot seemed for a moment to possesssome extraordinary moral force as if the world I had declared to live in was bound together by just such a length of string  --  cheap , durable and colorless . When the line was cleared I carried the kite to the crown of the beach and , holding it up , watched the wind lift it straight into the blue sky . The children were delighted . The stranger and his wife thanked me for my assistance . I returned to my book . The faggot had vanished but I longed then for a moral creation whose mandates were heftier than the delight of children , the trusting smiles of strangers and a length of kite string . I was born out of wedlock  --  the son of Franklin Pierce Taylor and Gretchen Shurz Oxencroft , his one-time secretary . I have not met my mother for several years but I can see her now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set plainly in her face like the waterholes in a prairie . She was born in an Indiana quarry town , the fourth and by far the plainest of four daughters . Neither of her parents had more than a high-school education . The hardships and boredom of the provincial Middle West forced them into an uncompromising and nearly liturgical regard for the escape routes of learning . They kept a volume of the complete works of Shakespeare onp148their parlor table like a sort of mace . Her father was a Yorkshireman with thick light-brown hair and large features . He was slender and wiry and was discovered , in his forties , to have tuberculosis . He began as a quarry worker , was promoted to quarry foreman and then , duringa drop in the limestone market , was unemployed . In the house where she was raised there was a gilt mirror , a horsehair sofa and some china and silver that her mother had brought from Philadelphia . None of this was claimed to prove lost grandeur or even lost comfort , but Philadelphia ! Philadelphia !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the limestone flats . Gretchen detested her name and claimed at one time or another to be named Grace , Gladys , Gwendolyn , Gertrude , Gabriella , Giselle and Gloria . In her adolescence a public library was opened in the village where she lived and through some accident or misdirection she absorbed the complete works of John Galsworthy . This left her with a slight English accent and an immutable clash between the world of her reveries and the limestone country . Going home from the library one winter afternoon on a trolley car she saw her father standing under a street lamp with his lunch pail . The driver did not stop for him and Gretchen turned to a woman beside her and exclaimed : " Did you see that poor creature ! He signaled for the tram to stop but the driver quite overlooked him . " These were the accents of Galsworthy in which she had been immersedall afternoon , and how could she fit her father into this landscape ? He would have failed as a servant or gar/dener . He might have passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel horses at the quarry . She knew what a decent , courageous and cleanly man he was and it was the intolerable sense of his aloneness that had forced her , in a contemptible way , to disclaim him . Gretchen  --  or Gwendolyn as she then called herself  --  graduated from high school with honors and was given a scholarship at the university in Bloomington . A week or so after her graduation from the university she left the limestone country to make her fortune in New York . Her parents came down to the station to see her off . Her fatherwas wasted . Her mother 's coat was threadbare . As they waved goodbye another traveler asked if they were her parents . It was still in her to explain in the accents of Galsworthy that they were merely some poor people she had visited but instead she exclaimed : " Oh yes , yes , they are my mother and father . " There is some mysterious , genetic principality where the children of anarchy and change are raised and Gretchen ( now Gloria ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her last year at the university and the ills , injustices , imperfections , inequities and indecenciesof the world made her smart . She more or less hurled herself at the city of New York and was hired shortly as a secretary for Franklin Pierce Taylor . He was a wealthy and visionary young man and a member of the Socialist Party . Gretchen became his secretary and presently his lover . They were by all accounts very happy together . What came between them  --  or so my father claimed  --   |p150was  that at this point her revolutionary ardor took the form of theft or kleptomania . They traveled a great deal and whenever they checked out of a hotel she always packed the towels , the table silver , the dish covers and the pillow cases . The idea was that she would distribute them among the poor although he never saw this happen . " Someone needs these things , " she would exclaim , stuffing their suitcases with what did not belong to her . Coming into the Hay-Adams in Washington one afternoon he found her standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Someone can use these , " she said . At the Commodore Perry in Toledo she packed the bathroom scales but he refused to close the suitcase until she returned them . She stole a radio in Cleveland and a painting from the Palace Hotel in San Francisco . This incurable habit of thieving  --  or so he claimed  --  led them to bitter quarrels and they parted in New York . In the use of any utensils  --  toasters , irons and automobiles  --  Gretchen had been dogged by bad luck , and while she had been well equipped with birth-control material her bad luck overtook her again . She discovered soon after the separation that she was pregnant . Taylor did not mean to marry her . He paid the costs of her accouchement and gave her an income and she took a small apartment on the West Side . She always introducedherself as Miss Oxencroft . She meant to be disconcerting . I suppose she saw some originality in our mutual illegitimacy . When I was three years old I was visited by my father 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of yellow curls . She offered to adopt me . After a month 's deliberation my mother  --  who was never very consistent  --  agreed to this . She felt that it was her privilege , practically her vocation , to travel around the world and improve her mind . A nursemaid was gotten for me and I went to live in the country with Grandmother . My hair began to turn brown . By the time I was eight my hair was quite dark . My grandmother was neither bitter nor eccentric and she never actually reproached me for this but she often said that it had come to her as a surprise . I was called Paul Oxencroft on my birth certificate but this was thought unsatisfactory and a lawyer came to the house one afternoon to settle it . ' While they were discussing what to call me a gardener passed the window , carrying a hammer , and so I was named . A trust had been established to provide Gretchen with a decent income and she took off for Europe . This ended her impostureas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she be Gretchen and so she was . When my father was a young man he summered in Munich . He had worked out all his life with barbells , dumbbells , etc. and had a peculiar physique that is developedby no other form of exercise . Even as an old man he was well set up and looked like one of those aging gymnasts who endorse calisthenic courses and blackstrap molasses . In Munich he posed , out of vanity or pleasure , for the architectural sculptor Fledspar who ornamented the facade of the Prinz-Regenten Hotel . He posed as one of those male caryatids who hold on their shoulders thep15lintels of so many opera houses , railroad stations , apartmentbuilding and palaces of justice . The PrinzRegentenwas bombed in the forties but long before this I saw my father 's recognizable features and overdevelopedarms and shoulders supporting the facade of what was then one of the most elegant hotels in Europe . Fledsparwas popular at the turn of the century and I saw my father again , this time in full figure holding up the three top floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Yalta , Berlin and upper Broadway and I saw him lose caste , face and position as this sort of monumentalfacade went out of vogue . I saw him lying in a field of weeds in West Berlin . But all of this came much later and any ill feeling about my illegitimacy and the fact that he was always known as my uncle was overcome by my feeling that he held on his shoulders the Prinz-Regenten , the better suites of the Mercedes and the Opera House in Malsburg that was also bombed . He seemed very responsibleand I loved him . I once had a girl who kept saying that she knew what my mother must be like . I do n't know why an affair that centered on carnal roughhouse should have summoned memories of my old mother , but it did . The girl had it all wrong , although I never bothered to correct her . " Oh , I can imagine your mother , " the girl would sigh . " I can see her in her garden , cutting roses . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was in the garden at all she was very likely on her hands and knees , flinging up weeds as a dog flings up dirt . She was not the frail andp153graceful creature that my friend imagined . Since I have no legitimate father I may have expected more from her than she could give me but I always found her disappointirand sometimes disconcerting . She now lives in Kitzbuhel until the middle of December  --  whenever the snow begins to fall  --  and then moves to a pension in the Estoril . She returns to Kitzbuhel when the snow melts . These moves are determined more by economic reasons than by any fondness she has for the sun . She still writes to me at least twice a month . I ca n't throw the letters away unopened because they might contain some importantnews . I enclose the letter I most recently received to give you some idea of what her correspondence is like . " I dreamed an entire movie last night , " she wrote , " not a scenario but a movie in full color about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went back to the garden of the old house in Indiana and found everything the way I 'd left it . Even the flowers I 'd cut so many years ago were on the back porch , quite fresh . There it all was , not as I might remember it , for my memory is failing these days and I could n't recall anything in such detail , but as a gift to me from some part of my spirit more profound than my memory . And after that I dreamed that I took a train . Out of the window I could see blue water and blue sky . I was n't quite sure of where I was going but looking through my handbag I found an invitaton to spend a weekend with Robert Frost . Of course he 's dead and buried and I do n't suppose we would have gotten along for more than five minutes butp154it seemed like some dispensation or bounty of my imaginationto have invented such a visit . " My memory is failing in some quarters but in others it seems quite tenacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seem to hear music all the time . There is music running through my mind when I wake and it plays all day long . What mystifies me is the variety in quality . Sometimes I wake to the slow movement of the first Razurnovsky . You know how I love that . I may have a Vivaldi concerto for breakfast and some Mozart a little later . But sometimes I wake to a frightful Sousa march followed by a chewing gum commercial and a theme from Chopin . I loathe Chopin . Why should my memory torment me by playing music that I loathe ? At times my memory seems to reward me ; at times it seems vindictive and , while I 'm speaking of memory , I must mention little Jamsie . Jamsie is her Border terrier . I was waked one night last week at about three by a curioussound . As you know Jamsie sleeps beside my bed and Jamsie was making the noise . She was counting . I distinctlyheard her counting . She counted from one to twelve . After this she did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course but I clearly heard her go through the alphabet . I know you 'll think I 'm mad but if porpoisescan talk why not Jamsie ? When she finished the alphabet I woke her . She seemed a little embarrassed at having been caught at her lessons but then she smiled at me and we both went back to sleep . " I suppose you think all of this foolish but at least Ip155do n't go in for Tarot cards or astrology and I do not , as my friend Elizabeth Howland does , feel that my windshieldwiper gives me sage and coherent advice on my stock market investme%ts . She claimed only last month that her windshield wiper urged her to invest in Merck Chemicals which she did , making a profit of several thousand . I suppose she lies about her losses as gamblersalways do . As I say , windshield wipers do n't speak to meitbut I do hear music in the most unlikely places  --  especially in the motors of airplanes . Accustomed as I am to the faint drone of transoceanic jets it has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old DC-7s and Constellations that I take to Portugal andGeneva . Once these planes are airborne the harmonics of I ' . their engines sound to my ears like some universal music as random and free of reference and time as the makings of a dream . It is far from jubilant music but one would be making a mistake to call it sad . The sounds of a Constellationseem to me more contrapuntal  --  and in a way less universal than a DC-7 . I can trace , as clearly as anything I ever heard in a concert hall , the shift from a major to a diminished seventh , the ascent to an eighth , the reductionto a minor and the resolution of the chord . The sounds have the driving and processional sense of baroquemusic but they will never , I know from experience , reach a climax and a resolution . The church I attended as a girl in Indiana employed an organist who had never completed his musical education because of financial difficulties or a wayward inability to persevere . Hep156played the organ with some natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of things , what had started out as a forthright and vigorous fugue would collapse into formlessness and vulgarity . The Constellations seem to suffer from the same musical irresolution , the same wayward inability to persevere . The first , second and third voices of the fugue are sounded clearly but then , as with the organist , the force of invention collapses into a series of harmonic meanderings . The engines of a DC-7 seem both more comprehensiveand more limited . One night on a flight to Frankfurt I distinctly heard the props get halfway through Gounod'svulgar variations of Bach . I have also heard Handel 's Water Music , the death theme from Tosca , the opening of the Messiah , etc . But boarding a DC-7 one night in Innsbruck  --  the intense cold may have made the difference  --  I distinctly heard the engines produce some exalting synthesis of all life 's sounds  --  boats and train whistles and the creaking of iron gates and bedsprings and drums and rainwinds and thunder and footsteps and the sounds of singing all seemed woven into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked us to observe the No Smoking sign ( Nicht Rauchen ) , an announcement that has come to mean to me that if I am not at home I am at least at my destination . " Of course I know that you think all of this unimportant . It is no secret to me that you would have preferred a more conventional mother  --  someone who sent you baked goods and remembered your birthday  --  but itp157seems to me that in our knowledge and study of one another we are circumspect and timid to an impractical degree . In our struggle to glimpse the soul of a man  --  and have we ever desired anything more  --  we claim to have the honesty of desperation whereas in fact we set up whole artificial structures of acceptable reality and stubbornlyrefuse to admit the terms by which we live . I will , before I end my letter , bore you with one more observationof fact . What I have to say must be well known to most travelers and yet I would not dare confide my knowledge to an intimate friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think me mad I suppose no harm can be done . " I have noticed , in my travels , that the strange beds I occupy in hotels and pensions have a considerable variancein atmosphere and a profound influence on my dreams . It is a simple fact that we impress something of ourselves  --  our spirits and our desires  --  on the mattresses where we lie and I have more than ample evidence to prove my point . One night in Naples last winter I dreamed of washing a drip-dry wardrobe which is , as you well know , something I would never do . The dream was quite explicit  --  I could see the articles of clothing hangingin the shower and smell the wet cloth although this is no part of my memories . When I woke I seemed surrounded by an atmosphere unlike my own  --  shy , earnest and chaste . There was definitely some presence in the room . In the morning I asked the desk clerk who had last occupied my bed . He checked his records and said that itp158had last been occupied by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to a smaller room but who could then be seen coming out of the dining room . I then turned to see Miss Lowell , whose white drip-dry dress I had already seen in my dreams and whose shy , chaste and earnest spirit still lingered in the room she had left . You will put this down to coincidence , I know , but let me go on . Sometime later , in Geneva , I found myself in a bed that seemed to exhale so unsavory and venereal an atmosphere that my dreams were quite disgusting . In them I saw two naked men , mounted like a horse and rider . In the morning I asked the desk clerk who the earlier tenants had been and he said : " Oui , oui , deux tapettes . " They had made so much noise they had been asked to leave . After this I made a practice of deciding who the previous occupant of my bed had been and then checking with the clerk in the morning . In every case I was correct  --  in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cooperate . In cases involving prostitutes they were sometimes unwilling to help . If I found no presence in my bed I would judge that the bed had been vacant for a week or ten days . I was always correct . Traveling that year I shared the dreams of businessmen , tourists , married couples , chaste and orderly people as well as whores . My most remarkable experiencecame in Munich in the spring . " I stayed , as I always do , at the Bristol , and I dreamed about a sable coat . As you know I detest furs but I saw this coat in great detail  --  the cut of the collar , the honey/colored skins , the yellow silk with which it was lined and in one of the silk pockets a pair of ticket stubs for the opera . In the morning I asked the maid who brought me coffee if the previous occupant of the room had owned a fur coat . The maid clasped her hands together , rolled her eyes and said yes , yes , it was a Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maid , had ever seen . The woman had loved her coat . It was like a lover to her . And did the woman who owned the coat , I asked , stirring my coffee and trying to seem unexceptional , ever go to the opera ? Oh yes , yes , said the maid , she came for the Mozart festival and went to the opera every night for two weeks , wearing her sable coat . " I was not deeply perplexed  --  I have always known life to be overwhelmingly mysterious  --  but would n't you say that I possess indisputable proof of the fact that we leave fragments of ourselves , our dreams and our spirits in the rooms where we sleep ? But what could I do with this information . If I confided my discovery to a friend I would likely be thought mad and was there , after all , any usefulness in my ability to divine that my bed had been occupied by a spinster or a prostitute or by no one at all ? ' Was I gifted or were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a misnomer for a faculty that could not be exploited ? I have finally concluded that the universality of our dreams includes everything  --  articles of clothing and theater ticket stubs  --  and if we truly know one another so intimately might n't we be closer than we imagine to a peaceable world ? "  |p160I  grew up in Grandmother 's house in Ashburnham and went to a country day school . I took my meals in the pantry until I was ten or eleven , when I was elevated to the big dinner table . There were usually guests . It was a time of life when the conversation of adults seemed painfullytiresome . I guess I was sulky . Anyhow Grandmotherlectured me . " Now that you 're old enough to dine at my table , " she said , " I expect you to make some contribution to the conversation . When people gather in the evening they gather to dine but they also gather to exchangeopinions , experiences and information . We learn something every day , do n't we ? We see something interestingevery day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be interesting to me and my guests and I want you to take a more active part in the conversation . " I asked to be returned to the pantry but Grandmother did n't seem to hear me and I was nervousp161when I went to the table that night . The talk rattled on and then Grandmother smiled at me to signify that my turn had come . All I could remember was that walking home from school I saw a lady in the public park stealing marigolds . When she heard my footstep she hid the marigoldsunder her coat . As soon as I passed she went on picking flowers . " I saw a lady in the park , " I said , " stealing marigolds . " " Is that all you saw , " asked Grandmother . " I saw the basketball game . " The adults picked up the talk again but I knew I had failed and would have to prepare myself . I was taking a course in ancient history and I began each night to memorizethe gist of two pages from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " that stretched from the Black Sea to the western shores of the Mediterranean , none approachedAthens , and the man responsible for this achievement was Pericles . . . " The next night we had Solon in Sardis and the night after that we had the Athenianconstitution . At the end of the week Grandmother said kindly : " I guess perhaps it would be better if you listened to the conversation . " Grandmother was rich , and I wo n't go into this . She was a stout women with a plain face but the fact that she happened never to have worried about money had left her , even as an old woman , with an uncommon freshness . She seemed through luck and money to have missed one of the principal sources of anxiety . We were great friends although I sometimes teased her . When I was aboutp162twelve  --  I had n't gone away to school  --  she was expectingfor dinner an English earl named Penwright . Titles excited her and for some reason her excitement about the arrival of Lord Penwright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend the dinner . I learned that we were going to have oysters and I walked into the village and bought a large phony pearl at Woolworth 's . I had Olga , the waitress , put this into one of the oysters on Lord Penwright 's plate . There were maybe twelve people at the table and we were all chatting when Lord Penwright exclaimed , " Oh , my word , " or " I say , " and held up his pearl . It was the biggest pearl that Woolworth 's had and it looked , in the candlelight , priceless . " What a charming favor , " said his lordship . " Hmmm , " said Grandmother . Her face , usually quite bright , was troubled . " I shall have it set and give it to my wife , " said the lord . " But it 's my pearl , " Grandmother said . " This is my house . These are my oysters . The pearl is mine . " " I had n't quite thought of it that way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearl to Grandmother . As soon as she had it in her hands she saw that it was Woolworth 's and , turning to me at the end of the table , she said , " Go to your room . " I went to the kitchen , had dinner and then went to my room . She never mentioned the pearl again but things between us were never the same . I was sent away to school in September.  |p163Grandmother  died in my last year at school and I had no place to go for Christmas . I had plenty of friends , as I recall , but I either did n't receive any Christmas invitationsor I did n't accept any . I was left alone in the dormitory when school closed for the holidays . I was terriblylonely in the empty building and felt that my illegitimacywas a cruel injustice . Everyone else in school had at least one parent while I had none . It seemed that my father could at least buy me a beer on the Christmas holidays . That 's all I wanted from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston and I flew to Boston that night . I found his name in one of the suburban telephonedirectories and drove out to Dedham , where he lived . I was just going to ask him to buy me a beer . That 's really all I had in mind . I rang the bell and when his wife opened the door I was surprised to see a very homely white-haired woman . Her face was sallow and her teethp164were long but having so little or nothing at all to do with physical charm she seemed to have mustered another kind of charm . She seemed kindly and intelligent . Her mouth was large and thin-lipped but her smile was beautiful . I said that I was Paul Hammer and that I wanted to see Mr. Taylor . I think she knew who I was . She said he was in the city . " He went in for a party on Wednesday , " she said , " and when he goes to a party it 's usually several days before he returns . He stays at the Ritz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was happy to have him out of the house . I thanked her and drove to the Ritz . He was registered but he did n't answer the house phone and I took the elevator up to his floor . He did n't answer the doorbell either , but the door was unlocked and I went in . There had been a party all right . The living room was full of the usual empty bottles and dirty glasses without which you ca n't , after all , have a party . He was in the bedroom . There were two unmade beds , both of which had seen some venereal mileage . He lay on one in a poleaxed , drunken sleep , naked . Around his neck he wore a chain of champagne corks  --  seventeen  --  which I guessed some friend had put there after he had stoned out . He was over fifty then but weight-lifting had paid off and if you could n't see very well you might think he was a much younger man . He was lithe , really lithe , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto his bed by liquor , like the faded figure of somep165Icarus or Ganymede that you might find painted on the wall of some old-fashioned , second-rate Italian restaurant , flyspecked and badly drawn . I do n't think he would have waked if I 'd shouted in his ears , and anyhow he needed the sleep . I was that charitable . I was even more charitable . He was my father , the author with some collaboration of my heart , vitals , lights and mind , and how far could a man go with such a creator ? I could kill him , I could abuse him and I could forgive him but I had to do something so I settled on an uneasy brand of forgivenessand went away . My next stop was Kitzbiihel . If my father would n't buy me a beer maybe I could get a cup of tea out of Mother . We speak of travel  --  world travel  --  as if it were the most natural human condition . " Mr. X , " we read , " then traveled from Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth ! I got an evening plane for London at Logan Airport . The plane was delayed and I drank five martinis at the airport bar and crossed the Atlantic in a drunken stupor . We got to London at daybreak , where I discovered that my bag had been lost . I wandered around the airport until three that afternoon when my bag was found and took a cab to the Dorchester . I tried , unsuccessfully , to get some sleep and then went out to a movie and got stoned at a pub . I had tickets for an earlymorningflight to Frankfurt-am-Main but there was a thick fog over London that morning and when I got to the airport everything was grounded . It was announced at half-hour intervals that the fog was expected to lift . Ip166ate my complimentary breakfast . Then I ate my complimentarylunch . At three o'clock the airport was declared closed for the day . I went back to the Dorchester but there were no rooms and after trying four other hotels I ended up in a rooming house in Parkman Square where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not choose to describe . In the morning it was still foggy but it seemed to be lifting and I returned to the airport . I drank a cup of abominable coffee and a glass of orangecoloredwater . The effect of this on my digestion was galvanic and I quick-stepped to the men 's room . I had been there about fifteen minutes when I heard my flight announced . I pulled up my pants , ran the length of the airport and just caught the Frankfurt plane . My digestive troubles were not over and I spent the flight from Londonto Frankfurt in the toilet . Lighted signs in three languagescommanded me to return to my seat but how could I ? In Frankfurt , where I got a plane for Innsbruck , it was very cold . In Innsbruck I got the Transalpini to Kitzbiihel , arriving at my destination at four in the afternoon , but I did not , in fact , seem to have arrived anywhere . I seemed merely to have scattered my guts and vitals a third of the way around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The facade of the wooden building was decked with horns and I wondered if the Tyrolese had failed to make the connection with cuckoldry or was it that kind of a pension ? When I asked to see my mother they seemed astonished . She was a Fraulein . A maid went upstairs and broughtp167Mother down . She cried with delight when she saw me and I took her in my arms . Her hair had begun to turn gray but she was not heavy . The color of her eyes remained a brilliant blue . " Have you come for Christmas , Paul , " she asked . " Have you come to spend Christmas with your mother ? I usually go to the Estoril long before this but there has n't been any snow this year and so I 'm simply hanging on until the first flakes fall . " They gave me a room next to hers and we went upstairstogether . She made some tea on a spirit lamp and poured me a cup . Then the door flew open and a bony woman flew in , exclaiming : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugarbowl yesterday at teatime and you neglected to return it . " " But I did return your sugarbowl , " my mother said politely . " I put it on your bookshelf . You 'll find it there . " When the stranger had left Mother turned to me and asked : " How is your horrid country ? " " It 's not horrid , Mother , " I said , " and it 's your coun-try . " " It 's true that I travel on an American passport , " she said , " but that 's merely the sort of compromise one has to strike in dealing with a bureaucracy . It is , however , a horrid place . When I was in the Socialist Party with your father I said again and again that if American capitalism continued to exalt mercenary and dishonest men the economy would degenerate into the manufacture of drugs and ways of life that would make reflection  --  anyp168sort of thoughtfulness or emotional depth  --  impossible .

" Well I was , " she said . " I did n't call you . " " It does n't matter , " I said . " I knew it would n't , " she said harshly . " Well , to make a long story short , I went out to see some friends in Los Angeles and they took me for a ride on the freeway and here I saw another example of forgetfulness , suicide , municipal corruption and the debauchery of natural resources .

At first I thought someone had joined her after I 'd left but then I could tell by the level of her voice that she was talking to herself . I could hear her clearly . " My father was a common quarry worker , often unemployed . I had read somewhere that the trajectory of a person 's career could be plotted from their beginnings and given such humble beginnings I thought that if I accepted them I would end up as a waitress in a diner or at best a small-town librarian . I kept trying to tamper with my origins so that I would have more latitude for a career . Having been raised in a small town I was terrified of being confined to one . . . " I went down the hall and opened her door . She had taken off her shoes and was lying on her bed , fully dressed , talking to the ceiling or the air . " What in the world are you doing , Mother ?

Now , three times a week , I lie down on my bed and talk to myself for an hour . I 'm very frank . I do n't spare myself any unpleasantness . The therapy seems to be quite effectiveand , of course , it does n't cost me a cent . I still have three quarters of an hour to go and if you do n't mind leaving me alone . . .

When I sleep on my abdomen ... " I went back to my room and packed , the only son of a male caryatid holding up the three top floors of the Mercedes Hotel and a crazy old woman . I left her a note saying that I had suddenly gotten restless . To appear and disappear did not seem to me a dirty trick . I had the feeling that she was so wrapped up in her own eccentricitiesthat she would hardly notice my going . I got a cab to the station and began my travels again . I was back in London that night in time for dinner . That was the twenty-third of December . After dinner I took a walk . It was snowing . I passed a theater or movie house where an evangelist , whose name I ca n't remember , was holding ap171meeting . I went in out of curiosity . The hall was about half full . The evangelist was a plain man dressed plainly in gray  --  not ugly  --  but possessing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bulbous and red . His lips were delicate and thin . His hair and his ears seemed to have been slapped on as an afterthought . The house lights were on and I looked around at the congregation . There were plenty of rooming-house types  --  lonely old men and lonely old women whose devotions would be rooted in stupidity and boredom  --  but there were also clear faces , young faces , the faces of men and women putting up some creditable struggle for peace of mind . The ardor with which they bowed their heads in prayer and the sense of shared humanity moved me deeply . It seemed to me then that the cruel burdens of insularity , suspicion , loneliness , fear and worry had been lifted . Life was natural and we , together , were natural men and women . A man beside me seemed to plunge into the attitudes of prayer . At the end of the exhortation we were asked to come to the front of the theater , confess our sins and be forgiven . The congregation then , in small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were blessed . As they turned away , after the blessing , many of their faces were radiant , and what point would there be in my asking how long their exaltation would last ? They must return , many of them , to empty rooms , the care of invalids , bankrupt marriages , contumely , ridicule and despair , but some promise had been made . I went down thep172aisle myself with one of the last groups . Oh Father I have sinned . I ate more than my share of the sandwiches at the picnic . I have performed every known form of carnal indecency . I left my new bicycle out in the rain . I do not love my parents . I have admired myself in a looking glass . Cleanse and forgive me most merciful Father . Then , standing there with my head bowed , I felt completelycleansed and forgiven . Life was simple , natural , a privilege . My life had a purpose although it was not revealed to me until later . I walked happily back to the hotel.  |p173In  my sophomore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my name changed from Paul Hammer to Robert Levy . I 'm not quite sure why . Hammer , of course , was no name at all . Levy had for me a pure and simple sound and , belonging really to no community , I suppose I hoped to insinuate myself into the Jewish community . My lawyer spoke eloquently of the fact that I had been born out of wedlock and had been named for a humble and rudimentary tool that had been seen passing a window . The judge , whose name was Weinstock , refusedmy petition . The New Haven paper carried the story , including the origin of my name , and as a result I was dropped from the social register and lost at least a dozen friends . I have always been astonished to find that bastardy remains a threat to organized society . I 'll skip school and college . When I was twenty-four and living in Cleveland I invested fifty thousand dollarsp174of the money Grandmother left me in a publishing house run by a man I 'd known in college . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of a year we mortgaged our firm to a larger publishing house who , six months later , foreclosed the mortgage and copped my investment . I do n't think there was any connection  --  Istill had an adequate income  --  but at about this time I began to suffer from melancholy  --  a cafard  --  a form of despair that sometimes seemed to have a tangible approach . Once or twice , I think , I seemed to glimpse some of its physical attributes . It was covered with hair  --  it was the classical bete noire  --  but it was as a rule no more visible than a moving column of thin air . I decided then to move to New York and translate the poetry of Eugenio Montale . I took a furnished apartment , but I seemed to know almost no one in the city and this left me alone much of the time and much of the time with my cafard . It overtook me on trains and planes . I would wake feeling healthy and full of plans , to be crushed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coffee . It was most powerful and I was most vulnerable when the noise of traffic woke me at dawn . My best defense , my only defense , was to cover my head with a pillow and summon up those images that represented for me the excellence and beauty I had lost . The first of these was a mountain  --  it was obviously Kilimanjaro . The summit was a perfect , snow-covered cone , lighted by a passing glow . I saw the mountain a thousand times  --  I begged top175see it  --  and as I grew more familiar with it I saw the fire of a primitive village at its base . The vision dated , I guess , from the bronze or the iron age . Next in frequency I saw a fortified medieval town . It could have been MontSt-Michelor Orvieto or the grand lamasery in Tibet but the image of the walled town , like the snow-covered mountain , seemed to represent beauty , enthusiasm and love . I also saw less frequently and less successfully a river with grassy banks . I guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrive at and at one point it seemed to me that a railroad track or a thruwayhad destroyed the beauty of the place . I had begun to drink heavily to lick the cafard and one morning  --  I had been in New York for about a month  --  I took a hooker of gin while I shaved . I then went back to bed again , covered my head with a pillow and tried to evoke the mountain , the fortified town or the green fields , but I saw instead a pale woman wearing a shirt with light-blue stripes . I seemed to feel for her deeply and clearly during the moment or two that I saw her but then she vanished . I stayed in bed that day until eleven or later , when i went out to the corner drugstore and ordered some breakfast . The place had begun to fill up with the lunchhourcrowd and the noise and the smells nauseated me . I drank some coffee and orange juice and went back to my apartment and had another drink . I was drinking straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third drink and went out once more to see if I could n't eat something.  |p176This  time I went to a French restaurant where my alcoholicfastidiousness would not be offended . I ordered a martini , some pate and a plate of scrambled eggs and was able to get this down . Then I returned to my apartment , undressed and got back into bed again , pulling the covers over my face . I hated the light of day , it seemed to be the essence of my cafard , as if darkness would lessen my frustrations , as if the night were a guise of forgetfulness . I stayed in bed , neither sleeping nor waking . When I dressed again and went out onto the street it was beginning to get dark . I went back to the French restaurant , where I had some snails and a beef filet , and then went to a movie . It was a spy movie and seemed so old-fashioned that it undermined my already feeble sense of time and reality . I left halfway through the movie and went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took a couple of sleeping pills and stayed in bed until two the next afternoon , when I dressed and went out to the restaurant and had another plate of scrambled eggs . I then returned to bed and stayed there until ten the next morning . What I wanted then was a long , long , long sleep and I had enough pills to accomplish this . I flushed the pills down the toilet and called one of my few friends and asked for the name of his doctor . I then called the doctor and asked him for the name of a psychiatrist . He recommendeda man named Doheny . Doheny saw me that afternoon . His waiting room had a large collection of magazines but the ashtrays were clean , the cushions were unrumpled and I had the feelingp177that perhaps I was his first customer in a long time . Was he , I wondered , an unemployed psychiatrist , an unsuccessfulpsychiatrist , an unpopular psychiatrist , did he wile away the time in an empty office like an idle lawyer , barber or antique dealer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was furnished with antiques . I wondered then if some part of a psychiatrist 's education was the furnishing of his consultation room . Did they do it themselves ? Did their wives do it ? Was it done by a professional ? Doheny had large brown eyes in a long face . When I sat in the patient 's chair he turned the beam of his brown eye onto me exactly as a dentist turns on the light above his drills and for the next fifty minutes I basked in his gaze and returned his looks earnestlyto prove that I was truthful and manly . He seemed , like some illusion of drunkenness , to have two faces and I found it fascinating to watch one swallow up the other . He charged a dollar a minute . After our fourth or fifth consultation he asked me to masturbate when I got home and report my reactions to him . I did as he asked and reported that I had felt ashamed of myself . He was delighted with this news and said that it proved that sexual guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repressed transvestite homosexual . I had told him about Daddy posing for Fledspar and he told me that this image of a naked man supporting hotels , palaces of justice and opera houses had intimidated me and forced me into an unnatural way of life . I told him to go to hell and said that I was through . I said that he wasp178a charlatan and that I was going to report him to the American Psychiatric Society . If he was n't a charlatan why did n't he have diplomas hung on his wall like other doctors ? He got very angry at this , threw open his desk drawer and pulled out a pile of diplomas . He had diplomasfrom Yale , Columbia and the Neurological Hospital . Then I noticed that all these documents were made out to a man named Howard Shitz and I asked if he had n't picked them up in a secondhand bookstore . He said he had changed his name when he went into practice for reasons that any dunce would understand . I left . I was no better after Doheny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously if the ubiquity of my father 's head and shoulders carved in limestone had not been crippling ; but if it had been what could I do ? The opera house in Malsburg and the Prinz-Regenten had been demolished but I could n't remove him from his position on upper Broadway and he was still holding up the Mercedesin Frankfurt . I went on drinking  --  more than a quart a day  --  and my hands had begun to shake terribly . When I went into a bar I would wait until the bartender turned his back before I tried to get the glass up to my mouth . I sometimes spilled gin all over the bar . This amused the other customers . I went out to Pennsylvania one weekend with some heavy-drinking friends and came back on a social train that got me into Penn Station at about eleven Sunday night . The station was then being razed and reconstructed and it was such a complex of ruins that it seemed like a frightening projection of myp179own confusions and I stepped out into the street , looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightly lighted for a man whose hands were shaking and I started walking east , looking for some dark saloon where my infirmity would not be so noticeable . Walking down a side street I saw two lighted windows and a room with yellow walls . The windows were uncurtained . All I could see were the yellow walls . I put down my suitcase to stare at the windows . I was convinced that whoever lived there lived a useful and illustrious life . It would be a single man like myself but a man with a continent nature , a ruling intelligence , an efficient disposition . The pair of windows filled me with shame . I wanted my life to be not merely decent but exemplary . I wanted to be useful , continentand at peace . If I could not change my habits I could at least change my environment and I thought that if I found such a room with yellow walls I would cure my cafard and my drunkenness . The next afternoon I packed a bag and took a cab across town to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin my illustrious life . They gave me a room on the second floor , looking out onto an airshaft . The room had not been made up . There was an empty whiskey bottle and two glasses on the bureau and only one of the two beds had been used . I called the desk to complain and they said the only other vacancy they had was a suite on the tenth floor . I then moved to this . I found a parlor , a double bedroom and a large collection of flower pictures . I ordered some gin , vermouth and ap180bucket of ice and got stoned . This was not what I intended to do and in the morning I moved to the Hotel Madison . My room at the Madison was furnished with the kind of antiques Doheny had had in his consultation room . It only lacked the colored photographs of his three children . The desk , or some part of it , had once been a spinet . The coffee table was covered with leather that had been tooled , gilded and burned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that I could not escape my own image . I saw myself smoking , drinking , dressing and undressing and when I woke in the morning the first thing I saw was myself . I left the next day for the Waldorf , where I was given a pleasant , high-ceilinged room . There was a broad view . I could see the dome of St. Bartholomew 's , the Seagram Building and one of those yellow bifurcated buildings that has a terraced and windowed front and a flat , yellow-brick backside with no sign of life but a rain gutter . It seemed to have been sliced with a knife . Almost anywhere in New York above the fifteenth floor your view includes a few caryatids , naiads , homely water tanks and Florentine arches and I was admiring these when it occurred to me how easy it would be to escape the cafard by jumping into the street and I checked out of the Waldorf and took a plane to Chicago . In Chicago I took a room at the Palmer House . This was on the sixteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period but the more I examined it thep181more it seemed to be an inoffensive improvisation and then I realized that it was the same furniture I had seen in my room at the Waldorf . I flipped open the venetian blinds . My window looked out into an enclosure where I could see , upwards , downwards and sidewise , a hundred , hundred windows exactly like mine . The fact that m ) " room had no uniqueness seemed seriously to threaten my own uniqueness . I suffered an intense emotional vertigo . The fear was not of falling but of vanishing . If there was nothing in my room to distinguish it from a hundred , hundred others there might be nothing about me to set me apart from other men , and I snapped the venetian blinds shut and went out of the room . Waiting for the elevator a man gave me that bland , hopeful gaze of a faggot on the make and I thought that he might have been driven by the sameness of the hotel windows to authenticate his identity by unnatural sexual practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downstairs I drank three martinis and went to a movie . I stayed in Chicago two days and took the Zephyr to San Francisco . I thought a train compartment might be the environment where I could begin my new life but it was not . In San Francisco I stayed two nights at the Palace and two nights at the St. Francis and then flew down the coast and checked in at the Los Angeles Biltmore . This was the furthest from what I wanted and I moved from there to the Chateau Marmont . I moved from there to the BeverlyHills and a day later took a plane to London on the northerly route . I tried to get a room at the Connaughtp182but they were full and so I went instead to the Dorchesterwhere I lasted two days . I then flew to Rome and checked in at the Eden . My cafard had followed me around the world and I was still drinking heavily . Lying in bed in the Eden one morning with a pillow over my face I summoned up Kilimanjaro and its ancient village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to me then that I had thought the town might be Orvieto . I rented a Fiat from the concierge and started north . It was after lunch when I got into Umbria and I stopped in a walled town and had some pasta and wine . The country was wheat country , more heavily forested than most of Italy and very green . Like most travelers I kept stupidly observing the sameness of things , kept tellingmyself that on the evidence of what I saw I might be in New Hampshire or the outskirts of Heidelberg . What for ? It was nearly seven o'clock when I came down the winding road into the broad valley that surrounds Orvieto . I had been wrong about the towers but everything else seemed right . The city was high , its buildings seemed to be a variation of the stone butte and it looked like the place I had seen in fending off the cafard . It seemed to correspond to my vision . I was excited . My life , my sanity were involved . The papal cathedral , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , awe , admirationand something like dread as if some part of my memorywas that of a heretic on my way to be questioned by the bishops . I drove through the lower town up to thep183city on the butte and checked in at the Hotel Nazionale where I was given a large , deluxe European room with a massive armoire and a glass chandelier . It was riot the room I was looking for . I wandered around the streets and just before dark , in a building not far from the cathedral , I saw the lighted windows and the yellow walls . I seemed , looking up at them from the sidewalk , to be standing at the threshold of a new life . This was not a sanctuary , this was the vortex of things , but this was a place where the cafard could not enter . The door of the building was open and I climbed some stairs . The pair of yellow rooms was on the second floor . They were unfurnished , as I knew they would be , and freshly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man putting up shelves for my books . I spoke to the man and asked him who the rooms belonged to . He said they were his . I asked if they were for sale or for rent and he smiled and said no . Then I said I wanted them and would pay whatever he asked for them but he went on smiling and saying no . Then I heard some men in the hallway , carrying something heavy . I could hear their strained voices , their breathing , and the object , whatever it was , bumping against the wall . It was a large bed , which they carried into the second of the yellow rooms . The owner explained to me then that this was his marriagebed . He was going to be married next day in the chapel of the cathedral and begin his married life here . I was still so convinced that the rooms were , spiritually at least , my property that I asked him if he would n't preferp184to live in one of the new apartments in the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was prepared to give him a large present for the wedding . He was impervious , of course . Like any groom , he had imagined so many hundreds of times the hour when he would bring his bride back to the yellow rooms that no amount of money would dislodge the memory from its place in his mind . I wished him well anyhow and went down the stairs . I had found my yellow rooms and I had lost them . I left Orvieto in the morning for Rome and left Rome the next day for New York . I spent one night in my apartment during which I drank a quart of whiskey . The next afternoon I drove out to Pennsylvania to visit a classmate of mine  --  Charlie Masterson  --  and his wife . There were heavy drinkers and we ran out of gin before dinner . I drove into the little village of Blenville and bought a fresh supply at the liquor store and started back . I made a wrong turn and found myself on a narrow red dirt lane that seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the road and a little above it , I saw the yellow walls for the third time . I turned off the motor and the lights and got out of the car . There was a brook between the road and the house and I crossed this on a wooden bridge . A lawn or a field  --  the grass needed cutting  --  sloped up to a terrace . The house was stone  --  rectangular  --  an old Pennsylvania farmhouse , and the yellow room was the only room lighted . The walls were the same color I had seen in Orvieto . Ip185went up onto the terrace , as absorbed as any thief . A woman sat in the yellow room , reading a book . She wore a black dress and high-heeled shoes and had a glass of whiskey on a table at her side . Her face was pale and handsome . I guessed she was in her twenties . The black dress and the high-heeled shoes seemed out of place An the country and I wondered if she had just arrived from town or were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass made this seem unlikely . But it was not the woman but the room I wanted  --  square , its lemon-yellow walls simply lighted  --  and I felt that if I could only possessthis I would be myself again , industrious and decent . She looked up suddenly as if she sensed my presence and I stepped away from the window . I was very happy . Walking back to the car I saw the name Emmison painted on a mailbox at the end of the driveway . I found my way back to the Mastersons ' and asked Mrs. Mastersonif she knew anyone named Emmison . " Sure , " she said . " Dora Emmison . I think she 's in Reno . " " Her house was lighted , " I said . " What in the world were you doing at her house ? " " I got lost . " " Well she was in Reno . I suppose she 's just come back . Do you know her ? " she asked . " No , " I said , " but I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll ask her for a drink tomorrow . " She came the next afternoon , wearing the black dressand the same high heels . She was a little reserved but Ifound her fascinating , not because of her physical andp186intellectual charms but because she owned the yellow rooms . She stayed for supper and I asked about her house . I presently asked if she would n't like to sell it . She was not at all interested . Then I asked if I could see the house and she agreed indifferently . She was leaving early and if I wanted to see the place I could come back with her and so I did . As soon as I stepped into the yellow room I felt that peace of mind I had coveted when I first saw the walls in a walkup near Pennsylvania Station . Sometimes you step into a tackroom , a carpenter 's shop or a country post office and find yourself unexpectedly at peace with the world . It is usually late in the day . The place has a fine smell ( I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or baker has a face so clear , so free of trouble that you feel that nothing bad has ever or will ever happenhere , a sense of fitness and sanctity never achieved , in my experience , by any church . She gave me a drink and I asked again if she would sell the place . " Why should I sell my house , " she asked . " I like my house . It 's the only house I have . If you want a place in the neighborhood the Barkham place is on the market and it 's really much more attractive than this . " " This is the house I want . " " I do n't see why you 're so crazy about this place . If I had a choice I 'd rather have the Barkham place . " " Well I 'll buy the Barkham place and exchange it for this . " " I simply do n't want to move , " she said . She looked at her watch.  | " Could I sleep here , " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " " But what do you want to sleep here for ? The sofa 's hard as a rock . " " I 'd just like to . " " Well I guess you can if you want to . No monkey busi-ness . " " No monkey business . " " I 'll get some bedding . " She went upstairs and came down with some sheets and a blanket and made my bed . " I think I 'll turn in myself , " she said , going towards the stairs . " I guess you know where everything is . If you want another drink there 's some ice in the bucket . I think my husband left a razor in the medicine cabinet . Good night . " Her smile was courteous and no more . She climbed the stairs . I did n't make a drink . I did n't , as they say , need one . I sat in a chair by the window feeling the calm of the yellow walls restore me . Outside I could hear the brook , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night world seemed endearing as if I quite literally loved the night as one loves a woman , loved the stars , the trees , the weeds in the grass as one can love with the same ardor a woman 's breasts and the apple core she has left in an ashtray . I loved it all and everyone who lived . My life had begun again and I could see , from this beginning , how far I had gone from any natural course . Here was the sense of reality  --  a congenial , blessed and useful construction to which I belonged . I stepped out onto thep188terrace . It was cloudy but some stars could still be seen . The wind was shifting and smelled of rain . I walked down to the bridge , undressed and dove into a pool there . The water was buoyant and a little brackish from the bogs in which it rose , but it had , so unlike the disinfectedsapphire of a pool , a strong and unmistakably erotic emphasis . I dried myself on my shirttails and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth were paved for my contentment . I brushed my teeth , turned out the light , and as I got into my bed it began to rain . For a year or more the sound of the rain had meant merely umbrellas , raincoats , rubbers , the wet seats of convertibles , but now it seemed like some enlargement of my happiness , some additional bounty . It seemed to increasemy feeling of limberness and innocence and I fended off sleep to listen to it with the attention and curiosity with which we follow music . When I did sleep I dreamed in this order of the mountain , the walled town and the banks of the river and when I woke at dawn there was no trace of the cafard . I dove into the pool again and dressed . In the kitchen I found a melon , made some coffee and fried some bacon . The smell of coffee and bacon seemed like a smell of newness and I ate with a good appetite . She came down later in a bathrobe and thanked me for having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips her hand shook so that the coffee spilled . She went into the pantry , returned with a bottle of whiskey and spiked her coffee . She neither apologizedp189or explained this but the spike steadied her hand . I asked her if she would n't like me to cut the grass . " Well I would frankly , " she said , " if you do n't have anything betterto do . It 's terribly hard to find anyone around here to do anything . All the young men leave home and all the old ones die . The mower 's in the toolshed and I think there 's some gasoline . " I found the mower and gasoline and cut the grass . It was a big lawn and this took me until noon or later . She was sitting on the terrace reading and drinking something  --  icewater or gin . I joined her , wondering how I could build my usefulness into indispensability . I could have made a pass at her but if we became lovers this would have meant sharing the yellow room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a sandwich before you go there 's some ham and cheese in the refrigerator , " she said . " A friend of mine is coming out on the four-o'clock but I suppose you 'll want to go back before then . " I was frightened . Go back , go back , go back to the greasy green waters of the Lethe , back to my contemptible cowardice , back to the sanctuary of my bed where I coweredbefore thin air , back to anesthetizing myself with gin in order to eat a plate of scrambled eggs . I wondered about the sex of her visitor . If it was a woman might n't I stay on as a sort of handyman , eating my supper in the kitchen and sleeping in the yellow room ? " If there 's anything else you 'd like me to do , " I said . " Firewood ? " " I buy my firewood in Blenville . " " Would you like me to split some kindling ? "  | " Not really , " she said . " The screen door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could repair that . " She did n't seem to hear me . She went into the house and returned a little later with two sandwiches . " Would you like mustard ? " she asked . " No thank you , " I said . I took the sandwich as a kind of sacrament since it would be the last thing I could approach with any appetiteuntil I returned to the yellow room and when would that be ? I was desperate . " Is your visitor a man or a woman , " I asked . " I really do n't think that concerns you , " she said . " I 'm sorry . " " Thank you for cutting the grass , " she said . " That needed to be done but you must understand that I ca n't have a strange man sleeping on my sofa without a certain amount of damage to my reputation and my reputation is n't absolutely invincible . " " I 'll go , " I said . I drove back to New York then , condemned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as I closed the door of my apartment I fell into the old routine of gin , Kilimanjaro , scrambled eggs , Orvietoand the Elysian Fields . I stayed in bed until late the next morning . I drank some gin while I shaved and went out onto the street to get some coffee . In front of my apartment house I ran into Dora Emmison . She wore black  --  I never saw her in anything else  --  and said thatp191she had come in town for a few days to do some shopping and go to the theater . I asked if she 'd have lunch with me but she said she was busy . As soon as we parted I got my car and drove back to Blenville . The house was locked but I broke a pane of glass in the kitchen window and let myself in . To be alone in the yellow room was everything I had expected . I felt happy , peaceful and strong . I had brought the Montale with me and I spent the afternoon reading and making notes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my watch were procrustean had vanished . At six o'clock I went for a swim , had a drink and made some supper . She had a large store of provisions and I made a note of what I was stealing so that I would replace it before I left . After dinner I went on reading , taking a chance that the lighted windows would not arouse anyone 's curiosity . At nine o'clock I undressed , wrapped myself in a blanket and lay down on the sofa to sleep . A few minutes later I saw the lights of a car come up the drive . I got up and went into the kitchen and shut the door . I was , of course , undressed . If it was she I supposed I could escape out the back door . If it was not she , if it was some friend or neighbor , they would likely go away . Whoever it was began to knock on the door , which I had left unlocked . Then a man opened the door and asked softly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wake up , it 's Tony , the old loverboy . " Climbing the stairs he kept asking " Doree , Doree , Doree , " and when he went into her bedroom and found the bed empty he said , " Awp192shit . " He then came down the stairs and left the house and I stayed , shivering in the kitchen , until I heard his car go down the road . I got back onto the sofa and had been there for perhaps a half hour when another car came up the drive . I retired again to the kitchen and a man named Mitch went through more or less the same performance . He climbed the stairs , calling her name , made some exclamationof disappointment and went away . All of this left me uneasy and in the morning I cleaned up the place , emptiedthe ashtrays and drove back to New York . Dora had said that she would be in the city for a few days . Four is what is usually meant by a few and two of these had already passed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country I bought a case of the most expensive bourbon and started back to Blenville , late in the afternoon . It was after dark when I turned up the red dirt road . Her lights were on . I first looked in at the window and saw that she was alone and reading as she had been when I first found the place . I knocked on the door and when she opened it and saw me she seemed puzzled and irritated . " Yes ? " she asked . " Yes ? What in the world do you want now ? " " I have a present for you , " I said . " I wanted to give you a present to thank you for your kindness in letting me spend the night in your house . " " That hardly calls for a present , " she said , " but I do happen to have a weakness for good bourbon . Wo n't you come in ? "  |p193I  brought the case into the hall , tore it open and took out a bottle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , I 'm going out , " she said , " but I guess there 's time for a drink . You 're very generous . Come in , come in and I 'll get some ice . " She was , I saw , one of those serious drinkers who preparetheir utensils as a dentist prepares his utensils for an extraction . She arranged neatly on the table near her chair the glasses , ice bucket and water pitcher as well as a box of cigarettes , an ashtray and a lighter . With all of this within her reach she settled down and I poured the drinks . " Chin , chin , " she said . " Cheers , " I said . " Did you just drive out from New York , " she asked . " Yes , " I said . " How is the driving , " she asked . " It 's foggy on the turnpike , " I said . " It 's quite foggy . " " Damn , " she said . " I have to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnpike when it 's foggy . I do wish I did n't have to go out but the Helmsleys are giving a party for a girl I knew in school and I 've promised to show up . " " Where did you go to school ? " " Do you really want to know ? " " Yes . " " Well I went to Brearley for two years . Then I went to Finch for a year . Then I went to a country day school called Fountain Valley for two years . Then I went to ap194public school in Cleveland for a year . Then I went to the International School in Geneva for two years , the ParioliSchool in Rome for a year , and when we came back to the United States I went to Putney for a year and then to Masters for three years . I graduated from Masters . " " Your parents traveled a lot ? " " Yes . Dad was in the State Department . What do you do ? " " I 'm translating Montale . " " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You just do it to amuse yourself ? " " To occupy myself . " " You must have some money , " she said . " I do . " " So do I , thank God , " she said . " I 'd hate to be without it . " Tell me about your marriage , " I said . This might have seemed importunate but I have never known a divorced man or woman unwilling to discuss their marriage . " Well it was a mess , " she said , " an eight-year mess . He drank and accused me of having affairs with other men and wrote anonymous letters to most of my friends , claiming that I had the principles of a whore . I bought him off , I had to , I paid him a shirtful and went out to Reno . I came back last month . I think I 'll have another little drink , " she said , " but first I 'm going to the john .

I got up and took her in my arms but she pushed me away  --  not angrily  --  and said : " Please do n't , please do n't . I do n't feel like that tonight . I 've been feeling terribly all day and the bourbon has picked me up but I still do n't feel like that . Tell me all about yourself . " " I 'm a bastard , " I said . " Oh , really . I 've never known any bastards . What does it feel like ? " " Mostly lousy , I guess . I mean I would have enjoyed a set of parents . " " Well parents can be dreadful , of course , but I suppose dreadful parents are better than none at all . Mine were dreadful . " She dropped a lighted cigarette into her lap but retrieved it before it burned the cloth of her skirt . " Are your parents still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're very old . " She sighed and stood . " Well if I 'm going to Havenswood , " she said , " I guess I 'd better go . " Now she was unsteady . She splashed a little whiskey into her glass and drank it withoutice or water . " Why do you go to Havenswood , " I asked . " Why do n't you telephone and say there 's a fog on the turnpike or that you 've got a cold or something . " " You do n't understand , " she said hoarsely . " It 's one of those parties you have to go to like birthdays and wed-dings . " " I think it would be better if you did n't go . "  | " Why ?

I 've been drinking , that 's true , and I 'll tell you why . I ca n't drive safely on the goddam Jersey Turnpike sober . That road and all the rest of the freeways and thruways were engineered for clowns and drunks . If you 're not a nerveless clown then you have to get drunk .

" " Well let 's have another drink then , " I said . " Get out , " she said . " All right . " I went out of the yellow room onto the terrace . Ip197watched her from the window . She was reeling . She stuffed some things into a bag , tied a scarf around her hair , turned out the lights and locked the door . I followed her at a safe distance . When she got to her car she dropped the keys in the grass . She turned on the 14hts and I watched her grope in the grass until she recovered the keys . Then she slammed the car down the driveway and clipped the mailbox post with her right headlight . I heard her swear and a moment later I heard the noise of falling glass , and why is this sound so portentous , so like a doomcrack bell ? I was happy to think that she would not continue up to Havenswood but I was mistaken . She backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went . I spent the night at a motel in Blenville and telephonedthe turnpike police in the morning . She had lasted about fifteen minutes.  |p198My  lawyer arranged for the purchase of the house . I was able to get the place and eight acres of land for thirty-five thousand dollars . Her mother came down from Washington and removed her personal effects and I moved into the house three weeks later , and began my orderly life . I woke early , swam in the pool , ate a large breakfast and settled down to work at a table in the yellowroom . I worked happily until one or sometimes later and then ate a bowl of soup . I bought some tools and spent the afternoons clearing the woods around the house and cutting and stacking wood for the fireplace . At five I took another swim and drank the first of three daily whiskeys . After supper I studied German until half past ten when I went to bed feeling limber , clean and weary . If I dreamed at all my dreams were of an exceptional innocenceand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain , the valley and the fortified city.  |p199I  kept a cat named Schwartz , not because I like cats but to keep the mice and shrews from overrunning the old house . The man in the drug store in Blenville gave me Schwartz and I knew nothing about his past . I guessed he was a middle-aged cat and he seemed to have a cranky disposition if such a thing is possible in an animal . I fed him canned cat food twice a day . There was a brand of cat food he disliked and if I forgot and gave him this he would go into the yellow room and shit in the middle of the floor . He made his point and so long as I fed him what he liked he behaved himself . We worked out a practical and unaffectionate relationship . I do n't like having cats in my lap but now and then I would dutifully pick him up and pat him to prove that I was a good scout . With the early frosts the field mice began to besiege the place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of Schwartz . At the height of his efficiency as a mouser Schwartz vanished . I let him out one night and in the morning he failed to return . I do n't know much about cats but I guessed they were loyal to their homes and I supposed that a dog or a fox had killed my friend . One morning a week later ( a light snow had fallen ) Schwartz returned . I fed him a can of his favorite brand and gave him a few dutiful caresses . He smelled powerfully of French perfume . He had either been sitting in the lap of someone who used perfume or had been sprayed with it . It was an astringent and musky scent . The nearest house to mine was owned by some Polish farmers and the woman , I happened to know , smelledp200powerfully of the barnyard and nothing else . The next nearest house was shut for the winter and I could n't think of anyone in Blenville who would use French perfume . Schwartz stayed with me that time for a week or ten days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned he smelled like the street floor of Bergdorf Goodman during the Christmas rush . I buried my nose in his coat and felt a moment 's nostalgia for the city and its women . That afternoon I got into my car and drove over the back roads between my place and Blenville , looking for someplace that might house a bewitching woman . I felt that she must be bewitching and that she was deliberatelytempting me by dousing my cat with perfume . All the houses I saw were either farms or places owned by acquaintances and I stopped at the drug store and told my story . " Schwartz , " I said , " that cat , that mouser you gave me , he goes off every other week and comes home smelling like a whorehouse on Sunday morning . " " No whorehouses around here , " said the druggist . " I know , " I said , " but where do you suppose he gets the perfume ? " " Cats roam , " said the druggist . " I suppose so , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean if I can find who buys the stuff . . . " " I do n't remember selling a bottle since last Christmas , " the druggist said . " The Avery boy bought a bottle for his girl friend . " " Thank you , " I said . That night after dinner Schwartz went to the door andp201signaled to be let out . I put on a coat and went out with him . He went directly through the garden and into the woods at the right of the house with me following . I was as excited as any lover on his way . The smell of the woods , heightened by the dampness of the brook , the stars overhead , especially Venus , seemed to be extensions of my love affair . I thought she would be raven-haired with a marbly pallor and a single blue vein at the side of her brow . I thought she would be about thirty . ( I was twenty-three . ) Now and then Schwartz let out a meow so that it was n't too difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across Marshman 's pasture and into Marshman 's woods . These had not been cleared for some years and the saplings lashed at my trousers and my face . Then I lost Schwartz . I called and called . Schwartz , Schwartz , here Schwartz . Would anyone , hearingmy voice in the dark woods , recognize it as the voice of a lover ? I wandered through the woods calling my cat until a tall sapling dealt me a blinding blow across the eyes and I gave up . I made my way home feeling frustratedand lonely . Schwartz returned at the end of the week and I seized him and smelled his coat to make sure that she was still setting out her lures . She was . He stayed with me that time ten days . A snow had fallen on the night he vanishedand in the morning I saw that his tracks were clear enough to follow . I got through Marshman 's woods and came , at the edge of them , on a small frame house , painted gray . It was utilitarian and graceless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturdays and Sundays and those summer nights when the dark comes late . I had seriously begun to doubt that it was the lair of a raven-haired beauty . The cat 's tracks went around the house to a back door . When I knocked an old man opened the door . He was small , smaller than I , anyhow , with thin gray hair , pomaded and combed . There was a white button in his right ear , connected to a cord . From the lines and the colorlessness of his face I would guess that he was close to seventy . Some clash between the immutable facts of vanity and time seemed to animate him . He was old but he wore a flashy diamond ring , his shoes were polished and there was all that pomade . He looked a little like one of those dapper men who manage movie theaters in the badlands . " Good morning , " I said . " I 'm looking for my cat . " " Ah , " he said , " then you must be the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was domiciled when he was not with me . Henry , Henry , your second master has come to pay us a call . " Schwartz was asleep on a chair . He did not stir . The room was a combination kitchen and chemistry laboratory . There was the usual kitchen furniture and on a long bench an assortment of test tubes and retorts . The air was heavy with scent . " I do n't know anything about the olfactory capacities of cats but Henry does seem to enjoy perfumes , do n't you Henry . May I introduce myself . I 'm Gilbert Hansen , formerly head chemist for Beauregarde et Cie . "  | " Hammer , " I said , " Paul Hammer . " " How do you do . Wo n't you sit down . " " Thank you , " I said . " You manufacture perfume here ? " " I experiment with scents , " he said . " I 'm no longer in the manufacturing end of things but if I hit on something I like I 'll sell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however . After forty-two years with them I was dismissedwithout cause or warning . However this seems to be a common practice in industry these days . I do have an income from my patents . I am the inventor of E ' toile de Neige , Chous-Chous , Muguet de Nuit and Naissance de Jour . " " Really , " I said . " How did you happen to pick a place like this  --  way off in the woods  --  for your experiments ? " " Well it is n't as out of the way as it seems . I have a garden and I grow my own thyme , lavender , iris , roses , mint , wintergreen , celery and parsley . I buy my lemons and oranges in Blenville and Charlie Hubber , who lives at the four corners , traps beaver and muskrat for me . I find their castors as lasting as civet and I get them for a fraction of the market price . I buy gum resin , methyl salicylate and benzaldehyde . Flower perfumes are not my forte since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chous-Chous is cedar bark , and parsley and celery go into Naissance de Jour . " " Did you study chemistry ? " " No . I learned my profession as an apprentice . I think of it more as alchemy than chemistry . Alchemy is , of course , the transmutation of base metals into noble onesp204and when an extract of beaver musk , cedar bark , heliotrope , celery and gum resin can arouse immortal longingsin a male we are close to alchemy , would n't you say ? " " I know what you mean , " I said . " The concept of man as a microcosm , containing within himself all the parts of the universe , is Babylonian . The elements are constant . The distillations and transmutations release their innate power . This not only works in the manufacture of perfume ; I think these transmutations can work in the development of charac-ter . " I heard a woman 's heels in the next room  --  light , swift , the step of someone young . Marietta came into the kitchen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marietta Drum . " " Paul Hammer , " I said . " Oh , hello , " she said . She lighted a cigarette . " Eight , " she said . " How many yesterday , " he asked . " Sixteen , " she said , " but it was only twelve the day before . " She wore a cloth coat with a white thread on one shoulder . Her hair was dark blond . She was not beautiful  --  not yet . Something , some form of loneliness or unhappiness , seemed to mask or darken her looks . It would be a lie to say that there was always a white thread on her clothing  --  that even if I bought her a mink coat there would be a white thread on it  --  but the white thread hadp205some mysterious power as if it were a catalyst that clarifiedmy susceptibilities . It seemed like magic and when she picked the thread off her coat and dropped it onto the floor , the magic remained . " Where are you going now , " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , " she said . " Why ? What do you want to go to New York for ? You do n't have anything to do in New York . " " I 'll find something to do , " she said . " I 'll go to the Museumof Natural History . " " What about the groceries . " " I 'll buy them later . I 'll be back before the stores close . " She was gone . " Well , goodbye Schwartz , " I said . " Come home whenever you feel like it . I always have plenty of mice . It was nice to have met you , " I said to the old man . " You and your granddaughter must come over for a drink someday . I have the Emmison place . " I walked and ran through the snowy woods back to my house , changed my clothes and headed for the city . I was in love with Marietta and I recognized all the symptoms . My life was boundless  --  my knees were weak . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been inhaling the aphrodisiac fumes of Etoile de Neige , Chous-Chous , Muguet de Nuit and Naissance de Jour . My sudden infatuationcould be put down as immature , but the truth of the matter is that I frequently fall suddenly in love with men , women , children and dogs . These attachments are unpredictable , ardent and numerous.  |p206For  example , when I was still in the publishing business I had an appointment to meet a printer in New York . I telephoned from the hotel lobby and he asked me to come up to his room . When he opened the door and introduced himself I saw past him to where his wife stood in the middle of the room . She was not a beauty but she had a prettiness , a brightness , that was stunning . I talked with her only long enough for him to get his hat and coat , but during this time I seemed to fall in love . I urged her to join us for lunch but she said she had to go to Bloomingdale 's and look for furniture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch . The business conversation bored me and I had trouble keeping my mind on the contracts we were meant to discuss . All I could think of was her blondness , her trimness , the radiancewith which , it seemed , she had been standing in the middle of that hotel room when he opened the door . I hurried through lunch , said that I had another appointment , and looped over to the furniture department at Bloomingdale 's , where I found her reading a price tag on a chest of drawers . " Hello , " I said . " Hello , " she said , " I somehow thought you might come . . . " Then she took my arm and we left Bloomingdale 's , walking on air , and went to some restaurant where she had tea and I had a drink . We seemed immersed in one another  --  she seemed to generate a heat and light that I needed . I do n't remember much of what we said but I do remember being terribly happy and that everyonep207around us  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness . They lived in Connecticut and she asked me to come out for the weekend . I walked her back to the hotel , kissed her goodbye in the lobby , and walked around the streets for an hour , so high that my ears were ringing . On Friday I went out to Connecticut and she met me at the station . There was a lot of kissing in the car . I said that I loved her . She said she loved me . That night after dinner when her husband went upstairs to the toilet we had a serious discussion about her children  --  they had three children  --  and she said that her husband had been in analysis for seven years . At this point any disruption in his affairs would be catastrophic . The pleasurehis wife and I took in one another 's company must have been apparent because on Saturday he began to sulk . On Sunday he was downright mean and glum . He said that he detested above all things maladjusted men who preyed on the happiness of others . He used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving for Cleveland in the morning and she said she would drive me to the airport . He said she would not . They had a quarrel and she cried . When I left in the morning they were still sleeping and there was no one to say goodbye to but the cat . It took me a month or so to forget her but in the meantimeI had to go to London . The man with whom I shared a seat on the plane was pleasant and we began to talk . Nothing important was said but we were very sympatheticand at one point he asked if I would like to go to sleep or should we go on talking . I said that I would likep208to go on talking and we talked all the way across the Atlantic . We shared a cab into London . I was going to the Connaught and he was staying at the Army-Navy . When we said goodbye he suggested that we have lunch together . I had no other engagement and he met me at the Connaught for lunch . After lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked to Westminster and the Embankment  --  and when the bars reopened we went to a pub and had some drinks . He said that he knew of a good restaurant near Grosvenor Square and we went there for dinner and stayed there until about midnight when we said goodbye . We exchanged cards and promised to call one another in New York but we never did and I 've never seen him again . There was , so far as I could discern , nothing unnatural in this encounter but things are not always this simple . In the late winter I went south to Wentworth to play some golf . An amiable man in the bar the night I arrived suggestedthat we pair off since our scores seemed to be about the same . In the morning , at about the third or fourth hole , I noticed that he was praising my form and praising it extravagantly . There is nothing about my form that deserves praise and I began to feel that his flattery  --  which is what it amounted to  --  had in it a hint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing the game to me  --  that his golf was better than mine but that he was chipping his shots to give me a slight advantage . We played nineteen holes and his manner grew  --  or so I thought  --  increasingly sentimental and protective . I keptp209my distance in the shower and when we went to the bar I definitely got the feeling that something was going on . He kept bumping into me and touching me . I was not repelled but I did not want to invest my sexuality in a one-night stand with a stranger at Wentworth and I left in the morning . As for children I will give only one example . I went out to Maggie Fowler 's for a weekend in the Hamptons . Her son  --  a boy of about eight or nine  --  was with her . He was the child of her first marriage and evidently spent most of his time with his father or away at school . He seemed a little strange with Maggie . He had that extraordinary air of privacy that some children enjoy . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 've seen it in all sorts of children . I got up early on Saturday morning and , finding him downstairs , walked with him to the beach for a swim . He held my hand on the walk  --  an unusual attention for a boy his age  --  and I guessed that he was lonely , but if I explained his conduct by this I must have been lonely myself because I enjoyed his company . He may have reminded me of my own childhood . The resonance of deep affection , some part of which is surely memory , was what I experienced . We had a good swim and had breakfast together and then he asked , very shyly , if I would like to play catch . We spent perhaps an hour on the back lawn , throwing a ball back and forth . Then the others came down and we started drinking Bloody Marys and there were the usual activities of a weekend , most of which excluded a boy his age . Whenp210we were dressing that evening to go out Maggie knocked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say good night to him . I did . When I got up on Sunday morning he was sitting on a chair outside my bedroom door and we walked again to the beach . I did n't see much of him on Sunday but I seemed aware of him  --  his footstep , his voice , his presence in the house . I drove back on Sunday afternoon and I 've never seen or heard of him but I definitely felt something like love for him during the few hours we spent together . As for dogs I will also confine myself to a single example . In the spring I went out to Connecticut for a weekendwith the Powerses . After lunch on Saturday we decided to climb what they called a mountain . It was , in fact , a hill . They had a dirty old collie named Francey who came along . Near the summit there was a steep rock face that was too much for Francey and I picked her up in my arms and carried her to the top . She stayed at my side for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried her down the steep stretch . While we had cocktails Francey stayed at my side and I roughed the fur on her neck . I was just as pleased with her company , I think , as she was with mine . When I went upstairs to change Francey came along and lay on the floor . I went to bed at about midnight and just as I was about to close the bedroom door Francey came along the hall and joined me . She slept on my bed . Francey and I were inseparable on Sunday . She followed me wherever I went and I talked with her , fed her crackers and roughed andp211caressed her neck . When it was time for me to leave on Sunday , Francey , while I was saying goodbye , streaked across the driveway and got into my car . I was flattered , of course , but flattery is some part of susceptibility and all the way home I thought tenderly of the old dog as if I had left a love . It took me an hour and a half to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parking place near the museum . The odds against finding her in that labyrinthwere unequal , I knew , but that it was a labyrinth , winding , twilit and cavernous , gave some fitness to my errand and I stepped into the museum at a basement entrance with a very light heart . It was a place I had visited once or twice a year for as long as I could rememberand while there had been changes there had been fewer  --  far fewer  --  than there had been outside the walls . In fifteen years the Alaskan war canoe had traveled perhapstwenty-five yards , leaving a gallery of totem poles for a vestibule . Eskimo women in glass cases were performingthe same humble tasks they had been performingwhen I was a child , clutching Gretchen Oxencroft 's hand . I decided to start at the top of the building and work my way down . I took the elevator and began my search in a gallery that contained jewels and glass constructionsof molecular particles . Lighting was a problem since if the galleries had been well lighted I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to see whether or not she was there ; but many of the galleries were noctur/nal and I had to go from exhibit to exhibit , looking for her face in the half-lights . I was able to take in the Pleistocene room in a glance  --  that soaring construction of prehistoric bone and the intensely human odor of wet clothing  --  and the room that contains the stuffed copperheadswas also well lighted . I passed the Blue Whale and the stuffed Aardvark and then stepped into another dusky gallery where the only illumination came from cases of magnified Protozoa . I descended from there to the even deeper twilight of the African gallery and from there to the North American habitat groups . Here in the stale and cavernous dark was a thrilling sense of permanence . Here were landscapes , seasons , moments in time that had not changed by a leaf or a flake of snow during my life . The flamingoes flew exactly as they had flown when I was a child . The rutting mooses were still locked , antler to antler , the timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glass that separated them from chaos and change , and not a leaf of the brilliantautumn foliage had fallen . The Alaska bear still reared at the end of a corridor that seemed to be his demesne and it was here that I found her , admiring the bear . " Hello , " I said . " Oh , hello , " she said . That was quick . Then she took my arm and said : " I have the most marvelous idea . Why do n't you take me to the Plaza for lunch . " We walked across the park towards the Plaza . " I don'tp213think I have enough money for lunch , " I said , " and there 's no place around here where I can cash a check . " I counted the money in my wallet . I had seventeen dollars . " But seventeen is enough to take me to lunch , " she said . " I mean you could miss lunch for once in your life , could n't you ? " That 's what we did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I explained to the waiter that I had already lunched but I did drink a glass of wine . She said goodbye to me in front of the hotel . " I have to get back to Blenville in time to buy Grandfather 's groceries , " she said . " Back to my prison , back to my jail . . . " I had a hamburger and an orange drink at the corner and drove back to Blenville myself . I was over there the next afternoon at around four . She answered the door . She was wearing a gray dress with a white thread on the shoulder . " Did you get anything to eat ? " she asked . " I had a hamburger . " " I 'm sorry I spent all your money . " " That 's all right . I 've got more . Why do n't you come over to my house ? " " Where do you live ? " " I bought Dora Emmison 's place . " " I 'll get a coat . I feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted a fire , made some drinks and we sat in the yellow room while she told me her story . She was twenty-three and had never married . She had lived in France until she was twelve when her parentswere killed in an accident and her grandfather be/came her guardian . She had gone to Bennington . When her grandfather moved to the country she took an apartment and got a job as a receptionist at Macy 's . She was bored and lonely in the city and had come out to Blenvillein the autumn with the hope of finding a job , but the only industry in Blenville was the motel and she did n't want to be either a prostitute or a chambermaid . While she was talking there was a loud crack of thunder . Thunder was unusual at that time of year  --  the late winter  --  and at the first explosion I thought a plane had broken the sound barrier . The second peal  --  rolling and percussive  --  was unmistakably thunder . " Dammit , " she said . " What 's the matter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's absurd but that does n't make any difference . When I was working at Macy 's and living alone I used to hide in the closet when there was a thunderstorm . I finally went to a psychiatrist to see if he could do anything and he said the reason I was afraid of thunder was because I was a terrible egocentric . He said I thought I was so important that the thunder would seek me out for extermination . All of this may be true but it does n't keep me from trembling . " She was trembling then and I took her in my arms and we became lovers before the storm had passed over my land . " That felt good , " she said , " that felt very good . That was a nice thing to do . " " I 've never had it better , " I said . " Let 's get married . " Six weeks later we were married in the church in Blen/ville . Marietta wore a gray suit with a white thread on the lapel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we traveled in Europe , she would sometimes appear with a white thread on her shoulder . ) After the wedding we flew to Curacao and spent two weeks at St. Martha 's Bay . It was lovely and when we returned to Blenville I seemed to possess everything in the world that I wanted . When I finished the Montale and took it into New York I discovered that the poetry had already been translated but for some reason this did n't disappoint me . It seemed then that nothing could . I do n't know when the honeymoon ended . . . I 'll settle for a night in Blenville . Eleven o'clock . Groping , I found Marietta 's side of the bed empty . There was a light on in the kitchen . The shape of the lighted window stretched over the lawn . Was Marietta sick ? I sleep naked and I went down the stairs into the kitchen naked . Marietta stood in the center of the floor wearing her wedding ring and nothing else . She was eating , with a bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embraced her she pushed me away angrily and said : " Ca n't you see that I 'm eating . " The salmon gave off a sea smell , fresh and cheerful . I felt like taking a swim . When I touched her again she said : " Leave me alone , leave me alone ! Ca n't a person get something to eat without being molested ? " After that night  --  if that was the night  --  I saw more of distemper than tenderness and often slept alone ; but while Marietta'sdistempers were strenuous they had no more permanencethan the wind . They seemed at times to bep216influenced by the wind . Spring and its uncertain zephyrs  --  any sort of clemency  --  seemed to create a barometric disturbancein her nature that provoked her deepest discontents . Violence , on the other hand  --  hurricanes , thunderstorms and blizzards  --  sweetened her nature . In the autumn when tempests with girls ' names lashed the Bermudas and moved up past Hatteras into the northeast , she could be gentle , yielding and wifely . When snows closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , at the height of an epochal blizzard , she said she loved me . She seemed to think of love as a universal dilemma , produced by convulsions of nature and history . I will never forget how tender she was the day we went off the gold standard and her passion was boundless when they shot the King of Parthia . ( He was saying his prayers in the basilica . ) ' When our only mutuality was a roof tree and some furnishings she looked at me as if I was a repulsive brute to whom she had been sold by some cruel slavemaster ; but when the carts of thunder rolled , when the assassin 's knife struck home , when governmentsfell and earthquakes blasted the city walls she was my glory and my child . A clinician like Shitz would have said that I had been warned but he was wrong all along . My fault was that I had thought of love as a heady distillate of nostalgia  --  a force of memory that had resisted analysis by cybernetics . We do not fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had fallen in love with a memory  --  a piece of white thread and a thunderstorm . My own true love was a piece of white thread and that was so.  |p217Slee|ping  alone then , as I often did , I found myself forced into the reveries of an adolescent , a soldier , or a prisoner . To sublimate my physical needs and cure my insomnia I fell into the habit of inventing dream girls . I know the vastness that separates revery from the realities of a robust and a sweaty fuck on a thundery Sunday afternoon , but like some prisoner in solitary confinement I had nothing to go on but my memories and my imagination . I began with my memory and pretended to be sleeping with a girl I had known in Ashburnham . I remembered her dark blondness in detail and seemed to feel her pubic hair against my naked hip . Night after night I summoned up all the girls I had ever romanced . Night after night they came singly and sometimes in pairs so that I lay happily on my stomach with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoning them but after a while they seemed to come of their own volition . Like all lonely men , I fell in love  --  hopelessly  --  with the girls on magazine covers and the models who advertise girdles . I did not go so far as to carry their photographs around in my wallet , but I was tempted to , and having fallen in love with these strangers I found that they willingly joined me in bed . Surrounded then by the women I remembered and the women I had seen photographed I was joined by a third group of comforters produced , I suppose , by some chamber in my nature . These were women I had never seen . I woke one midnight to find myself lying beside an imaginary Chinese who had very small breasts and a voluptuous backside . She was followed by a vivacious Negress and she by an amiable but very fat woman withp218red hair . I had never romanced a fat woman that I could recall . But they came , they solaced me , they let me sleep , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I envied men like Nailles who might , I suppose , looking at Nellie , recall the number and variety of places where he had covered her . On the shores of the Atlantic and the Pacific , the Tyrrhenian and the Mediterranean , in catboats , in motorboats , in outboards , cabin cruisers and ocean liners ; in hotels , motels , in castles , in tents ; on beds , on sofas , on floors , on grassy hummocks , on pine needles , on stony mountain ledges warm from the sun ; at every hour of the day and night ; in England , in France , in Germany , Italy and Spain ; while I , looking at Marietta , would remember the number of places where I had been rebuffed . In the motel in Stockbridge she had locked herself in the bathroom until I fell asleep . When I took her for a two-week cruise she forgot to pack her contraceptives and the ship 's doctor had none for sale . In Chicago she kicked me in the groin . In Easthampton she defended herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolonged and on most nights she would hurry into bed and cover her face with a blanket before I could get undressed . I am too tired , she would say , I am too sleepy . I have a head cold . I have a toothache . I have indigestion . I have the flu . On the beach at Nantucket she ran away from me and when I thought I had her cornered in the sailboat she dove overboardand swam to shore.  |p219After  a year or two the yellow paint on the walls had begun to crack and discolor , and Marietta called the painter in Blenville and had him bring out some samples . I had never told her about the importance of the yellow walls and so her choice of pink was not malicious but pink was the color she chose . I could have protested but my obsession with yellow had begun to seem absurd . Surely I had enough character to live with a normal spectrum and I let the painter go ahead . Two or three weeks after the painters had finished I woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bed , all the symptomsof panic . My lips were swollen , I had difficulty breathing and my hands were shaking . I dressed and had two scoops of gin before breakfast . I was drunk most of that day . I had , I knew , to change the pace of my life and on Friday we flew to Rome . The cafard followed me throughout that trip but it followed me without much guile either because it was lazy or because it was an assassin so confident of its prey that it had no need to exert itself . On Saturday morning I woke , feeling cheerful and randy . I was just as cheerful on Sunday but on Monday I woke in a melancholy so profound that I had to drag myself out of bed and stumble , step by step , into the shower . On Tuesday we took a train to Fondi and a cab through the mountains to Sperlonga , where we stayed with friends . I had two good days there but the bete noire caught up with me on the third and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had four good days in Naples . Had the bete noire lost track ofp220its victim or was it simply moving in the leisurely way of a practiced murderer ? My fifth day in Naples was crushingand we took the afternoon train back to Rome . Here again I had three good days but I woke on the fourth in danger of my life and went out to take a walk , putting one foot in front of the other . On some broad and curving street , the name of which I ca n't remember , I saw comingtowards me a line of motorcycle policemen , moving at such a slow pace that they had to keep putting their feet on the paving to keep the engines upright . Behind them were a few hundred men and women carrying signs that said PACE , SPERANZA and AMORE . It was , I realized , a memorial procession for the communist delegate Mazzacone , who had been shot in his bathtub . All I knew about him was that he had been described as saintly in L'Unita . I did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began to cry . There was no question of drying my tears . They splashed down my face and wet my jacket , they were torrential . I joined the procession and as soon as I began to march I felt the cafarde take off . There were marshals with armbands to keep the parade in order and we were told not to speak so that as we moved through Rome there was no sound but the shuffle and hiss of shoe leather , much of it worn , and because of our numbers , a loud , weird and organic sound , a sighing that someone with his back to the parademight have mistaken for the sea . We marched through the Venezia to the Colosseum . We walked proudly , men , women and children , in spitep221of the shuffling sound . This grief which , in my case , we accidentally shared reminded me of how little else there was that we had in common . I felt the strongest love for these strangers for the space of three city blocks . There was a memorial service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when I went back to the hotel I felt well . We flew back to New York soon afterwardsand it was sitting on a beach that following summer ( I had already seen the picture in the dental journal ) that I decided , on the strength of a kite string , that my crazy old mother 's plan to crucify a man was sound and that I would settle in Bullet Park and murder Nailles . Sometime later I changed my victim to Tony.  |p225Nailles  asked Hammer to go fishing . It came about this way . Nailles was a member of the Volunteer Fire Department , where he drove the old red LaFrance fire truck . To hell over the hills and dales of Bullet Park late at night , ringing his bell and blowing his siren , seemed to him the climax of his diverse life . Mouthwash , fire trucks , chain saws and touch football ! The village seemed upendedin the starlight and the only lights that burned burned in bathrooms . It was his finest hour . The fire company had a meeting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended this . The red fire truck was parked in front of the building . The garage space had been swept and hosed down and tables covered with sheets had been set up as a buffet and bar . Two apprentice firemen were polishing glasses and CharlieMaddux , the self-appointed firehouse cook , was bastinga leg of lamb at a gas range in the corner . Charlie wasp226a used-car dealer . He weighed nearly three hundred pounds . He liked to buy food , cook food , eat food , and he very likely dreamed of joints of meat and buckets of shellfish . His wife was , predictably , a spare woman devoted to a diet of blackstrap molasses and wheat germ . He seemed , as a firehouse cook , to enjoy a sense of reality that he did not enjoy either with his wife or his used cars and he stirred , basted , seasoned , tasted and served the dinner with absolute absorption and like most amateur cooks he was incurably premature , getting the meal onto the table a half hour before anyone was ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty members of the fire department at that time . About twenty had gathered . Some part of the atmosphere of the place was that it had been the firemen themselves who had converted it from a loft into a habitableclub room . They had , on Saturdays and Sundays , put down the Vinylite floor , nailed and painted the wallboardand wired the fluorescent lights . They were understandablyproud of their work . The meeting was , of course , stag but it was , excepting the locker room at the club , the last stag gathering in the village and its exclusivenesshad been challenged . Some members of the ladies ' auxiliary had wanted to attend the monthly meeting if only to supervise the cooking . They felt that Charlie Maddux was a usurper and that his grocery bills were probably scandalous . They had been forestalled but the sense that the maleness of the place was embattled gave it the snugness of a tree house . The atmosphere of a tree house extended to the ceremoniousness that followed.  |p227The  chief called the meeting to order with a memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stiff silk with a thick fringe of gold . The secretaryread the minutes of the last meeting , which were approved , and the treasurer reported that there was eighty-three dollars and fourteen cents in the treasury . All of this and all that followed was performed with an immutable solemnity that could not have been explained by the few facts and figures involved . There was a somberdiscussion reproaching those firemen who came to the car wash and did nothing but drink beer . Had anyone spoken humorously it would have been a misunderstandingof the gravity of these rites . " We have a new application for membership , " said the secretary . " Mr. Hammer , will you leave the room please while we discuss your application ? " Nailles turned and saw that Hammer was in the back row . Hammer left the room . " Mr. Hammer , " the secretarysaid , " lives on Powder Hill and seems to be the sort of man who would fit into the company all right but when we asked about his experience he said that he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashburnham . It 's outside Cleveland . So we wrote for his papers and the letter was returned . There is n't any fire department in Ashburnham . There never was . I do n't like to accuse a man of lying but at the same time we do n't want any phonies in the outfit , do we ? " " How do we know there is n't a fire department in Ashburnham , " Nailles asked . " The letter was returned . "  | " It could have been a slipup in the post office . Why do n't we take him in ? The roster is n't full and even if he does n't have any experience he could help with the truck wash . " " Do you want to put that in the form of a motion ? " " I move that Paul Hammer be elected a member of the fire department . " " I second the motion . " " All those in favor say aye . " " Aye . " " Contrary-minded ? "  --  " Everything 's been ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs , " and if you do n't get your arses down here now it will all be spoiled . I do n't mind cooking but I do n't like to see everything get cold . " The meeting was adjourned . Eliot joined Hammer at the bar and asked if he was a fisherman . He was motivatedentirely by kindness . Hammer said that he was . " There 's a little stream in Venable that I sometimes go to on Saturday morning , " Eliot said . " If you 'd like to try it I 'll pick you up at around eight o'clock . This time of year I use bait . " On Saturday morning Eliot , with Tessie in the back seat , picked up Hammer and they started north on Route 61 . Route 61 was one of the most dangerous and in appearanceone of the most inhuman of the new highways . It had basically changed the nature of the Eastern landscapelike some seismological disturbance , forcing it to conform , it seemed , to some parts of Montana . At leastp229fifty men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday morning the mixture of domestic and industrial traffic was catastrophic . Trucks as massive and towering as the land castles of the barbarians roared triumphantly downhill and labored uphill at a walking pace . Passing them and repassing them made this simple journey seem warlike . Nailles remembered the roads of his young manhood . They followed the contours of the land . It was cool in the valleys , warm on the hilltops . One could measure distances with one 's nose . There was the smell of eucalyptus , maples , sweet grass , manure from a cow barn and , as one got into the mountains , the smell of pine . There were landmarks  --  abandoned farms  --  a stone tower and a blue lake . In the windows of the houses one passed one saw a cat , an array of geraniums , the face of a child or an old man . He remembered it all as intimate , human and pleasant , compared to this anxious wasteland through which one raced the barbarians . They turned off 61 at Venable , bought some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a walk of about two miles and Tessie limped along gallantly althoughit was a struggle for the old bitch . Coming down into a valley they heard the sound of the stream . It was explicitly the sound of laughter  --  nothing else . Giddy laughter , the laughter of silly girls and nymphs , rang through the bleak spring woods . The stream was shallow  --  this would account for the asinine and continuous laughter  --  and they walked upstream until they found a deep pool . " I 'll go further up and fish down , " Nailles said.  | " Why do n't we plan to meet here at around noon . I want to get back for lunch . " Off he went with Tessie . ' When they met at noon Nailles had taken two trout . Hammer had caught nothing . They both carried flasks of bourbon and they sat on the banks of the stream  --  immersed in the sound of watery laughter  --  and had a drink . They were about the same weight , height and age , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dark and long enough to fall over his brow . He had a habit of combing it or pushing it up with his fingers . His father had criticized this gesture and he may have clung to it as a sign of rebelliousness and independence . Hammer'shair was brown and cut very short . Nailles 's face was the broadest and most open . Hammer 's face was thin and he frequently touched it with his fingers  --  a sort of groping gesture as if he were looking for something he had lost . His right hand moved over his face from time to time as one 's hand moves over a shelf in a dark closet where a key has been left . His laughter was sharp  --  three harsh , explosive sounds . He had a nervous way of shiftinghis head , setting his teeth and bracing his shoulders as if his thinking consisted of a series of resolves and decisions . I must cut down on my smoking . ( Teethsetting . ) Life can be beautiful . ( Shoulder bracing . ) I am often misunderstood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nailles 's manner was much more serene . The force of friendship  --  a force that Nailles had never seen described  --  was nearly as important to him as love although there was no resemblance at all between the two . Love with its paraphernalia of sexuality , jealousy ,  |p231nostalgia  and exaltation was easier to recognize than friendship , which seemed to have ( excepting athletic equipment ) no paraphernalia at all . Nailles had enjoyed a large number of friends for as long as he could remember . Most of his friends were partners in games  --  skiing , fishing , cards or drinking . He was intensely contented in the company of his friends  --  in which he would now count Hammer  --  but it was a contentment in which there was no trace of jealousy , sexuality or nostalgia . He could remember as a boy  --  and as a man  --  friends who were both jealous and possessive but he could not honestly recall having experienced this . In the clubs that he belonged to there was some vestigial , adolescent jockeying for popularity  --  or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not insensibility . To ski a mountain in tandem with a friend was , for Nailles , close to bliss but his happiness frustrated analysis . He was genuinely delighted to meet an old friend but there was no sorrow when they parted . His friends played a practical role in he scarcely rememberedthem  --  but his happiness when they were reunited was absolute . Here was an affection , stripped of all the sentiments that make an affection recognizable . Nailles was very happy , drinking bourbon in the woods with Hammer . That Hammer planned to murder his fishing companiondid not , at this point , strike him in any way as unnatural . Looking at his victim Hammer thought that he would like to leach from his indictment all the petulantp232cliches of complaint . He knew that Nailles merchandised Spang and he had heard the worst of the commercials on TV . ( If you were ashamed of your clothing , would n't you change it ? If you were ashamed of your house , would n't you improve it ? if you were ashamed of your car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed of your breath when Spang can offer you breath-charm for periodsof up to six hours . . . ) It was infantile to rail at this sort of thing , Hammer thought . It had been the national fare for twenty-five years and it was not likely to improve . He wanted change and newness but he wanted his wants to be mature . Why despise Nailles because he loved the gold cigarette lighter that he now took out of his pocket . The economy was frankly capitalistic and who but a child would be shocked to observe that its principal talisman was gold ? The woman who dreamed of a mink coat  --  Hammer thought  --  had more common sense than the woman who dreamed of heaven . The natureof man was terrifying and singular and man 's environmentwas chaos . It would be wrong , he thought , to call Nailles 's religious observances a sham . He guessed they were vague and perhaps sentimental but since Christ 's Church was the only place in Bullet Park where mystery was professed and since there was much that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his love for his son ) there was nothing delinquent in his getting to his knees once a week . Hammer had chosen his victim for his excellence . " Did n't I see your son directing traffic at the Browns ' , " Hammer asked  | " Yes , " Nailles laughed . " He directs traffic at cocktail parties . He 's been terribly sick . " " What was the matter ? " " Mononucleosis . " " Who 's your doctor ? " " Well we had Mullin until they shut him down and then we went to old Dr. Feigart but neither of them really cured Tony . It was a very strange thing . He 'd been sick for over a month when someone told us about this guru . He calls himself Swami Rutuola . He lives over the funeral parlor on River Street . He came to the house one night and I do n't know how he did it but he cured Tony . " " Is he a holy man ? " " I really do n't know . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even know what he did . I was n't allowed into the room . But he fixed up Tony . He 's fine now . He plays basketball and directs traffic at cocktail parties . I must remind him that the Lewellens are having a party on Friday . Well , shall we go ? " They walked back through the woods , the executioner and his victim , trailed by the old setter . Nailles stowed their tack in the back of the car and then opened the door for Tessie . " Jump in , Tessie , " he said , " jump in , girl . " Tessie whined . Then she made a lurch for the seat and fell to the ground . " Poor old girl , " Nailles said . He picked her up , an awkward armful with her legs sticking out , and laid her on the back seat of the car . " Why do n't you do something about her , " Hammer asked . " Well I 've done everything I can or almost every/thing , " Nailles said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a distillate of Novocain . It 's supposed to prolong a dog 's life but it costs fifteen dollars a shot and they have to have it once a week . " " I did n't mean that , " Hammer said . " What did you mean ? " " Why do n't you shoot her ? " The contemptible callousness of his new companion , the heartless brutality involved in the thought of murderinga beloved and trusting old dog , provoked a rage in Nailles so towering and so pure that for a moment he might have killed Hammer . He said nothing and they drove back to Bullet Park.  |p235Have  you ever committed a murder ? Have you ever known the homicide 's sublime feeling of rightness ? Conscientious men live like the citizens of some rainy border country , familiar with a dozen national anthems , their passports fat with visas , but they will be incapable of love and allegiance until they break the law . Have you ever waked on a summer morning to realize that this is the day when you will kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unparalleled . Lift up a leaf to find a flaw but there will be none . The shade of every blade of grass is perfect . Hammer mowed his lawns that day . The imposture was thrilling . Look at Mr. Hammer cutting his grass . What a nice man Mr. Hammer must be . Marietta had gone to Blenville for the weekend . Hammerwas kept busy with his lawns until noon when he had a drink . He drove to the supermarket and bought a can of Mace and a loaded truncheon from the SelfDefensecounter . Everything was ready , everything butp236the gasoline . He shook the can with which he had refueledthe lawn mower . It was empty . He had this filled and then sat on his terrace . At three o'clock the mailman drove his truck down the street , stopping at the mailboxesthat stood at the foot of every walk and drive . There was no mail for Hammer but from every house but his someone appeared  --  a cook , a mother-in-law , an invalid  --  andopened their boxes in a way that seemed furtive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like undoing one 's trousers . They groped inside for some link to the tempestuous world  --  bills , love letters , checks and invitations . Then they returned . It was a cloudless day . The birds in the trees seemed , to Hammer , to be singing either an invitation list or the names of a law firm . Tichnor , Cabot , Ewing , Trilling and Swope , they sang . He went into the pantry , smiling at the bottles . He did this three times and on his fourth trip to the pantry poured himself a stiff drink . He drank , he thought , not for courageor stimulation but to make the ecstasy of his lawlessnessendurable . He drank too much . Hammer was not the sort of drinker who repeats himself , staggers and drives dangerously ; but the inflammation of his thinking was hazardous . Towards dusk he wanted to tell someone his plans ; he needed a confidant . He settled on the holy man over the funeral parlor and settled on him so decisively that he must , unconsciously , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pounded on the door of the Temple of Light . " Come in , " said Rutuola . He sat in a chair with his right hand covering his bad eye.  | " Are you the holy man ? " Hammer asked . " Oh no , no indeed . I 've never claimed to be that . You must excuse me . I am very tired tonight . " " You cure the sick ? " " Sometimes , sometimes . I help with prayers but I am so tired tonight that I can not help myself . I have said a hundred times that I am sitting in a house by the sea at four o'clock and that it is raining but I know that it is half past five and I am sitting in an old chair over a funeral parlor . " " You remember Tony Nailles ? " " Yes . " " I am going to kill him , " Hammer said . " I am going to burn him on the altar of Christ 's Church . " " Get out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Templeof Light . " The Lewellens ' guests had been invited for seven thirty . Tommy Lewellen stood on his terrace . His idea of a party was a day and a night he had spent in West Berlin with three Kurfurstendamm whores . That was a party . Things were different in Bullet Park , he thought , as he watched the caterer 's waiters set tables for fifty under a tent lighted with paper lanterns . " The AmalgamatedDevelopment Corporation and Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Lewellen cordially request the pleasure . . . " The business name on the invitation was put there so Lewellencould claim the party as a tax exemption . If the claim was accepted the party would cost him nothing and he would net a thousand . Lewellen was more interested inp238the financial arrangements of his wife 's parties than in anything else . He sometimes got so bored that he seemed to see straight through the display of elegance to the bills , canceled checks , even the nails in the floor . What was wrong with friendly talk and well-dressed men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothingat all except that the blandness of the scene would be offensive . No one would get drunk , no one would fight , no one would likely get screwed , nothing would be celebrated , commemorated or advanced . If the gathering he awaited stood at the brink of anything it stood at the brink of licentiousness . Sheer niceness , he thought , might drive a man to greet his guests wearing nothing but a cockwig . Gross and public indecencies would cure the evening of its timelessness and relate it vigorously to death . The waiters were setting out bowls of flowers . The flowers looked fresh enough but Lewellen guessed they had spent the afternoon at a wedding reception and would , after a night in the refrigerator , wilt during a fund-raising lunch in Greenwich , Connecticut . The energies of change were almost unknown to Lewellen , but that the scene that was about to begin would claim to be totally innocent of change made it half a scene , half a loaf , half an anything , a picture cut from a magazine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing was the sky  --  thought Lewellen  --  a boringreach of blue with some thunderclouds stacked up in the west like the towers of an old-fashioned West Side apartment hotel , the last abode of funky Hungarian widowswho left their dirty dishes in the hallway . What ap239bore was the sky ! Thunder sounded . The rhythm of thunder , thought Lewellen , was like the rhythm of a large orgasm . He liked that . He could see against the clear afterglow in the northwestclouds of black smoke rising from the ghetto on the riverbanks . The wind was from the south , and if there had been any shooting he would not have heard it . Tony Nailles , who would direct traffic , came over the lawn with a flashlight . " Hi Tony , " said Lewellen . " You want a drink ? " " I 'd like a beer , " Tony said . " There is n't any beer , " said Lewellen , " why do n't you have a gin and tonic ? " As Tony went over to one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped on the lawn . It was the Wickwires . They were , as always , impeccably dressed and incandescently charming but he wore dark glasses and had a piece of court plaster over one eye . " What a divine idea to have a tent , " she exclaimed . She was in a wheelchair . Nailles , stepping into the bathroom , found Nellie naked and took her in his arms . " If we 're going to do it , " Nellie said , " let 's do it before I take my bath . " They did . Then Nailles prepared to dress . Nellie had put his clothes on the bed and , standing naked above them , Nailles felt a powerful reluctance to dress . Having , in his experience with trains , learned something about the mysterious polarities that moved him , he wondered what would happen if his unwillingness to dress turned into a phobia . Would he spend the rest of his life padding naked around the bedroom while poor Nellie tried to conceal his condi/tion from the rest of the world ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit . Spread out on the bed it seemed to claim a rectitude and a uniformity that was repulsively unlike his nature . Did he want to go to the party in a fig leaf , a tiger skin , nothing at all ? Something like that . Nailles thought about his mother . He had visited her on Tuesday night . " Are you feeling any better , Mother , " he had asked . " Would you like Tony to come and see you . Is there anything I can get you . " She had not replied for nearly a month . Then from some part of his mind , deeper than memory , he heard singing : " The poor soul sat singing by a sycamore tree , Sing all a green willow , Her hand on her bosom , her head on her knee , Sing willow , willow , willow . " Dressed , Nailles began to look for his wallet . It would be in the jacket pocket of the suit he had worn that afternoon . When he reached into the pocket he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he had asked some grave questions about pain and death and had got no answer ; had been told there was none . " I came into the house , " he said aloud , " and I made a drink and then I went upstairs and undressedand took a shower so it must be in the bedroom somewhere . " He must have put the wallet on some surfacein the bedroom and now he examined all of these  --  the dressing table , the chest of drawers , etc . It was nowhere . He could not recall having been in any of thep241other bedrooms but he examined them . He heard Nellie 's heels coming down the hall . " I 've lost my wallet , " he said . " Oh dear , " said Nellie . He had no use for the wallet that night , she knew , but she knew that he would not go to the party without it . The loss of any object was for both of them acute as if their lives rested on some substructureof talismans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " and I made a drink and then I went upstairs and I undressed and took a shower so it must be here somewhere . " For the next half hour or longer they were upstairs , downstairs , in and out of the living room , opening unuseddrawers onto collections of Christmas ribbon , feelingunder chairs , lifting up newspapers and magazines , shaking out pillows and grabbing under cushions . To look into their faces you would have thought they had lost their grail , their cross , their anchor . Why could n't Nailles go to the party without his wallet ? He could n't . " I came into the house , " he said , " and I made a drink and then I went upstairs and undressed and took a shower . " " Oh here it is , " cried Nellie . It was the pure voice of an angel , freed from the mortal bonds of grossness and aspiration . " It was in the pantry under the minutes of your last meeting . You must have put it there when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank you , " said Nailles to his deliverer . They started for the party . Thunder sounded . The noise reminded Nailles again of what it had felt like to be young and easy . " You know I was awfully happy that summer I climbed in the Tirol , " he said . " I climbed the Grand Kaiser and the Pengelstein .
