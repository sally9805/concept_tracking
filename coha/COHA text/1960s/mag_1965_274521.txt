When Nikita Khrushchev opened the gates of Stalin 's concentration camps and set free hordes of political prisoners , he proudly boasted that " only lunatics " could object to life in Russia . So it seemed only logical for Nikita to deal with the intellectual critics of his own regime by locking them up not in harsh prisons-but in lunatic asylums . As men in white coats largely replaced the policemen , hundreds of writers , artists and other outspoken objectors to Communism vanished from the Moscow scene , to reappear in psychiatric hospitals as " mental cases . " <P> The first detailed account of this process is in Ward 7 , a remarkable novel by Valeriy Tarsis , which was smuggled out of Russia last year and has now been published in London . It is at once a searing indictment of the Communist system and an eloquent witness to the fervor for freedom that nearly 50 years of Marxist indoctrination have not been able to extinguish . <P> One Patient . Tarsis ' book is , in fact , more a documentary than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Author Tarsis are one and the same . Al mazov , a writer , is being treated in Ward 7 of a large Moscow mental hospital for the anti-state offense of smuggling manuscripts to the West . Tarsis himself spent six months in Kashchenko psychiatric hospital in 1962 and 1963 for sending The Bluebottle , a novel portraying the plight of intellectuals in Khrushchev 's Russia , to a British publisher via a tourist . When he was released , Tarsis , now 59 , went right to work on the story of his remarkable experience . Ward 7 , which Tarsis insisted on having published under his real name , is the result . <P> Ward 7 's Almazov finds that among the 150 men in the ward , there is just one " genuine patient , " the only one who is the " victim of anything except his lot as a Soviet citizen . " The rest of the inmates fall into three categories : 1 ) " the failed suicides , classified as lunatics because it was assumed ( by doctors and politicians , writers and ideologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lunatic " ; 2 ) the " Americans " - Russians who had tried to get in touch with a foreign embassy or with tourists , usually to emigrate ; and 3 ) " the less clearly defined category of young people who had failed to find their proper place in our society and who rejected all Soviet standards . " <P> The Yardstick . Both the inmates and the hospital staff well knew " there were neither patients nor doctors but only jailers in charge of inconvenient citizens . " As Almazov explains to a bewildered new arrival : " The reason you and I and all of us here are persecuted is that we do n't conform , we have n't the mentality of serfs . " <P> Unlike Chekhov 's Ward 6 in the clas sic of that name , from which Tarsis drew his title and which was an attack on the abysmal physical conditions in Czarist asylums . Ward 7 seemed almost heaven to some of the inmates by comparison with the wretchedness of Russian life outside . " Personally I 'm very happy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed . I 'm clothed . Nobody preaches Communism at me . Do you realize ? No propaganda , and you can say what you like ! Where else can you do that ? "
