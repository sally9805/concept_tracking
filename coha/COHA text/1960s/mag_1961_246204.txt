Russia and Red China have little in common save Communism , and even on that they disagree . The nature and the size of the split can shape the course of the cold war , and the West 's strategists have studied every scrap of evidence to help map its dimensions . The split was papered over at the meeting of all the world 's 81 Communist parties in Moscow last winter . Last week there was new evidence that the quarrel between the partners is becoming increasingly acrimonious . Writing in the London Sunday Times , Polish-born Kremlinologist Isaac Deutscher revealed an astonishingly bitter , point-by-point indictment of Peking policy " just sent out from Khrushchev 's offices in Moscow to the headquarters of several foreign Communist parties . " Among Moscow 's complaints : <P> " The Chinese comrades have conducted a surreptitious agitation against the principles of the Moscow Declaration " of December 1960 , particularly the doctrine of " peaceful coexistence . I The Chinese have tried to " discredit the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and have sought to extend their influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albania . They have made the Chinese embassy in Bern the control center for European subversion against Moscow . <P> The leaders of the Chinese Communist Party have hatched , without daring to formulate it categorically , a plan for the division of world Communism into two zones , a so-called Western zone , for which the U.S.S.R. should be responsible , and a so-called Eastern zone under the People 's Republic of China . " This plan has " a flavor of racialism about it contrary to the principles of Communism . " The Chinese have set up special centers in Asia and Africa for " subversive intrigue " against Moscow. * When Russian " interests more than ever demanded a determined policy of coexistence with the countries hostile to socialism , the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party denounced our every initiative in this direction as treason , as appeasing the invaders of Formosa , or as a sacrifice of the interests of the people of China to those of the U.S.S.R. " EUR Ever since 1949 , Chinese Boss Mao Tse-tung has preached " preventive war " against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one-sided military character of the Chinese party , " which had " grown up as an army and not as a civilian organization like any other Communist Party . Now it is more difficult to understand why , twelve years later , the position of the Chinese leaders has remained the same , " and how they can argue that " the Soviet Union should use its present overwhelming superiority in missiles , rockets and nuclear weapons " to dictate terms to the West even if it means war . The trouble is that China , " being obsessed with Formosa , " is bent on " liberating Formosa even at the risk of world war . " <P> Concludes the Moscow white paper : " World war between Communism and capitalism is not inevitable . It can and should be avoided . We have not been afraid of an open breach with the Yugoslav revisionists ; and we shall not be afraid of an open breach with the Chinese dogmatists either . "                 @ @ @ @
