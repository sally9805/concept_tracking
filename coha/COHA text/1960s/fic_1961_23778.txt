The Man Who Doubted A Story by JACK COPE Drawings by Frederick E. Banbery H E CAME up out of the mist at dusk to- ward the veranda steps . The farmer was scraping the mud off his boots on a sharp iron scraper and he turned slowly hearing the soft footsteps on the wet ground . As their eyes met , the Zulu raised his arm in a grand and gaunt salute . " I nkosana I " His greatcoat was an ancient military khaki darkened with grease and ending in tatters around his bare calves , and in his left hand he trailed a knobkerrie and a stick , as well as a small branch of wild olive with faded dull-green leaves . At his side , carrying a small blanket bundle was a barefooted boy who looked enough like him to be unmistakably his son . He did not speak again but waited in a courteous silence until the white man should either recognize him or ask who he was . He was so striking in all the singleness of his dignity , stripped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the farmer felt a keen pang of sympathy , searching the ravaged face for recognition . They were of the same age and height , both tall graceful men , but the black one looked doubly aged beside the ruddy weathered features of the other . Glancing between father and son the farmer found his clue suddenly , and out of the shadow of thirty years a face came back to him of a handsome youth . " Ha , it is you , Matan , I see ! " The Zulu raised his head and a quick and grateful smile bloomed on him . His white teeth shone and the heavy lines were loosened for a moment . " Inkosana , you are one who seldom makes a mistake . " 55 " I would n't say that . " " You have grown more like your father , and his voice speaks again in you . But I see that you carry a scar . " The white man ran his fingers over a deep scar from the corner of his eye and disappearing in his hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the war . They nearly buried me . " " Instead , you buried your enemies , " Matan said . No greater mark of honor could a man bear than the wound of battle on his face . " I would n't say that , " the farmer repeated . " No , but you are ill and cold . Go and warm yourself and get some food . Then we can speak together . " " First I will tell you , lnkosana , that I have come to fetch home my father . " " How 's that ? " the farmer asked quietly , hiding his surprise . " Your father has lain buried here for thirty years . " " I have come for his spirit . " They both were aware that this opened up between them such imponderable questions that they said nothing for a few moments until with another grave salute Matan went off , with his son , to the compound of the farm laborers . After the evening meal the farmer 's wife was in the kitchen storeroom packing eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while a young black woman in a scarlet head-cloth and blue pinny deftly washed and dried any that were marked . Two incandescent lamps hissed steadily and shed a strong white light . The storeroom beams were hung with hams and sides of smoked bacon , and phalanxes of jams and bottled preserves were ranged along the shelves . The women talked softly while they worked and sometimes laughed . The farmer came in to ask about some accounts and at the same time Matan appeared at the kitchen door . He had left his sticks but still held the branch of wild olive . In the strong light his face was like a deeply carved rock and the feverish black eyes alone betrayed him . The small boy came behind him , peering round the skirts of his ragged coat . " Come inside , Matan , " the farmer said , and turning to his wife : " This is the man . " The Zulu greeted her in the same majestic way and she answered , " San'bona . " " San'hona , " said the black maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the lamplight and squatted down on his hams in a ceremonial manner . The farmer asked where he lived and how were his family and at this he looked troubled , several times passing his hand over his eyes . He had lived in many places since he had left the Thorn Country . Now he had found a place again in the umSuluzi valley and had a garden to cultivate but no oxen yet and no plow . " And your family ? " the farmer repeated , thinking of his own three children tucked safe in their beds and his eldest son away for the first term at boarding school . When he glanced again at Matan he sensed a quiver on the rigid lips and he was appalled to see that tears had come to the sunken , burning eyes . " This is my family , " the Zulu said , reaching out and touching his son with a bony finger . " All the others I have lost . Two sons and a daughter I lost . My wife I lost . But this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and across the umSuluzi stream I can see where my father 's kraal stood . " " Oh , so you are on Dune 's ? " " I am on Dunes . " " Why did you not come to me ? I would give you a place . You may build again where your father 's huts were and plow his old lands . All those you gave up when you left . " Matan thought over his answer and after clearing his throat he said : " I am not ready . Now it is this that my heart tells use to say . When I had come to manhood and we were of an age my father worked for yours . " " I remember Makofin well . I remember the accident . I went to call the doctor and we rode out on our horses in the night . " " Inkosana , it was the long red wagon that cut him nearly in two . I was walking behind and my father carried the whip . He slipped as he put one foot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The oxen pulled the wagon over him with a load of corn and I dragged him out from under the wheels  --  my father . He was dying . I could see . " " He did not cry out . " " In the night he died . Our people buried him here . Inkosana , child of your father , think of Jack Cope grew up on a form . in Natal , South Africa , and became a newspaperman in Cape Town . His three novels have been published in England . and his collection of short stories carries the title of his first story published in this magazine , " The Tame Ox . " His work is known all over Europe and in 1960 he was elected a Life Fellow of the International Institute of Arts and Letters . He edits South Africa 's only English-language literary magazine , " Contrast , " and has completed his fourth novel , " Dream Smoke . " 56 THE MAN WHO DOUBTED mine too . He has been lying here for thirty years under the cold trees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been alone . Where this red wagon called Satan is working and its trek-cattle that killed my father , I can not stay . I went off and I have been everywhere . I have been to the Gold Mines , I worked in the sugar cane . I married and found a place with the Ntulis but wherever I have gone evil followed . " Evil has followed me , " he said again hollowly after a long pause . " A son was born and I was glad . Then again , another son . I did not believe it . I thought the evil had left me . My first-born withered and shriveled to a stick and he died . Then I believed it again . I took up my goods and drove my cattle away and always the evil has followed me . . . . No , why tell you all that happened ? Now I ant left with this stripling ? ' ' He looked round for the boy and at last caught sight of him through the kitchen door doing a lively little dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , sprightly and difficult to handle . Often he had to be given a cuff on the head and then tears burst from his eyes . But a moment later he was dancing and singing again . The father turned away with a shrug and then , as if by an afterthought , he said : " So then 1 have come to bring my father home . " The two white people waited in a strained way but the black girl gazed at him goggle-eyed . He had expected it , but now it devoured his insides . Ile went on , stumbling somewhat over his words , to say he had been to one who knew of these things . The man had him beat the ground , and he had thrown bones . He was a witch doctorisangoma . He said the evil had been sent by Makofin , father of Matan , because he lay two days ' journey away , alone in the cold drizzling trees ; two days from his home which was in the Thorn Country . There he had owned cattle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The witch doctor had cooked medicine and clipped the leaves of a branch into his medicine pot . He had said : " Watch one night by the grave . " Makofin 's ghost would climb out of the grave , he had said , and settle in the leaves of the branch . The son must then carry the ghost home to the Thorn Country in silence , unbroken silence , and bury it there . Peace would come at last to him . One word spoken by him during this journey home would send the ghost crying back to its cold grave . He drew out the branch of wild olive from under his coat and raising it he said : " On this I will take my father home . " The farmer and his wife glanced at each other but the maid flung up her hands with a cry of fear and darted out of the room . He took this sign from her without emotion and scarcely moved his head . Perhaps in his blood this sign of absolute belief worked profoundly , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he put down the branch and tried to compose himself . He did not look up at them , not because they might despise the witch doctors or that he feared their disbelief . His great terror lay in his own doubt . He took out his snuffbox and his hands shook as he uncorked it and put in his hand a small heap of snuff . Then , clearing his throat and swallowing , he found the calm he needed to state the point of his visit : Perhaps it was beyond a man to make a long journey without uttering a word . His lips could open in his sleep , or without thinking he might say something to a passer-by or to his son who would not remember always to speak correctly . if a truck were driving to the Thorn Country . . . in short , if the farmer could take him home with his father 's shadow and his son , the three of them , it would be well with them . He waited for the reply , greatly perturbed , and took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boy in the other room , singing to himself , while the two spoke low in their own language . Then the woman asked : " Matan , did you pay the isangoma ? " " It is the custom , " he mumbled as if angry at such a question . " What did you pay him ? " " A cow , " he said shortly , and then added : " It was my last cow . " " And do you really believe in this ? " It was the question that crawled under his skin , that pestered and devoured him , and with a sound like a groan he threw back his head . " Inkosazana , what else can I do ? " " I do n't know . I did not know your father as my husband did , but would his soul follow you with evil ? Would you wish evil on your own son ? " " Let it be ! " he said wildly . She was on the point of saying more , so cool in her knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart if only to enlighten him . But the man put a hand on her arm to quiet her . " Matan , I am not going to the Thorn Country . My truck is broken down ; it 's at the garage to be repaired . But you can go with the wagon in the morning and from the crossroads the milk truck will take you to the railway . And so you can ride in the train down to the Thorns and get home in one day . " The Zulu averted his face without a word . He had only a few shillings knotted in a cloth and the rail fare would leave him penniless . His son had come to the door and heard what the plan was , and he skipped delightedly at the thought of a ride in the milk truck and in a train , marvels he had never enjoyed . The father stood up stiffly and saluted the white people . He went out leaning one hand on the child 's shoulder and with the other carrying the bough from which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you do with them ? " the woman said . " Good heavens  --  the idea ! " " You know , I had an eerie feeling always at Makofin 's grave . I can remember them burying him sewn all crouched up in a blanket , and they put in some food and pots and a knobkerrie and assagai to see him on his way . Makofin was a hell-fire fighting man and the others were scared enough of him alive but ten times more scared of him dead . The boys are going to be glad about Matan taking the old man 's ghost home . They never liked the grave down in the forest . " " He looks so ill , " she said . " Fierce but somehow tortured , eh ? Worried to death . " He merely glanced at her and shrugged . His way with the Zulus was to get along as well as he could without bumping headlong into them on dangerous ground , and he did not push things down their throats . It had been silly of her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ask a man whether he really believed in a thing that went to the center of his life ? " About this account with the vet .. " he began . M AT A N walked down in the dark from the house of the white people and he still leaned one hand on his child . A moon was sliding in and out of the clouds and the wind blew cold and damp . Passing the open shed , he saw the wagon . The farm used tractors and motor vehicles now , but they kept the old trek-wagon standing there with its heavy iron-ringed pole slung up as if ready to roll out again on its fatal way . Ever since it had cut his father almost in two it had been called Satan and the men had a kind of awe for it . He went past , looking fearfully into the dark mouth of the shed , and he said nothing but listened to the chatter of the boy about the tasty food he had been given in the kitchen . In the compound Matan joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of their clan and they were all tied by ancient blood bonds one to another , yet he had noticed how his entry had put a hush on them . They offered him food and went on dipping their clean fingers in the black iron cooking pots , but they were like chickens when a hawk has flown over . The little boy edged close to a pot and soon he was eating ravenously , scooping out hot lumps of tasty steamed corn and potatoes and sweet pumpkin . Matan ate nothing and he did not speak . Seated on a polished wood block he leaned toward the leaping flames of the fire . He had tried to conceal as much as possible the wild-olive branch and had it under the folds of his coat tails . Presently he opened his coat and bared his bony chest to the heat . He had a skin amulet hanging at his throat by a blackened string and a medicine horn from some small antelope stuck as an earring through the lobe of one ear , and with his forbidding , deep-furrowed face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly a man at all , but a shadowing of death itself . Some of the men got up and went out , and from under his heavy brow he shot them wild , desperate glances . He waited a little longer , reluctant to go down into the night and the forest , and occasionally he looked at his son still busy at the cooking pot . When the boy could no longer force another mouthful down his throat but sat back with his stomach drum-right , Matan told him sharply to find a place among the boys and go to sleep . He went outside and came back with his hands and small shining face wet from a good rinsing at the tap . He was thrown a few clean grain bags with which he made himself a bed on the clay floor and soon lay rolled from head to foot like a small mummy in ltis blanket . Suppressing a sigh , Matan got up and buttoned his greatcoat close about him . He armed himself with his stick and knobkerrie . The others pretended not to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past cornlands and large fields standing in young kale and tur-58 HILARY CORKE A PSYCHIATRIST 'S SONG I HELP them out , I help them out , All those whose exits are in doubt From the self-extruded spirals Of their own ingrowing morals Those whose paths are set with shadows And the snakes breed in their meadows And the thoughtweed hinds the gate , I de-infest their whole estate : And those whose skiffs capsize at sea And can not swim , their legs not free , But in confusion look to drown , I hook them out and rub them down .

These bolt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin , The worm grows wily in the wall And down the family portraits fall ; I am the hero with the axe Who thrusts the fresh air through the cracks ; I sweep the flues , I scour the drains And free the gutters to the rains : While those who stumble in the wide Without-door tempest , void of pride , Untrousered , why , I fetch galoshes And plastic hats , and mackintoshes . All their ills away I take : Then why does my own sore head ache ? Look how the fish leap in the lake ! Then why does my own sore head ache ? nips for winter cattle feed , the ground falling all the while toward the fringe of trees . The moon gave a vague sense of light in the sky , but once inside the trees the darkness became so close that it seemed he had to push his way through it . Often he missed the path , groping a pace at a time and stumbling on roots or feeling suddenly the rasp of a creeper round his neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept even slower . His eyes were strained open to catch the least hint of light . A rustle went faintly through the upper foliage and from the occasional touches of cold on his face he knew a fine rain had started . Big drops fell with a lone splash from the trees on his head or down his neck . Then he was at the grave , sensing the hollowness of the dark clearing around him . He was confused at hearing loud noises , only they were in his head and the forest was quiet save for the slow shudder of drops on the leaves . He put his sticks and the olive branch tinder one arm and , with some difficulty over the trembling of his hands , he managed to strike a match . For a moment the flare of light chased away shadows into the thicket , and fell on the pyramid of earth and stones under which his father lay buried . Before the match flickered out he saw the green moss and grass on the grave mound and the long trailing beards of lichen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base of the mound was half-buried in green mold . A wet and dreary and silent . place , and any spirit lying drowned and bitter under the tree roots would writhe in its suffocation . If it were true ! It was starting in him again ; at the foot of his father 's grave itself the doubt came at him and a cold band pressed round his forehead and temples . He stood for a while and took hold on himself . He must not dare think such thoughts . He must follow the witch doctor to the letter  --  it was his last resort . What else could he do ? All With a start he remembered he had used those same words to the white woman . She had asked if he believed . Womanlike , she had put her finger in the eye of his sore . What if he did doubt ? He must keep to the finest hair of the isangoma 's instructions and , provided the truth lay there , then all must be well . He would regain his health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child grow up like a cornstalk to the sun . And if the white people were right ? Could there be two truths ? He tried to heave himself up out of the clawing blackness , straightened his back , and raised his head . " Father , I am here , " he said . His breast at once felt calmer , and he began to make preparations for the watch through the night . He edged forward until his sandal touched the stones of the grave ; then he struck one more match and , keeping it alight in his cupped hand , made his way to the nearest tree . There he settled himself with his back to the moss-covered roots and , tucking his coat as well as possible around his knees , he took the olive branch in one hand . A cold drop coursed down his forehead and nose . It was no longer raining and he found to his dread that he was in a heavy sweat . He sighed and muttered to himself . He would feel better if something came to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a hare . But it was a lonely place and a little-used path . Cattle kept the track open and maybe at night the small denizens of the trees would dart along it frightened by the coughing of a leopard . He would welcome a leopard . The air seemed to become wanner and then the clouds opened and moonlight came filtering down through the treetops into the clearing . He could make out the shape of the grave mound and at a distance the pale streaks against the black which he knew , though they seemed to be moving , were tree trunks . He had to close his eyes to escape the appearance that the trees were moving about . After some time had passed he heard the growl of thunder and he thought he understood that strange wave of warmth and closeness that was hammering against his chest as if with soft fists . Cold , rain  --  rain and cold , did it never stop here in the thin high veld ? " My father , I have left you a long while , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another rumble of thunder . He waited , thinking of his father , and he began speaking to him . " My father , Makofin , son of Poli , why have you come as a thief and taken everything from use ? It was not so before . You were a fighting man and born of great blood and your word was respected . Did they leave you too little food for your journey and have you eaten grasshoppers on the bare hill ? My father , if you kill me and my last son , who will be left to pray and comfort you  --  what home will you return to when you journey up from there below to see the sun again ? " He spoke in the form of the old prayers but in his blood was the feeling that he should be given some sign , and because no sign came he was left hollow and beaten . Flashes of lightning were flickering palely among the trees and the thunder groaned nearer , thudding on the ground as if some great beast were on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar into the forest and thunder ripped and boomed in the sky striking trees and hilltops while the rain fell in huge dark waves . Gullies of water poured and washed against him and he crouched more into himself , wet and shivering and almost unconscious of his purpose in being there . T H E rain passed and the wind died and silence and darkness came back over the forest . He thought of his father 's ghost in the underworld shivering at an empty pot and a dead fire while the water from the cold earth dripped muddily over him . Alone he was too , and malignant , and his eyes glaring red like those of a man wild with death or sorrow . The vision was so clear and striking to his inner mind that he thought it a dream and he had been asleep or was still sleeping . The branch of wild olive seemed to be moving in his hand and with a thrill of horror he dropped it , then grabbed at it , feeling about in the dark in case it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shaking hand he was sure that it moved of its own and so great a desire filled him to run for his life that his legs began twitching like a dog in its hunting dreams . Closing his eyes , be forced his head and back against the tree until his muscles stopped jerking and he could no longer feel any movement , not in his legs nor in the twig nor the hand that held it . He opened his eyes vaguely and was staring upwards . There was light , faint light . The moon had come through and was dropping a dim ray among the still treetops . Here and there was the mere phantom of a tree trunk . Slowly he searched into the cave of the clearing and then fixed on a place above the grave . He stared for a long time , not believing his senses , blinked slowly and looked again . Over the grave stood a large white shape , there was no mistake . And as the moon ran out of the clouds and its light seeped down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two dark hollows where it would have eyes . " Makofin , son of Poli , " he grated out , though his lips and tongue were almost paralyzed . " Ha ! do you come to turn your son 's bones to water ! Come with me home to the umSuluzi . " He could now see two strange shapes like great horns rising above it and in a swaying movement the head shook . A cry came from Matan 's throat . He tried to struggle to his feet , rolled to one side and fell . His body shivered all over and a foam hissed from his mouth and nostrils , The moon was covered by a dark cloud bank 60 THE MAN WHO DOUBTED and complete darkness crcpt over the veld and into every crevice of the dripping forest . Far down at the foot of a tall tree the black man lay fighting for breath and oblivious of everything . The owls flew down from their roost in a hammerkop 's nest , a leopard made its coughing grunt as it padded along the trail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating of hooves , and then the return of silence . Still the man lay on his side and ants began to crawl on him . At the first lightening of the sky he stirred and tried to open his eyes . He felt blinded , scratched and clawed at his face and then screamed out . His face was covered with ants . He rolled and whipped over on the grass like an eel and by brushing and beating at his face with his coat sleeves he cleaned himself and then began to kill off and shake the ants out of his coat . His limbs felt weak and he was unnerved in every fiber of his body . But in spite of his dread of the place he raised his hand as steadily as he could and said : " Makofin , son of Poll , I came in peace . Now you too , be no thief . To me , your son , give back peace . " He gathered up his sticks and , with one fearful glance at it , took up also the wild-olive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound , but walked slowly like an old man . Passing beyond the grave , he noticed in the turf the , and all his doubts came back with a new agony . When had the ox stood there  --  during the night , or before ? There was water in one of the hoofmarks . His head was nodding as with an illness when he started again , and at sunrise he arrived back at the compound . M A TA N crouched like some old tree trunk among the milk cans on the wagon . It seemed that in contrast to his gloom and silence and the awe he inspired in the other farm workers , the small boy had become all the more sprightly . He danced and skipped alongside the cart , threw stones at a flock of starlings , whistled gaily or sang to himself at every step . T'Ie farm workers kept wide of the man whom they believed to be carrying the ghost of his father but the boy had almost taken command now that he had the task of guiding him home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy milk truck while loud explanations were made and shouts of amazement exchanged with the loading crew . Then the truck started off : the boy shrilled and laughed and opened his mouth to feel the roar of wind in his checks . At the railhead the child made all the explanations while his father fumbled open his damp cloth and handed over one by one the shillings and florins to pay the fare . Then , aboard the train , the boy dashed up and clown the corridors , hung out on the balcony rails , and scrambled over people 's feet in the crowded compartment where his father sat , stony and silent with lips sewn together in a terrible bitterness . In a shrill voice the boy explained that the olive branch had been doctored and on it was roosting none other than the ghost of his grandfather . With one accord the passengers yelled out and made a concerted dash to get out at the door , struggling and cursing and knocking the child over in their hurry to escape . When the last of them had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , was a silver sixpence . The boy picked it up with a chirp of pleasure and ran after the gabbling passengers . He tossed it in the air and caught it , shouting : " Who lost this ? Who lost this ? " They were too angry or scared to notice him and so he tied it into a ragged corner of his vest . The passengers complained about the ghost and some minutes later the ticket examiner came to restore order . " You ca n't travel with a ghost , " lie said to Matan and was answered by a glimmer of anger from eyes so sunken and reddened that even he was taken aback . " I 'm not sure , you may need another ticket for the spook , " he said . And Matan , seeing the smile of contempt , turned away his face to hide his rage and dismay . " Why do n't you answer ? " " He is my father and he has lost his voice , " the boy said . " Well , he 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the balcony . I ca n't have the corridor blocked with passengers . " Matan rose unsteadily and made his way out along the corridor and to the balcony , still gripping his sticks and bundle and his olive bough . The other passengers hurried past or pretended not to see the thin and haggard man keeping his balance precariously as the train jolted and swayed an the curves and gradients . There he stayed until the train pulled in at the station of Colenso alongside the broad muddy Tugela River with the great water towers and smokestacks of the central power station rising like a giant out of the bush-dotted and almost empty plain . Matan climbed down to the platform , made his way across to a bench , and , sinking clown exhausted , watched the train pull out . He had not eaten for two days and a fever ran in his veins , The boy raced up and down in a daze of happiness . He loved the machines and heavy electric engines , the maze of power lines , the intricate transformer plant where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiss and whirr of strange things , and , high above all , the great plumes of smoke going up in the blue sky . He would one day work in the power station , he thought . His father sat on the bench recovering his strength while the boy played , dodging among passengers and porters . He untied the sixpence to play with and threw it in the air . Matan watched the boy and thought of continuing his journey , this time on foot over the ridge and into the umSuluzi valley . He saw the coin make a bright arc , land on the platform , and roll over the edge . His son looked down at the track where his sixpence had fallen . A train drawn by a green electric locomotive was coming quietly and swiftly into the platform and the boy , without seeing it , was on the point of leaping down to the track . From the bends Matan could not reach him in time . " Bheka ! " he yelled . " Iyez ' isitimela ! " ( " Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child turned and , seeing the locomotive , flinched back as if struck . The passenger train glided through the station without halting and after the last coach and the van had passed by he looked down and there was his coin still lying in the ballast . He jumped lightly over to recover it . Quickly he climbed up again , clutching the sixpenny piece in his fist , and ran to his father . With shining eyes , he said " Father , you spoke ! " Matan had the branch across his knees and with lips half drawn back from his teeth in an expression like a snarl he watched it intently . He did not hear or see his son . But nothing happened to the smallest leaf on the branch . IIe did not quite know what he had expected . Perhaps , if the long shadow of his father had indeed been riding on the bough , it would have made some sign of its departure , withering the leaves or setting them on fire . Yet nothing happened and the terrible suspicion swelled again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors , there was no averting the evil following him , no way of controlling his destiny . What must be must be . " Come , " he said mildly to the boy . " Let us go . " He walked now with an effort and his tall straight back was slightly stooped . A fierce energy drove him on and the boy frequently ran a few paces or jogged at his father 's side , clinging to the ragged and flapping greatcoat . They kept for some miles to the dusty district road . The sun 's heat danced from the hard clay and shale and in the bush the sun beetles droned and shrilled . The man kept his eyes fixed ahead and passing any stranger he merely raised his free hand in a silent gesture . " My father can not speak , " the boy explained , and they hurried on . Down through the thorn scrub they turned on an ancient footpath , and they did not slacken pace . Sweat dripped from Matan 's chin and the boy trotting behind gasped for breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped at a stream to drink a little water and rinse their faces , and they crossed the slow-running umSuluzi at a drift . At last they came to their home , two thatch beehive huts set at the foot of a rocky hill , and an old woman , who was a relative of Ma tan 's mother , stopped grinding corn and fetched him a drink in a calabash . She regarded him with intense alarm and had noticed how he had changed for the worse , but she tried to keep her face turned aside and did not speak except in greeting . He left the boy with her and from the blackened thatch inside his but drew out a long-bladed fighting assagai . He placed the branch at the back of the but with a bowl of milk and went out again into the afternoon sun , now carrying his assagai as well as his sticks . At the drift across the umSuluzi he stopped to polish the blade of his spear , taking fine sand and a piece of pumice to hone off the spots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dried the glittering blade on his sleeve . It was illegal and dangerous to carry such a weapon but he now cared little for that . A quick walk through the bush brought him at sunset to a wealthy kraal where many cattle and goats were being penned by small boys for the night . The huts were built of stone with stout thatch roofs out of which thrust poles and sticks surmounted by various skulls and horns of animals and blown-up gall bladders . One but alone was of the traditional all-thatch pattern and was even weathered 62 THE MAN WHO DOUBTED and dilapidated in a kind of mock humility , and here he found the isangoina expecting him . " You have spoken , you opened your mouth ! " the man accused hint without any ceremony . " I have spoken  --  what matter ? " " Did you remember what I said ? " " I remembered . " Matan turned on him ferociously and glared almost maddened at the crafty and intelligent face obscure in the growing darkness . " Why have you come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will say . I want to know if my father has returned . I want to know if I will be given peace , I and my son . " " How can I say ? You have broken the command of the spirits . " " I paid you my last cow to do this  --  and you will do it , son of Noqomfela . " Have you come to threaten me , one who can destroy you with his little finger ? " " I must have an answer . Come with me now and attend to the burial of my father 's shadow . The grave is ready . And if you say he has not come home then I swear to you , evildoer , I will send your ghost to fetch him . " He laid his palm along the shining blade of the spear to make himself clear to the doctor and then stooping under the low door he came out . In single file they returned on the path through the bush . The isangoma walked ahead , a slight old man wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was dusk . The grave was in a hollow near the river and over it rose the pale-dusty ominous trunk of a fever tree . Matan had dug it himself before leaving . He brought the branch of wild olive and some pots of beer and corn and he led a goat on a thong for the sacrifice . He quickly cut the goat 's throat with the sharp edge of his assagai blade and ' disemboweled it . While he struck a match the witch doctor studied the fat on the entrails and slit out the gall bladder . The match went out and now the moon shone down on them from a clear black sky . By its light Matan climbed down into the grave and carefully placed the pots of food and beer . When he raised himself he saw the other had scratched together some twigs and lit a small fire . On it he sprinkled powder from a horn and a thick , acrid smoke hissed out , flowing like a liquid down the lip of the new grave . Matan coughed heavily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he gripped the gleaming , bloodstained spear all the tighter and began slowly to climb out . He was weak and heavy in his limbs , fighting tenaciously to keep his balance . The fever raced in his veins and his head was ringing . Now he was out and the isangorna stood to face him . Has my father 's long shadow returned ? " he demanded . " He has returned . " " Then you lied to me . Words escaped my mouth and still you say he is here . This way or that way you are lying . " " ft was too far for him to fly back to the umLambongwenya so he continued the journey with you . He is here , he is satisfied . " This is another lie . I have not heard his voice . " You do not hear and see because your life is nearing an end . Son of Makofin , you are dying . " " That is at least the truth , " he said slowly and bitterly , leaning on the haft of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will not live many days . " " You have given your life for your father , and for your son . " " Then let us die together , " Matan cried out , raising the spear in a sudden whirl of his thin but powerful arm . The witch doctor shrieked as he stepped back . A T sunrise the boy came to search for his father and found him lying calm and serene on his back with his head propped on the roots of the fever tree and his feet toward the open grave . Stuck fast inches deep into the bole of the tree was his stabbing assagai . " How is it with my father ? " he asked with a beating heart . The man looked up gauntly and seeing his son his eyes softened . " It goes well with me . Is the other here , the son of Noqomfe/a ? " " No . " " Look about  --  is he not lying stabbed ? " " No , he is nowhere . " " Look for my spear then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He raised his burning eyes and saw the haft and blade of his assagai standing out from the tree trunk . At that he sighed as if greatly relieved . " When you are old enough , " he said with difficulty , " get back the place of your fathers and live there in peace . Let them bury me in the same grave which I dug for Makofin . Now we are home . One day you may have cattle again , and men children and girl children . I can not give you anything . " The boy twisted out of a knot in his vest the coin he had picked up . " Look , I have a sixpence . I will grow big and have boots to wear and work at the power station .
