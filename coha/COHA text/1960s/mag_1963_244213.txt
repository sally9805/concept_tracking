To the average American , liver is for wurst . But to 47.6 million Frenchmen , le foie - when it is not gras - is the precious , pesky organ that regulates their lives . When a Frenchman exclaims , " Mon foie ! " , his cry from the gland wins instant sympathy , even in a Place de la Concorde traffic jam . Depending on whether it is swollen , too hard , too tender , congested , enrheumed or , as the French say , " intoxicated " from a surfeit of rich food , the liver is blamed for virtually every physical malfunction from ingrown toenails to inadequate amatory performance . <P> To assuage the Gallic gland , French men gulp some 7,000 varieties of patent medicines - notably , Les Petites Pilules Carters Pour Le Foie - as well as treating it to massage , hot baths , compresses , radioactive water , herbs , fasts , purges , exercises , and injections , naturally , of liver . Says an Anglo-Saxon doctor who has practiced for many years in Paris : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that he had liver trouble . " Undoubtedly , the Frenchman 's liver takes a worse beating than any other variety on earth , except that of the geese they force-feed for foie gras . The French foie not only absorbs more and richer food than most other livers ; it also has to cope with the world 's highest alcoholic intake . One result is that France has the world 's highest death rate from cirrhosis of the liver , 31.2 per 100,000 annually , v. 11.5 in the U.S. <P> Crises for Cats . In most other civilized countries , the liver is rated one of the body 's most rugged and efficient organs ; the original protein factory , it can actually repair its own damaged cells and lost tissue . The Anglo-Saxon often attributes liver ailments to malnutrition , a fate to which the liver is not conspicuously subject in France , where every foodstuff is weighed for its effect on the foie . In the age-old belief that eggs overtax young livers , the average French parent would sooner poach a hare than an egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as suspect as they are essential to French cuisine . The French even treat their dogs and cats for crises de foie . <P> So universal is the cult of liver worship , say many doctors , that patients refuse to believe that anything else could possibly be wrong with them . Says Dr. Andr Varay , one of France 's most eminent liver specialists : " French liver trouble is almost a chauvinistic attribute . The Frenchman looks indulgently at the minor miseries his epicureanism and great cooking cause him , the way a valiant warrior looks on his battle scars . " <P> Give It a Walk . This week , as the nation girded itself for its foie du reveillon , the virulent hangover peculiar to Christmas and New Year 's , magazines and newspapers were filled with timely tips for the battle-scarred . In addition to stringent post-holiday dieting-for serious crises de foie , doctors recommend total abstinence from meat , eggs , fish , butter , wine , tobacco and coffee-Dr . Andr Soubiran , writing in the woman 's magazine Jours de France , warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will invariably be " put in a better humor " if it is taken for a brisk walk , " preferably in a forest .
