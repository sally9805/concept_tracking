To those who were old enough to job-hunt then , the Depression ' 30s were a time nobody loved . But for young Americans today , the period has become a nostalgic treasure trove . Stores from coast to coast are advertising ruffles and the Harlow look ; the late show provides a touchstone by rerunning the movie classics ; and Bonnie and Clyde is mandatory in all extracurricular undergraduate courses . But as is often the case with trends , artists have been well in the vanguard of popular taste , and some of the most gifted have been on a ' 30s kick for years ( see color opposite ) . <P> Fun &; Sexy . Wisconsin 's Warrington Colescott , 47 , who knew the period as a teenager , explored the subject in his Dillinger series , a group of lithographs and color intaglios in his recent one-man show this February at the Milwaukee Art Center . To California-born Colescott , the ' 30s , for all the hard times , had " a kind of kinship and romance . " He sees Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the folk hero of the decade , the outlaw at odds with society , who also personified " the general environment of violence that is still very much with us . " <P> Colescott was inspired to begin his Dillinger series after a visit to the old Biograph Theater in Chicago , where Dillinger was ambushed by the FBI . For his version of Dillinger 's famed raid on the Mason City , Iowa , bank , Colescott again went to the scene , interviewed Iowans who had been present for the great event . Colescott 's version breaks the bank heist into a series of movie stills , evokes Dillinger 's gaiety and derring-do with " Fun " lettered in a corner and a half-naked doll , with a star in her navel , strumming a banjo-ukulele . Two naked gun molls accompany the raiders ; as Colescott observes , " the Dillinger men took their girls with them wherever they went . I 've tried to convey the feeling of the gang : very rowdy , very adolescent , very sexual . " <P> Star Photos . Richard Merkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late to know at first hand the decades between the wars . But he has become an indefatigable researcher into the era , which he sees typified by " an innocence , a lack of maturity , and on the other hand , a marvelous sense of style and elegance . " To recapture the past , he surrounds himself with trivia , including old copies of Esquire , FORTUNE and The New Yorker , a collection of Popeye lamps , Old Gold cigarette posters and bound volumes of Superman comics . Merkin adopts the look of the past as well as pasting it together ; he owns seven white , plaid or pinstripe suits ( all with vest and broad lapels ) and 175 ties ( mostly pink and lavender ) , parts his hair like a Van Heusen shirt model , sports a Groucho Marx mustache and smokes Murads.
