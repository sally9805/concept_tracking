Charles de Gaulle picked up a phone and called his chief delegate at Evian-les-Bains , white-haired Louis Joxe . Break off the talks , he ordered-at least for the moment . De Gaulle was frankly fed up . Day after day , week after week , Algeria 's rebel F.L.N. delegation had rejected every French proposal . There would be no special guarantees for the rights of Algeria 's 1,000,000 Europeans after independence , the rebels insisted . Nor would the French be allowed to hang on to the vast Sahara region and its oil ; the Sahara must become an integral part of the new Algerian nation . As for France 's unilateral ceasefire in the Algerian war announced last month , the F.L.N. replied by stepping up their own killing : in the 19 days following the opening of the Evian conference , 133 people have been killed and 300 wounded by the terrorists in Algeria alone . <P> Relaying the boss 's orders to the startled F.L.N. contingent across the table in Evian 's Hotel du Pare , Joxe was polite but firm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have nothing to add . I suggest , in the present state of our talks , a suspension of our meetings and an interval for reflection . " <P> The F.L.N. 's chief negotiator , stocky ex-Guerrilla Belkacem Krim , was clearly taken aback . " We do not agree at all . Not at all . This is a unilateral move , " he spluttered . Krim proposed that " working sessions " continue the following day . But De Gaulle was adamant ; he plainly wanted to let the Algerians stew for awhile . Perhaps , suggested Joxe , everyone might get together again in ten to 15 days , but the tone of his farewell words as he flew off to Paris was clear enough : do n't call us , we 'll call you .
