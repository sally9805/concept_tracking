Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . - First Amendment <P> To alter the latest interpretation of those time-honored words , which go back to 1791 , is the goal of 170 proposed amendments to the U.S. Constitution , now being hotly debated before the House Judiciary Committee . In an unprecedented assault on the Constitution 's first ten amendments , which are known as the Bill of Rights , all of the new amendments , whatever their wording , have one aim : to reverse the Supreme Court 's recent decisions against school prayers and Bible reading . <P> Dubious Business ? From Alabama 's Governor George Wallace to Roman Catholic Bishop Fulton Sheen , a parade of largely anti-court witnesses testified before the committee last week . Ala bama refuses to " order God out of our neighborhood schools , " cried Wallace . " We will stand up for God ! We will stand up for America ! " More constructively , Sheen suggested that no amendment was needed . But he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in schools . " Said he : Let schools be allowed at least to adopt " the prayer that every member is carrying in his pocket - 'In God We Trust . ' " <P> Things looked good for New York Republican Frank J. Becker , author of an amendment approving voluntary school prayers . Becker claimed 167 signatures on a discharge petition , only 51 short of the number required to get his proposal out of committee and onto the House floor . But opposition was stiffening for one compelling reason : even mild tinkering with the First Amendment is dubious business . Said the Rev. Eugene Carson Blake , Stated Clerk of the United Presbyterian Church : " I take alarm at this experiment with our liberties . The Bill of Rights should remain unamended , for the rights are inalienable . " <P> Much of the cry to " Get God Back in the Schools " reflects deep misunderstanding of what the court actually said . In Engel v. Vitale ( 1962 ) , it overruled the required daily recitation of a nondenominational prayer composed by a governmental body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1963 's Murray v. Curlett and Schempp v. School District , it overruled school-required reading of Scripture in Maryland and Pennsylvania . All three decisions were based on what the court deemed to be an inescapable reading of the First Amendment 's " establishment " clause . Far from being antireligious , the court simply aimed to keep government from interfering with religion . <P> Wrong Clause ? Many constitutional lawyers who agree with the ultimate decision still fault the court on its reasoning . Its use of the establishment clause seems to proscribe any link at all between government and religion , yet such links are embedded in the realities of U.S. society . To infer that government now has a duty to cut them may well force the court to later confront unnecessarily painful questions , including the constitutionality of tax exemption for churches . Such future troubles could have been avoided , critics say , had the court arrived at the same school decisions by a somewhat different route-the First Amendment 's " free exercise " clause , thus allowing the court to stress freedom of worship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
