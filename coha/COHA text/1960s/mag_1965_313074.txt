Frank Morrissey 's closest cronies would not claim that he is a learned jurist or even a seasoned trial lawyer . <P> Nonetheless , argued Massachusetts ' junior Senator last week , the Kennedy clan 's longtime political trusty has a more substantial qualification for the federal bench in Boston . In Ted Kennedy 's words , Frank is " absolutely in corruptible . " <P> The subtle merits and elusive memo ries of Francis Xavier Morrissey , 55 , were scrutinized for nine hours by Senate Judiciary Committee members , who then approved President Johnson 's nominee for the $30,000-a-year lifetime judgeship ( TIME , Oct. 8 ) . There were , of course , turgid testimonials arranged by Morrissey 's backers . Anticipating opposition in Senate subcommittee hearings , they put on ten witnesses and adduced an encomium from Richard Cardinal Gushing , who in 1956 christened Morrissey 's tenth baby , Richard Gushing , in the first such ceremony ever televised . <P> Teddy Kennedy , at whose family 's behest Morrissey was made a Boston municipal justice in 1958 , avowed that the nominee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Added House Speaker John McCormack : " I like a man who is loyal . What 's wrong with rewarding your friends ? " The most memorable characterization was offered by Walter McLaughlin , president of the Massachusetts Bar Association , which did an about-face and decided to support Morrissey after twice opposing his nomination . " His educational background , " said McLaughlin , " has been pilloried from post to post . " <P> Unpleasant Word . The American Bar Association sent three officials to pillory some more . They pointed to conspicuous gaps in Morrissey 's background as lawyer and judge . Concluded Bernard Segal , former chairman of the A.B.A. 's federal judiciary committee : " We have not had any case in which those factors are so lacking as in the case of Judge Morrissey . " <P> The air of unreality deepened when Albert Jenner , present chairman of the same committee , disclosed that in 1933 Morrissey went to Georgia , where it was then possible for a resident to gain admission to the bar without an examination . Morrissey , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts , had a try at the bar exam nonetheless , and failed it . In Athens , Morrissey obtained a Georgia diploma from a two-man outfit , now defunct , called the Southern Law School . Jenner called it a " diploma mill . " Armed with this credential and testimonials from both of his teachers , Morrissey was admitted to practice before superior court in Clarke County on Sept. 7 , 1933 . The next day he went to Atlanta , where he won admittance to the Georgia supreme court and the U.S. district court , with two more diploma crammers as character witnesses . <P> " As near as we can determine , " Jenner concluded , " Morrissey returned to Boston either the night of the 8th or the morning of the 9th of September . " Illinois ' Senator Everett Dirksen observed : " If you allege that you live in one state for the purpose of being admitted to the bar , and you 're not a resident-there 's a rather unpleasant word for that . It bothers me . " Oddly enough , Morrissey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all neglected to inform the Judiciary Committee of Morrissey 's educational foray in Georgia .
