He stood proudly at the plate in his pin-stripe New York Yankee uniform , listening to the roar of the huge hometown crowd . " It 's a hell of a thing , " said Pinch-Hitter Harry Bright . " I wait 17 years to get into a World Series . Then I finally get up there , and 69,000 people are yelling-yelling for me to strike out . " Whiff he did , thus capping a spectacular performance-for someone else . <P> <P> The achievement belonged to Pitcher Sandy Koufax , 28 , who , in his nine seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers , has known his share of trouble . Only last year , a mysterious circulatory ailment called Raynaud 's Phenomenon almost caused doctors to amputate the forefinger on his pitching hand. * But this year Koufax won 25 games , lost only five , set a record with 306 strikeouts , and was the key man in the Dodgers ' drive to the National League pennant . Yet all that seemed nothing compared to last week . <P> <P> With artistry and audacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first game of the World Series . He not only beat the fearsome Yankees ; he humiliated them . <P> <P> Sometimes it was a smoking fastball , sometimes a tantalizing curve that dropped like an overripe apple across the center of the plate . Whatever it was , the Yankees could not hit it . The top of the Yankee order , producers of 73 home runs this year , did not get the ball in front of the plate until the sixth inning . Mickey Mantle had two Ks beside his name in the scorebook before he managed an infield pop-up-and drop-kicked his batting helmet halfway to the dugout . At last , Tommy Tresh got to Koufax for a two-run homer . But Bobby Richardson , who struck out only 22 times all season , whiffed three times . " That , " muttered a Yankee , " is an act of God . " Finally , with two out in the ninth , Koufax fogged the final fastball past Harry Bright . That made the total 15 strikeouts , and a new Series record . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other heroes . Catcher John Roseboro hit a three-run homer off Whitey Ford , and First Baseman Bill Skowron , a Yankee discard , bedeviled his old teammates with two run-producing hits . But none could match Koufax . In the dressing room , he rubbed a little salt in Yankee wounds . " I would have been satisfied with 14 strikeouts , " he said , " but I had to end the game some way , and that seemed as good a way as any . " <P> The bookies still picked the Yankees to win the second game . Dodger Manager Walter Alston 's pitcher for this engagement was Johnny Podres , who at 31 is getting a trifle thick around the waist . There are those who joke that Bachelor Podres pitches harder off the field than on ( " He 's done all the things that Bo Belinsky says he has , " goes one gag ) , but among his peers he has a reputation as a " money " pitcher who is toughest under pressure . Over 81 innings , he gave up only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball to Relief Pitcher Ron Perranoski , and tipped his cap to the fans . <P> Meanwhile , the Dodgers made the Yankees look like a farm club . Marvel ous Maury Wills blithely stole second on a pick-off play . Tommy Davis clouted two triples and ran his Series batting average to .625 ; " Moose " Skowron , still drinking thirstily at the well of revenge , put the game away with a wrong-way homer into the rightfield stands . Final score : Dodgers 4 , Yankees 1 .
