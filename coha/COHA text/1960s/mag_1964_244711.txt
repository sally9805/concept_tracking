In the six months since his brother 's death , Attorney General Robert Kennedy has been casting about for a future-and so far has found none . He has considered teaching , perhaps taking a college presidency . But inevitably , his search has centered on politics . <P> A few weeks ago , Pundit Walter Lippmann suggested that Kennedy run for Governor of New York in 1966 . But Lippmann did not check his facts ; Bobby did , and discovered that the state requires legal residence of at least five years for any gubernatorial candidate . <P> When One 's Enough . How about returning to Massachusetts to make the first run of his life for elective office ? Well , there are problems there too . Democratic Governor Endicott Peabody is up this fall for a second two-year term , but it would hardly seem sporting for Bobby to shove him aside . He could , of course , wait until 1966 and run for Republican Lev Saltonstall 's Senate seat , but Brother Teddy is already in the Senate , and even Massachusetts might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> There was , and still is , talk that Lyndon Johnson might want Bobby to be his running mate this year . But that talk blows hot and cold-mostly cold . Johnson has not discussed the possibility with Bobby , and Bobby , who never was an intimate of the President , has not broached it . <P> Under serious consideration last week was still another possibility-running for the U.S. Senate from New York against Republican Kenneth Keating . Though Kennedy 's legal voting residence is still in Massachusetts , that would not bar him from running from New York , since he would merely be required to be an inhabitant of the state at the time of his election. * <P> Launching Pad . Bobby 's brother-in-law , Steve Smith , an experienced Kennedy political troubleshooter , has recently been scouting out Bobby 's chances for the New York seat . The idea appeals greatly to many New York Democratic leaders ; they have been desperately looking for a strong candidate to contest Keating , who has a formidable following . But there are dissonant voices as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York City 's Mayor Robert Wagner mumbled his reluctant acquiescence , but he would just as soon not deal with any threats to his party leadership , and the New York Times was plainly against it . While there is nothing illegal about a Kennedy candidacy in New York , said a Times editorial , " there is plenty that is cynical about it ... He would merely be choosing New York as a convenient launching pad for the political ambitions of himself and others . " <P> Notwithstanding all the flurry , Robert Kennedy as of last week still had n't made up his mind . <P> <P> - " No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty years , and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States , and who shall not , when elected , be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen . " ( Article I , Section 3 , U.S. Constitution. )                  @ @ @
