Officials in Bangkok habitually argue that Thailand - Communist insurgency problems notwithstanding - is not at all like Viet Nam . Last week Thai Communist guerrillas , who until now have confined their terrorism to ambush and intimidation in the countryside , challenged that notion with the kind of bold attack that has become routine in Viet Nam : a commando raid on an airfield . <P> The Communists ' target was the Royal Thai Air Force Base at Udorn , one of five Thai fields from which U.S. fighter-bombers fly daily strikes into North Viet Nam and Communist-held parts of Laos . Udorn , only a few miles from the Mekong River border with Laos , has a complement of 6,000 American airmen , two fighter-bomber squadrons and two tactical reconnaissance squadrons . Like the other Thai bases , it was considered a safe haven ; as one U.S. serviceman put it not long ago : " It 's a big thing when you do n't have to go to bed wondering if somebody 's going to lob a mortar shell at you . " <P> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept up to the base one night last week carried AK-47 automatic rifles and satchel charges . The men penetrated the northern edge of the base at a point where there was no fence . Thai guards responsible for base security flashed the alarm . By that time , however , the intruders had already damaged two planes , an F-4D Phantom fighter bomber and a C-141 jet transport fitted for medical evacuation . In the confusing half-hour firefight that ensued , a Thai guard was killed and four Americans were wounded , one critically . Two guerrillas were killed and two were captured . Following the Udorn attack , all other bases in Thailand were put on full alert , and U.S. base security guards , previously armed only with pistols , were issued M-16 rifles .
