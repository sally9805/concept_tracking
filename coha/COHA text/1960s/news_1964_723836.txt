txt More than 3,000 supporters of civil rights and social reform marched on the state capitol today in snow , freezing rain and slush . They presented their demands to Governor Rockefeller and legislative leaders , who offered their sympathy but no specific help . Leaders of the six labor and civil rights organizations that sponsored the one-day demonstration were not surprised by the Governor 's reaction . A. Philip Randolph , the Negro labor leader who is heading an effort to establish a $1.50 minimum hourly wage in the state , told the demon- strators in a rally after the Capitol march : " We had a useful but disappointing  --  but not discouraging ? conference with Governor Rockefeller this morning . " Mr. Randolph and others who addressed the demonstrators emphasized that the state 's politicians would change their minds about reform legislation when liberal voters exercised their power at the ballot box and in further demonstrations . Mr. Randolph said , speaking of the Governor : " We can change his mind if we continue to march .

Most of the ' bystanders were expressionless.1 The march was quiet and digni- ; fied , except for one group that sang a song that ran : " . . before I 'll be a slave , Wagner 'll , be buried in his grave . . .

Another speaker at the afternoon rally , Norman Hill of , the National Congress of Racial Equality , said of the meeting with Mr. Rockefeller : " By and large , with the exception of a promise and a commitment to help the hospital workers , we got what we 've always gotten  --  sympathy . " He told the demonstrators that " only if we light fires all over the state , only if we disrupt and dislocate in a creative way , will we get what we want . " The Governor , after his onehour-and-40-minute meeting with the Negro and labor leaders , said that he planned a meeting with legislative leaders within the next few days to discuss all the problems presented today .
