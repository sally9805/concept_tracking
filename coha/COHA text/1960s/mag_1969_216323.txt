MIDDLE EAST <P> When Israeli commandos raided Bei rut 's International Airport last month , eight of Middle East Airlines ' 13 planes went up in flames . Despite this destruction , MEA did not really lose much during the raid - and in some ways is better off than before . Though a brand-new Boeing 707 jet was destroyed , the line also got rid of some aging Comets and other planes that it had been trying unsuccessfully to sell . <P> Keep ' Em Flying . Most important , MEA had shrewdly insured its fleet with war-risk policies that covered the full " book value " of the aircraft . Since the line valued the planes rather generously on its books , it figures to get $17.9 million from Lloyd 's of London and other insurers - more than enough to replace the lost fleet . The true mar ket value of each of its three six-year-old Comet jets , for example , is about $400,000 , but MEA listed each at $1,500,000 and paid appropriate premiums . MEA will also collect $1,500,000 for each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more than the market value for one lost Viscount . The new Boeing 707 is expected to bring $8,500,000 , roughly what it cost . The eighth gutted plane , a VC-10 , was on charter from Ghana Airways , and MEA is not responsible for its loss . <P> <P> The high insurance coverage did not result from Israeli-Arab tensions , but from the brief Indo-Pakistani war in 1965 . " At that time , " says Sheikh Najib Alamuddin , MEA 's president , " our aircraft served both Karachi and Bombay , and we decided to cover our fleet with complete war-risk insurance . Thank goodness we 've continued to maintain those policies . " <P> MEA , the largest and most successful Arab airline , managed to maintain its service by doubling up some flights in the first days following the raid . Instead of scheduling separate flights to London and Paris , for example , it serviced both capitals with a single daily plane from Beirut . To back up its remaining five planes , the line has since chartered three Comets from Kuwait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boeing from Air France . It will also have six months ' free use of a Caravelle owned by Morocco 's King Hassan II . Other offers to help have come in from Pan American , Lufthansa , KLM and Russia 's Aeroflot . <P> There is no guarantee that MEA 's recovery will last . Chartering planes is expensive and cuts into flight profits . Since the Israeli attack , Lloyd 's has increased MEA 's premiums for war-risk coverage eighteenfold , and has imposed a ceiling on what it will pay henceforth : a maximum of $8,150,000 each for no more than two airplanes . Lloyd 's is imposing similar conditions on Israel 's El Al and all other airlines operating intensively in the Middle East area . <P> The question now facing MEA is whether the airport raid will affect tourism and shake passenger confidence . That will not be answered until the Lebanese tourist season begins in April . For the first 19 days of 1969 , however , MEA 's passenger loads were almost 20% above the same period in 1968.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
