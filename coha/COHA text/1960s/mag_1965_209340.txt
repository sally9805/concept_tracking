While the unfolding mystery of Stonehenge traces some surprising knowledge of astronomy back to Stone Age Britons , the steadily growing evidence of paleontology is tracing life itself farther and farther into the past . Last week Dartmouth Professor An drew McNair reported to the Geological Society of America that he had discovered the remains of advanced forms of life 120 million years older than any recognized before . As for simpler , one-celled organisms , Harvard 's Elso S. Barghoorn told the society that he has found them to be a billion years older than anyone had previously suspected . <P> Primeval Presumption . During an electron microscopic examination of samples of ancient , black sedimentary rock from South Africa , Paleontologist Barghoorn uncovered the remains of 3-billion-year-old , rod-shaped organisms so small that 50,000 of them , placed end to end , would measure only an inch . Until his find , the oldest known forms of life were more complex tiny organisms-also identified and photographed by Barghoorn ( TIME , March 12 ) - that existed about 2 billion years ago . With the older specimens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area in time-say within a half-billion years-of possible transition between non-biologically produced material and the first presumptive primeval organism . " Discovery of the bacteria-like organisms , says Barghoorn , indicates that there was water and erosion 3 billion years ago and that biological processes then were comparable to those today . <P> Mother Lode . Geologist McNair made his discovery last summer after sighting a distinctive rock ledge on remote Victoria Island in the Canadian arctic . Clearly visible on the surface of the Pre-Cambrian rock , which had somehow escaped the disturbances of mountain building and the pressures of overlying rock , were the fossilized tracks of burrowing , wormlike animals - an encouraging indication that more fossils might be near by . Says McNair : " I knew how gold prospectors felt when they stumbled across the mother lode . " Splitting open the rock , he found the remains of 47 primitive , clamlike brachi-opods that radioisotope dating proved to be at least 720 million years old . <P> Before McNair 's discovery , there had been no evidence that advanced forms of life existed until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists believed that there was not enough oxygen in the Pre-Cambrian atmosphere to support the development of animals with specialized organs . Now the highly evolved and efficient digestive , locomotive , respiratory and nervous systems of McNair 's brachiopods and worms suggest that the earth 's atmosphere had an ample supply of oxygen 720 million years ago , and probably for much longer than that .
