The demands on a Prince of Wales have altered , but I am determined to serve and to try as best I can to live up to those demands , whatever they might be in the rather uncertain future . <P> One thing I am clear about , and it is that Wales needs to look forward with out forsaking the traditions and essential aspects of her past . <P> First in lilting Welsh , and then in a King 's English , Britain 's Prince Charles last week spoke those modest words to his countrymen in response to his in vestiture as Prince of Wales . Around the world millions watched the four hours of panoply and pageantry over satellite TV transmission . What the world saw was a slim , erect young man moving slowly and somewhat stiffly at first through one of royalty 's rich , ancient rituals . But for the 80,000 or so who crowded in and around the ancient castle of Caernarvon , the mixture of Welsh informality and London modishness that marked the occasion made it a kind of family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more impressive , more personal-and more fun - than almost anyone , especially the Welsh , had thought it would be . <P> Box-Lunch Search . Even so , the occasion was not entirely without the violence that Welsh nationalists had promised . Two young extremists were killed the night before the ceremony when explosives that they were carrying went off near train tracks in Abergele , where the royal family passed on its way to Caernarvon . Later , the train carrying the royal entourage was halted while police checked out one of dozens of bomb threats , and hours after Charles had left the castle , a British soldier burned to death inside an army minibus that had caught fire , possibly from a bomb . <P> Even though no incidents disturbed the ceremony itself , tension did necessitate a gigantic and unseemly security apparatus . Frogmen searched the harbor , and gate guards pried into guests ' box lunches and even into the orchestra 's instruments in a search for explosives . <P> Such minor indignities paled once the ceremony was underway . It began with a procession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms , bards dressed in swirling blue-and-green togas , Welsh politicians in robes of office and British officials , including Prime Minister Harold Wilson , KEYSTONE in morning clothes . The royal family itself was rather subdued . Queen Elizabeth , carrying an Edwardian parasol , was done up in pale gold . Prince Philip wore the dark blue , braided uniform of a field marshal . Prince Charles , who waited in the Chamberlain tower until formally summoned by his mother , wore the No. 1 blues of the New Royal Regiment of Wales , of which he is colonel-in-chief . As he received the instruments of his office - silver- handled sword , amethyst ring , ermine-topped mantle and contemporary gold coronet-mother and son looked into each other 's eyes . When it was over , and Charles had delivered his speech , Philip caught his son 's eye , and the prince broke into a smile .
