The darkroom assistant in Dancker 's photo shop in Bonn could hardly believe his eyes . Among banal vacation snapshots on a strip of film taken from a Minox camera were nine pictures of NATO documents clearly marked " Top Secret " and " Secret . " It took police and the West German Counter Espionage Service four days to identify the owner of the film . He proved to be Rear Admiral Hermann Ludke , formerly deputy chief ( early 1966 to mid-1967 ) of the logistics section of SHAPE , NATO 's European command , who was on the eve of his retirement from the service . <P> Ludke had held a CTS ( Cosmic Top Secret ) clearance in the SHAPE job and knew the most sensitive details of NATO logistics : the capacities of European ports , transport , defense industries ; the location of nuclear weapons depots and ordnance stockpiles of the NATO armies , virtually down to the number of available artillery rounds . The photos suggested that he might be transmitting secrets to NATO 's enemies . <P> Feted with Champagne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was not told of the suspicions against him until three days before he left the navy . The occasion was a champagne luncheon feting his retirement . After a laudatory farewell speech by Defense Minister Gerhard Schroder , Vice Admiral Gert Jeschonnek , the chief of the navy , and a counterespionage man took Ludke aside to question him . The admiral at first lamely explained that someone must have stolen the Minox to take the pictures . However , he later changed his story to claim that he wanted the documents for his memoirs . If so , they would surely have ranked among the dullest ever written , since the documents were merely directives for handling supplies . Nevertheless , he was allowed to go home arid was interrogated only the next day . Because West German counterspies apparently take weekends off , two more days elapsed before the federal attorney 's office in Karlsruhe , which investigates and prosecutes treason , was informed of the case. * It took over the investigation , but unfortunately it did not stick close enough to the admiral . <P> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hunting preserve near Trier in the Eifel Mountains , a fist-sized wound in his chest , his Mauser rifle , loaded with dumdum rounds , across his legs . Accident ? Ludke was an avid hunter and too experienced a rifleman . Suicide ? The Trier district attorney 's office thought so , but it did not rule out murder . There was nothing in Ludke 's record to indicate a likelihood of treason , but the federal prosecutor 's office left open the possibility that he had spied for a foreign power .
