It was almost a palace coup in reverse . With the cool , crisp disdain of a modern-day Victoria , India 's Rajmata ( Queen Mother ) of Gwalior informed the governor of the state of Madhya Pradesh last week that 36 members of the state 's ruling Congress Party had defected to her opposition United Front Party . That gave the Rajmata , who is 47 and as tough a politician as they come , a clear majority in the 296-mem-ber state legislature . Flabbergasted , the governor suspended the legislature indefinitely , a move that could either open the way to new elections or lead to an invitation to the Rajmata herself to form a new government . <P> The legislative turmoil in India 's seventh largest state ( pop . 36,000,000 ) was only one numbing throb in what has become a royal headache for Indira Gandhi 's Congress Party . Twenty years after India 's independence and the merging of the country 's 554 autonomous kingdoms with its British-run provinces , the maharajahs , princelings and other assorted royalty left over from the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Congress Party . The party , in turn , is angrily threatening to cut off the pensions and special privileges of the princes . <P> Into Decline . Under India 's terms of independence , the old royal families who governed half the country and one-fourth of its people turned over their kingdoms to the central government in exchange for tax-free pensions and a series of special privileges . The pensions varied all the way from $26 to $665,000 a year , depending on the size of the kingdom ; many princes retained most of their accumulated wealth . The privileges included immunity from arrest and civil lawsuit , and retention of old titles , many palaces and estates . <P> Without the prestige and power of old , the princely life went quickly into decline . Many princes now sit in their drawing rooms amid moldering Victorian knickknacks , with the swords and shields of their martial caste decorating the walls and the reproachful gaze of full-length ancestors in oils staring down on them . Others converted their palaces into hotels . The Rajmata 's former kingdom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of Madhya Pradesh . The lavish royal guest house is a Girl Scout training center , and the main palace is a museum that charges 300 a head for admission . Many out-of-work princes drifted into the foreign service . Some took a fling at business ; the Maharajah of Cooch Behar even organized tiger-hunting safaris , complete with flush toilets under canvas . <P> By the early 1960s , more and more princes were drifting into a new princely calling-politics . Their former subjects , nostalgic for the good old days of low prices and far less bureaucracy , turned out in droves to vote for them . <P> In a 1962 parliamentary election , the Maharani Gayatri Devi of Jaipur ran up the biggest majority vote of any candidate-192,909 votes out of 246,516 cast . In the latest parliamentary elections last February , 28 princes won sizable parliamentary victories , only nine of them Congress Party members .
