Ever since the Food and Drug Administration 's careful checking procedures saved the U.S. from the 1961 thalidomide disaster , the agency 's critics have accused it of becoming overcautious and of needlessly delaying the marketing of valuable new drugs . This week the FDA stands accused of just the opposite-of having too hastily approved a drug that may not be safe enough for widespread use . <P> The drug , Du Font 's amantadine hydrochloride , is virtually the only medicine effective in preventing viral infections . Trade-named Symmetrel , it has been tested on more than 3,000 human subjects , and has shown remarkable effectiveness in protecting against Asian-A influenza . For an adult the effective dose of amantadine is 200 mg. a day , a tiny fraction of an ounce . <P> The trouble is that a tiny fraction more is dangerous ; even a young adult in good condition suffers severe side effects with a dose of only 300-400 mg . The reactions observed among medical students , reports the University of Illinois ' Dr. George Gee Jackson , " were predominantly alterations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inability to concentrate and depression . Several described sensations of depersonalization and altered body image . There was a remarkable degree of associated anxiety . " At doses of 400 mg. , nearly every volunteer suffered such effects . Fortunately , the effects subside in a few hours if no more amantadine is taken . <P> <P> After hearing Dr. Jackson 's report , the University of Cincinnati 's Dr. Albert B. Sabin , developer of oral polio vaccine , declared : " There is great concern about the large-scale use of this drug because its margin of safety is very , very narrow . " <P> FDA Commissioner James Lee Goddard refused to back down . " The risks involved in using the drug were weighed against the possible benefits , " he said in an interview in Medical Tribune . Information sent to physicians , he added , warns them against possible adverse reactions . And he promised continued cautious monitoring in the hope of finding ways to avoid them .                  @ @ @
