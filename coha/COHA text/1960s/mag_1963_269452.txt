The technical name of the disorder is hepatolenticular degeneration , a mouthful that has moved physicians to call it Wilson 's disease , after the doctor who first described it . But by any name it is still one of the most mysterious and devastating defects in the body 's complex chemistry . It can be inherited from outwardly healthy parents and involves the metabolism of minute amounts of copper . As recently as 1960 , medical textbooks stated : " The course of the disease is inexorably downhill if untreated . " Most baffling is the fact that the inherited defect may either produce severe illness within the first year of life , or lie dormant like a slowly ticking time bomb for as long as 40 years . In the A.M.A. Journal last week , two New York City doctors reported that they have developed a way to detect the defect before any illness has developed , when diet and drug treatment have the best chance to postpone , if not to prevent , its usual deadly sequence . <P> Danger Signal . Root of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has this defective gene , the child will not develop the disease , though he may pass on the gene . But if both parents have it , an average of one child out of four will have a deficiency of ceruloplasmin-a little-understood blue component of the blood , in which eight atoms of copper are bound into a large protein molecule . A deficiency of ceruloplasmin leads to a piling up of copper in such sensitive organs as the liver and brain . <P> The first visible sign that the time bomb has been triggered , whether at four or 40. may be jaundice . But more threatening is the brain damage : tremor , loss of control over physical movements , and personality changes . In young victims mental retardation is obvious . In adolescents and adults the effects of brain dam age are often mistaken for a variety of mental illnesses , including schizophrenia . <P> Only recently have doctors been able to slow down Wilson 's disease with drugs to leach copper out of the body , and a low-copper diet ( no liver , mushrooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , say Drs . Irmin Sternlieb and I. Herbert Scheinberg of Albert Einstein College of Medicine , to spot the inherited defect before illness has time to develop . <P> Brother &; Sister . To do this , they have perfected the use of a simplified , 50-cent test* to be given to any suspected cases and all relatives of known victims . It takes only one drop of blood . Anybody with a normal ceruloplasmin level can forget about Wilson 's disease . But anybody with an abnormally low level , the Bronx doctors say , should have a further test for copper in the liver . If this registers high , the patient is assumed to have the chemical defect and is promptly put on drugs and diet in the hope of preventing the development of full-blown disease . <P> Though it will take many years to determine whether the disease can be completely prevented , Drs .
