A century ago it was hardly respectable for a lady to be healthy , much less to engage in sports . She was expected to faint now and then to show her gentility . There were , however , a few revolutionaries among 19th century husbands who thought a wife was more fun when not in a swoon . Perhaps the most effective of these was a short , stocky man with a curly yellow beard named Dioclesian Lewis . In the 1860s he devised a system of light gymnastics , mostly for ladies , and invented the light wooden dumbbell and the beanbag. // His writings quaintly set forth his theories and his successes and , while now out of print , they may still be found in some libraries not recently weeded . His bestseller , The New Gymnastics , was published in 1862 by Ticknor and Fields and subsequently appeared in many editions . Other publications were mostly self-help pamphlets with titles like Five Minnie Chats with Young Women , Chastity ; or , Our Secret Sin and Our Digestion ; or , My Jolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crusade , a forerunner of the WCTU , and he is credited with such witticisms as , " A clean tooth never decays . " But his system of physical education for women remains his most important achievement in social history . It came in the nick of time , for well-to-do women may have been headed for extinction . They spent most of their time lying on their couches , and with good reason , since standing they had to lace themselves to a 20-inch waist and weigh themselves down with some 20 pounds of clothing . // Catherine Beecher , who was unusually energetic for her time and who had talked about exercise for women even before Dio  --  as he was often called  --  came along , took a survey of women 's health as early as 1856 . It was appalling . She said that of her nine married sisters-in-law all but two were either delicate or invalids . Of her 14 married female cousins , all were delicate or invalids . // Dio Lewis ' own wife was no better than her contemporaries . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hacking cough , a hectic flush , and she , too , finally took to her couch . The Lewises were living in Buffalo at the time , and Dioclesian was practicing homeopathic medicine and editing a magazine called The Hom ? opathist . With the onset of his wife 's illness he immediately dropped his career and devoted all his efforts to curing her . He got her off the couch , prescribed a loose dress and low-heeled shoes , then set her to sawing wood , a job he considered most beneficial to deep breathing . That first winter she managed to saw all the wood needed to keep two fires in their home going . The next winter they moved to Fredericksburg , where the climate was milder , but by then Mrs. Lewis was well . // This was also a fortunate move for Dio Lewis , for it was here that he discovered the lecture platform . He was such a success that he began to devote his whole time to traveling and speaking . Six nights a week he lectured on health , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperance . // The females in his audience loved Dio , and Lewis loved an audience . He used plenty of props : wands and blowguns , his light wooden dumbbell and his little bag of ticking filled with white beans . There were group games , there was laughter , there was gentility. // To prove all the benefits of his system , he now had , with all the rest of his apparatus , his healthy wife to exhibit and thump and flex . Julian Hawthorne ( Nathaniel 's journalist son ) , who did not like Lewis at all , felt especially sorry for his wife . He described Lewis as dapper , suave and full of sly jokes . // But Lewis could afford to ignore his detractors . He had by now received an honorary doctor 's degree from Cleveland 's Homoeopathic Hospital College , and he had a successful school going in Boston . This was called the Boston Normal Institute of Physical Education and was located at 20 Essex Street . There were seven ladies in the first class of 13. // After this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass. and bought a hotel with 110 rooms , and in October 1864 he opened the Family School for Young Ladies . It was a health farm for girls who had broken down at seminaries . The girls went to bed at 8:30 , wore strong shoes , ate plain food , walked with swinging arms and dressed in bloomers and tunics. // The school 's purpose was to beef up the girls , not slim them down , and during the first year Lewis noted an average enlargement in his students of 2 ? inches in the chest , 5 inches in the waist , 1 ? inches around the upper arm and 1 inch in the forearm. // " I attended his school , " wrote Mrs. Lillie Chase Wyman of Hingham , " worn out in body and mind and a mere bundle of damaged nerves , but gained there courage and strength to take up the battle and begin anew . " // Elizabeth Weir of Concord , who attended the school as a spectator now and then , wrote to a friend long afterward : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class . One of our ( then ) Concord young ladies , Una Hawthorne , attended his school in Lexington , and we always enjoyed the accounts of it that she brought home from time to time . " // Una Hawthorne , as a matter of fact , was only reluctantly allowed by her mother to attend the school and only under the condition that she wear her bloomers down to her shoe tops and put on a skirt when she crossed the street or was otherwise in public view . When she eventually decided to become a physical education teacher , her mother said no , and that was the end of that . // But if Una Hawthorne did not make it to the career of gymnastics teacher , there were others who did , more resolute and less dominated . A Miss Evans , a graduate of the Lewis Boston school , had for some time been instructing Mount Holyoke girls in the approved method of wand waving and marching and , when Vassar opened its doors in 1865 , it had Delia F. Woods as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gymnastics . Lucy Hunt , in the same class with Una Hawthorne , was on hand in Northampton to take over when Smith opened in 1873. // By 1882 improvement in female health had become so evident that the Associated Collegiate Alumnae was able to put forth a flat statement to the effect that of its 1,290 members , 77.85% were alive and robust and had not been harmed by college learning at all . // Today Dioclesian Lewis is all but forgotten . But in his day he was given testimonial dinners and silver bowls , and a book was written in his honor . The author was one Moses Coit Tyler , and the title was The Brawnville Papers  --  a story of a gymnastic Utopia centered around the Lewis system . // The citizens of the fictional Brawnville sang in chorus this tribute to Dr. Dioclesian Lewis : // Then work away till a better day On our pill-cursed race is shining ; For the " bell " and the " ring " shall defiance fling At the fiends of Disease and Pining .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
