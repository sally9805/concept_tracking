txt New York Gov . Nelson A. Rockefeller has given some ground on his fee-increase proposal , moving to a position where he will be seeking approximately $60 , - 000,000 more revenue from these sources instead of the S108,000,000 that was envisaged in the budget . The word " compromise " has been a part of the Governor 's political philosophy since he took office in 1959 . He has said that he felt that willingness to settle for compromise is a sound governmental principle . But , as political observers see it , this is the first time in some four year that Governor Rockefeller has had to make a major compromise . Observers , too , feel that there undoubtedly was some " fat " in the budget to absorb this revenue cutback . In fact , the Governor hinted that his budget was on the ample side  --  and not at all lean  --  in his briefings of the press on the new budget . Acceptable Proposal Furthermore , it is reasoned here , if more revenue should be needed  --  as the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue in those supplemental appro priations at the end of the legislative session . The Governor 's compromise is not specific . But after conferences with his legislative leaders . he is understood to have asked them to come up with a proposal that will be more acceptable to the rank and file . ? There is talk that the new car-registration fee might be a flat $25 or $26 for all automobiles . The original Rockefeller proposal would have raised the fee from the present $8 to $26 range to a new scale of $20 to $45 . Compromise in the liquor-license fee increase would be designed to ease the impact on hotel , restaurant , and package-store operators . Budget . Revolt The so-called " budget revolt " had cut deeply into the Republican side of the Legislature . Eleven GOP senators and 26 GOP assemblymen had expressed their opposition to the Rockefeller plan for raising the auto fees , and a considerable number of Republican legislators had taken a position against the liquor - license increase . Although indicating to legislative leaders he is willing to accept " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is holding his ground on his original contention : that fees are not taxes and that by raising fees he is not violating his campaign pledge not to raise taxes this session . The Democrats , solidly opposed to any manner of fee increase , haVe been charging that Governor Rockefeller is violating his campaign pledge . Support . Sufficient The Governor does have the numbers in the Republican-controlled Legislature to get his fee legislation through . The compromise is expected to be sufficient to silence the opposition within his own party in the Legislature , and the fee bills that now emerge are expected to becoMe law . Observers in Albany say that Governor Rockefeller can not afford to lose his fee program entirely without looking bad politically , since it is so much a part of his " pay-as-you-go " approach to state government .
