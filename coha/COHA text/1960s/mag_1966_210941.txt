In its prime , nothing better epitomized travel in the age for which it was named than the Twentieth Century Limited . A 1902 passenger once declared that it made New York and Chicago practically suburbs of each other . It did so with an all-Pullman splendor that offered both fresh-and saltwater baths , barbers and a library . Soprano Nellie Melba , the Armours , the Swifts and Teddy Roosevelt rode the train , and oldtime waiters recall that early-rising Herbert Hoover was invariably first up for breakfast . But in recent years , ordinary coaches had to be added to match the fare ( $43 ) at which jets now fly , in two hours , as against the train 's 16-hour run . <P> The end of the Twentieth Century , whose 80-man crew now often outnumbers passengers , approached last week when New York Central President Alfred E. Perlman announced plans to abandon , starting Jan. 1 , all passenger routes of over 200 miles . <P> Profits &; Previews . Over 80 years ago , according to legend , William H. Vanderbilt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Central &; Hudson River Railroad for profit or for public service . " The public be damned ! " was his immortal reply . " We run them because we have to . They do n't pay . " The modern New York Central has changed its manner , if not its mind . Along with the Central 's Twentieth Century and New York-Detroit Wolverine , the venerable Spirit of St. Louis may also be eliminated if the Interstate Commerce Commission approves the request of the Pennsylvania Railroad , which is now more or less set to merge with the Central on Oct. 1 . <P> In place of the great old trains and of its other long-haul passenger runs , the New York Central plans to start swift , spartan ( no club cars ) daytime shuttle service between some 80 cities along its 10,000-mile system . This , said Perlman , will " best serve the needs of the traveling public " - not to mention the Central 's balance sheet . <P> <P> In a preview of the kind of service to come , a self-propelled Central car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of Air Force surplus jet engines , last week whined through the flat farm country between Butler , Ind. , and Stryker , Ohio , at a U.S. rail record of 184 m.p.h . The test indicated that with existing technology and only minor changes in roadbeds , U.S. passenger trains can easily reach the 125-m.p.h. speed at which experts say railroads can profitably compete with airlines for the short-haul passenger trade . Said Perlman , 63 , who acted as " copilot " on the run : " The future of rail passenger services now hinges on the economic and marketing aspects of the business . " <P> <P> Even Faster . Operating every three hours during the day , a fast train shuttle could cut the time of the 142-mile New York-Albany trip by a third , to not much more than the two hours it takes by air . The probable cost : $5 , or $1.78 less than the present train fare , and about $8 less than the price of a plane ticket .
