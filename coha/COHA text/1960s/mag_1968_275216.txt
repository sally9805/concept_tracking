As the nine Justices of the Supreme Court reassemble in Washington this week to begin a new session , all the panoply will be familiar . The robed Justices will file behind the long Honduras mahogany bench as usual and take their seats in the high-backed black leather chairs set against red velvet draperies . The bronze clock will strike 10 o'clock , and the court clerk will intone the traditional " Oyez ! Oyez ! " <P> But though the symbols of constitutional majesty are still in place , the court faces as much uncertainty as it has ever known in its 178-year history . Justice Abe Fortas will sit to the right of his colleagues , and not in the chair that he had hoped to occupy ; the seat in the center is still filled by Chief Justice Earl Warren , who is anxious to end his Supreme Court career . Three other Justices besides Warren are old enough to be thinking about retirement : Hugo Black , 82 , John Marshall Harlan , 69 , and William O. Douglas , 69 . Lawyers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now constituted may find themselves presenting those cases to other Justices , men who may well have different judicial philosophies . <P> Birthday of an Amendment . Despite the uncertainty of the future , Justices Warren , Fortas and William Brennan took time last week to celebrate the past . The occasion was the 100th anniversary of the 14th Amendment , and at a centennial commemoration sponsored by N.Y.U. Law School , all three defended the use of the amendment 's " due process clause " to strike down state laws that discriminate against Negroes or deny federally guaranteed rights . Brennan called the 14th " the prime tool by which we as citizens are striving to shape a society which truly champions the dignity and worth of the individual . " Perhaps with the court 's Senate critics in mind , he traced the history of the amendment arguing that it was the original intention of Congress to have the court interpret and enforce its guarantees-Warren said that the court has for too many years had " sole responsibility for giving content and meaning to the broad mandate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of Congress and the President to share in the task through civil rights legislation . Pointing out that court decisions have helped awaken the nation 's conscience , Fortas said that the past 15 years have brought " the revitalization of the 14th Amendment and a return to the Constitution . " But he warned of " a new and savage struggle between freedom 's believers and its destroyers . " <P> Deep in Politics . That struggle is bound to drag the court into more controversy . Right from the start of its new session , it will be deeply mired in politics . High on the docket is a plea from George Wallace , who is asking his favorite scapegoat to put his name on the ballot in Ohio-the only state where he has not made it .
