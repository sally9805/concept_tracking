txt President Kennedy called tonight for a broad program of Federal tax reduction and reform to take effect in 1963 and " cut the fetters which hold hack private spending . " In a speech to the Economic Club of New York at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel , Mr. Kennedy pledged his Administration again to such a program . Ile said its main impact should be to stimulate consumer spending and thus the profits of business and industry . The President strongly implied that he would send to Congress a one-package bill of both reduction and reform , but left himself free to maneuver on this point . Be retreated somewhat from a statement he made last year in a national television address that his tax program would be made effective as of Jan. 1 , 1963 , and said only that it should take effect in 1963 , Nowhere in his speech , long awaited as the first outline of his tax policy , did he estimate by how much taxes should be reduced and private spending increased . Tests Are Set Forth But . the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enacted in the coming session of Congress . Among them was the criterion that taxes should be reduced " by a sufficiently early date and a sufficiently large amount to do the job required . " The other tests Mr. Kennedy set were as follows : q The new tax bill " 11111S1 increase private consumption as well as investment . " For this reason , he called for top-to-bottom cuts in both personal and corporate tax rates . The new tax bill " should improve both the equity and simplicity " of the tax structure , by " long-needed tax reforms , a broadening of the tax base and the elimination or modification of many special tax privileges . " In his speech , the President worked hard to allay fears that his tax program would cause a spiralling Federal budget deficit . He conceded the possibility of a temporary budget deficit but asserted that " the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut rates now . " Only full employment can balance the budget ? and tax reduction can pave the way to full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in his next budget , nonspace and non-defense spending will be held to present levels , thus reducing the possibility of too large a budget deficit . Mr. Kennedy took note of increasing signs that such a tax program as he outlined would encounter difficulties in the Congress . This week , Representative Wilbur D. Mills , Democrat of Arkansas , the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , indicated he did not favor tax reduction effective Jan. 1 and had other reservations about both reduction and reform . " A higher order of statesmanship and determination will be required if the possible is not to wait on the perfect , " Mr. Kennedy said . Differs with Rockefeller By placing his emphasis on tax cuts to increase consumer buying , Mr. Kennedy differed sharply with Goveror Rockefeller , the early favorite for the Republican nomination for president in 1964 . In a recent , speech to the National Association of Manufacturers , Governor Rockefeller accepted Mr. Kennedy 's invitation -- proffered in a speech at Yale Unniversity last summer ? to engage in a " dialogue " on economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage business investment in p 1 a ii and equipment , since there were no signs that consumer buying was lagging and since , the present object was not to end a short-term recession . Taking up the " dialogue " himself , Mr. Kennedy pointed out tonight that his Administration also had taken " major steps " in Governor Rockefeller 's recommended direction ? a tax credit for business investment and a new schedule of plant and equipment depreciation . These steps , he said , already had mounted to a 10 per cent reduction in corporate income taxes worth about $2,500,000 , . 000 . " Now , " Mr. Kennedy said , " we need to increase consumer demand to make these measures fully effective  --  demand which will make more use of existing capacity and thus increase both profits and the incentive to invest . In fact , profits after taxes would be at least 15 per cent higher today if we were operating at full employment . " Mr. Kennedy also criticized criticism of Governor Rockefeller by citing New York State as an example of economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment has been persistently higher than t h e national average , " Mr. Kennedy said . " The increases in personal income and employment have both been slower here than in the nation as a whole . " You have seen the tragedy of chronically depressed areas upstate , of unemployed young people roaming the streets of New York , of thousands forced to go on re/lief . " Republican spokesmen , as well as Mr. Mills , have been insisting that tax reduction must be accompanied by reductions in Federal spending . Mr. Kennedy outlined several steps he said were being taken by his Administration to meet this demand . Defense and space expenditures would necessarily rise in the next budget , he said , as would fixed interest charges on the national debt . But I can tell you now , " Mr. Kennedy said , " that the Vital of all other expenditures combined will be held at approximately its current level . " This , he said , in the context of the times , would be a " noteworthy effort in expenditure control . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include a $750,000,000 reduction in the postal deficit , a savings of $300,000,000 in the storage costs of surplus feed grains , and a saviings of at least $600 , - 000,000 from the cancellation of unworkable or obsolete weapons systems .
