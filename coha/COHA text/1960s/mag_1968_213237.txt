While the prelims are on , the champ goes through his warm-up routine . He flexes hands that have been strengthened by years of squeezing a hard rubber ball . He slips on the gloves for a fast workout on a punching bag . Using an old fighter 's trick , he smears Vaseline around his eyebrows to keep perspiration out of his eyes . Then Roger Williams , amateur boxer and former welterweight champion of Idaho 's Farragut Naval Training Station , steps onstage for his nightly bout with the piano . <P> In his most recent engagement at Colorado Springs ' Broadmoor Hotel , he came out of his corner fast with the arpeggios of The Sound of Music . Then , with a flurry of rights , he smashed into the weaving octaves of Liszt 's Second Hungarian Rhapsody . He coasted into the sweeping glissandi of Impossible Dream , and soon the affair turned into a waltz-Fascination , in fact . <P> Milking the Melody . As the mood became sentimental , the audience breathed " aaahs " of recognition for their favorites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The biggest thing I have to offer , " says Williams , " is emotion .

When he gives tunes the full treatment on his recordings , the beat bounces , choirs carol , strings sigh-and listeners buy . In 14 years his 52 albums have sold close to 15 million copies , making Williams , at 43 , not only the largest-selling pianist in modern recording history but also the largest-selling instrumentalist of any sort . <P> What kind of man could play such overblown , frankly corny music with such conviction ? The kind who could bemuse the slick show-biz world by acting like the earnest former Sunday-school teacher that he is , addressing his musicians as " gang " or " troops " ( except in moments of strain , when he calls them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his wife after their first date , then play the organ for the processional at their wedding-he darted from organ to altar just in time . The kind whose favorite song is To Each His Own and who tacks maxims on the wall of his ten-room hilltop home in Encino , Calif. , such as : " In every work that you begin , do it with all your heart and you will prosper .
