Like a swarm of angry locusts , the helicopters descended on the soccer field at Dongxoai . Out of them poured Vietnamese rangers , who were greeted by a hail of Viet Cong fire . Three fell within a minute ; the rest bolted for a ditch by a road . But one hulking figure , a Leica camera bobbing about his neck , threw himself against a hut and started snapping pictures . In the bloody melee , he took some memorable ones : a ranger as he was hit , his hand clutched to his stomach ; a Viet Cong , his head popped up over a bunker to stare with surprise at the camera lens ; a fallen ranger and the Viet Cong who shot him , barely 30 feet apart . <P> Safely back in Saigon , Associated Press Photographer Horst Faas put his pictures on the Wirephoto transmitter , rubbed a shrapnel nick on the back of his pudgy hand , and mused : " If they had used more mortars , they would have killed us all . " His venture into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Faas 's daring and reourcefulness in getting the most poignant war photos that have come out of Viet Nam . He likes to show his latest pictures to anyone who will look . " That , " he says with fierce pride , " is a Horst Faas picture . " <P> Coldly Clinical . Faas has seen more combat than any other foreigner in Viet Nam . He has an uncanny instinct for finding out where the action is and getting there fast . His intelligence network , say admirers , can be second only to that of the Viet Cong . He works so hard that he is miles ahead of the competition . He is coldly clinical about his grisly work , but then he has to be . " Otherwise , " says a reporter , " with what he sees every day , he 'd go right out of his mind . " <P> Faas was born in Berlin in 1933 , worked in a darkroom for a photo agency , joined the A.P . in 1955 . He shot much of the fighting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polaroid snapshots-a practice that enabled him to be in the right place to take the last picture of Patrice Lumumba as he was bundled from a plane to the truck that would carry him to his execution . From the Congo , Faas went to Algeria , where he snapped a number of O.A.S . murders daily and risked inviting his own . When a picture he took of one O.A.S . murder made the papers , a man stopped him in the street , invited him into a cafe for an absinthe , then pulled a pistol on him . " I was not going to plead with him , " Faas recalls . " I heard him cocking the pistol . I thought , ' Now I get it . ' He fired twice , and zip , zip , a round went by each ear . Then he bought me another absinthe . ' Next time we kill you . ' " <P> Checking the Troops . Faas was spared a next time because he was transferred to Viet Nam in 1962 . His life is in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of himself . " Before I go out with a unit , I check the troops , " he explains . " Troops are good or troops are sloppy . If they are more interested in the chickens and ducks than in their packs , I do n't go out with them . " As the war escalates , Faas knows that his own chances of escaping unscathed are worsening . " Maybe after another battle , " he said last week , " I 'll just quit . That 's the great advantage of being a civilian . "
