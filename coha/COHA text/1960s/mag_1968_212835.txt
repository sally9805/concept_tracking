One character gets his kicks pretending to shoot pretty women with a .22 rifle from his bedroom window . Another suffers from such an advanced case of post-coitum triste that he urinates on a woman . Then there is the fellow whose sleep is troubled by a nocturnal emission , and next morning he frantically hides his shorts from the prying eyes of an older woman . Not to mention the daredevil who copulates with a nimble Philippine girl on a wooden bench while she chats nonchalantly with a waitress passing by . <P> These are only a sampling of the variety of sexual practices and preferences presented in the pages of Evergreen magazine ; for range and ingenuity they are unmatched in any other publication this side of the Story of O. In the past two to three years , freedom of sexual expression has increased at a galloping rate , and Evergreen has led the field . This is no surprise since its editor and publisher is Barney Rosset , 45 , president of Grove Press , a house that specializes in erotica and avant-garde authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Zebra paperbacks embrace everything from outright pornography ( The Pearl ) to mystical flights of sexual fantasy ( Jean Genet 's Miracle of the Rose ) to revolutionary calls to action ( Frantz Fanon 's The Wretched of the Earth ) . It also has a generous supply of European anti-novelists and provocative psychologists . <P> Last Frontier . Cheap girlie magazines have always catered to prurient interests , but Evergreen is not of that ilk . It was started in 1957 as a paperbound book , publishing such unknown authors as Edward Albee , James Purdy , Samuel Beckett , Allen Ginsberg . In 1964 , it was turned into a slick-paper magazine with striking art work and lots of color ; its scatology is elegantly framed . With a circulation of some 160,000 , the magazine recently changed from a bimonthly to a monthly . <P> Evergreen 's editors claim that they are not on the lookout for adventurous sex ; that just happens to be what people are writing about . " It is the last frontier , " says Managing Editor Fred Jordan . " Sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . It can be a political statement . " If sex , in fact , turns sour in so many Evergreen stories , the editors believe that is a reflection of the times , specifically the anguish over the Viet Nam war . <P> And sex , truth to tell , is cheerless in Evergreen . Women are not so much to be loved as abused , and the varieties are impressive . One writer , E. F. Cherrytree , candidly reveals his special hangup : a passion to see women fighting each other , the bloodier the better . " It 's my biggest sex pleasure and has been since I was four . I 'm 35 now . " Evergreen illustrated this treatise with a few pages of sketches of two shapely girls , one blonde , one mauve , going at it tooth and claw . The piece evoked considerable response , says Rosset , all of it favorable . " We really stumbled on something , " he says , adding that he could have devoted an entire issue to that idiosyncrasy.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
