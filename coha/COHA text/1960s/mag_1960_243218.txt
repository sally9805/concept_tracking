Kudriavtsev was , in the findings of a Canadian royal commission , the real head of the Canadian spy ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1945 . The Russians then brazenly assigned him to the U.N . as adviser to the Soviet delegation in 1947 , but the appointment stirred such bad publicity that he was recalled inside four months .
