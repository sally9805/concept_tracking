As the torchbearers of institutionalized liberalism , Americans for Democratic Action could hardly have relished in advance a scheduled address by Daniel Patrick Moynihan at a policy meeting of their national board in Washington last week . Yet Urbanologist Moynihan ( TIME cover , July 28 ) is a member of the board and had a proper voice at the meeting . In keeping with his maverick style , he managed to plant some well-honed darts in sundry sensitive zones of the liberal conscience . Items : <P> &gt;Viet Nam and urban riots together represent " an especial problem of American liberals because more than anyone else it is they who have been in office , in power at the time of , and in large measure presided over the onset of both . " The war " was thought up and is being managed by the men John F. Kennedy brought to Washington . " The cities erupted " in the aftermath of one of the most extraordinary periods of liberal electoral victories that we have ever experienced . Who are we , then , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more clearly that their interest is in the stability of the social order , and that given the threats to that stability , it is necessary to make much more effective alliances with political conservatives who share that concern , and who recognize that unyielding rigidity is just as much a threat to the continuity of things as is an anarchic desire for change . " <P> &gt; " Liberals must somehow overcome the curious condescension which takes the form of sticking up for and explaining away anything , howsoever outrageous , which Negroes , individually or collectively , might do . " Distinction must be made between " the vast Negro underclass , a disorganized , angry , hurt group easily given to self-destructive violence , and the radical , nihilist youth that seeks to use the underclass for apocalyptic confrontation with white society . " The differentiation " means facing up to some of the realities of life in that class that liberals have been notoriously unwilling to acknowledge . " <P> &gt; Liberals " must divest themselves of the notion that the nation , especially the cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Government is " good at collecting revenues and rather bad at disbursing services , " federal money should be shared generously with state and local authorities on a " permanent , ongoing basis . " Initiative in using the money should be left to the locality . " Let us be frank . The original , determining opposition to this proposition has come from liberals , not conservatives , in Washington , and we should be ashamed of ourselves . "
