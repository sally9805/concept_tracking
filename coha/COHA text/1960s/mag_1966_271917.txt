The disease is striking in beachside beatnik pads and in the dormitories of expensive prep schools ; it has grown into an alarming problem at U.C.L.A. and on the U.C. campus at Berkeley . And everywhere the diagnosis is the same : psychotic illness resulting from unauthorized , nonmedical use of the drug LSD-25 . <P> Patients with post-LSD symptoms are providing the U.C.L.A. Neuropsychiatric Institute with 10% to 15% of its cases ; more are flocking to the university 's general medical center and the County General Hospital . By best estimates , 10,000 students in the University of California system have tried LSD ( though not all have suffered detectable ill effects ) . No one can even guess how many more self-styled " acid heads " * there are among oddball cult groups . <P> " Florid &; Terrifying . " Southern California devotees proclaim the alleged benefits of LSD with evangelistic fervor . They say it brings supernatural powers . It does not , say U.C.L.A. psychiatrists . Some say it is an aphrodisiac . It is not . They say it helps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the solution is already in the mind , hidden behind an emotional block . <P> What LSD actually has done for far too many users , says U.C.L.A. 's Psychiatric Resident Duke D. Fisher , is to produce " florid psychoses with terrifying visual and auditory hallucinations , marked depression , often with serious suicide attempts , and anxiety bordering on panic . One patient tried to kill himself when he thought his body was melting , and he remained suicidal for more than two weeks , after only one dose of LSD . Other patients have required more than two months of psychiatric hospitalization . Still others have been sent to state hospitals for long-term treatment . " Adds U.C.L.A. Psychiatrist J. Thomas Ungerleider : " The symptoms may recur in their original intensity long after the last dose of the drug . Many users have had this experience . " <P> The varied types of LSD users include vast numbers of thrill seekers . Most have tried marijuana , then the amphetamines , before " graduating " themselves to what they regard as the ultimate in kicks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see EDUCATION ) many are trying LSD because they feel lost on an impersonal , bustling campus ; others have been squeezed by the need to make better grades to avoid the draft . <P> One of the most disturbing aspects of the LSD binge is that it has hit high schools and prep schools . A 17-year-old user reports that there is a sales ring in his Sherman Oaks school pushing LSD at a penny a microgram . The usual dose of the pure chemical , used by psychiatric investigators , is 100 mcg. ( 1/300,000th of an ounce ) , but even junior acid heads boast of taking walloping overdoses . " I 've taken as much as 500 micrograms , " says one youthful user . " At least that 's what I paid for . "
