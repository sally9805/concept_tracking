Almost everyone agrees that the Selective Service System is inequitable , iniquitous-and indispensable . Almost everyone also agrees on most of the latest spate of proposals to reform the draft . <P> President Johnson , drawing heavily on the recommendations of his advisory commission ( TIME , March 10 ) , last week proposed to Congress some sweeping revisions of the system , notably : 1 ) inducting younger men first rather than the oldest eligible for service , 2 ) ending deferments for most graduate students and giving serious consideration to withdrawing undergraduate deferments , and 3 ) substituting a lottery scheme for the present selection by birth date . <P> South Carolina Democrat L. Mendel Rivers , whose House Armed Services Committee will write the legislation , at first seemed opposed to the President 's program , in particular to the lottery idea , which under present circumstances would become a form of Viet Nam roulette . Rivers had employed his own advisory panel , which flatly rejected any system of random selection , and the chairman apparently differed with the President on other points as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospects seem to be for more compromise than conflict between the White House and Capitol Hill . " I do n't shut my eyes to some form of chance , " Rivers allowed later . " We 're all trying to work things out . " Furthermore , Rivers ' own advisers came out in favor of taking 19-and 20-year-olds first . There was also agreement on reducing deferments for graduate students , although here the President was prepared to go beyond the prevailing sentiment in the Armed Services Committee . He would deny deferment to all graduate students except those studying to be physicians , dentists and ministers . Rivers is disposed to grant waivers to others in fields associated with defense needs , such as physics . <P> Johnson shrewdly defused disputation in advance by taking a flexible position on the touchy questions of undergraduate deferment and whether to replace or reorganize the system of local draft boards . Nor does he intend to rush out executive orders-as he has the power to do-to implement the lottery scheme and some other proposals . Congress has until June 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so doing it may apply legislative controls to some areas in which the President now has sole jurisdiction . But Johnson 's go-slow approach gives Congress time to make its views felt-and an opportunity to share any political consequences of major changes in the draft .
