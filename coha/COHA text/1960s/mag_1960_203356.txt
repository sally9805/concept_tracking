THE RELUCTANT SURGEON ( 359 pp. ) - John Kobler-Doubleday ( $4.95 ) . <P> The 18th century 's greatest physician looked and acted like some crazed quack in a horror movie . A squat , curmudgeonly eccentric , he jounced through London in a cart hauled by three Asiatic water buffaloes . A moatless drawbridge guarded his rambling home at 12 Leicester Square . In the fetid basement of his country villa , a vast copper cauldron was kept at the boil ; there he melted down human and animal corpses to get fresh skeletons for his grisly pathological museum of pickled fetuses , stuffed one-eyed pigs and cock-plumed hens . There may have been , as his contemporaries thought , more madness than method in his research , but dour John Hunter ( 1728-93 ) as much as any man helped turn surgery and pathology into sciences . <P> In this fluent , zestful biography , Author Kobler shows how , in the Age of Reason , John Hunter 's profession was largely a slit-or-miss affair . Anesthesia was virtually unknown ; patients scarcely drugged by doses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the knife . Untrained midwives often ripped babies ' heads from shoulders in the course of arduous labor . The cliquish Corporation of Surgeons had a near monopoly on cadavers for dissection ; private anatomy teachers were forced to traffic with the " sack-'em-up men " - the body snatchers . <P> Sharp &; Scholar . To the professional satisfaction of his older brother , William , a melancholy anatomist who became one of London 's more fashionable physicians , John Hunter could bargain for corpses with the finesse of a whist sharp ( which he was ) . But he had other talents too . A careless scholar , an indifferent cabinetmaker , John at 20 joined his brother 's London medical school . He learned fast : within a year he was teaching one of William 's dissecting classes ; later he helped on his brother 's major discovery-the first accurate descriptive anatomy of a pregnant uterus . <P> On his own , John gained a reputation , a growing surgical practice at St. George 's Hospital and a household . He had married the daughter of a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who bore him four children and wrote tidy verses to Franz Joseph Haydn 's music . While John padded about his museum , Anne kept a salon graced by Johnson and Boswell , Lord Chesterfield and Gibbon . Some of Hunter 's students came too : Edward Jenner , who administered the first successful vaccination ; Philip Syng Physick , the " Father of American Surgery . " <P> Pearls &; Bees . John- " that dear man " to Anne 's tea-sipping cronies-was all work , although his peers regarded it as play . He produced artificial pearls from mussels he kept in the bottom of his fish pond . While Anne plunked at her pianoforte , he listened until he fixed the exact note hummed by a swarm of bees ( treble A above middle C ) . Obliging friends and zookeepers plied him with odd creatures for dissection . Only with reluctance did he take time for his patients . " I must go and earn this damn 'd guinea , " he complained , " or I shall be sure to want it tomorrow . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1793 , heart-ailing and gouty , he was nearly bankrupt . Not even the sale of their country house kept Anne from the indignity of turning nanny .
