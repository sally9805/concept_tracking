" This is Radio Free Cuba , the anti-Communist voice of Cuba broadcasting on the 40-meter band . Worker , militiaman , rebel soldier , radio ham-help topple the despot ! Close ranks so that the fatherland , today bloodied by Russian imperialism , becomes the tomb of Communism in America . This is Radio Free Cuba transmitting from a point in Cuban territory . " <P> In Cuban exile communities from Miami to Caracas , the word was out : " Algo se mueve " - Something is moving . First came the faint , crackling anti-Castro broadcast last week from inside Cuba . Then 24 hours later came word of the biggest raid in months on Castro 's fortress . The raiders identified themselves as members of the Movement for Revolutionary Recuperation , led by Manuel Artime , who headed the abortive Bay of Pigs landing . <P> At 10:30 p.m. , said an M.R.R. spokesman in Miami , Artime and a " strong force of commandos " had gone ashore at Puerto Piln , 145 miles from Guantanamo on Cuba 's southern coast . <P> Linking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sierra Maestra mountains , the exiles had captured the town and held it for three hours against Castro 's militia , during that time declaring it a " free territory of Cuba . " They then blew up the Cabo Cruz sugar mill and disappeared . Puerto Piln , the exiles noted with satisfaction , was only a few miles from the spot where Castro himself originally landed in 1956 , and the Sierra Maestra was his sanctuary in the early stages of the revolution . <P> Within hours , Radio Havana was on the air railing about the attack . Castro denied that the exiles had sent in a landing party . The mill , he fumed , was bombarded from the sea " by a pirate vessel of the Rex type , which the CIA operates from bases located in Florida , Puerto Rico and Central America . " <P> Nevertheless , he admitted damage to shore installations and cried that " 70,000 sacks of sugar " had been destroyed . Naturally , he blamed " a new criminal , vandalistic act by the United States Government . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more landings-one by Artime on the southern coast , and the other by Underground Leader Manolo Ray somewhere in the north . But exile groups in Miami would neither confirm nor deny the new raids . <P> Recruits &; Munitions . In Washington , the State Department blandly denied all . " These attacks , " said a spokesman , " are neither supported nor condoned by the Government . " Perhaps not , but Miami was alive last week with exile activity . Once again , Cubans were turning up at the old clapboard house on 23rd Street that served as a recruiting center for the Bay of Pigs operation , getting physical exams , then mysteriously dropping out of sight . Small groups of Cubans were training at isolated farms outside Miami . At Key Largo , a 28-ft. launch loaded with exile munitions caught fire , was popping while firemen were trying to douse the blaze . <P> No one believes that a second frontal invasion is in the offing . The exiles agree that it would amount to suicide . What does seem to be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare . Right now , three main groups are operating :
