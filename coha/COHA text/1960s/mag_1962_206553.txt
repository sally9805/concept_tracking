They called him " the baby-faced assassin " at Harvard , where he was an All-America guard in 1941 . Old grads claim they can still hear echoes of the thunderous tackle he made on Navy 's William ( " Barnacle Bill " ) Busik . As a lieutenant on the submarine Tirante during World War II , he won the Silver Star for leading raiding parties aboard Japanese craft and engaging in hand-to-hand combat . Yet for all such exploits-and despite his heritage as a member of one of Massachusetts ' most celebrated Yankee families-Endicott ( " Chub " ) Peabody , 42 , until last week was a chronic political loser . <P> Chub 's family tree is full of prominent Democrats . The most famous of all was Chub 's grandfather , the Endicott Peabody who founded Groton and who was a lifelong advocate of Democratic public service . <P> Do-Good .

" <P> Tough Task . Teddy 's landslide victory apparently carried Peabody across by 3,868 votes-at least pending a possible recount of the cliffhanging contest . At one point he seemed about to fall backward-but the discovery of a " clerical error " in Democratic Holyoke gave him an additional 8,500 votes . It seemed likely , therefore , that Peabody would get a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play my part in shaping the world , and I do n't believe in hiring mercenaries to do it . " <P> But many in Massachusetts still felt that Chub Peabody would find the shaping of the world a painful task when he collides with the cynical Democratic professionals in the Massachusetts legislature . Says one legislative veteran : " You 're going to find him some cold night outside the Statler without his pants . The kindest thing you can do for him right now is give him a bathrobe.
