Brooks Atkinson covered Broadway for 35 years before the New York Times gave him the honorific title critic at large . But George Gelles , music critic of the Boston Herald Traveler for just two months , reached the same status last week . And he is only 27 . What accounts for the sudden rise ? <P> Years of music study , for one thing - at the Manhattan School of Music , Princeton , Brandeis and a year of graduate work at the Free University in Berlin . At Manhattan , Gelles studied under Michael Steinberg , a distinguished musicologist who now writes reviews for the Boston Globe . Like Steinberg , , guest conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra . If Danny Kaye or Victor Borge had conducted " with such crazed dislocation of tempo and with such prodigality in expression of tragic suffering and deep knee-bends , " wrote Steinberg , " the audience would have been in stitches . " Two weeks ago in the Herald Traveler , Gelles remarked that Guest Conductor Seiji Ozawa " has shrunk from a lightweight with charm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emotionally indifferent . " <P> Friends of the symphony bridled . Several orchestra members signed an anti-Steinberg telegram to the Globe . The protest went unheeded . Similarly , a Symphony Orchestra board of trustees member wrote to Herald Traveler Publisher Harold E. Clancy expressing dismay that the paper had hired " one of Steinberg 's young imitators . We think that perhaps the Herald might be in a position to alter its course . " <P> Clancy denies that he was reacting to any pressure , but Gelles was suddenly promoted to critic at large . So far , his duties are not exactly defined ; Gelles ' editors have not given him any assignments . One thing is perfectly clear , though : " at large " does not include the Boston Symphony Orchestra .
