For the first time in the history of TV 's Nielsen ratings , the three major networks last week ended up in as close a thing to a photofinish as statistics are likely to produce : a dead heat between CBS and NBC , each scoring an identical 19.4%* and , only a whisker behind long-lagging ABC with 19.3% . <P> Sitting there basking was ABC Network President Tom Moore , who says expansively : " None of it was really a surprise , only a confirmation . " ABC 's shows are apparently more dynamically mediocre than CBS 's , for it is obviously out of CBS that ABC has taken its great equalizing bite ( see chart ) . ABC , at any rate , has fresher and less mechanical situation comedies than CBS and with its two Peyton Place programs it has proved to all television that audiences at night like sex and soap as much as audiences do in the daytime . <P> Score or Drop Out . CBS still has six of the top ten shows , so its loss is not entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overall sampling of the total mass of people who watch a given network during a given minute , CBS has lost millions of fans . CBS-TV President James T. Aubrey Jr . has built his success on cold formula : quality be damned , programs either score high ratings or drop out . It would follow that the same criterion might apply to a TV president who lives by such a formula , and rumors are all over the industry that Aubrey 's own rating is down-but not enough to be out . <P> There are 91 regularly scheduled shows in prime time . The top program this season is NBC 's Bonanza , which has long since outshot all competition to become TV 's preeminent Western . <P> On the air five years , Bonanza stars Lome Greene as a late 19th century Nevada rancher who talks softly and with psychiatric insight while combating , say , a half-breed horse thief , who was the heavy in this week 's show . The dialogue uses pithy aphorisms ( " When you are only half of something , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way toward a modern message : " Never feel guilty about having warm human feelings toward anyone . " The episodes are surprisefully plotted and seek variety in the bizarre : next week a knight in armor rides out the purple sage and rams his lance through a stagecoach door . <P> Over and Over . The second-highest-rated show is ABC 's Bewitched , in which Elizabeth Montgomery ( TIME , Oct. 30 ) goes on " twitching her nose into other people 's business , " as the dialogue put it last week , reassembling broken vases , halting rainstorms , and engineering marriages through her special talents as an authentic but broom-less witch . If the ratings are correct some 32 million people watch this show each week , in which the same sort of thing happens over and over again- something breaks , the girl 's nose twitches , the film is run backwards , the broken object is whole again , tune in again next week , same time , same staple.               @ @ @ @ @ @
