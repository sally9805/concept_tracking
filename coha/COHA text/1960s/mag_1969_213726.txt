WHAT will it be like , at the finish ? <P> In Weekend , French Film Maker Jean-Luc Godard foresees the end of the world as an immense traffic jam . Stanley Kubrick sees the men of 2001 as murder victims of a machine they have made more clever than themselves . <P> Or consider this scenario : The people are thrown together against their wills , trapped in colossal , modernistic buildings on a landscape devoid of trees . The lights are always lit . Pavement stretches everywhere . Cars and buses and trains and aircraft are useless ; there is no way out . No darkness . No silence . No beds . No escape from an endless series of broadcast announcements , no avoiding the silly , circular games of other people 's children . There are queues for food , queues for asking questions , queues for liquor-and finally queues for nothing , because there is nothing left . Then there is only boredom , and the debris of boredom . Dirty glasses , old newspapers , crumpled cigarette packs . Even the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their makeup so streaked that their faces look as if they are melting . Men in rumpled suits , with three days ' growth of beard , slump in chairs staring at the message boards that bear no messages . <P> Packaged and Shipped . Perhaps it will all begin with a simple and foreseeable act of God-say a heavy snowstorm in New York City . There , last week , at the world 's largest international airport , the scenario came true . Even at its best , an airport terminal seems inhuman-a monstrous machine disguised as a building and designed to process people and baggage . To the machine , there is no difference between men , women , children , suitcases , pets . All are collected , screened according to route , classified by status , divided into units of the right size , packaged in aircraft-and shipped . When 17 inches of drifting snow clogged the runways and access roads of John F. Kennedy airport , 6,000 people were forced to exist inside nine broken machines . And , because of the incredible slowness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for three days . <P> For Michael Rogers , a student headed back to Georgia 's Oglethorpe College , the ordeal began shortly after 10 a.m . Sunday , when he telephoned Eastern Airlines to check on its 11:25 a.m. flight to Atlanta . Assured that the flight would depart with " a slight delay despite the snow , " Michael drove to the airport and checked into the Eastern terminal at 11 a.m. - only to discover that the flight had been canceled . He was still there 56 hours later . Thousands of other travelers were similarly misled by the airlines , which , out of either optimism or greed , led them to believe that planes were still taking off . American Airlines waited until 2 p.m. on Sunday to announce the indefinite cancellation of all future flights , although all outgoing planes had officially been grounded since 10 a.m . Eastern waited until 9:30 p.m . Sunday to announce that no flight would leave until at least noon of the next day .               @ @ @ @ @ @
