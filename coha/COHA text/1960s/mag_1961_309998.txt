Art may be a universal language , but moviegoers who hope to cope with movies on the current U.S. market will also do well to study subtitlese . Foreign films are flooding in , and not everyone understands British , let alone German , French , Italian , Russian-and Art . <P> The Gordeyev Family ( Artkino ) , a Russian export amplified from a novel ( Foma Gordeyev ) by Maxim Gorky , is a visual experience that roars across the screen with the rage and razmakh of a flash fire on the steppes . Unfortunately it is also a piece of Marxist propaganda that suggests Premier Khrushchev might profitably send some of his moviemakers to Siberia-to stimulate corn production . <P> Gordeyev tells the tragic story of a morally sensitive , socially conscious young Russian merchant ( Georgy Yepifanstev ) of the last century who asks himself : " Is a man born only to make money ? " In an episode of shuddery weirdness and God-haunted irony , the sanctimonious serpent ( Pavel Tarasov ) who serves as the hero 's guardian , glassily indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , replies : " Eat or be eaten . That is the law of life . " Unable to accept such a law , unable to find a better one , unable to love a good woman ( Alia Labetskaya ) , the hero plunges into dissipation . At the climax the wicked guardian orders the young man certified insane , and at the end the hero stands in the breadline of the poorhouse his own father founded . <P> Director Donskoi 's cartoon-capitalists are often fun to look at , if impossible to take seriously , and even moviegoers who can not believe in Marxist fairy tales will feel the chthonian power of Donskoi 's images . In one , a ballroom filled with swilling businessmen whirls like a carousel as the camera slowly descends to discover that this frivolous world of profit and pleasure is being turned by a great mill wheel , and the wheel itself by the sweat and strength of poor men chained like beasts to an eternal round of labor without value , suffering without sense . <P> The Green Mare ( Zenith-International ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like that famously funny film first made by Marcel Pagnol , The Green Mare is a comedy of barnyard humors adapted from a ribald but rus ironic novel by Marcel Aym . Regrettably , Director Claude Autant-Lara lacks both Pagnol 's touch and Aym 's intensity . The Green Mare ai n't what she used to be . Nevertheless she is , as the French say , green-which means , as the Americans say , blue . The plot , for example , involves a Rabelaisian family feud in which the antagonists fight to a finesse and take each other 's wives . Best plonk : when a farmer finds a stranger dossing down with his dairymaid , he bawls indignantly , " Be off with you ! I can handle the servants without outside help ! "
