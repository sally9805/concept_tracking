txt What 's ahead ... The auto industry is expected to brave a hostile congressional powwow next week on the subject of auto safety . ? Chief of the meeting will be Sen. Abraham A. Ribicoff ( D ) , of Connecticut . And he 's already got Detroit scared . General Motors has just proffered a peace bid by announcing their fall models will have six safety features as standard equipment . That means , for instance , a safer new Pontiac ? about $200 safer . And right now GM is n't saying whether it or the buyer will provide the wampum . If the cost is passed to the buyer the new features will in effect cancel the excise tax cut . It was the fight for the cut that made the automen Ribicoff-shy . The Senator almost tied a tax cut for new cars to a law seeking 17 safety devices on new cars . But the Detroiters have read the smoke signals . Those 17 features are to be mandatory on all new government-purchased cars . Trends ... The big splurge in man-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World consumption of wool , for instance , has slipped to 9 percent of the fiber market . Part of the reason is that the increase in wool production has not kept pace with the increase in population . Now wool marketing men are trying to up production by improved animal husbandry and exchanging information among wool producing countries . The Western-oriented International Wool Secretariat is even giving aid to the wool textile industry behind the Iron Curtain . Poland now gets wool technical aid and the Soviet Union will soon . Wool boards are being set up in Chile and Peru . Uruguay and Brazil expect to follow .  - -  -  The secretariat director , Australian William Vines , says , " We must put wool in a class of its own . We want to shoW people that wool is far superior in quality to manmade fibers . " And it is worth a moderate premium . " For the first time in more than six years the nation is experiencing an extended rise in the industrial price level . - Industrial raw materials , machine tools , electrical equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basic metal prices have moved up 8 percent this year alone . New York 's Bankers Trust Company economists warn : " With the labor market as tight as it is and many companies and industries operating at capacity , the danger of a renewal of the wage-cost-price spiral seems greater today than at any time since the mid-1950's. " 0 Not all of America 's market is made up of those who think young . In fact the National Retail Merchants Association advises its members not to forget the older generation . By 1970 there will be about 3 million more people in the 50.64 age bracket than in 1963 . And 2 million more in the 65 and over group . These " oldsters " are more active , have wider interests , and possess more money than ever before , the association says . How and why . . . That product of the affluent society , the " PR " man , is out to attract to his profession the respect now shown lawyers , architects , or certified public accountants . This summer the Public Relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tests will be given in New York , Chicago , and Los Angeles . The two-day examination will test general theories and techniques of public relations , the ethics of public relations counseling , and the economics of running a " PR " agency . Only college men  --  with eight years of " PR " work behind them  --  need apply . It is all in line with the attempt of " PR " men to toss off the image that they are merely high pressure press agents . Most of the successful ones now are well educated and experienced in business and finance . Many find themselves advising executives on personnel changes or the worth of a new product . The PRSA tests are voluntary . But the society hopes they will eventually carry the aura of a bar exam . Artisans  --  and the private workshop  --  are coming into their own in the Soviet bloc . Even in Poland , which usually lags behind other bloc countries , there has been a sharp increase in the number employed in crafts . There are two reasons for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slack . And the public has come to demand the service that only the craftsman , can offer .
