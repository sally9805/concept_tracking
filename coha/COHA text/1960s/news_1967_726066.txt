txt Albert Henry DeSalvo , the 35-year-old mental patient who says he murdered 13 women as the Boston strangler , was found guilty tonight of armed robbery , assault and sex offenses involving four women . He was sentenced to life imprisonment . DeSalvo 's lawyer , F. Lee Bailey , who had asked the jury of 12 men to find the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity , told newsmen bitterly : " Massachusetts has burned another witch . No fault of the jury 's , of course . It 's the fault of the law . " ? The verdict was a rare defeat for Mr. Bailey , who successfully defended Samuel H. Sheppard and Dr. Carl Coppolino in recent murder cases . Mr. Bailey said he would ap- peal . He said the appeal would challenge the Massachusetts law on criminal insanity , which he termed archaic . His case was built on the argument that DeSalvo was a schizophrenic personality . Al ; though the 13 murders committed in the Boston area from mid-1962 to early 1964 were not a part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . He said lie lilt these crimes were so nionstrous that the jury must agree thatl his client was insane . But the court refused to per- mit testimony relating to the stranglings . DeSalvo , a former military policeman and former middleweight boxing champion of the armed forces in Germany , stood erect and wan as the jury foreman , F. Hunter Rowley of Chicord , a brokerage firm ana:yst , reported him " guilty " oil each count of a 10-count indictment . The jury deliberated 3 hours 4:5 minutes and reported at 6 P.M. DeSalvo had expected the verdict , Mr. Bailey said . The charges concerned activities of DeSalvo in 1964 , when , according to the indictments , he invaded the apartments of four women in the Boston area . Mr. Bailey , in his closing remarks this morning . had implored the jury to find his client insane so he could be put away in a mental hospital and studied try psychiatrists . To send him back to jail , he suggested , would be as cruel and stupid a punishment as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanted Incarceration When the verdict was read in Middlesex County Superior Court , Judge Cornelius J. Moynihan took up the matter of sentencing . Mr. Bailey said it was DeSalvo 's own wish to be incarcerated for the rest of his life . " He wants society to be prote.cted from . him , " Mr. Bailey said . The sentence of life imprisonment was imposed on one count of armed robbery . The other counts drew terms of from three to 10 years and are to run concurrently . In Massachusetts , life imprisonment can be commuted after 20 years . Judge Moynihan stipulated that the life sentence begin after DeSalvo completed a sentence of nine to 10 years for assault and robbery . Assuming that the lesser sentence might be reduced to six years for good behavior , DeSalvo would still have to spend at least 26 years in jail . To Stay in Mental Hospital Pending the appeal , DeSalvo is to be kept at Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminal Insane . He has been there since his arrest in late 1964 . He was declared capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridgewater , DeSalvo began bragging to other inmates about the Boston stranglings . However , the Commonwealth lacks witnesses and physical evidence to link him with the murders . During the trial , all four women whose homes he was accused of havinc , invaded testified . At the start of the trial the judge asked news media not to identify the women , to save them from embrassassment . This morning , In his charge to the jury , Judge Moynihan told the jurors to purge from their minds DeSalvo 's story of having strangled 13 women . " He is not on trial for homicide , " he said . The judge said the jury could find him guilty , not guilty or not guilty by reason of insanity . The jury had listened to clashing opinions by psychiatrists on the question of DeSalvo 's sanity . Judge Moynihan did not comment on this testimony . Mr. Bailey noted that prosecution psychiatrists had cited DeSalvo 's quiet conduct in court as evidence that he was not a schizophrenic but a shrewd and cunning sociopathic criminal . But not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for often the symptoms of schizophrenia are hidden . 11 Months in Jail That was probably why DeSalvo was released after only 11 months in Middlesex County House of Correction in April . 1962 , Mr. Bailey said . It was not foreseen , he said , that De- . Salvo would shortly become a ' " dangerous and uncontrollable beast . " DeSalvo had been sentenced to a two-year term ( later reduced to 11 months ) for assault and battery and breaking and entering . Assistant District Attorney Donald L. Conn , closing the case for the prosecution , said De Salvo was nothing more than a cunning criminal who had cleverly feigned symptoms of mental illness . Winding up an emotioncharged summation , Mr. Conn pointed a finger at DeSalvo and told the jury : " It 's my duty to my wife , to your wife , to every woman who might conceivably be a victim of this man , to stamp his conduct for what it is ? vicious criminal conduct . " Do n't let this man con you right out of your shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conned " because he expected to get a lot of money from the sale to magazines of his autobiography as the Boston strangler . DeSalvo wanted to be committed to a hospital in the expectation that he would " get out in 3. couple of years , " the prosecutor added .
