The entry of astronaut John Glenn into the political arena as a candidate for the Senate from Ohio illustrates a peculiar facet of the American character . This is the blind confidence people have that a man who has greatly distinguished himself in a field remote from politics is thereby uniquely qualified to help make the country 's laws . Glenn himself discovered this characteristic of his fellow Americans as he traveled the country on a speaking tour following his famous pioneering journey into space  --  and he found it vaguely disquieting that many among the millions of Americans who would stand for hours in the rain and cold to cheer him as the first American to orbit the earth in space would not spend half an hour at the polls to vote for a mayor , a governor or a congressman . It also concerned him that millions of these same Americans who would lavish adulation upon him as an astronaut , or upon a victorious general or a winning football coach , would instinctively vilify an elected official because he sought or held a public office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the American form of government , this apathy on the one hand , this unreasoning hatred on the other , were flaws in the American character which weakened and divided the country . This brought up an obvious question : Flow could this American penchant for bestowing superhuman qualities upon its heroes be turned into a national asset ? Could he , for example , transmute hero worship into political support as General Eisenhower so successfully had done ? And if this were possible , could he then , with nothing to guide him through the traps and pitfalls of public office save his own innate sense of right and wrong , effectively create in the public mind a new image of the politician ' ? And finally , if he should decide to try to make this great leap into the unknown , under what banner should he run ? Glenn , as he began brooding over these things in the first months after his flight , would found It to define his 01% El political philosoph ? . He had studied carefully the platforms of both parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agree or disagree . His basic instincts were nonpartisan  --  he once had described himself as " either a liberal Republican or a conservative Democrat . " In 1960 , in conserxative mood . he had voted for Richard Nixon . By 1962 he had become the close friend of John F. Kennedy and his Vice President , Lyndon Johnson . With their views on the need to make America predominant in space , he completely agreed . On other issues he was not persuaded . It was in this troubled mood of indecision  --  of " Go or No Go " on a political career  --  that he passed the summer months of 1963 , working competently but without zest at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston , Tex . Then came November 22 . Future historians probabl ? will record that the bullet which killed John F. Kennedy in Dallas in November launched Lt. Col. John H. Glenn Jr . into political orbit two months later . " Up until the time of the President 's death he had been drifting , weightless , in a sea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the astronauts and Glenn 's closest civilian friend and confidant . The death of the President was the catalyst , the precipitating agent NA hich crystallized his thinking . In the weeks following the President 's funeral all his thoughts about his own future and the best way he could LISC his talents finally came into focus . " Glenn 's indecision about his future goals was completely understandable in the light of the pressures which had been brought to bear on him since his great ad% enture in space . On February 20,1962 , he had ridden down from the skies in the white-hot fireball of the Mercury capsule to find . himself enshrined in the pantheon of American folk heroes . The President had received him at the White House . The Vice President had escorted him to the Capitol to address both houses of a cheering Congress . Roads , bridges , streets , schools and hundreds of babies had been named for him , and wherever he went , thousands thronged to see him and hear him speak , heaping upon him an adulation few men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs after his epic flight , politicians of both parties began to woo him , noting with awe and wonder the magnetic spell the square-jawed , balding , warmly smiling man cast over all who met him . Here , they realized , was a public figure in a new dimension , the all-American boy grown up into the hero-astronaut of the space age . Neither party had any clear idea of Glenn 's political views , but each , afraid that the other would get him . quickened its campaign of persuasion . But Glenn , a calm man under heat and pressure on the ground as in space , was not to be stampeded . To the urging of Bobby Kennedy , as to the cannonade of arguments from the big guns of the Republican Party , he listened politely and gave the same noncommittal answer . Maybe someday , thanks . But not yet . The great challenge of the space age , he pointed out , still lay ahead . The bold adventures into the unknown that would test all the nation 's technical skill and courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that program . More and more , however , as the months went by , Glenn began to realize that in the great adventures to come he would be permitted to play only a groundling 's role . When the Apollo capsule streaks off on its journey to the moon late in this decade , he will he nearly 50 years old , and its crew of three will be made up of younger men . He will be relegated to the status of elder statesman . a technical consultant helping to design the birds that other men will fly . Furthermore , he learned , there was no challenging place for him in the management of the space agency , for the high posts were already filled by competent men . The more he thought about it , the more his status became clear to him . He was like an aging athlete who had come to the end of his career and found that there was no place for him as either player , coach or manager in the sport he loved . If this were true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner drives were never still , who must be forever competing , forever testing himself against his own past achievements ? At this point in his career there still were many roads open to him . The Marine Corps , in which he served with valor and distinction for two decades , still commanded his deepest loyalties . If he should return to active duty with the Corps , there would he fast planes to fly and the fascinating daily challenge of working with an advancing aviation technology . But in the Marine Corps , too , time would eventually catch up with him , and while in his 50 's , still full of drive and vigor , he would be forced into retirement . There were other prospects that appealed to him . As an astronaut he had lectured to his fellows , sometimes to their annoyance , that they were a new and special breed of dedicated men , obligated by the nature of their jobs to set an example to all American youth . Traveling the country on speaking tours , he himself had tried to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be . At schools and colleges all over the country he had talked of his vision of America as a land of daring , wisdom , strength and freedom . He could continue these speaking tours in the employ of one of the great foundations  --  serving as a sort of senior camp counselor to all America . To a man of Glenn 's dedicated patriotism , this idea had strong appeal . But there was one thing lacking  --  the element of venturing into the unknown . Some prospects he quickly rejected . In the months since his pioneer flight , industrialists had wooed him as earnestly as had the politicians . Huge firms had sought to hire him , and one of them had offered him a million dollars in salary over a period of 10 years . Thinking less of himself than of his wife and children , he had pondered this proposal briefly . Then he had turned it down . This left one major field still unexplored  --  politics , an area as unknown to him and , he suspected , as potentially hazardous as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a citizen 's interest in his government . While on duty as a Marine he had voted , by absentee ballot or in person , in every general election since 1950 ? an unusual record for a military man . As a youngster , when other kids were writing English themes on their favorite sports hero , he had chosen as his subject the United States Senate . As a teen-ager he had driven from his white clapboard home in New Concord , Ohio , to sit in the visitors ' galleries while the Congress debated the Selective Service Act . As a resident of Washington , he frequently would take his wife Annie and their children , David and Lyn , to the Capitol to watch the lawmakers at work . Now , every time he went to Capitol Hill to testify on the space program , congressmen from both parties took him aside to urge him , earnestly , to join them in the political arena . It was an idea that charmed and , at the same time , curiously repelled him . Strapped in Friendship 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the dials and gauges , he felt calm , confident and sure of himself . The laws of physics that would lift him into space were unforgiving of mistakes . But they were unchanging laws that intelligent men could master . There was no element of personal morality involved in the choice of which button to push , and when , or which valve to open or close . You did the right thing at the right time , or you were dead . To Glenn , with his trained scientific mind , it seemed that as a politician he would be flying blind . The political people , in effect , were asking him to launch himself into an undetermined orbit , strapped into a capsule bearing a party label , with no knowledge of how the controls would %vork , or of what heats and pressures he would be called on to endure . Tentatively he reaffirmed his early judgment . Politics was not the answer . He would stay in the space agency . On the afternoon of November 22 , as he worked in his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Glenn got the news that the President was dead . Two nights later he sat in a Washington motel room with Annie , Ford Eastman of NASA , and his friend and confidant , Bob Voas . He had come , as the representative of all the astronauts , to pay the spacemen 's last tribute to the man who had been their friend . We were sitting there watching the television , " Eastman recalls . " The came ras showed the crowds filing slowly past the President 's casket in the rotunda of the Capitol . Everybody was very quiet . Finally John got up . ' Let 's go over there , ' he said . We left in a car he had rented and drove first to the Lincoln Memorial . It was a cold night , and there were not many people there , but they recognized John and spoke to him . We stayed half an hour , I guess , while John read the words he had read there many times before  --  Lincoln 's second inaugural speech , and the Gettysburg address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there a long time , watching the slow-moving , mourning crowd file past . We then went on past the casket  --  the guard broke the line for a moment  --  and there , too , as we were leaving , a lot of people recognized John and came up to shake his hand . " The emotional impact of this evening , and the events of the following day , when he rode in the President 's funeral procession , seemed finally to fix in John Glenn 's mind the course he wanted his own life to take . The words of one martyred President , the sight of the sorrowing crowds filing past the casket of another , pouring out their love for a man who had been so savagely vilified in life , had deeply stirred him . Anti-Kennedy letters He remembered that , alter being photographed water-skiing with Jacqueline Kennedy , he had received letters which reflected this same unreasoning hatred against the President . " Do n't get mixed up with those Kennedys , " one writer had snarled . " They 'll turn you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in public life . " Stay out of politics , " one man had written . " It 's a dirty business . It always has been and always will he . " Back at his desk at Houston , though Glenn made no public announcement , those close to him knew well that his attitude toward a political career had changed . A friend calling on him in December noted on his bookshelf volumes delving deeply into politics and thenational character . Beside John F. Kennedy 's Profiles in Courage stood Barry Goldwater 's Conscience of a Conservative and Why Not 47ctory ? Alongside Theodore H. White 's The Making of the President , 1960 was John Kenneth Galbraith 's The Affluent Society . The tone of his letters took on a political cast . He seemed to be trying out phrases . " I think that a man can be a conservative without being a reactionary , " he wrote , " and that he can be a liberal without being a radical , and that conservative and liberal can sit down and reason together without vituperation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left and right " so blinded by their beliefs they find the smallest disagreement and any opposition an evidence of treason . These black spirits line the main road of our nation 's progress as a funeral mob shouting profanities at each other and all those that march steadily toward the future . " Word that Glenn 's resistance to politics had begun to weaken soon reached the ears of higher-ups in both parties . A delegation of Ohio Democrats descended upon him to urge that he offer himself as vice-presidential running mate to his good friend , Lyndon 13 . Johnson . A Republican congressman sent word that he intended to nominate Glenn for Vice President on the G.O.P. ticket . Glenn rose to neither bait . In Washington , at a quiet breakfast on January 10 , Ohio Republican chairman Ray Bliss laid his cards on the table in the latest series of meetings with Glenn . He wanted the astronaut to run for congressman-at-large , a post that wouldhe left vacant when young Robert Taft Jr . moved up to make his bid for the Senate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was needed . Soon Governors Romney of Michigan and Scranton of Pennsylvania were on the telephone urging Glenn to accept Bliss 's offer . Glenn thanked them for their calls . The Republicans then sought to bring up their biggest gun of all . Word came to Glenn that former President Eisenhower would be pleased to have him as his guest at the Rose Bowl game . Glenn went , but the talk was brief and inconclusive . Meanwhile , whenever they could corner him , the Democratic persuaders were dangling before Glenn 's eyes an even richer prize than a seat in the House  --  and the prospect of a fiercer fight . There was little likelihood , they told the astronaut , that their spry but aging incumbent senator , 74-year-old Stephen Young , could overcome the magic of the Taft name in the November elections . Haunted by the prospect of defeat , they implored Glenn to try for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate , and thus rescue Ohio 's divided and dispirited Democrats . For a week there was a hold on the political countdown while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the office of Scott Carpenter , his close friend and backup man in his Mercury flight , Glenn made his choice . He turned 10 Bob Voas , who long had urged him that his brightest future lay in politics . " OK , Bob , " he said . " It 's Go . " He reached for the telephone to call his wife . 1-1e phoned his parents in the little town of New Concord . As a courtesy , he telephoned Senator Young in Washington to tell him he %%mild oppose him in the Democratic primary in Nia% . The senator r1/4. - ceived the no% s without visible elation , Glenn 's decision to run as ; I Democrat may have wounded the Republicans ; it caused little surprise among those %%ho kilo% him best . The only formal reason he gage for his choice of party was that his father and mother are mo of the few Democrats in a staunchly Republican town . Associates feel there %%as another , perhaps more compelling , reason : The long talks with L ) ndon Johnson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disappointed Republicans haxe been heard to suggest that a third factor %nen more strongly influenced Glenn 's choice of a party label : The Democrats had a Senate seat to offer and the GOP did n't . Glenn made up his mind on Wednesday . On Thursday , after being formally separated from NASA and the space program , he left for Columbus , Ohio , where on the following day he would announce his candidacy . As he emerged from his house in Kemah , Tex. , newsmen and cameras were camped on his doorstep . At stops in Chicago and Dayton they were wailing for him , and at Columbus he had to plow his Nvay through the greatest throng of reporters to greet him since the days of his famous flight . It was clear that although orbiting the earth in a capsule might have taught him nothing of political campaigning , it had in% ested him with a fame and glamour that got him off to a racing start . The next day , as he made his formal announcement , he had little else but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of American politics has a serious candidate begun a race for high office with so little organized support . Around him as he addressed the reporters was his entire political camp : Bob Voas , the psychologist , whose previous experience in politics had been as a poll-watcher ; Rep. Wayne Hays , a political figure of limited renown in Ohio : Donald R. Gosney , Democratic chairman in a small and remote county : Clarence Graham , an old friend of Glenn 's father : and Robert ( Mic ) McDaniel , a rotund soft-drink bottler from East Liverpool . The fact that the little group of faithful was far outnumbered by the reporters present could be attributed to Glenn 's political na  --  vet ? . The announcement of his candidacy had come almost too late . While he agonized in Houston , Ohio 's Democratic leaders , hearing no favorable word from him , had already endorsed Senator Young , and 672 of the party regulars were to meet in Columbus on Monday the 20th to ratify that endorsement with trumpets and banners . With their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Neil House , an antique caravansary much favored by politicians , on Sunday evening . Young 's pledged cohorts they might he , but some 500 of them headed for Glenn 's suite on the eighth floor as soon as they put down their bags . Once they had elbowed their way into Glenn 's presence , they behaved less like shrewd politicians than like any other hero-worsh iping mob . They clutched his hand and pumped it , and they reached out to touch the hem of his garment . They poked pieces of paper at him for him to autograph , and if no paper was at hand , they asked him to scrawl his signature on their delegate badges or their handkerchiefs . In the throng were a few pragmatic characters who did not forget the business at hand . Drawing Glenn aside , they asked him bluntly the old political question : If they supported Glenn , what was in it for them ? " 1 represent 15,000 industrial workers , " a labor boss told him . " What will you do for us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenn had for improving the lot of his race . For a man who had never before been confronted with the realities of practical politics , Glenn handled himself with amazing aplomb . He could n't enter into any sort of political discussion , he explained . He was still in the Marine Corps , and so long as he remained in federal service , he would adhere strictly to the prohibitions of the Hatch Act . " He crawled into the Hatch Act like he was crawling into a space capsule , " a witness to Glenn 's backroom dexterity said . " He could easily have reassured these guys with a word or two . But he did n't even drop a hint . If the rules said no political talk , then that was it : - Though Glenn had done his best to keep the meeting nonpolitical , it was clear the next morning that the aura surrounding a folk hero had had its bemusing effect on the delegates . They assembled in convention as planned . But they did not endorse Senator Young . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of sharp maneuvering and some acrimonious bickering , they bolted the party leadership and refused to endorse anybody . They then adjourned amid general pandemonium . Glenn backers were delighted . In his first political contest , their candidate had won . While the maneuvering was at its height Colonel Glenn remained sequestered in his suite , far above the tumult on the convention floor . At a crucial moment an ardent supporter came panting in . Would the colonel come down and stroll about the lobby , just to make his presence felt ? he asked . No , Glenn said , he did n't think he ought to do that . OK , the sup porter argued , how about just coming down and buying a newspaper ? There was n't anything in the Hatch Act saying a man could n't buy a newspaper in a hotel lobby , was there ? No , the colonel said , he did n't suppose there was . But if he went down there to buy a newspaper he 'd know that was n't his real purpose in being there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention . And that would n't be right . " It 's that d conscience of his , " said " Mic " McDaniel , chomping on his stogie . " He 's the first candidate I ever saw who would n't give himself the benefit of the doubt in a little borderline case like that . He backed off like we wanted him to go down and hold up a bank . " The morning after Glenn 's dogfall victory on the convention floor , his original little band of supporters , now joined by two hardy political pros from Akron , gathered in the candidate 's room to lay plans for the campaign ahead . The pros , knowing that running a serious primary campaign in a great industrial state might cost a quarter of a million dollars , asked first about the war chest . Was it ample ? Glenn 's newly appointed finance chairman , Fred L. Bohn , an amiable plumbing-and-heating contractor from Zanesville , pulled some papers from his pocket and scribbled briefly with a pencil . " The way 1 figure it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got nearly sixty-five dollars in the kitty . " The pros , stunned , peered incredulously at each other , then reached wearily for their checkbooks . Unperturbed by the shaky state of his finances , Glenn left for Washington to start the month-long process of getting out of the Marine Corps . From Washington he went home to Texas , there to remain secluded until his final discharge conies through later this month . Then , free of all restrictions , he will begin his campaign on March 1 . Behind him in Columbus in a headquarters which was beginning to hum with activity , he left Bob Voas and Ford Eastman  --  both men have left the space agency  --  to answer the phones , see visitors . poke hopefully through the mail in search of checks , and write warm letters of thanks to well-wishers , and short , polite notes to the people who denounce Glenn for turning into a politician , and worst of all , a Democrat . Two years ago Bob Voas had followed John Glenn to the launching pad where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the blockhouse he watched the lift-off , and there he followed , minute by minute , Glenn 's three orbits around the world . Late last month Voas followed Glenn again , to a hotel ballroom in Columbus , where in the glare of klieg lights he helped to launch his hero again into the unknown . " I felt the first time he would go all the way , " Voas says . " I feel this time he will go all the way . I know this guy . I 've studied him . In politics , as in space , there 's no limit to how far he can go . " Voas 's confidence implies what many men suspect  --  that Glenn in his Senate race is making a test flight , getting the feel of the controls . But his eye is still on a moon shot  --  the longest political moon shot of them all .
