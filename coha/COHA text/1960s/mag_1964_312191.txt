Long the Reddest , deadest corpse in the Soviet satellite closet , East Germany showed faint stirrings of unnatural life last week . East German guards were busy knocking a 5-by-9-ft. hole in the Wall as officials of both Germanys signed a pass agreement permitting West Berliners to visit relatives in the East zone five times a year . At the same time , thousands of East German pensioners began registering to go West with the cagey blessing of Communism 's chief zombie in the Soviet zone , Walter Ulbricht . And when the satellite 's nominal No. 2 man , Premier Otto Grotewohl , died of a stroke , he was promptly replaced by ascetic , articulate Willi Stoph , whom the Communists have artfully put forward as the kind of man the West can deal with . <P> Though the changes are more cosmetic than cosmic , any loosening of East Germany is an improvement , an ambiguous mood summed up in West German Chancellor Erhard 's reaction to the pass agreement : " The German people will certainly feel genuine joy and satisfaction , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clause . The pass agreement , the fruit of hard bargaining over eight months between West Berlin and East German officials , grew out of temporary visits permitted last Christmas . Now , some 800,000 West Berliners with relatives in the East will be able to make as many as five family visits a year at holiday times . In addition , West Berliners can cross the Wall within 24 hours if there is a family emergency ( sickness , death , marriage or childbirth ) . This is permitted under a hardship clause , which also allows the East zone member of a married couple sundered by the advent of the Wall to emigrate to the West . <P> Ulbricht 's motive in letting East German pensioners ( men over 65 , women over 60 ) visit the West is less humanitarian than it might seem . He has already let 70,000 aged and ailing East Germans emigrate since the Wall went up , saving the Republic nearly $45 million in pensions and state medical care . His new liberality will give 3,000,000 more of the unproductive among East Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the Communist dole roll . <P> Red Triumph . The death of long-ailing Grotewohl at 70 left Ulbricht as the only , lonely survivor of the old guard of East German Communism . A tragic anti-hero who might have stepped from the pages of a Graham Greene novel , Grotewohl , as leader of the Social Democratic Party in the Soviet Zone after World War II , had one brief moment of importance . He used it to ally the Social Democrats to the Communists , symbolized in his famous walk from the right of an East Berlin operetta theater in 1946 to shake hands center-stage with Communist East German President Wilhelm Pieck . The gesture gave Moscow the faade of legality that it wanted to create the German Democratic Republic in East Germany . Though Grotewohl got the premiership as his reward , Ulbricht and Moscow thereafter ignored him , letting him indulge the good life he enjoyed : he once even bought his mistress a red Triumph sports car .                   @ @
