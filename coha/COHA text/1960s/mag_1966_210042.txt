EDUCATION ABROAD The Uninfected They wear tight blue jeans or pants that bell at the bottom . Their hair flows in ringlets over shirt collars . They strum cowboy tunes on guitars , favor English phrases such as " Hello , baby " and " Love me , do . " They claim to be alienated from their elders and resist any form of ideological indoctrination . In short , many students in Eastern Europe are surprisingly like U.S. campus rebels . In Prague a fortnight ago , 400 educators , including a dozen Westerners , met in a conference sponsored by Czechoslovakia 's Red regime to talk about why the Communist culture fails to grab the kids . <P> Utter Pessimism . In part , the answer is that many Eastern European students are bored with propaganda , restricted literature and limited travel . " We are young and can not always think only of building socialism , " says a Rumanian youth . " It is a fact , " says a Czech student , " that the only attractive currents for our generation are coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us we are a new generation building a new world ; then they insist we dance a folk dance two centuries old . " As a consequence , Eastern European girls prefer the watusi , the jerk , and big-beat music . <P> " Our youth feel a sense of utter pessimism , a rejection of any kind of political commitment , " complains one Communist elder . " They doubt the meaning of positive effort . Their only real interest is sex . " Youthful Yugoslav Author Mihajlo Mihajlov recently wrote President Tito that any fears that reading Western literature could " infect " Mihajlov with a " foreign ideology " are unfounded . His proof : " I have been reading Communist literature since childhood , and I still fail to find any sympathy for Communism . " <P> Well-Educated Watchmen . Such cynicism stems partly from students feeling that their education is put to little use by Communist societies , which tend to reserve the best jobs for party favorites . " They encourage us to study engineering and medicine , " complains a young Pole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community and to make less money as a doctor than a common laborer . I did n't study ten years for that . " A Czech student complained that university graduates are being " offered jobs as night watchmen-we have the best-educated night watchmen in the world . " <P> To stem such discontent , Eastern European countries are making it tougher for students to get into college and are channeling more of them into trade schools , which often lead to better-paying jobs . When Polish children complete their new , eight-grades schooling , one-fifth go on to four-year academic high schools , the rest to trade schools . After that they can take competitive exams for university training , but only 33,000 out of 80,000 applicants made it last year . <P> Communist indoctrination in schools has perforce turned soft-sell . Polish universities dropped compulsory-and widely scorned-cram courses in " Rudiments of Marxism-Leninism , " now offer more flexible discussion courses on " Main Problems of Marxist Philosophy . " Grade schools offer a new course called " civic education " directed at convincing children of " the superiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly by studying the party organization and local government in action .
