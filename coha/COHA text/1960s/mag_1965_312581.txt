Any time a president of the Mississippi Bar Association makes a speech , most Americans might give odds that he would include a blast at the U.S. Supreme Court . But Earl T. Thomas , partner in a top Jackson law firm , produced something quite different last week in a talk to Mississippi judges on " how to improve the administration of justice . " <P> A key problem is loss of public faith in courts , said Thomas , and one big reason is " backwash from the irrational , intemperate and emotional criticism of the United States Supreme Court . Fair , objective and rational criticism of said court , as of all courts , is not only healthy and to be commended , but also to be continued . When criticism , how ever , not based on rational or reason able bases , becomes solely vitriolic and emotional , then all courts are bound to suffer in the consequent loss of respect , prestige and the confidence of citizens . For the layman is unable to differentiate or becomes forgetful of the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippian and graduate of the Ole Miss law school , went on to criticize Mississippi 's own courts for archaic customs and " adherence , by acquiescence , inertia or other wise , to the ' sporting theory of justice , ' which makes justice a game instead of a quest for truth . " He even urged the state to emulate federal courts and catch up with other states by approving modern pretrial discovery techniques and summary judgments ( where there are no real factual issues ) " for the removal of sham actions from the trial calendars . " If Thomas surprised his listeners , who included the entire Mississippi Supreme Court , they also surprised him . " Earl , that 's just what we need , " said one admiring judge .
