Last week , just a month after he replaced John ( What 's My Line ? ) Daly as American Broadcasting Co. vice president in charge of news , James C. Hagerty , 51 , served notice that he will bring to his new job the same blunt and outspoken qualities that marked his eight years as press secretary to Dwight Eisenhower . In a speech before an aluminum industry convention in Oberlin , Ohio , Jim Hagerty reported ample room for improvement in TV news coverage-including ABC 's . Said he : " Too much emphasis has been placed on well-modulated voices and nice-looking faces . These voices and faces all too often are merely relaying the reports gathered by the wire service facilities . They seldom if ever actually leave the radio or television studio to cover the news . All too often they read someone else 's work - or at the most rewrite it . They have little if any association with the stories they are reporting . <P> " There are some radio and television voices in Washington who , to my personal knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a presidential news conference in the eight years I was at the White House . There are also individuals who have never been to Capitol Hill to cover the Congress , or to the State Department , or any other departments and agencies of the Government . <P> There is little initiative in digging up stories , in working to develop others .
