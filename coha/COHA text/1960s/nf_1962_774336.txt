txt  | Any actor will continue to save and invest his resources in various expected future consumers ' goods as long as the utility , considered in the present , of the marginal product of each unit saved and invested is greater than the utility of present consumers ' goods which he could obtain by not performing that saving . The latter utility ? of present consumers ' goods forgone ? is the " disutility of waiting . " Once the latter becomes greater than the utility of obtaining more goods in the future through saving , the actor will cease to save . Allowing for the relative urgency of wants , man , as has been demonstrated above , tends to invest first in those consumers ' goods with the shortest processes of production . Therefore , any given saving will be invested either in maintaining the present capital structure or in adding to it capital in more and more remote stages of production , i.e. , in longer processes of production . Thus , any new saving ( beyond maintaining the structure ) will tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capital goods . In a modern economy , the capital structure contains goods of almost infinite remoteness from the eventual consumers ' goods . We saw above some of the stages involved in the production of a comparatively very simple good like a ham sandwich . The laborer in an iron mine is far removed indeed from the ham sandwich in Jones ' armchair . It is evident that the problems of measurement that arose in previous sections would be likely to pose a grave difficulty in saving and investing . How do actors know when their capital structure is being added to or consumed , when the types of capital goods and consumers ' goods are numerous ? Obviously , Crusoe knows when he has more or fewer berries , but how can a modern complex economy , with innumerable capital goods and consumers ' goods , make such decisions ? The answer to this problem , which also rests on the commensurability of different goods , will be discussed in later chapters . In observing the increased output made possible by the use of capital goods , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive power to capital and to say that  | three types of productive forces enter into the production of onsumers ' goods : labor , nature , and capital . It would be easy to draw this conclusion , but completely fallacious . Capital goods have no independent productive power of their own ; in the last analysis they are completely reducible to labor and land , which produced them , and time . Capital goods are " stored-up " labor , land , and time ; they are intermediate way stations on the road to the eventual attainment of the consumers ' goods into which they are transformed . At every step of the way they must be worked on by labor , in conjunction with nature , in order to continue the process of production . Capital is not an independent productive factor like the other two . An excellent illustration of this truth has been provided by Bohm-Bawerk : The following analogy will make it perfectly clear . A man throws a stone at another man and kills him . Has the stone killed the man ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be answered without hesitation in the affirmative . But how if the murderer , on his trial , were to defend himself by saying that it was not he but the stone that had killed the man ? Taking the words in this sense , should we still say that the stone had killed the man , and acquit the murderer ? Now it is with an emphasis like this that economists inquire as to the independent productivity of capital . . . We are not asking about dependent intermediate causes , but about ultimate independent elements . The question is not whether capital plays a part in the bringing about of a productive result ? such as the stone does in the killing of the man ? but whether , granted the productive result , some part of it is due to capital so entirely and peculiarly that it simply can not be put to the credit of the two other recognized elementary factors , nature and labour . Rohm-Bawerk replies in the negative , pointing out that capital goods are purely way stations in the process of production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor and land : If , today , by allying my labor with natural powers , I make bricks out of clay , and tomorrow , by allying my labor with natural gifts , I obtain lime , and the day after that make mortar and so construct a wall , can it be said of any part of the wall that I and the natural powers have not made it ? Again , before a lengthy piece of work , such as the  | the decision to save and invest in the stick . If the latter is greater , and his 200 berries forgone have a greater value than the expectation of 1,500 berries three days from now , then his time preference has conquered the increased utility of stock , and he will not make the saving-investment decision . Thus , the actor 's value scale may be : In case ( b ) he will make the decision to invest ; in case ( a ) he will not . We can say that the value of 1,500 berries three days from now is the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is discounted by the actor according to his rate of time preference . The present value of his expected future good is compared to the present value of the present good on the actor 's value scale , and the decision to save and invest is made accordingly . It is clear that the higher the rate of discount , the lower the present value of the future good will be , and the greater the likelihood of abstaining from the investment . On the other hand , the lower the rate of discount , the higher the present value of future goods will be on the actor 's value scale , and the greater the likelihood of its being greater than the value of present goods forgone , and hence of his making the investment . Thus , the investment decision will be determined by which is greater : the present value of the future good or the present  | value of present goods forgone . The present value of the future good , in turn , is determined by the value that the future good would have if immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future good " ) ; and by the rate of time preference . The greater the former , the greater will be the present value of the future good ; the greater the latter ( the rate of discount of future compared to present goods ) , the lower will be the present value . At any point in time , an actor has a range of investment decisions open to him of varying potential utilities for the products that will be provided . He also has a certain rate of time preference by which he will discount these expected future utilities to their present value . How much he will save and invest in any period will be determined by comparing these present values with the value of the consumers ' goods forgone in making the investment decision . As he makes one investment decision after another , he will choose to allocate his resources first to investments of highest present value , then to those of next highest , etc . As he continues investing ( at any given time ) , the present value of the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is giving up a larger and larger supply of consumers ' goods in the present , the utility of the consumers ' goods that he forgoes ( leisure and others ) will increase ? on the basis of the law of marginal utility . He will cease saving and investing at the point at which the value of goods forgone exceeds the present value of the future utilities to be derived . This will determine an actor 's rate of saving and investing at any time . It is evident that the problem again arises : How can actors decide and compare time-preference rates for innumerable possible goods and in a complex , modern economy ? And here too , the answer for a complex economy lies in establishing commensurability among all the various commodities , present and future , as will be discussed in later chapters . Now , the uncertainty factors enter into the actor 's decision in one way or the other . The delicate procedure of weighing all the various factors in the situation is a complex process that takes place in the mind of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a decision depending purely on the individual judgment , the subjective estimates , of each actor . The " best " decision can not be exactly , or quantitatively , decided upon in advance by objective methods . This process of forecasting the future conditions that will occur during the course of his action is one that must be engaged in by every actor . This necessity of guessing the course of the relevant conditions and their possible change during the forthcoming action is called the act of entrepreneurship . Thus , to some extent at least , every man is an entrepreneur . Every actor makes his estimate of the uncertainty situation with regard to his forthcoming action . The concepts of success or failure in entrepreneurship are thus deducible from the existence of action . The relatively successful entrepreneur is the one who has guessed correctly the changes in conditions to take place during the action , and has invested accordingly . He is the Crusoe who has decided not to build the stick because his judgment tells him that he will soon find a new grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , the relatively unsuccessful entrepreneur is the one who has been badly mistaken in his forecast of the relevant changes in conditions taking place during the course of his action . He is the Crusoe who has failed to provide himself with a stick against the blight . The successful actor , the successful entrepreneur , makes correct estimates ; the unsuccessful entrepreneur is the one who makes erroneous estimates . Suppose now that an investment has already been made , and capital goods have already been built with a goal in view , when changing conditions reveal that an error has been made . The actor is then faced with the problem of determining what to do with the capital good . The answer depends on the convertibility of the capital good . If the good becomes wo ; hless in the use for which it is intended , the actor , though having made an error in investing in it in the first place , now has it on his hands and has to make the best of it . If there is another use to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do so . Thus , if Crusoe finds that a new grove has rendered his stick useless for berry-picking , he may use it as a walking stick . He would not  | have invested in it originally if he had known it would be useless for berry-picking , but now that he has it , he turns it to its most urgent available use . On the other hand , he may feel that it is hardly worthwhile to spend time replacing the stick , now that it is usable only for walking purposes . Or , after working fifty hours and building an axe , he may find a house left by some previous inhabitant . The axe , however , may be convertible to use in something just a bit lower in value ? say , building a bow and arrows for hunting or building a boat for fishing . The axe may be so valuable in these uses that Crusoe will still work to replace and maintain it in operation . It is clear that the accumulated stock of capital goods ( or , for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force on present-day action . The actor in the present is influenced by his ( or someone else 's ) actions in the past , even if the latter were to some extent in error . Thus , Crusoe might find an axe already available , built by a previous inhabitant . It might not be the sort of axe that Crusoe would consider the best available . However , he may decide , if it is a serviceable axe , to use it as a capital good and to wait until it wears out before replacing it with one of his choosing . On the other hand , he may feel that it is so blunt as to be of little use , and begin immediately to work on an axe of his own . The conservatism of the past exercises a similar influence on the question of location , another aspect of the same problem . Thus , Crusoe may already have built his house , cleared a field , etc. , in one portion of the island . Then , one day , in walking around the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with far greater advantages in fishing , fruits , etc . If he had not invested in any capital goods or durable consumers ' goods , he would immediately shift his location to this more abundant area . However , he has already invested in certain capital goods : some , such as the axe , are easily convertible to the new location ; others , such as the cleared field and house , can not be converted in their location . Therefore , he has to decide on his value scale between the advantages and disadvantages of moving : the more abundant fish and fruits vs. the necessity of working to build a new house ,  | new clearing , etc . He might decide , for example , to stay in the house and clearing until they have worn down to a certain point , without working on a replacement , and then shift to the new location . If an actor decides to abandon nonconvertible capital , such as the stick or the cleared field , in favor of producing other capital and consumers ' goods , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources by allowing the emergence of " unused capacity " of his resources . When Crusoe abandons his clearing or stick or house ( which may be considered in this connection as equivalent to capital ) , he is abandoning nonconvertible capital for the sake of using his labor in combination with natural elements or capital goods which he believes will yield him a greater utility . Similarly , if he refuses to go deep into a jungle for berries , he is not " wasting " his nonconvertible supply of land-and-berries , for he judges doing so of far less utility than other uses that he could make of his labor and time . The existence of a capital good not in use reveals an error made by this or by some previous actor in the past , but indicates that the actor expects to acquire a greater utility from other uses of his labor than he could obtain by continuing the capital good in its originally intended use or by converting it to some other use . This discussion provides the clue to an analysis of how actors will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , actors have their choice among the varying elements provided by nature . Thus , suppose that Crusoe , in his explorations of the island , finds that among the possible locations where he can settle , some are abundant in their output of berries ( setting aside their production of other consumers ' goods ) , some less so , and some useless and barren . Clearly , other considerations being equal , he will settle on the most fertile ? the " best " land ? and employ this factor as far as is determined by the utility of its product , the possibility of investing in useful capital goods on the land , the value he places on leisure , etc . The poorer areas of land will remain unused . As stated above , this development is to be expected ; there is no reason to be surprised at such evidence of " unused resources . " On the other hand , if the better  | areas are used up , then Crusoe will go on to utilize some of the next best areas , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility of his leisure forgone . ( " Next best " includes all the relevant factors , such as productivity , convenient access to the best land , etc . ) Areas of potential use , but which the actor chooses not to bring into use because it would not " pay " in terms of utilities forgone , are called submarginal areas . They are not objects of action at the moment , but the actor has them in mind for possible future use . On the other hand , Crusoe 's island may be so small or so barren that all his available useful land or water areas must be pressed into use . Thus , Crusoe might have to explore the whole island for his daily output of two hundred berries . In that case , if his resources are such that he must always employ all the possibly useful nature-given factors , it is obvious that the actor is pretty close to the bare survival level . In those cases where nature-given factors are worked on , " improved , " and maintained by human labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods . Thus , land that has been cleared , tilled , ploughed , etc. , by human labor has become a capital good . This land is a produced good , and not an originally given good . Decisions concerning whether and how much to improve the soil , or whether to maintain it or extract the maximum present consumers ' goods at the expense of future losses ( " erosion " ) , are on exactly the same footing as all capital-formation decisions . They depend on a comparison of the expected utility of future production as against the utility of present consumers ' goods forgone . It is clear that capital formation and the concomitant lengthening of the period of production prolong the period of provision of the actor . Capital formation lengthens the period in the future for which he is providing for the satisfaction of wants . Action involves the anticipation of wants that will be felt in the future , an estimate of their relative urgency , and the setting about to satisfy them . The more capital men invest , the longer their period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and presently  | consumed are present goods . A future good is the present expectation of enjoying a consumers ' good at some point in the future . A future good may be a claim on future consumers ' goods , or it may be a capital good , which will be transformed into a consumers ' good in the future . Since a capital good is a way station ( and nature-given factors are original stations ) on the route to consumers ' goods , capital goods and nature-given factors are both future goods . Similarly , the period of provision can be prolonged by lengthening the duration of serviceableness of the consumers ' goods being produced . A house has a longer durability than a crop of berries , for example , and Crusoe 's investment in a house considerably lengthens his period of provision . A durable consumers ' good is consumed only partially from day to day , so that each day 's consumption is that of a present good , while the stock of the remainder is a future good . Thus , if a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's use will consume 1/3,000 of it , while the remainder will be consumed in the future . 1/3,000 of the house is a present good , while the remaining part is a future good . It may be added that another method of lengthening the period of production is the simple accumulation of stocks of consumers ' goods to be consumed in the future instead of the present . For example , Crusoe might save a stock of one hundred berries to be consumed a few days or a week later . This is often called plain saving , as distinguished from capitalist saving , in which saving enters into the process of capital formation . We shall see , however , that there is no essential difference between the two types of saving and that plain saving is also capitalist saving in that it too results in capital formation . We must keep in mind the vital fact that the concept of a " good " refers to a thing the units of which the actor believes afford equal serviceability . It does not refer to the physical or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the popular fallacious objection to the universal fact of time preference ? that , in any given winter , ice the next summer is preferred to ice now . This  | was not a case of preferring the consumption of the same good in the future to its consumption in the present . If Crusoe has a stock of ice in the winter and decides to " save " some until next summer , this means that " ice-in-the-summer " is a different good , with a different intensity of satisfaction , from " ice-in-the-winter , " despite their physical similarities . The case of berries or of any other good is similar . If Crusoe decides to postpone consuming a portion of his stock of berries , this must mean that this portion will have a greater intensity of satisfaction if consumed later than now ? enough greater , in fact , to overcome his time preference for the present . The reasons for such difference may be numerous , involving anticipated tastes and conditions of supply on that future date . At any rate , " **29;1406;TOOLONG " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the number of berries that will be shifted from today 's to next week 's consumption will be determined by the behavior of the diminishing marginal utility of next week 's berries ( as the supply increases ) , the increasing marginal utility of today 's berries ( as the supply decreases ) , and the rate of time preference . Suppose that as a resultant of these factors , Crusoe decides to shift one hundred berries for this purpose . In that case , these hundred berries are removed from the category of consumers ' goods and shifted to that of capital goods . These are the sort of capital goods , however , which , like wine , needs only maturing time to be transferred into consumers ' goods , without the expenditure of labor ( except the possible extra labor of storing and unstoring the berries ) . It is clear , therefore , that the accumulation of a stock of consumers ' goods is also saving that goes into capital formation . The saved goods immediately become capital goods , which later mature into more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between the two types of saving . 10 . Action as an Exchange We have stated that all action involves an exchange ? a giving up of a state of affairs for what the actor expects will be a more  | satisfactory state . We may now elaborate on the implications of this truth , in the light of the numerous examples that have been given in this chapter . Every aspect of action has involved a choice among alternatives ? a giving up of some goods for the sake of acquiring others . Wherever the choice occurred ? whether among uses of durable consumers ' goods , or of capital goods ; saving vs. consumption ; labor vs. leisure ; etc. ? such choices among alternatives , such renouncing of one thing in favor of another , were always present . In each case , the actor adopted the course that he believed would afford him the highest utility on his value scale ; and in each case , the actor gave up what he believed would turn out to be a lesser utility . Before analyzing the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man must always act . Since he is always in a position to improve his lot , even " doing nothing " is a form of acting . " Doing nothing " ? or spending all of his time in leisure ? is a choice that will affect his supply of consumers ' goods . Therefore , man must always be engaged in choosing and in action . Since man is always acting , he must always be engaged in trying to attain the greatest height on his value scale , whatever the type of choice under consideration . There must always be room for improvement in his value scale ; otherwise all of man 's wants would be perfectly satisfied , and action would disappear . Since this can not be the case , it means that there is always open to each actor the prospect of improving his lot , of attaining a value higher than he is giving up , i.e. , of making a psychic profit . What he is giving up may be called his costs , i.e. , the utilities that he is forgoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actor 's costs are his forgone opportunities to enjoy consumers ' goods . Similarly , the ( greater ) utility that he expects to acquire because of the action may be considered his psychic income , or psychic revenue , which in turn will be equal to the utility of the goods he will consume as a result of the action . Hence , at the inauguration of any action , the actor will believe that this course of action will , among the alternatives , maximize his psychic income or psychic revenue , i.e. , attain the greatest height on his value scale .  | This chapter has been an exposition of part of praxeological analysis ? the analysis which forms the body of economic theory . This analysis takes as its fundamental premise the existence of human action . Once it is demonstrated that human action is a necessary attribute of the existence of human beings , the rest of praxeology ( and its subdivision , economic theory ) consists of the elaboration of the logical implications of the concept of action . Economic analysis is of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) If A , then B ; if B , then C ; if C , then D , etc. ? by rules of logic . 3 ) Therefore , we assert ( the truth of ) B , C , D , etc . It is important to realize that economics does not propound any laws about the content of man 's ends . The examples that we have given , such as ham sandwich , berries , etc. , are simply illustrative instances , and are not meant to assert anything about the content of a man 's goals at any given time . The concept of action involves the use of scarce means for satisfying the most urgent wants at some point in the future , and the truths of economic theory involve the formal relations between ends and means , and not their specific contents . A man 's ends may be " egoistic " or " altruistic , " " refined " or " vulgar . " They may emphasize the enjoyment of " material goods " and comforts , or they may stress the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its laws apply regardless of the nature of these ends . Praxeology , therefore , differs from psychology or from the philosophy of ethics . Since all these disciplines deal with the subjective decisions of individual human minds , many observers have believed that they ; ire fundamentally identical . This is not the case at all . Psychology and ethics deal with the content of human ends ; they ask , why does the man choose such and such ends , or what ends should men value ? Praxeology and economics deal with any given ends and with the formal implications of the fact that men have ends and employ means to attain them . Praxeology and economics are therefore disciplines separate and distinct from the others . Thus , all explanations of the law of marginal utility on psychological or physiological grounds are erroneous . For example , many writers have based the law of marginal utility on an alleged " law of the satiation of wants , " according to which a man can eat so many scoops of ice  | cream at one time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is true in psychology is completely irrelevant to economics . These writers erroneously concluded that , at the beginning of the supply , a second unit may be more enjoyable than the first , and therefore that marginal utility may increase at first before declining . This is completely fallacious . The law of marginal utility depends on no physiological or psychological assumptions , but is based on the praxeological truth that the first unit of a good will be used to satisfy the most urgent want , the second unit the next most urgent want , etc . It must be remembered that these " units " must be of equal potential serviceability . For example , it is erroneous to argue as follows : Eggs are the good in question . It is possible that a man needs four eggs to bake a cake . In that case , the second egg may be used for a less urgent use than the first egg , and the third egg for a less urgent use than the second . However , since the fourth egg allows a cake to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marginal utility of the fourth egg is greater than that of the third egg . This argument neglects the fact that a " good " is not the physical material , but any material whatever of which the units will constitute an equally serviceable supply . Since the fourth egg is not equally serviceable and interchangeable with the first egg , the two eggs are not units of the same supply , and therefore the law of marginal utility does not apply to this case at all . To treat eggs in this case as homogeneous units of one good , it would be necessary to consider each set of four eggs as a unit . To sum up the relationship and the distinctions between praxeology and each of the other disciplines , we may describe them as follows : Why man chooses various ends : psychology . What men 's ends should be : philosophy of ethics . also : philosophy of aesthetics . How to use means to arrive at ends : technology . What man 's ends are and have been , : rid how man has used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal implications of the fact that men use means to attain various chosen ends : praxeology . What is the relationship between praxeology and economic analysis ? Economics is a subdivision of praxeology ? so far the only fully elabo- rated subdivision . With praxeology as the general , formal theory of human action , economics includes the analysis of the action of an isolated individual ( Crusoe economics ) and , especially elaborate , the analysis of interpersonal exchange ( catallactics ) . The rest of praxeology is an unexplored area . Attempts have been made to formulate a logical theory of war and violent action , and violence in the form of government has been treated by political philosophy and by praxeology in tracing the effects of violent intervention in the free market . A theory of games has been elaborated , and interesting beginnings have been made in a logical analysis of voting . The suggestion has been made that , since praxeology and economics are logical chains of reasoning based on a few universally known premises , to be really scientific it should be elaborated according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious misconception of the role of mathematical logic , or " logistics . " In the first place , it is the great quality of verbal propositions that each one is meaningful . On the other hand , algebraic and logical symbols , as used in logistics , are not in themselves meaningful . Praxeology asserts the action axiom as true , and from this ( together with a few empirical axioms ? such as the existence of a variety of resources and individuals ) are deduced , by the rules of logical inference , all the propositions of economics , each one of which is verbal and meaningful . If the logistic array of symbols were used , each proposition would not be meaningful . Logistics , therefore , is far more suited to the physical sciences , where , in contrast to the science of human action , the conclusions rather than the axioms are known . In the physical sciences , the premises are only hypothetical , and logical deductions are made from them . In these cases , there is no purpose in having meaningful propositions at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematical language is more useful . Simply to develop economics verbally , then to translate into logistic symbols , and finally to retranslate the propositons back into English , makes no sense and violates the fundamental scientific principle of Occam 's razor ; which calls for the greatest possible simplicity in science and the avoidance of unnecessary multiplication of entities or processes . Contrary to what might be believed , the use of verbal logic is not inferior to logistics . On the contrary , the latter is merely an auxiliary device based on the former . For formal logic deals with the necessary and fundamental laws of thought , which must be verbally expressed ,  | and logistics is only a symbolic system that uses this formal verbal logic as its foundation . Therefore , praxeology and economics need not be apologetic in the slightest for the use of verbal logic ? the fundamental basis of symbolic logic , and meaningful at each step of the route . It is often charged that any theory grounded on a logical separation of means and ends is unrealistic because the two are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts purposively , he therefore drives toward ends , and whatever route he takes , he must , ipso facto , employ means to achieve them . The distinction between means and ends is a necessary logical distinction rooted in all human ? indeed , all purposive ? action . It is difficult to see the sense in any denial of this primordial truth . The only sense to the charge concerns those cases where certain objects , or rather certain routes of action , become ends in themselves as well as means to other ends . This , of course , can often happen . There is no difficulty , however , in incorporating them into an analysis , as has been clone above . Thus , a man may work at a certain job not only for the pay , but also because he enjoys the work or the location . Moreover , any desire for money is a desire for a means to other ends . The critics of praxeology confuse the necessary and eternal separation of ends and means as categories with their frequent coincidence in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis in chapter 1 was based on the logical implications of the assumption of action , and its results hold true for all human action . The application of these principles was confined , however , to " Crusoe economics , " where the actions of isolated individuals are considered by themselves . In these situations there are no interactions between persons . Thus , the analysis could easily and directly be applied to n number of isolated Crusoes on n islands or other isolated areas . The next task is to apply and extend the analysis to consider interactions between individual human beings . Let us suppose that Crusoe eventually finds that another individual , say Jackson , has also been living an isolated existence at the other end of the island . What types of interaction may now take place between them ? One type of action is violence . Thus , Crusoe may entertain a vigorous hatred toward Jackson and decide to murder or otherwise injure him . In that case , Crusoe would gain his end ? murder of Jackson ? by committing violence . Or Crusoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and collection of furs and murder Jackson as a means to that end . In either case , the result is that Crusoe gains in satisfaction at the expense of Jackson , who , to say the least , suffers great psychic loss . Fundamentally similar is action based on a threat of violence , or intimidation . Thus , Crusoe may hold up Jackson at the point of a knife and rob him of his accumulated  | furs and provisions . Both examples are cases of violent action and involve gain for one at the expense of another . The following factors , singly or in combination , might work to induce Crusoe ( or Jackson ) to refrain from any violent action against the other : 1 ) He may feel that the use of violence against any other human being is immoral , i.e. , that refraining from violence against another person is an end in itself , whose rank in his value scale is higher that that of any advantages in the form of capital or consumers ' goods that he might gain from such action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might well establish an unwelcome precedent , causing the other person to take up arms against him , so that he may end by being the victim instead of the victor . If he begins a type of action where one must gain at the expense of another , then he must face the fact that he might turn out to be the loser as a result of the action . 3 ) Even if he feels that his violent action will eventually result in victory over the other , he may conclude that the " costs of the war " would exceed his net gain from the victory . Thus , the disutility of time and labor-energy spent in fighting the war ( war may be defined as violent action used by two or more opponents ) , in accumulating weapons for the war ( capital goods for war uses ) , etc. , might , in prospect , outweigh the spoils of conquest . 4 ) Even if Crusoe feels reasonably certain of victory and believes that the costs of fighting will be far less than the utility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be outweighed in his decision by long-run losses . Thus , his conquest of Jackson 's furs and house may add to his satisfaction for a while after the " period of production " ( = preparing for the war + the length of time of the war itself ) , but , after a time , his house will decay and his furs become worthless . He i -. ay then conclude that , by his murder of Jackson , he has lost permanently many services which Jackson 's continued existence might have furnished . This might be companionship or other types of consumers ' or capital goods . How Jackson might have served Crusoe without resort to violence will be indicated below , but , at any rate , Crusoe may  | be detained from using violence by estimating the disutility of the long-run consequences more highly than the utility of the expected short-run gains . On the other hand , his time preference may be so high as to cause his short-run gains to override the long-run losses in his decision . It is possible that Crusoe may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war or the long-run consequences , in which case his actions will turn out to be erroneous , i.e. , the means he used were not the appropriate ones to maximize his psychic revenue . Instead of murdering his opponent , Crusoe might find it more useful to enslave him , and , under continual threat of violence , to force Jackson to agree to expend his labor for the satisfaction of Crusoe 's wants rather than his own . Under slavery , the master treats the slave as he does his livestock , horses , and other animals , using them as factors of production to gratify his wants , and feeding , housing them , etc. , just enough to enable them to continue in the master 's service . It is true that the slave agrees to this arrangement , but this agreement is the result of a choice between working for the master and injury through violence . Labor under these conditions is qualitatively different from labor not under the threat of violence , and may be called compulsory labor as compared to free labor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave under Crusoe 's dictates , it does not mean that Jackson is an enthusiastic advocate of his own slavery . It simply means that Jackson does not believe that revolt against his master will better his condition , because of the costs of the revolt in terms of possible violence inflicted on him , the labor of preparing and fighting , etc . The argument that the slave might be an enthusiastic supporter of the system because of the food , etc. , provided by his master ignores the fact that , in that case , violence and the threat of violence by the master would not be necessary . Jackson would simply voluntarily place himself in Crusoe 's service , and this arrangement would not be slavery , but another type considered in the next section . It is clear that the slave is always worse off than he would be without the threat of violence by the mas- ter , and therefore , that the master always gains at the expense of the slave . The interpersonal relation under slavery is known as hegemonic . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being enforced by threats of violence . The master uses the slaves as instruments , as factors of production , for gratifying his wants . Thus , slavery , or hegemony , is defined as a system in which one must labor under the orders of another under the threat of violence . Under hegemony , the man who does the obeying ? the " slave , " " serf , " " ward , " or " subject " ? makes only one choice among two alternatives : ( 1 ) to subject himself to the master or " dictator " ; or ( 2 ) to revolt against the regime of violence by use of his own violence or by refusing to obey orders . If he chooses the first course , he submits himself to the hegemonic ruler , and all the other decisions and actions are made by that ruler . The subject chooses once in choosing to obey the ruler ; the other choices are made by the ruler . The subject acts as a passive factor of production for use by the master . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slave , he engages in coerced or compulsory labor , and the dictator alone is free to choose and act . Violent action may result in the following developments : ( a ) inconclusive fighting , with neither opponent the victor , in which case the war may continue intermittently for a long period of time , or violent action may cease , and peace be established ( the absence of war ) ; ( b ) the victor may kill the victim , in which case there is no further interpersonal action between the two ; ( c ) the victor may simply rob the victim and leave , to return to isolation , or perhaps with intermittent violent forays ; or ( d ) the victor may establish a continuing hegemonic tyranny over the victim by threats of violence . In course ( a ) , the violent action was proved abortive and erroneous ; in ( b ) , there is no further interpersonal interaction ; in ( c ) , there is an alternation between robbery and isolation ; and iii ( d ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in ( d ) has a continuing pattern of inter personal relationship been constituted . These relations are corn- pulsory , involving the following coerced " exchanges " : the slaves are treated as factors of production in exchange for food and other provisions ; the masters acquire factors of production in exchange for supplying the provisions . Any continuing pattern of interpersonal exchanges is called a society , and it is clear that a society has been established only in case ( d ) .5 In the case of Crusoe 's enslavement of Jackson , the society established is a totally hegemonic one . The term " society , " then , denotes a pattern of interpersonal exchanges among human beings . It is obviously absurd to treat " society " as " real , " with some independent force of its own . There is no reality to society apart from the individuals who compose it and whose actions determine the type of social pattern that will be established . We have seen in chapter 1 that all action is an exchange , and we may now divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Autistic exchange consists of any exchange that does not involve some form of interpersonal exchange of services . Thus , all of isolated Crusoe 's exchanges were autistic . On the other hand , the case of slavery did involve interpersonal exchange , in which each gives up some goods in order to acquire other goods from the other . In this form of compulsory exchange , however , only the ruler benefits from the exchange , since he is the only one who makes it of his own free choice . Since he must impose the threat of violence in order to induce the subject to make the exchange , it is clear that the latter loses by the exchange . The master uses the subject as a factor of production for his own profit at the latter 's expense , and this hegemonic relationship may be called exploitation . Under hegemonic exchange , the ruler exploits the subject for the ruler 's benefit From this point on , we shall develop an analysis of the workings of a society based purely on voluntary action , entirely unhampered by violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions that are purely voluntary , and have no trace of hegemonic relations . Then , after working out the laws of the unhampered market , we shall trace the nature and results of hegemonic relations ? of actions based on violence or the threat of violence . We shall note the various effects of violent interference with voluntary actions and shall consider the consequences of approaches to a regime of total hegemony , of pure slavery or subjection . At present , we shall confine our discussion to an analysis of actions unhampered by the existence of violence of man against man . The major form of voluntary interaction is voluntary interpersonal exchange . A gives up a good to B in exchange for a good that B gives up to A. The essence of the exchange is that both people make it because they expect that it will benefit them ; otherwise they would not have agreed to the exchange . A necessary condition for an exchange to take place is that the two goods have reverse valuations on the respective value scales of the two parties to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two exchangers , and A gives B good X in exchange for good Y. In order for this exchange to take place , the following must have been their value scales before making the exchange : ( Parentheses around the good indicate that the party does not have it in his stock ; absence of parentheses indicates that he has . ) A possesses good X , and B possesses good Y , and each evaluates the good of the other more highly than his own . After the exchange is made , both A and B have shifted to a higher position on their respective value scales . Thus , the conditions for an exchange to take place are that the goods are valued in reverse order by the two parties and that each of the parties knows of the existence of the other and the goods that he possesses . Without knowledge of the other person 's assets , no exchange of these assets could take place . It is clear that the things that must be exchanged are goods ,  | which will be useful to the receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or claims to future goods , which may be considered as equivalent to future goods ) , they may be capital goods or consumers ' goods , labor or nature-given factors . At any rate , the objects of an exchange must be scarce means to human ends , since , if they were available in abundance for all , they would be general conditions of human welfare and not objects of human action . If something were a general condition of human welfare , there would be no need to give something up to acquire it , and it would not become the object of exchange . If the goods in question are unique goods with a supply of one unit , then the problem of when exchanges will or will not be made is a simple one . If A has a vase and B a typewriter , if each knows of the other 's asset , and if A values the typewriter more highly , and B values the vase more highly , there will be an exchange . If , on the other hand , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the other has , then an exchange will not take place . Similarly , an exchange will not take place if either party has no knowledge that the other party has a vase or a typewriter . On the other hand , if the goods are available in supplies of homogeneous units , the problem becomes more complex . Here , in determining how far exchanges of the two goods will go , the law of marginal utility becomes the decisive factor . If Jones and Smith have certain quantities of units of goods X and Y in their possession , then in order for Jones to trade one unit of X for one unit of Y , the following conditions have to be met : To Jones , the marginal utility of the added unit of Y must be greater than the marginal utility of the unit of X given up ; and to Smith , the marginal utility of the added unit of X must be greater than the marginal utility of the unit of Y given up . Thus :  | ( The marginal utilities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not comparable , since they can not be measured , and the two value scales can not be reduced to one measure or scale . ) However , as Jones continues to exchange with Smith units of X for units of Y , the marginal utility of X to Jones increases , because of the law of marginal utility . Furthermore , the marginal utility of the added unit of Y continues to decrease as Jones ' stock of Y increases , because of the operation of this law . Eventually , therefore , Jones will reach a point where , in any further exchange of X for Y , the marginal utility of X will be greater than the marginal utility of the added unit of Y , so that he will make no further exchange . Furthermore , Smith is in a similar position . As he continues to exchange Y for X , for him the marginal utility of Y increases , and the marginal utility of the added unit of X decreases , with the operation of the law of marginal utility . He too will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than raise his position on his value scale , so that he will decline to make any further exchange . Since it takes two to make a bargain , Jones and Smith will exchange units of X for units of Y until one of them reaches a point beyond which further exchange will lead to loss rather than profit . Thus , suppose that Jones begins with a position where his assets ( stock of goods ) consist of a supply of 5 horses and 0 cows , while Smith begins with assets of 5 cows and 0 horses . How much , if any , exchanges of one cow for one horse will be effected is reflected in the value scales of the two people . Thus , suppose that Jones ' value diagram is as shown in Fig. 5 . The dots represent the value of the marginal utility of each additional cow , as Jones makes exchanges of one horse for one cow . The crosses represent the increasing marginal utility of each horse given up as Jones makes exchanges . Jones will stop trading after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 3 cows , since a further such exchange will make him worse off . On the other hand , suppose that Smith 's value diagram appears as in Fig. 6 . The dots represent the marginal utility to Smith of each additional horse , while the crosses represent the marginal utility of each cow given up . Smith will stop trading after two  | exchanges , and therefore Jones will have to stop after two exchanges also . They will end with Jones having a stock of 3 horses and 2 cows , and Smith with a stock of 3 cows and 2 horses . It is almost impossible to overestimate the importance of exchange in a developed economic system . Interpersonal exchanges have an enormous influence on productive activities . Their existence means that goods and units of goods have not only direct use-value for the producer , but also exchange-value . In other words , goods may now be exchanged for other goods of greater usefulness to the actor . A man will exchange a unit of a good so long as the goods that it can command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had in direct use , i.e. , so long as its exchange-value is greater than its direct use-value . In the example above , the first two horses that Jones exchanged and the first two cows surrendered by Smith had their respective assets had greater use-value to their owners than exchange-value . The existence and possibilities of exchange open up for producers the avenue of producing for a " market " rather than for themselves . Instead of attempting to maximize his product in isolation by producing goods solely for his own use , each person can now produce goods in anticipation of their exchange-value , and exchange these goods for others that are more valuable to  | him . It is evident that since this opens a new avenue for the utility of goods , it becomes possible for each person to increase his productivity . Through praxeology , therefore , we know that only gains can come to every participant in exchange and that each must benefit by the transaction ; otherwise he would not engage in it . Empirically we know that the exchange economy has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the participants . Thus , any person can produce goods either for his own direct use or for purposes of exchange with others for goods that he desires . In the former case , he is the consumer of his own product ; in the latter case , he produces in the service of other consumers , i.e. , he " produces for a market . " In either case , it is clear that , on the unhampered " market , " it is the consumers who dictate the course of production . At any time , a good or a unit of a good may have for its possessor either direct use-value or exchange-value or a mixture of both , and whichever is the greater is the determinant of his action . Examples of goods with only direct use-value to their owner are those in an isolated economy or such goods as eyeglasses ground to an individual prescription . On the other hand , producers of such eyeglasses or of surgical instruments find no direct use-value in these products , but only exchange-value . Many goods , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange-value for their owners . For the latter goods , changing conditions may cause direct use-value to replace exchangevalue in the actor 's hierarchy of values , or vice versa . Thus , if a person with a stock of wine happens to lose his taste for wine , the previous greater use-value that wine had for him will change , and the wine 's exchange-value will take precedence over its usevalue , which has now become almost nil . Similarly , a grown person may exchange the toys that he had used as a child , now that their use-value has greatly declined . On the other hand , the exchange-value of goods may decline , causing their possessors to use them directly rather than exchange them . Thus , a milliner might make a hat for purposes of exchange , but some minor defect might cause its expected exchange- value to dwindle , so that the milliner decides to wear the hat herself . One of the most important factors causing a change in the relationship between direct use-value and exchange-value is an increase in the number of units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility we know that an increase in the supply of a good available decreases the marginal utility of the supply for direct use . Therefore , the more units of supply are available , the more likely will the exchange-value of the marginal unit be greater than its value in direct use , and the more likely will its owner be to exchange it . The more horses that Jones had in his stock , and the more cows Smith had , the more eager would they be to exchange them . Conversely , a decrease in supply will increase the likelihood that direct use-value will predominate . The network of voluntary interpersonal exchanges forms a society ; it also forms a pattern of interrelations known as the market . A society formed solely by the market has an unhampered market , or a free market , a market not burdened by the interference of violent action . A society based on voluntary exchanges is called a contractual society . In contrast to the hegemonic society based on the rule of violence , the contractual type of society is based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make exchanges are called contracts , and a society based on voluntary contractual agreements is a contractual society . It is the society of the unhampered market . In a contractual society , each individual benefits by the exchange-contract that he makes . Each individual is an actor free to make his own decisions at every step of the way . Thus , the relations among people in an unhampered market are " symmetrical " ; there is equality in the sense that each person has equal power to make his own exchange-decisions . This is in contrast to a hegemonic relationship , where power is asymmetrical ? where the dictator makes all the decisions for his subjects except the one decision to obey , as it were , at bayonet point . Thus , the distinguishing features of the contractual society , of the unhampered market , are self-responsibility , freedom from vio- lence , full power to make one 's own decisions ( except the decision to institute violence against another ) , and benefits for all participating individuals . The distinguishing features of a hegemonic society are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make one 's own decisions to a dictator , and exploitation of subjects for the benefit of the masters . It will be seen below that existing societies may be totally hegemonic , totally contractual , or various mixtures of different degrees of the two , and the nature and consequences of these various " mixed economies " and totally hegemonic societies will be analyzed . Before we examine the exchange process further , it must be considered that , in order for a person to exchange anything , he must first possess it , or own it . He gives up the ownership of good X in order to obtain the ownership of good Y. Ownership by one or more owners implies exclusive control and use of the goods owned , and the goods owned are known as property . Freedom from violence implies that no one may seize the property of another by means of violence or the threat of violence and that each person 's property is safe , or " secure , " from such aggression . What goods become property ? Obviously , only scarce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are abundant to all , are not the objects of any action , and therefore can not be owned or become property . On the free market , it is nonsense to say that someone " owns " the air . Only if a good is scarce is it necessary for anyone to obtain it , or ownership of it , for his use . The only way that a man could assume ownership of the air is to use violence to enforce this claim . Such action could not occur on the unhampered market . On the free , unhampered market , a man can acquire property in scarce goods as follows : ( I ) In the first place , each man ha , s ownership over his own self , over his will and actions , and the manner in which he will exert his own labor . ( 2 ) He acquires scarce nature-given factors either by appropriating hitherto unused factors for his own use or by receiving them as a gift from someone else , who in the last analysis must have appropriated them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods or consumers ' goods either by mixing his own labor with nature- given factors to produce them or by receiving them as a gift from someone else . As in the previous case , gifts must eventually resolve themselves into some actor 's production of the goods by the use of his own labor . Clearly , it will be nature-given factors , capital goods , and durable consumers ' goods that are likely to be handed down through gifts , since nondurable consumers ' goods will probably be quickly consumed . ( 4 ) He may exchange any type of factor ( labor service , nature-given factor , capital good , consumers ' good ) for any type of factor . It is clear that gifts and exchanges as a source of property must eventually be resolved into : self-ownership , appropriation of unused nature-given factors , and production of capital and consumers ' goods , as the ultimate sources of acquiring property in a free economic system . In order for the giving or exchanging of goods to take place , they must first be obtained by individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events is therefore : A man owns himself ; he appropriates unused nature-given factors for his ownership ; he uses these factors to produce capital goods and consumers ' goods which become his own ; he uses up the consumers ' goods and/or gives them and the capital goods away to others ; he exchanges some of these goods for other goods that had come to be owned in the same way by others . ' ' ' 12 These are the methods of acquiring goods that obtain on the free market , and they include all but the method of violent or other invasive expropriation of the property of others . In contrast to general conditions of welfare , which on the free market can not be subject to appropriation as property , scarce goods in use in production must always be under someone 's control , and therefore must always be property . On the free market , the goods will be owned by those who either produced them , first put them to use , or received them in gifts . Similarly , under a system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintend and direct the operations of these goods . Whoever performs these functions in effect owns these goods as property , regardless of the legal definition of ownership . This applies to persons and their services as well as to material goods . On the free market , each person is a complete owner of himself ,  | whereas under a system of full hegemonic bonds , he is subject to the ownership of others , with the exception of the one decision not to revolt against the authority of the owner . Thus , violent or hegemonic regimes do not and can not abolish property , which derives from the fundamentals of human action , but can only transfer it from one person or set of people ( the producers or natural self-owners ) to another set . We may now briefly sum up the various types of human action in the following table : HUMAN ACTION I. Isolation ( Autistic Exchange ) II . Interpersonal Action A. Invasive Action B. Noninvasive Action 1 . War 1 . Gifts 2 . Murder , Assault 2 . Voluntary Exchange 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an analysis of a noninvasive society , particularly that constituted by voluntary interpersonal exchange . In describing the conditions that must obtain for interpersonal exchange to take place ( such as reverse valuations ) , we implicitly assumed that it must be two different goods that are being exchanged . If Crusoe at his end of the island produced only berries , and Jackson at his end produced only the same kind of berries , then no basis for exchange between them would occur . If Jackson produced two hundred berries and Crusoe one hundred fifty , it would be nonsensical to assume that any exchange of berries would be made between them . The only voluntary interpersonal action in relation to berries that could occur would be a gift from one to another . If exchangers must exchange two different goods , this implies that each party must have a different proportion of assets of goods  | in relation to his wants . He must have relatively specialized in the acquisition of different goods from those the other party produced . This specialization by each individual may have occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the three : ( a ) differences in suitability and yield of the nature-given factors ; ( b ) differences in given capital and durable consumers ' goods , and ( c ) differences in skill and in the desirability of different types of labor . These factors , in addition to the potential exchange-value and use-value of the goods , will determine the line of production that the actor will pursue . If the production is directed toward exchange , then the exchange-value will play a major role in his decision . Thus , Crusoe may have found abundant crops on his side of the island . These resources , added to his greater skill in farming and the lower disutility of this occupation for him because of a liking for agriculture , might cause him to take up farming , while Jackson 's greater skill in hunting and more abundant game supply induce him to specialize in hunting and trapping . Exchange , a productive process for both participants , implies specialization of production , or division of labor . The extent to which division of labor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market for the products . The latter determines the exchange-value that the producer will be able to obtain for his goods . Thus , if Jackson knows that he will be able to exchange part of his catch of game for the grains and fruits of Crusoe , he may well expend all his labor on hunting . Then he will be able to devote all his labor-time to hunting , while Crusoe devotes his to farming , and their " surplus " stocks will be exchanged up to the limits analyzed in the previous section . On the other hand , if , for example , Crusoe has little use for meat , Jackson will not be able to exchange much meat , and he will be forced to be far more directly self-sufficient , producing his own grains and fruits as well as meat . It is clear that , praxeologically , the very fact of exchange and the division of labor implies that it must be more productive for all concerned than isolated , autistic labor . Economic analysis alone , however , does not convey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the division of labor brings to society . This is based on a further empirical insight , viz. , the enormous variety in human beings and in the world around them . It is a fact that , superimposed on the basic unity of species and objects in nature , there is a great diversity . Particularly is there variety in the aforementioned factors that would give rise to specialization : in the locations and types of natural resources and in the ability , skills , and tastes of human beings . In the words of Professor von Mises : One may as well consider these two facts as one and the same fact , namely , the manifoldness of nature which makes the universe a complex of infinite varieties . If the earth 's surface were such that the physical conditions of production were the same at every point and if one man were . . . equal to all other men . . . division of labor would not offer any advantages for acting man . It is clear that conditions for exchange , and therefore increased productivity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiority in productivity in regard to one of the goods exchanged ? a superiority that may be due either to better naturegiven factors or to the ability of the producer . If individuals abandon attempts to satisfy their wants in isolation , and if each devotes his working time to that specialty in which he excels , it is clear that total productivity for each of the products is increased . If Crusoe can produce more berries per unit of time , and Jackson can kill more game , it is clear that productivity in both lines is increased if Crusoe devotes himself wholly to the production of berries and Jackson to hunting game , after which they can exchange some of the berries for some of the game . In addition to this , full-time specialization in a line of production is likely to improve each person 's productivity in that line and intensify the relative superiority of each . More puzzling is the case in which one individual is superior to another in all lines of production . Suppose , for example , that Crusoe is superior to Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of game . Are there any possibilities for exchange in this situation ? Superficially , it might be answered  | that there are none , and that both will continue in isolation . Actually , it pays for Crusoe to specialize in that line of production in which he has the greatest relative superiority in production , and to exchange this product for the product in which Jackson specializes . It is clear that the inferior producer benefits by receiving some of the products of the superior one . The latter benefits also , however , by being free to devote himself to that product in which his productive superiority is the greatest . Thus , if Crusoe has a great superiority in berry production and a small one in game production , it will still benefit him to devote his full working time to berry production and then exchange some berries for Jackson 's game products . In an example mentioned by Professor Boulding : A doctor who is an excellent gardener may very well prefer to employ a hired man who as a gardener is inferior to himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice . This important principle ? that exchange may beneficially take place even when one party is superior in both lines of production ? is known as the law of association , the law of comparative costs , or the law of comparative advantage . With all-pervasive variation offering possibilities for specialization , and favorable conditions of exchange occurring even when one party is superior in both pursuits , great opportunities abound for widespread division of labor and extension of the market . As more and more people are linked together in the exchange network , the more " extended " is the market for each of the products , and the more will exchange-value predominate , as compared to direct use-value , in the decisions of the producer . Thus , suppose that there are five people on the desert island , and each specializes in that line of product in which he has a comparative or absolute advantage . Suppose that each one concentrates on the following products :  | With more people participating in the market process , the opportunities for exchange for each actor are now greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exchange takes place between just two people and involves two goods . Thus , as shown in Fig. 7 , the following network of exchange may take place : Exchange-value now takes a far more dominant place in the decisions of the producers . Crusoe ( if A is Crusoe ) now knows that if he specializes in berries , he does not now have to rely solely on Jackson to accept them , but can exchange them for the products of several other people . A sudden loss of taste for berries by Jackson will not impoverish Crusoe and deprive him of all other necessities as it would have before . Furthermore , berries will now bring to Crusoe a wider variety of products , each in far greater abundance than before , some being available now that would not have been earlier . The greater productivity and the wider market and emphasis on exchange-value obtain for all participants in the market . It is evident , as will be explained further in later sections on indirect exchange , that the contractual society of the market is a genuinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he is best fitted , and each serves his fellow men in order to serve himself in exchange . Each person , by producing for exchange , co-operates with his fellow men voluntarily and without coercion . In contrast to the hegemonic form of society , in which one person or one group of persons exploits the others , a con- tractual society leaves each person free to benefit himself in the market and as a consequence to benefit others as well . An interesting aspect of this praxeological truth is that this benefit to others occurs regardless of the motives of those involved in exchange . Thus , Jackson may specialize in hunting and exchange the game for other products even though he may be indifferent to , or even cordially detest , his fellow participants . Yet regardless of his motives , the other participants are benefited by his actions as an indirect but necessary consequence of his own benefit . It is this almost marvelous process , whereby a man in pursuing his own benefit also benefits others , that caused Adam Smith to exclaim that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proceedings . Thus , in explaining the origins of society , there is no need to conjure up any mystic communion or " sense of belonging " among individuals . Individuals recognize , through the use of reason , the advantages of exchange resulting from the higher productivity of the division of labor , and they proceed to follow this advantageous course . In fact , it is far more likely that feelings of friendship and communion are the effects of a regime of ( contractual ) social co-operation rather than the cause . Suppose , for example , that the division of labor were not productive , or that men had failed to recognize its productivity . In that case , there would be little or no opportunity for exchange , and each man would try to obtain his goods in autistic independence . The result would undoubtedly be a fierce struggle to gain possession of the scarce goods , since , in such a world , each man 's gain of useful goods would be some other man 's loss . It would be almost inevitable for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetual war . Since each man could gain from his fellows only at their expense , violence would be prevalent , and it seems highly likely that feelings of mutual hostility would be dominant . As in the case of animals quarreling over bones , such a warring world could cause only hatred and hostility between man and man . Life would be a bitter " struggle for survival . " On the other hand , in a world of voluntary social co-operation through mutually beneficial exchanges , where one man 's gain is another man 's  | gain , it is obvious that great scope is provided for the development of social sympathy and human friendships . It is the peaceful , co-operative society that creates favorable conditions for feelings of friendship among men . The mutual benefits yielded by exchange provide a major incentive ( as in the case of Crusoe above ) to would-be aggressors ( initiators of violent action against others ) to restrain their aggression and co-operate peacefully with their fellows . Individuals then decide that the advantages of engaging in specialization and exchange outweigh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market society formed by the division of labor is its permanence . The wants of men are renewed for each period of time , and so they must try to obtain for themselves anew a supply of goods for each period . Crusoe wants to have a steady rate of supply of game , and Jackson would like to have a continuing supply of berries , etc . Therefore , the social relations formed by the division of labor tend to be permanent as individuals specialize in different tasks and continue to produce in those fields . There is one , less important , type of exchange that does not involve the division of labor . This is an exchange of the same types of labor for certain tasks . Thus , suppose that Crusoe , Jackson , and Smith are trying to clear their fields of logs . If each one engaged solely in the work of clearing his own field , it would take a long period of time . However , if each put in some time in a joint effort to roll the other fellow 's logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased . Each man could finish the task in a shorter period of time . This is particularly true for operations such as rolling heavy logs , which each man alone could not possibly accomplish at all and which they could perform only by agreed-upon joint action . In these cases , each man gives up his own labor in someone else 's field in exchange for receiving the labor of the others in his field , the latter being worth more to him . Such an exchange involves a combination of the same type of labor , rather than a division of labor into different types , to perform tasks beyond the ready capacity of an isolated individual . This type of co-operative " log-rolling , "  | however , would entail merely temporary alliances based on specific tasks , and , would not , as do specialization and division of labor , establish permanent exchange-ties and social relations . The great scope of the division of labor is not restricted to situations in which each individual makes all of one particular product , as was the case above . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different stages of production necessary to produce a particular consumers ' good . Thus , with a wider market permitting , different individuals specialize in the different stages , for example , involved in the production of the ham sandwich discussed in the previous chapter . General productivity is greatly increased as some people and some areas specialize in producing iron ore , some in producing different types of machines , some in baking bread , some in packaging meat , some in retailing , etc . The essence of developed market economies consists in the framework of co-operative exchange emerging with such specialization . Before analyzing the problem of the terms of exchange , it is well to recall the reason for exchange ? the fact that each individual values more highly the good he gets than the good he gives up . This fact is enough to elminate the fallacious notion that , if Crusoe and Jackson exchange five thousand berries for one cow , there is some sort of " equality of value " between the cow and the five thousand berries . Value exists in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange precisely because for each of them there is an inequality of values between the cow and the berries . For Crusoe the cow is valued more than the five thousand berries ; for Jackson it is valued less . Otherwise , the exchange could not be made . Therefore , for each exchange there is a double inequality of values , rather than an equality , and hence there are no " equal values " to be " measured " in any way.21 We have already seen what conditions are needed for exchange to occur and the extent to which exchange will take place on  | given terms . The question then arises : Are there any principles that decide the terms on which exchanges are made ? Why does Crusoe exchange with Jackson at a rate of five thousand berries for one cow ; or two thousand berries for one cow ? Let us take the hypothetical exchange of 5,000 berries for 1 cow . These are the terms , or the rate of exchange ( 5,000 berries for 1 cow ) . If we express one commodity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commodity . Thus , the price of one good in terms of another is the amount of the other good divided by the amount of the first good in exchange . If 2 cows exchange for 1,000 berries , then the price of cows in terms of berries ( " the berry-price of cows " ) is 500 berries per cow . Conversely , the price of berries in terms of cows ( " the cow-price of berries " ) is 1/60o cow per berry . The price is the rate of exchange between two commodities expressed in terms of one of the commodities . Other useful concepts in the analysis of exchange are those of " selling " and " buying . " Thus , in the above exchange , we may say that , Crusoe sold a thousand berries and bought two cows in exchange . On the other hand , Jackson sold two cows and bought a thousand berries . The sale is the good given up in exchange , while the purchase is the good received . Let us again focus attention on the object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all action is to maximize psychic revenue , and to do this the actor tries to see to it that the psychic revenue from the action exceeds the psychic cost , so that he obtains a psychic profit . This is no less true of interpersonal exchange . The object in such an exchange for each party is to maximize revenue , to exchange so long as the expected psychic revenue exceeds the psychic cost . The psychic revenue from any exchange is the value of the goods received in the exchange . This is equal to the marginal utility to the purchaser of adding the goods to his stock . More complicated is the problem of the psychic costs of an exchange . Psychic costs include all that the actor gives up by making the exchange . This is equal to the next best use that he could have made of the resources that he has used . Suppose , for example , that Jackson possesses five cows and is  | considering whether or not to sell one cow in exchange . He decides on his value scale that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses of the cow : 1 . 5,000 berries offered by Crusoe 2. 100 bbls. of fish offered by Smith 3. 4,000 berries offered by Jones 4 . Marginal utility of the cow in direct use . In this case , the top three alternatives involve the exchange-value of the cow , and the fourth its value in direct use . Jackson will make the best use of his resource by making the exchange with Crusoe . The 5,000 berries of Crusoe will be his psychic revenue from the exchange , while the loss of the 100 barrels of fish constitutes his psychic cost . We saw above that , in order for exchange to take place , the marginal utility of the goods received must be greater than the marginal utility of the goods given up . We now see that for any specific exchange to occur , the marginal utility of the goods received must also be greater than the marginal utility forgone ? that which could have been received in another type of exchange . It is evident that Jackson will always prefer an offer of more units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units of the same good . In other words , the seller will always prefer the highest possible selling price for his good . Jackson will prefer the price of 5,000 berries per cow offered by Crusoe to the price of 4,000 berries per cow offered by Jones . It might be objected that this may not always he true and may be offset by other factors . Thus , the prospect of 4,000 berries from Jones may be evaluated higher than the prospect of 5,000 berries from Crusoe , if : ( a ) the psychic disutility of labor and time , etc. , for delivery over a longer distance to the latter renders the prospect of sale to Crusoe less attractive despite the higher price in berries ; or ( b ) special feelings of friendship for Crusoe or hatred for Jones serve to change the utilities on Jackson 's value scale . On further analysis , however , these turn out not to be vitiating factors at all . The rule that the actor will prefer the highest selling price for his good in terms of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good  | is not defined by its physical characteristics , but by the equal serviceability of its units to the actor . Now , clearly , a berry from a longer distance , since it must call forth the disutility of labor to move it , is not the same good as the berry from a shorter distance , even though it is physically the same berry . The very fact that the first is further away means that it is not as serviceable as the other berry , and hence not the same good . For one " price " to be comparable with another , the good must be the same . Thus , if Jackson prefers to sell his cow for 4,000 berries from Jones as compared to 5,000 berries from Crusoe , it does not mean that he chooses a lower price for his product in terms of the same good ( berries ) , but that he chooses a price in terms of one good ( berries from Jones ) over a price in terms of an entirely different good ( berries from Crusoe ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility , receiving berries from Crusoe takes on a different quality from that of receiving berries from Jones , the two packets of berries are no longer of equal serviceability to Jackson , and therefore they become for him two different goods . If these feelings cause him to sell to Jones for 4,000 berries rather than to Crusoe for 5,000 berries , this does not mean that he chooses a lower price for the same good ; he chooses between two different goods ? berries from Crusoe and berries from Jones . Thus , at all times , an actor will sell his product at the highest possible price in terms of the good received . Clearly , the converse is true for the buyer . The buyer will always purchase his good at the lowest possible price . This truth can be traced in the example just discussed , since , at the point that Jackson was a seller of the cow , he was also a buyer of the berries . Where the good in question ? berries ? was comparable , he bought at the lowest possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/4,000 cow per berry . In cases where Jackson chooses the latter price , the two berries are no longer the same , but different , goods . If , to buy berries , the purchaser has to range further afield or buy from someone he dislikes , then this good becomes a different one in kind from the good closer by or sold by a friend .  | One of the most important problems in economic analysis is the question : What principles determine the formation of prices on the free market ? What can be said by logical derivation from the fundamental assumption of human action in order to explain the determination of all prices in interpersonal exchanges , past , present , and future ? It is most convenient to begin with a case of isolated exchange , a case where only two isolated parties are involved in the exchange of two goods . For example , Johnson and Smith are considering a possible exchange of a horse of the former for some barrels of fish possessed by the latter . The question is : What can economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two goods in the exchange ? An individual will decide whether or not to make an exchange on the basis of the relative positions of the two goods on his value scale . Thus , suppose the value scale of Smith , the possessor of the fish , is as follows : ( Any desired numbers of rank could be assigned to the various quantities , but these are not necessary here . ) It is clear that Smith would be willing to acquire a horse from Johnson if he could give up 100 barrels of fish or less . 100 barrels or less are less valuable to Smith than the horse . On the other hand , 101 or more barrels of fish are more valuable to him than the horse . Thus , if the price of the horse in terms of the fish offered by Smith is 100 barrels or less , then Smith will make the  | exchange . If the price is 101 barrels or more , then the exchange will not be made . Suppose Johnson 's value scale looks like this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 102 barrels of fish . If the price offered for his horse is less than 102 barrels of fish , he will not make the exchange . Here , it is clear that no exchange will be made ; for at Johnson 's minimum selling price of 102 barrels of fish , it is more beneficial for Smith to keep the fish than to acquire the horse . In order for an exchange to be made , then , the minimum sell . ing price of the seller must be lower than the maximum buying price of the buyer for that good . In this case , it must be lower than the price of 100 barrels of fish per horse . Suppose that this condition is met , and Johnson 's value scale is as follows : Johnson will sell the horse for any amount of fish at or above 81 barrels . This , then , is his minimum selling price for the horse . With this as Johnson 's value scale , and Smith 's as pictured above , what price will they agree upon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish ) ? All analysis can say about this problem is that , since the exchange must be for the mutual benefit of both parties , the price of the good in isolated exchange will be established somewhere between the maximum buying price and the minimum selling price , i.e. , the price of the horse will be somewhere between 100 and 81 barrels of fish . ( Similarly , the price of the fish will be set somewhere between 1/sl and 1/loo of a horse per barrel . ) We can not say at which point the price will be set . That depends on the data of each particular case , on the specific conditions prevailing . In particular , it will depend upon the bargaining skill of the two individuals . Clearly , Johnson will try to set the price of the horse as high as possible , while Smith will try to set the price as low as possible . This is based on the principle that the seller of the product tries to obtain the highest price , while the buyer tries to secure the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two will agree on , except that it will be somewhere in this range set by the two points . Now , let us gradually remove our assumption of isolated exchange . Let us first assume that Smith has a competitor , Brown , a rival in offering fish for the desired horse of Johnson 's . We assume that the fish offered by Brown is of identical serviceability to Johnson as the fish offered by Smith . Suppose that Smith 's value scale is the same as before , but that Brown 's value scale is such that the horse is worth more than 90 barrels of fish to him , but less than 91 barrels . The value scales of the three individuals will then appear as follows : Brown and Smith are competing for the purchase of Johnson 's horse . Clearly , only one of them can make the exchange for the  | horse , and since their goods are identical to Johnson , the latter 's decision to exchange will be decided by the price offered for the horse . Obviously , Johnson will make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . Their value scales are such that Smith and Brown can continue to overbid each other as long as the price range is between 81 and 90 barrels of fish per horse . Thus , if Smith offers Johnson an exchange at 82 barrels per horse , Brown can compete by raising the bid to 84 barrels of fish per horse , etc . This can continue , however , only until Brown 's maximum buying price has been exceeded . If Smith offers 91 barrels for the horse , it no longer pays for Brown to make the exchange , and he drops out of the competition . Thus . the price in the exchange will be high enough to exclude the " less capable " or " less urgent " buyer ? the one whose value scale does not permit him to offer as high a price as the other , " more capable , " buyer . We do not know exactly what the price will be , but we do know that it will be set by bargaining somewhere at or below the maximum buying price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of the next most capable buyer . It will be somewhere between 100 barrels and 91 barrels , and the exchange will be made with Smith . We see that the addition of another competing buyer for the product considerably narrows the zone of bargaining in determining the price that will be set . This analysis can easily be extended to a case of one seller and n number of buyers ( each offering the same commodity in exchange ) . Thus , suppose that there are five potential buyers for the horse , all offering fish , whose value scales are as follows : With only one horse to be disposed of to one buyer , the buyers overbid each other until each must drop out of the competition .  | Finally , Smith can outbid A , his next most capable competitor , only with a price of 100 . We see that in this case , the price in the exchange is uniquely determined ? once the various value scales are given ? at 100 , since at a lower price A is still in the bidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be willing to conclude the exchange . At any rate , even if the value scales are not such as to determine the price uniquely , the addition of more competitors greatly narrows the bargaining zone . The general rule still holds : The price will be between the maximum buying price of the most capable and that of the next most capable competitor , including the former and excluding the latter . It is also evident that the narrowing of the bargaining zone has taken place in an upward direction , and to the advantage of the seller of the product . The case of one-sided competition of many sellers with just one buyer is the direct converse of the above and may be considered by merely reversing the example and considering the price of the fish instead of the price of the horse . As more sellers of the fish competed to conclude the exchange with the one buyer , the zone of determination of the price of fish narrowed , although this time in a downward direction and to the further advantage of the buyer . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival ? to offer a lower price for the product than his competitors . The sellers continued to underbid each other until all but the one seller were excluded from the market . In a case of many sellers and one buyer , the price will be set at a point between the minimum selling price of the second most capable and that of the most capable competitor ? strictly , at a point below the former and down to or including the latter . In the final example above , the point was pushed down to be uniquely determined at the latter point-11 oo horse per barrel . We have so far considered the cases of one buyer and more than one seller , and of one seller and more than one buyer . We now come to the only case with great importance in a modern , complex economy based on an intricate network of exchanges : two-sided competition of buyers and sellers . Let us therefore consider a market with any number of competing buyers and sellers .  | Any product could be considered , but our hypothetical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange for fish ( with the horses as well as the fish considered by all parties as homogeneous units of the same good ) . The following is a list of the maximum buying prices of the various buyers , based on the valuations on their respective value scales : The " most capable buyer " of fish we recognize as Smith , with a buying price of 100 barrels . Johnson is the " most capable seller " ? the seller with the lowest minimum selling price ? at 81 barrels . The problem is to find the princif. ' e by which the price , or prices , of the exchanges of horses will be determined . Now , let us first take the case of X1-Smith . It is clear that it is to the advantage of Smith to make the exchange at a price of 100 barrels for the horse . Yet it is to Smith 's greater advantage to buy the good at the lowest possible price . He is not engaged in over .  | bidding his competitors merely for the sake of overbidding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price that he can . Therefore , Smith will prefer to begin bidding for a horse at the lowest prices offered by his competitors , and only raise the offered price if it becomes necessary to do so in order to avoid being shut out of the market . Similarly , Johnson would make an advantageous sale at a price of 81 barrels . However , he is interested in selling his product at the highest possible price . He will underbid his competitor only if it becomes necessary to do so in order to avoid being shut out of the market without making a sale . It is evident that buyers will tend to start negotiations by offering as low prices as possible , while sellers will tend to start by asking for as high a price as they think they can obtain . Clearly , this preliminary " testing of the market " will tend to be more prolonged in a " new " market , where conditions are unfamiliar , while it will tend to be less prolonged in an " old " market , where the participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past and can estimate more closely what the results will be . Let us suppose that buyers begin by offering the low price of 82 barrels for a horse . Here is a price at which each of the buyers would be glad to make a purchase , but only one seller , Z1 , would be willing to sell at 82 . It is possible that Z1 , through ignorance , might conclude the exchange with some one of the buyers at 82 , without realizing that he could have obtained a higher price . It is also possible that the other buyers will , through ignorance , permit the buyer to get away with this windfall without overbidding him for this cheap horse . But such a result is not very likely . It seems most likely that Z1 will not sell at such a low price , and that the buyers would immediately overbid any attempt by one of their number to conclude an exchange at that price . Even if , by some chance , one exchange was concluded at 82 , it is obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other seller would make an exchange at that price , the price of further exchanges would have to rise further , as a result of upbidding by buyers . Let us assume at this point that no exchange will be made at this price because of the further upbidding of the buyers and  | the knowledge of this by the sellers . As the offering price rises , the least capable buyers , as in the previous case , begin to be excluded from the market . A price of 84 will bring two sellers into the market , but will exclude X9 from the buyer 's side . As the offering price rises , the disproportion between the amount offered for sale and the amount demanded for purchase at the given price diminishes , but as long as the latter is greater than the former , mutual overbidding of buyers will continue to raise the price . The amount offered for sale at each price is called the supply ; the amount demanded for purchase at each price is called the demand . Evidently , at the first price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ; the demand for horses on the market is 9 . Only one seller would be willing to sell at this price , while all nine buyers would be willing to make their purchase . On the basis of the above tabulations of maximum buying prices and minimum selling prices , we are able to present a list of the quantities of the good that will be demanded and supplied at each hypothetical price . This table reflects the progressive entry into the market of the sellers as the price increases and the dropping out of the buyers as the price increases . As was seen above , as long as the demand  | exceeds the supply at any price , buyers will continue to overbid and the price will continue to rise . The converse occurs if the price begins near its highest point . Thus , if sellers first demand a price of 101 barrels for the horse , there will be eight eager sellers and no buyers . At a price of 99 , the sellers may find one eager buyer , but chances are that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is no point in paying such a high price , and the other sellers will eagerly underbid the one who tries to make the sale at the price of 99 . Thus , when the price is so high that the supply exceeds the demand at that price , underbidding of suppliers will drive the price downwards . As the tentative price falls , more sellers are excluded from the market , and more buyers enter it . If the overbidding of buyers will drive the price up whenever the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied , and the underbidding of sellers drives the price down whenever supply is greater than demand , it is evident that the price of the good will find a resting point where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied , i.e. , where supply equals demand . At this price and at this price only , the market is cleared , i.e. , there is no incentive for buyers to bid prices up further or for sellers to bid prices down . In our example , this final , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price , five horses will be sold to five buyers . This equilibrium price is the price at which the good will tend to be set and sales to be made . Specifically , the sales will be made to the five most capable buyers at that price : X1 , X2 , X3 , X4 and X5 . The other less capable ( or less urgent ) buyers are excluded from the market , because their value scales do not permit them to buy horses at that price . Similarly , sellers Z1 ? Z5 are the ones that make the sale at 89 ; the other sellers are excluded from the market , because their value scales do not permit them to be in the market at that price . In this horse-and-fish market , Z5 is the least capable of the sellers who have been able to stay in the market . Z5 , whose minimum selling price is 89 , is just able to make his sale at 89 . He is  | the marginal seller ? the seller at the margin , the one who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , X5 is the least capable of the buyers who have been able to stay in the market . He is the marginal buyer ? the one who would be excluded by a slight rise in price . Since it would be foolish for the other buyers to pay more than they must to obtain their supply , they will also pay the same price as the marginal buyer , i.e. , 89 . Similarly , the other sellers will not sell for less than they could obtain ; they will sell at the price permitting the marginal seller to stay in the market . Evidently , the more capable or " more urgent " buyers ( and sellers ) ? the supramargenal ( which includes the marginal ) ? obtain a psychic surplus in this exchange , for they are better off than they would have been if the price had been higher ( or lower ) . However , since goods can be ranked only on each individual 's value scale , and no measurement of psychic gain can be made either for one individual or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this psychic gain except that it exists . ( We can not even make the statement , for example , that the psychic gain in exchange obtained by X1 is greater than that of X5 . ) The excluded buyers and sellers are termed submarginal . The specific feature of the " clearing of the market " performed by the equilibrium price is that , at this price alone , all those buyers and sellers who are willing to make exchanges can do so . At this price five sellers with horses find five buyers for the horses ; all who wish to buy and sell at this price can do so . At any other price , there are either frustrated buyers or frustrated sellers . Thus , at a price of 84 , eight people would like to buy at this price , but only two horses are available . At this price , there is a great amount of " unsatisfied demand " or excess demand . Conversely , at a price of , say , 95 , there are seven sellers eager to supply horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this price , there is " unsatisfied supply , " or excess supply . Other terms for excess demand and excess supply are " shortage " and " surplus " of the good . Aside from the universal fact of the scarcity of all goods , a price that is below the equilibrium price creates an additional shortage of supply for demanders , while a price above equilib- rium creates a surplus of goods for sale as compared to demands for purchase . We see that the market process always tends to eliminate such shortages and surpluses and establishes a price where demanders can find a supply , and suppliers a demand . It is important to realize that this process of overbidding of buyers and underbidding of sellers always takes place in the market , even if the surface aspects of the specific case make it appear that only the sellers ( or buyers ) are setting the price . Thus , a good might be sold in retail shops , with prices simply " quoted " by the individual seller . But the same process of bidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the sellers set their prices below the equilibrium price , buyers will rush to make their purchases , and the sellers will find that shortages develop , accompanied by queues of buyers eager to purchase goods that are unavailable . Realizing that they could obtain higher prices for their goods , the sellers raise their quoted prices accordingly . On the other hand , if they set their prices above the equilibrium price , surpluses of unsold stocks will appear , and they will have to lower their prices in order to " move " their accumulation of unwanted stocks and to clear the market . The case where buyers quote prices and therefore appear to set them is similar . If the buyers quote prices below the equilibrium price , they will find that they can not satisfy all their demands at that price . As a result , they will have to raise their quoted prices . On the other hand , if the buyers set the prices too high , they will find a stampede of sellers with unsalable stocks and will take advantage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , regardless of the form of the market , the result of the market process is always to tend toward the establishment of the equilibrium price via the mutual bidding of buyers and sellers . It is evident that , if we eliminate the assumption that no preliminary sales were made before the equilibrium price was established , this does not change the results of the analysis . Even if , through ignorance and error , a sale was made at a price of 81 or 99 , these prices will still be ephemeral and temporary , and the final price for the good will tend to be the equilibrium price .  | Once the market price is established , it is clear that one price must rule over the entire market . This has already been implied by the fact that all buyers and sellers will tend to exchange at the same price as their marginal competitors . There will always be a tendency on the market to establish one and only one price at any time for a good . Thus , suppose that the market price has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to induce a buyer to buy at 92 . It is evident that no buyer will buy at 92 when he knows that he can buy on the regular market at 89 . Similarly , no seller will be willing to sell at a price below the market if he knows that he can readily make his sale at 89 . If for example , an ignorant seller sells a horse at 87 , the buyer is likely to enter the market as a seller to sell the horse at 89 . Such drives for arbitrage gains ( buying and selling to take advantage of discrepancies in the price of a good ) act quickly to establish one price for one good over the entire market . Such market prices will tend to change only when changing supply and demand conditions alter the equilibrium price and establish a condition of excess supply or excess demand where before the market had been cleared . A clearer picture of equilibrium prices as determined by supply and demand conditions will be derived from the graphical representation in Fig. 13 . It is evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher minimum selling prices are brought into the market , while demanders with low maximum buying prices will begin to drop out . Therefore , as the price decreases , the quantity demanded must always either remain the same or increase , never decrease . Similarly , as the price decreases , the amount offered in supply must always decrease or remain the same , never increase . Therefore , the demand curve must always be vertical or rightwardsloping as the price decreases , while the supply curve must always be vertical or leftward-sloping as the price decreases . The curves will intersect at the equilibrium price , where supply and demand are equal . Clearly , once the zone of intersection of the supply and de mand curves has been determined , it is the buyers and sellers at  | the margin ? in the area of the equilibrium point ? that determine what the equilibrium price and the quantity exchanged will be . The tabulation of supply offered at any given price is known as the supply schedule , while its graphical presentation , with the points connected here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply curve . Similarly , the tabulation of demand is the demand schedule , and its graphical representation the demand curve , for each product and market . Given the point of intersection , the demand and supply curves above and below that point could take many conceivable shapes without affecting the equilibrium price . The direct determinants of the price are therefore the marginal buyers and sellers , while the valuations of the supramarginal people are important in determining which buyers and sellers will be at the margin . The valuations of the excluded buyers and sellers far beyond the margin have no direct influence on the price and will become important only if a change in the  | market demand and supply schedules brings them near the intersection point . Thus , given the intersection point , the pattern of supply and demand curves ( represented by the solid and dotted lines ) could be at least any one of the variants shown in Fig. 14 . Up to this point we have assumed , for the sake of simplicity and clarity , that each demander , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good the price of which we have been concentrating on ? the horse . Now we can remove this restriction and complete our analysis of the real world of exchange by permitting suppliers and demanders to exchange any number of horses that they may desire . It will be seen immediately that the removal of our implicit restriction makes no substantial change in the analysis . Thus , let us revert to the case of Johnson , whose minimum selling price for a horse was 81 barrels of fish . Let us now assume that Johnson has a stock of several horses . He is willing to sell one horse ? the first ? for a minimum price of 81 barrels , since on his value scale , he places the horse between 81 and 80 barrels of fish . What will be Johnson 's minimum selling price to part with his second horse ? We have seen earlier in this chapter that , according to the law of marginal utility , as a man 's stock of goods declines , the value placed on each unit remaining increases ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the marginal utility of each unit declines . Therefore , the marginal utility of the second horse ( or , strictly , of each horse after the first horse is gone ) , will be greater than the marginal utility of the first horse . This win be true even though each horse is capable of the same service as every other . Similarly , the value of parting with a third horse will be still greater . On the other hand , while the marginal utility placed on each horse given  | up increases , the marginal utility of the additional fish acquired in exchange will decline . The result of these two factors is inevitably to raise the minimum selling price for each successive horse sold . Thus , suppose the minimum selling price for the first horse is 81 barrels of fish . When it comes to the second exchange , the value forgone of the second horse will be greater , and the value of the same barrels in exchange will decline . As a result , the minimum selling price below which Johnson will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , as the seller 's stock dwindles , his minimum selling price increases . Johnson 's value scale may appear as follows : On the basis of this value scale , Johnson 's own individual supply schedule can be constructed . He will supply 0 horses up to a price of 80 , 1 horse at a price between 81 and 87 , 2 horses with the price between 88 and 94 , 3 horses at a price of 95 to 98 , and 4 horses at a price of 99 and above . The same can be done for each  | seller in the market . ( Where the seller has only one horse to sell , the supply schedule is constructed as before . ) It is clear that a market-supply schedule can be constructed simply by adding the supplies that will be offered by the various individual sellers in the market at any given price . The essentials of the foregoing analysis of market supply remain unchanged . Thus , the effect of constructing the marketsupply schedule in this case is the same as if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each with minimum selling prices of 81 , 88 , 95 , and 99 . The fact that it is one man that is supplying the new units rather than different men does not change the results of the analysis . What it does is to reinforce the rule that the supply curve must always be vertical or rightward-sloping as the price increases , i.e. , that the supply must always remain unchanged or increase with an increase in price . For , in addition to the fact that new suppliers will be brought into the market with an increase in price , the same supplier will offer more units of the good . Thus , the operation of the law of marginal utility serves to reinforce the rule that the supply can not decrease at higher prices , but must increase or remain the same . The exact converse occurs in the case of demand . Suppose that we allow buyers to purchase any desired number of horses . We remember that Smith 's maximum buying price for the first horse was 100 barrels of fish . If he considers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional horse will be less than the utility of the first one , and the marginal utility of the same amount of fish that he would have to give up will increase . If the marginal utility of the purchases declines as more are made , and the marginal utility of the good given up increases , these factors result in lower maximum buying prices for each successive horse bought . Thus , Smith 's value scale might appear as in Fig. 16 . Such individual demand schedules can be made for each buyer on the market , and they can be added to form a resultant demand curve for all buyers on the market . It is evident that , here again , there is no change in the essence of the market-demand curve . Smith 's individual demand curve ,  | with maximum buying prices as above , is analytically equivalent to four buyers with maximum buying prices of 83 , 89 , 94 , and 100 , respectively . The effect of allowing more than one unit to be demanded by each buyer brings in the law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve is rightward-sloping as the price decreases , i.e. , that the demand must either increase or remain unchanged as the price decreases . For , added to the fact that lower prices bring in previously excluded buyers , each individual will tend to demand more as the price declines , since the maximum buying prices will be lower with the purchase of more units , in accordance with the law of marginal utility . Let us now sum up the factors determining prices in interpersonal exchange . One price will tend to be established for each good on the market , and that price will tend to be the equilib- rium price , determined by the intersection of the market supply and demand schedules . Those making the exchanges at this price will be the supramarginal and marginal buyers and sellers , while the less capable , or submarginal , will be excluded from the sale , because their value scales do not permit them to make an exchange . Their maximum buying prices are too low , or their minimum selling prices too high . The market supply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maximum buying prices of all the individuals in the market . The latter , in turn , are determined by the placing of the units to be bought and sold on the individuals ' value scales , these rankings being influenced by the law of marginal utility . In addition to the law of marginal utility , there is another factor influencing the rankings on each individual 's value scale . It is obvious that the amount that Johnson will supply at any price is limited by the stock of goods that he has available . Thus , Johnson may be willing to supply a fourth horse at a price of 99 , but if this exhausts his available stock of horses , no higher price will be able to call forth a larger supply from Johnson . At least this is true as long as Johnson has no further stock available to sell . Thus , at any given time , the total stock of the good available puts a maximum limit on the amount of the good that can be supplied in the market . Conversely , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit on the total of the sale good that any one individual , or the market , can demand . At the same time that the market supply and demand schedules are setting the equilibrium price , they are also clearly setting the equilibrium quantity of both goods that will be exchanged . In our previous example , the equilibrium quantities exchanged are 5 horses , and 5 x 89 , or 445 fish , for the aggregate of the market . The demand schedule tells us how many units of the purchase good will be bought at each hypothetical price . From this  | schedule we may easily find the total number of units of the sale good that will be expended at each price . Thus , from Table 2 , we find that at a price of 95 , three horses will be demanded . If three horses are demanded at a price of 95 barrels of fish , then the total number of units of the sale good that will be offered in exchange will be 3 X 95 , or 285 barrels of fish . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good that will be offered on the market at that price . The total outlay of the sale good at each hypothetical price is shown in Table 3.  | Fig. 17 is a graphic presentation of the total outlay curve . It is evident that this is a logical derivation from the demand curve and that therefore it too is a curve of outlay by buyers at each hypothetical price . A striking feature of the total outlay curve is that , in contrast to the other curves ( such as the demand curve ) , it can slope in either direction as the price increases or decreases . The possibility of a slope in either direction stems from the operation of the two factors determining the position of the curve . Outlay = Price X Quantity Demanded ( of purchase good ) . But we know that as the price decreases , the demand must either increase or remain the same . Therefore , a decrease in price tends to be counteracted by an increase in quantity , and , as a result , the total outlay of the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For any two prices , we may compare the total outlay of the sale good that will be expended by buyers . If the lower price yields a greater total outlay than the higher price , the total outlay curve is defined as being elastic over that range . If the lower price yields a lower total outlay than the higher price , then the  | curve is inelastic over that range . Alternatively , we may say that the former case is that of an elasticity greater than unity , the latter of an elasticity less than unity , and the case where the total outlay is the same for the two prices is one of unit elasticity , or elasticity equal to 1 . Since numerical precision in the concept of elasticity is not important , we may simply use the terms " inelastic , " " elastic , " and ( for the last case ) " neutral . " Some examples will clarify these concepts . Thus , suppose that we examine the total outlay schedule at prices of 96 and 95 . At 96 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is 285 barrels . The outlay is greater at the lower price , and hence the outlay schedule is elastic in this range . On the other hand , let us take the prices 95 and 94 . At 94 , the outlay is 282 . Consequently , the schedule here is inelastic . It is evident that there is a simple geometrical device for deciding whether or not the demand curve is elastic or inelastic between two hypothetical prices : if the outlay curve is further to the right at the lower price , the demand curve is elastic ; if further to the left , the latter is inelastic . There is no reason why the concept of elasticity must be confined to two prices next to each other . Any two prices on the schedule may be compared . It is evident that an examination of the entire outlay curve demonstrates that the foregoing demand curve is basically elastic . It is elastic over most of its range , with the exception of a few small gaps . If we compare any two rather widely spaced prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher price . If the price is high enough , the demand for any good will dwindle to zero , and therefore the outlay will dwindle to zero . Of particular interest is the elasticity of the demand curve at the equilibrium price . Going up a step to the price of 90 , the curve is clearly elastic ? total outlay is less at the higher price . Going down a step to 88 , the curve is also elastic . This particular demand curve is elastic in the neighborhood of the equilibrium price . Other demand curves , of course , could possibly be inelastic at their equilibrium price . Contrary to what might be thought at first , the concept of " elasticity of supply " is not a meaningful one , as is " elasticity  | of demand . " If we multiply the quantity supplied at each price by the price , we shall obtain the number of barrels of fish ( the sale good ) which the sellers will demand in exchange . It will easily be seen , however , that this quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At 82 it is 82 , at 84 it is 168 , at 88 it is 352 , etc . The reason is that its other determinant , quantity supplied , changes in the same direction as the price , not in the inverse direction as does quantity demanded . As a result , supply is always " elastic , " and the concept is an uninteresting one.27 7 . Speculation and Supply and Demand Schedules We have seen that market price is , in the final analysis , determined by the intersection of the supply and demand schedules . It is now in order to consider further the determinants of these particular schedules . Can we establish any other conclusions concerning the causes of the shape and position of the supply and demand schedules themselves ? We remember that , at any given price , the amount of a good that an individual will buy or sell is determined by the position of the sale good and the purchase good on his value scale . He will demand a good if the marginal utility of adding a unit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sale good that he must give up . On the other hand , another individual will be a seller if his valuations of the units are in a reverse order . We have seen that , on this basis , and reinforced by the law of marginal utility , the market demand curve will never decrease when the price is lowered , and the supply curve will never increase when the price decreases . Let us further analyze the value scales of the buyers and sellers . We have seen above that the two sources of value that a good may have are direct use-value and exchange-value , and that the higher value is the determinant for the actor . An individual , therefore , can demand a horse in exchange for one of two reasons : its direct use-value to him or , the value that he believes it will be able to command in exchange . If the former , then he  | will be a consumer of the horse 's services ; if the latter , then he purchases in order to make a more advantageous exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the existing market price has not reached equilibrium ? that it is now at 85 barrels per horse . Many demanders may realize that this price is below the equilibrium and that therefore they can attain an arbitrage profit by buying at 85 and reselling at the final , higher price . We are now in a position to refine the analysis in the foregoing section , which did not probe the question whether or not sales took place before the equilibrium price was reached . We now assume explicitly that the demand schedule shown in Table 2 referred to demand for direct use by consumers . Smooth- ing out the steps in the demand curve represented in Fig. 13 , we may , for purposes of simplicity and exposition , portray it as in Fig. 18 . This , we may say , is the demand curve for direct use . For this demand curve , then , the approach to equilibrium takes place through actual purchases at the various prices , and then the shortages or the surpluses reveal the overbidding or underbidding , until the equilibrium price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final equilibrium price , however , they will not buy at a higher price ( even though they would have done so if that were the final price ) , but will wait for the price to fall . Similarly , if the price is below the equilibrium price , to the extent that the buyers foresee the final price , they will tend to buy some of the good ( e.g. , horses ) in order to resell at a profit at the final price . Thus , if exchange-value enters the picture , and a good number of buyers act on their anticipations , the demand curve might change as shown in Fig. 19 . The old demand curve , based only on demand for use , is DD , and the new demand curve , including anticipatory forecasting of the equilibrium price , is D 'D ' . It is clear that such anticipations render the demand curve  | far more elastic , since more will be bought at the lower price and less at the higher . Thus , the introduction of exchange-value can restrict demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price , although the final demand ? to consume ? at the equilibrium price will remain the same . Now , let us consider the situation of the seller of the commodity . The supply curve in Fig. 13 treats the amount supplied at any price without considering possible equilibrium price . Thus , we may say that , with such a supply curve , sales will be made en route to the equilibrium price , and shortages or surpluses will finally reveal the path to the final price . On the other hand , suppose that many sellers anticipate the final equilibrium price . Clearly , they will refuse to make sales at a lower price , even though they would have done so if that were the final price . On the other hand , they will sell more above the equilibrium price , since they will be able to make an arbitrage profit by selling their horses above the equilibrium price and buying them back at the equilibrium price . Thus , the supply curve , with such anticipations , may change as shown in Fig. 20 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equilibrium price , from SS to S 'S ' . Let us suppose the highly unlikely event that all demanders and suppliers are able to forecast exactly the final , equilibrium  | price . What would be the pattern of supply and demand curves on the market in such an extreme case ? It would be as follows : At a price above equilibrium ( say 89 ) no one would demand the good , and suppliers would supply their entire stock . At a price below equilibrium , no one would supply the good , and everyone would demand as much as he could purchase , as shown in Fig. 21 . Such unanimously correct forecasts are not likely to take place in human action , but this case points up the fact that , the more this anticipatory , or speculative , element enters into supply and demand , the more quickly will the market price tend toward equilibrium . Obviously , the more the actors anticipate the final price , the further apart will be supply and demand at any price differing from equilibrium , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quickly will the final price be established . Up to now we have assumed that this speculative supply and demand , this anticipating of the equilibrium price , has been correct , and we have seen that these correct anticipations have hastened the establishment of equilibrium . Suppose , however , that most of these expectations are erroneous . Suppose , for example , that the demanders tend to assume that the equilibrium price will be lower than it actually is . Does this change the equilibrium price or obstruct the passage to that price ? Suppose that the demand and supply schedules are as shown in Fig. 22 . Suppose that  | the basic demand curve is DD , but that the demanders anticipate lower equilibrium prices , thus changing and lowering the demand curve to D 'D ' . With the supply curve given at SS , this means that the intersection of the supply and demand schedules will be at Y instead of X , say at 85 instead of 89 . It is clear , however , that this will be only a provisional resting point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 85 , the demanders see that shortages develop at this price , that they would like to buy more than is available , and the overbidding of the demanders raises the price again to the genuine equilibrium price . The same process of revelation of error occurs in the case of errors of anticipation by suppliers , and thus the forces of the market tend inexorably toward the establishment of the genuine equilibrium price , undistorted by speculative errors , which tend to reveal themselves and be eliminated . As soon as suppliers or demanders find that the price that their speculative errors have set is not really an equilibrium and that shortages and/or surpluses develop , their actions tend once again to establish the equilibrium position . The actions of both buyers and sellers on the market may be related to the concepts of psychic revenue , profit , and cost . We remember that the aim of every actor is the highest position of psychic revenue and thus the making of a psychic profit compared to his next best alternative ? his cost . Whether or not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his given resources ? in this case , his fish . His expected revenue in any action will be balanced against his expected cost ? his next best alternative . In this case , the revenue will be either ( a ) the satisfaction of ends from the direct use of the horse or ( b ) expected resale of the horse at a higher price ? whichever has the highest utility to him . His cost will be either ( a ) the marginal utility of the fish given up in direct use or ( b ) ( possibly ) the exchange-value of the fish for some other good or ( c ) the expected future purchase of the horse at a lower price ? whichever has the highest utility . He will buy the horse if the expected revenue is greater ; he will fail to buy if the expected cost is greater . The expected revenue is the marginal utility of the added horse for  | the buyer ; the expected cost is the marginal utility of the fish given up . For either revenue or cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be chosen as the marginal utility of the good . Now let us consider the seller . The seller , as well as the buyer , attempts to maximize his psychic revenue by trying to attain a revenue higher than his psychic cost ? the utility of the next best alternative he will have to forgo in taking his action . The seller will weigh the marginal utility of the added sale-good ( in this case , fish ) against the marginal utility of the purchase-good given up ( the horse ) , in deciding whether or not to make the sale at any particular price . The psychic revenue for the seller will be the higher of the utilities stemming from one of the following sources : ( a ) the value in direct use of the sale-good ( the fish ) or ( b ) the speculative value of re-exchanging the fish for the horse at a lower price in the future . The cost of the seller 's action will be the highest utility forgone among the following alternatives : ( a ) the value in direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speculative value of selling at a higher price in the future or ( c ) the exchange-value of acquiring some other good for the horse . He will sell the horse if the expected revenue is greater ; he will fail to sell if the expected cost is greater . We thus see that the situations of the sellers and the buyers are comparable . Both act or fail to act in accordance with their estimate of the alternative that will yield them the highest utility . It is the position of the utilities on the two sets of value scales ? of the individual buyers and sellers ? that determines the market price and the amount that will be exchanged at that price . In other words , it is , for every good , utility and utility alone that determines the price and the quantity exchanged . Utility and utility alone determines the nature of the supply and demand schedules . It is therefore clearly fallacious to believe , as has been the popular assumption , that utility and " costs " are equally and independently potent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next best alternative that must be forgone in any action , and it is therefore part and parcel of utility on the in- dividual 's value scale . This cost is , of course , always a present consideration of a future event , even if this " future " is a very near one . Thus , the forgone utility in making the purchase might be the direct consumption of fish that the actor might have engaged in within a few hours . Or it might be the possibility of exchanging for a cow , whose utility would be enjoyed over a long period of time . It goes without saying , as has been indicated in the previous chapter , that the present consideration of revenue and of cost in any action is based on the present value of expected future revenues and costs . The point is that both the utilities derived and the utilities forgone in any action refer to some point in the future , even if a very near one , and that past costs play no role in human action , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth will be made clear in later chapters . 8 . Stock and the Total Demand to Hold There is another way of treating supply and demand schedules , which , for some problems of analysis , is more useful than the schedules presented above . At any point on the market , suppliers are engaged in offering some of their stock of the good and withholding their offer of the remainder . Thus , at a price of 86 , suppliers supply three horses on the market and withhold the other five in their stock . This withholding is caused by one of the factors mentioned above as possible costs of the exchange : either the direct use of the good ( say the horse ) has greater utility than the receipt of the fish in direct use ; or else the horse could be exchanged for some other good ; or , finally , the seller expects the final price to be higher , so that he can profitably delay the sale . The amount that sellers will withhold on the market is termed their reservation demand . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for a good in exchange ; this is a demand to hold stock . Thus , the concept of a " demand to hold a stock of goods " will always include both demand-factors ; it will include the demand for the good in exchange by nonpossessors ,  | plus the demand to hold the stock by the possessors . The demand for the good in exchange is also a demand to hold , since , regardless of what the buyer intends to do with the good in the future , he must h ' d the good from the time when it comes into his ownership and possession by means of exchange . We therefore arrive at the concept of a " total demand to hold " for a good , differing from the previous concept of exchange-demand , although including the latter in addition to the reservation demand by the sellers . If we know the total stock of the good in existence ( here , 8 horses ) , we may , by inspecting the supply and demand schedules , arrive at a " total demand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , at a price of 82 , 9 horses are demanded by the buyers , in exchange , and 8 ? 1 = 7 horses are withheld by the sellers , i.e. , demanded to be held by the sellers . Therefore , the total demand to hold horses on the market is 9 + 7 = 16 horses . On the other hand , at the price of 97 , no horses are withheld by sellers , whose reservation demand is therefore 0 , while the demand by buyers is 2 . Total demand to hold at this price is 0 + 2 = 2 horses . Table 4 shows the total demand to hold derived from the sup- ply and demand schedule in Table 2 , along with the total stock , which is , for the moment , considered as fixed . Figure 23 represents the total demand to hold and the stock . It is clear that the rightward-sloping nature of the total demand curve is even more accentuated than that of the demand curve . For the demand schedule increases or remains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule of the sellers also tends to increase as the price falls . The total demand schedule is the result of adding the two schedules . Clearly , the reservation demand of the sellers increases as the price falls for the same reason as does the demand curve for buyers . With a lower price , the value of the purchase-good in direct use or in other and future exchanges relatively increases , and therefore the seller tends to withhold more of the good from exchange . In other words , the reservation demand curve is the obverse of the supply curve . Another point of interest is that , at the equilibrium price of 89 , the total demand to hold is 8 , equal to the total stock in existence . Thus , the equilibrium price not only equates the supply and demand on the market ; is ' also equates the stock of a  | good to be held with the desire of people to hold it , buyers and sellers included . The total stock is included in the foregoing diagram at a fixed figure of 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the price of a good so as to equate the stock with the total demand to hold the stock . Suppose that the price of a good is higher than this equilibrium price . Say that the price is 92 , at which the stock is 8 and the total demand to hold is 4 . This means that four horses exist which their possessors do not want to possess . It is clear that someone must possess this stock , since all goods must be property ; otherwise they would not be objects of human action . Since all the stock must at all times be possessed by someone , the fact that the stock is greater than total demand means that there is an imbalance in the economy , that some of the possessors are unhappy with their possession of the stock . They tend to lower the price in order to sell the stock , and the price falls until finally the stock is equated with the demand to hold . Conversely , suppose that the price is below equilibrium , say at 85 , where 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bids of the eager nonpossessors for the scarce stock push up the price until it reaches equilibrium . In cases where individuals correctly anticipate the equilibrium price , the speculative element will tend to render the total demand curve even more " elastic " and flatter . At a higher-thanequilibrium price few will want to keep the stock ? the buyers will demand very little , and the sellers will be eager to dispose of the good . On the other hand , at a lower price , the demand to hold will be far greater than the stock ; buyers will demand heavily , and sellers will be reluctant to sell their stock . The discrepancies between total demand and stock will be far greater , and the underbidding and overbidding will more quickly bring about the equilibrium price . We saw above that , at the equilibrium price , the most capable ( or " most urgent " ) buyers made the exchanges with the most capable sellers . Here we see that the result of the exchange process is that the stock finally goes into the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sale of the eight horses , the  | most capable buyers , XI-X5 , purchased from the most capable sellers of the good , Zl-Z5 . At the conclusion of the exchange , then , the possessors are XI-X5 , and the excluded sellers Z6-Z8 . It is these individuals who finish by possessing the eight horses , and these are the most capable possessors . At a price of 89 barrels of fish per horse , these were the ones who preferred the horse on their value scales to 89 barrels of fish , and they acted on the basis of this preference . For five of the individuals , this meant exchanging their fish for a horse ; for three it meant refusing to part with their horses for the fish . The other nine individuals on the market were the less capable possessors , and they concluded by possessing the fish instead of the horse ( even if they started by possessing horses ) . These were the ones who ranked 89 barrels of fish above one horse on their value scale . Five of these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four simply retained the fish without purchasing a horse . The total demand-stock analysis is a useful twin companion to the supply-demand analysis . Each has advantages for use in different spheres . One relative defect of the total demand-stock analysis is that it does not reveal the differences between the buyers and the sellers . In considering total demand , it abstracts from actual exchanges , and therefore does not , in contrast to the supply-demand curves , determine the quantity of exchanges . It reveals only the equilibrium price , without demonstrating the equilibrium quantity exchanged . However , it focuses more sharply on the fundamental truth that price is determined solely by utility . The supply curve is reducible to a reservation demand curve and to a quantity of physical stock . The demand-stock analysis therefore shows that the supply curve is not based on some sort of " cost " that is independent of utility on individual value scales . We see that the fundamental determinants of price are the value scales of all individuals ( buyers and sellers ) in the market and that the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is clear , in these cases of direct exchange of useful goods , that even if the utility of goods for buyers or sellers is at present determined by its subjective exchange-value for the individual , the sole ultimate source of utility of each good is its direct usevalue . If the major utility of a horse to its possessor is the fish  | or the cow that he can procure in exchange , and the major value of the latter to their possessors is the horse obtainable in exchange , etc. , the ultimate determinant of the utility of each good is its direct use-value to its individual consumer . How , then , may we sum up the analysis of our hypothetical horse-and-fish market ? We began with a stock of eight horses in existence ( and a certain stock of fish as well ) , and a situation where the relative positions of horses and fish on different people 's value scales were such as to establish conditions for the exchange of the two goods . Of the original possessors , the " most capable sellers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonpossessors , the " most capable buyers " purchased units of the stock with their fish . The final price of their sale was the equilibrium price determined ultimately by their various value scales , which also determined the quantity of exchanges that took place at that price . The net result was a shift of the stock of each good into the hands of its most capable possessors in accordance with the relative rank of the good on their value scales . The exchanges having been completed , the relatively most capable possesors own the stock , and the market for this good has come to a close . With arrival at equilibrium , the exchanges have shifted the goods to the most capable possessors , and there is no further motive for exchange . The market has ended , and there is no longer an active " ruling market price " for either good because there is no longer any motive for exchange . Yet in our experience the markets for almost all goods are being continually renewed . The market can be renewed again only if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under consideration on the value scales of at least two individuals , one of them a possessor of one good and the other a possessor of the second good . Exchanges will then take place in a quantity and at a final price determined by the intersection of the new combination of supply and demand . schedules . This may set a different quantity of exchanges at the old equilibrium price or at a new price , depend- ing on their specific content . Or it may happen that the new combination of schedules ? in the new period of time ? will be identical with the old and therefore set the same quantity of exchanges and the same price as on the old market . The market is always tending quickly toward its equilibrium position , and the wider the market is , and the better the communication among its participants , the more quickly will this position be established for any set of schedules . Furthermore , a growth of specialized speculation will tend to improve the forecasts of the equilibrium point and hasten the arrival at equilibrium . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive at equilibrium before the supply or demand schedules themselves change , the market does not reach the equilibrium point . It becomes continuous , moving toward a new equilibrium position before the old one has been reached . The types of change introduced by a shift in the supply and/ or the demand schedule may be depicted by the diagrams in Fig. 24.  | These four diagrams depict eight types of situations that may develop from changes in the supply and demand schedules . It must be noted that these diagrams may apply either to a market that has already reached equilibrium and is then renewed at some later date or to one continuous market that experiences a change in supply and/or demand conditions before reaching the old equilibrium point . Solid lines depict the old schedules , while broken lines depict the new ones . In all these diagrams straight lines are assumed purely for convenience , since the lines may be of any shape , provided the aforementioned restrictions on the slope of the schedules are met ( rightward-sloping demand schedules , etc . ) . In diagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market increases . At each hypothetical price , people will wish to add more than before to their stock of the good ? and it does not matter whether these individuals already possess some units of the good or not . The supply schedule remains the same . As a result , the new equilibrium price is higher than the old , and the quantity of exchanges made at the new equilibrium position is greater than at the old position . In diagram B , the supply schedule increases , while the demand schedule remains the same . At each hypothetical price , people will wish to dispose of more of their stock . The result is that the new equilibrium price is lower than the old , and the equilibrium quantity exchanged is greater . Diagrams A and B also depict what will occur when the demand curve decreases and the supply curve decreases , the other schedule remaining the same . All we need do is think of the broken lines as the old schedules , and the solid lines as the new ones . On diagram A we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fall in price and a fall in the quantity exchanged . On diagram B , we see that a decrease in the supply schedule leads to a rise in price and a fall in the quantity exchanged . For diagrams C and D , the restriction that one schedule must remain the same while the other one changes is removed . In diagram C , the demand curve decreases and the supply curve increases . This will definitely lead to a fall in equilibrium price ,  | although what will happen to the quantity exchanged depends on the relative proportion of change in the two schedules , and therefore this result can not be predicted from the fact of an increase in the supply schedule and a decrease in the demand schedule . On the other hand , a decrease in the supply schedule plus an increase in the demand schedule will definitely lead to a rise in the equilibrium price . Diagram D discloses that an increase in both demand and supply schedules will definitely lead to an increase in the quantity exchanged , although whether or not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , a decrease in both supply and demand schedules will lead to a decline in the quantity exchanged . In diagram C what happens to the quantity , and in diagram D what happens to the price , depends on the specific shape and change of the curves in question . The conclusions from these diagrams may be summarized in Table 5 . If these are the effects of changes in the demand and supply schedules from one period of time to another , the next problem is to explain the causes of these changes themselves . A change in the demand schedule is due purely to a change in the relative utility-rankings of the two goods ( the purchase-good and the salegood ) on the value scales of the individual buyers on the market . An increase in the demand schedule , for example , signifies a  | general rise in the purchase-good on the value scales of the buyers . This may be due to either ( a ) a rise in the direct use-value of the good ; ( b ) poorer opportunities to exchange the sale-good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a higher price of cows in terms of fish ; or ( c ) a decline in speculative waiting for the price of the good to fall further . The last case has been discussed in detail and has been shown to be self-correcting , impelling the market more quickly towards the true equilibrium . We can therefore omit this case now and conclude that an increase in the demand schedule is due either to an increase in the direct use-value of the good or to a higher price of other potential purchase-goods in terms of the sale-good that buyers offer in exchange . A decrease in demand schedules is due precisely to the converse cases ? a fall in the value in direct use or greater opportunities to buy other purchase-goods for this sales-good . The latter would mean a greater exchange-value ? of fish , for example ? in other fields of exchange . Changes in opportunities for other types of exchange may be a result of higher or lower prices for the other purchase-goods , or they may be the result of the fact that new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . The sudden appearance of cows being offered for fish where none had been offered before is a widening of exchange opportunities for fish and will result in a general decline of the demand curve for horses in terms of fish . A change in the market supply curve is , of course , also the result of a change in the relative rankings of utility on the sellers ' value scales . This curve , however , may be broken down into the amount of physical stock and the reservation-demand schedule of the sellers . If we assume that the amount of physical stock is constant in the two periods under comparison , then a shift in supply curves is purely the result of a change in reservation-demand curves . A decrease in the supply curve caused by an increase in reservation demand for the stock may be due to either ( a ) an increase in the direct use-value of the good for the sellers ; ( b ) greater opportunities for making exchanges for other purchasegoods ; or ( c ) a greater speculative anticipation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last case for the same reason  | we omitted it from our discussion of the demand curve . Conversely , a fall in the reservation-demand schedule may be due to either ( a ) a decrease in the direct use-value of the good to the sellers or ( b ) a dwindling of exchange opportunities for other purchase-goods . Thus , with the total stock constant , changes in both supply and demand curves are due solely to changes in the demand to hold the good by either sellers or buyers , which in turn are due to shifts in the relative utility of the two goods . Thus , in both diagrams A and B above , the increase in the demand schedule and a decrease in the supply schedule from S 'S ' to SS are a result of increased total demand to hold . In one case the increased total demand to hold is on the part of the buyers , in the other case of the sellers . The relevant diagram is shown in Fig. 25 . In both cases of an increase in the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the equilibrium price increases . On the contrary , when the demand schedule declines , and/or when the supply schedule increases , these signify a general decrease in the total demandto-hold schedule and consequently a fall in equilibrium price . A total demand-stock diagram can convey no information about the quantity exchanged , but only about the equilibrium . Thus , in diagram C , the broken lines both represent a fall in demand to hold , and we could consequently be sure that the total demand to hold declined , and that therefore price declined . ( The opposite would be the case for a shift from the broken to the solid lines . ) In diagram D , however , since an increase in the supply schedule represented a fall in demand to hold , and an increase in demand was a rise in the demand to hold , we could not always be sure of the net effect on the total demand to hold and hence on the equilibrium price .  | From the beginning of the supply-demand analysis up to this point we have been assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have been assuming the existence of eight horses and have been considering the principles on which this stock will go into the hands of different possessors . The analysis above applies to all goods ? to all cases where an existing stock is being exchanged for the stock of another good . For some goods this point is as far as analysis can be pursued . This applies to those goods of which the stock is fixed and can not be increased through production . They are either once produced by man or given by nature , but the stock can not be increased by human action . Such a good , for example , is a Rembrandt painting after the death of Rembrandt . Such a painting would rank high enough on individual value scales to command a high price in exchange for other goods . The stock can never be increased , however , and its exchange and pricing is solely in terms of the previously analyzed exchange of existing stock , determined by the relative rankings of these and other goods on numerous value scales . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no more diamonds are available anywhere . Again , the problem would be solely one of exchanging the existing stock . In these cases there is no further problem of production ? of deciding how much of a stock should be produced in a certain period of time . For most goods , however , the problem of deciding how much to produce is a crucial one . Much of the remainder of this volume , in fact , is devoted to an analysis of the problem of production . We shall now proceed to cases in which the existing stock of a good changes from one period to another . A stock may increase from one period to the next because an amount of the good has been newly produced in the meantime . This amount of new production constitutes an addition to the stock . Thus , three days after the beginning of the horse-market referred to above , two new horses might be produced and added to the existing stock . If the demand schedule of buyers and the reservation demand schedule of sellers remain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 26.  | The increased stock will lower the price of the good . At the old equilibrium price , individuals find that their stock is in excess of the total demand to hold , and the consequence is an underbidding to sell that lowers the price to the new equilibrium . In terms of supply and demand curves , an increase in stock , with demand and reservation-demand schedules remaining the same , is equivalent to a uniform increase in the supply schedule by the amount of the increased stock ? in this case by two horses . The amount supplied would be the former total plus the added two . Possessors with an excess of stock at the old equilibrium price must underbid each other in order to sell the increased stock . If we refer back to Table 2 , we find that an increase in the supply schedule by 2 lowers the equilibrium price to 88 , where the demand is 6 and the new supply is 6 . Diagrammatically , the situation may be depicted as in Fig. 27 . The increased stock is reflected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequent fall in price and an increase in the quantity exchanged . Of course , there is no reason to assume that , in reality , an increased stock will necessarily be accompanied by an unchanged reservation-demand curve . But in order to study the various  | causal factors that interact to form the actual historical result , it is necessary to isolate each one and consider what would be its effect if the others remained unchanged . Thus , if an increased stock were at the same time absorbed by an equivalent increase in the reservation-demand schedule , the supply curve would not increase at all , and the price and quantity exchanged would remain unchanged . ( On the total demand-stock schedule , this situation would be reflected in an increase in stock , accompanied by an offsetting rise in the total-demand curve , leaving the price at the original level . ) A decrease in stock from one period to another may result from the using up of the stock . Thus , if we consider only consumers ' goods , a part of the stock may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of consumption , if there is not sufficient production during the time considered , the total stock in existence may decline . Thus , one new horse may be produced , but two may die , from one point of time to the next , and the result may be a market with one less horse in existence . A decline in stock , with demand remaining the same , has the exactly reverse effect , as we may see on the diagrams by moving from the broken to the solid lines . At the old equilibrium price , there is an excess demand to hold compared to the stock available , and the result is an upbidding of prices to the new equilibrium . The supply schedule uniformly decreases by the decrease in stock , and the result is a higher price and a smaller quantity of goods exchanged . We may summarize the relation between stock , production , and time , by stating that the stock at one period ( assuming that a period of time is defined as one during which the stock remains unchanged ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows : If St equals stock at a certain period ( t ) Stn equals stock at an earlier period ( t ? n ) which is n units of time before period ( t ) P. equals production of the good over the period n U , , equals amount of the good used up over the period n Then : St = St , + P. ? U.  | Thus , in the case just mentioned , if the original stock is 8 horses , and one new horse is produced while two die , the new stock of the good is 8 + 1 ? 2 = 7 horses . It is important to be on one 's guard here against a common confusion over such a term as " an increase in demand . " Whenever this phrase is used by itself in this work , it always signifies an increase in the demand schedule , i.e. , an increase in the amounts that will be demanded at each hypothetical price . This " shift of the demand schedule to the right " always tends to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the " increase in quantity demanded " that takes place , for example , in response to an increased supply . An increased supply schedule , by lowering price , induces the market to demand the larger quantity offered . This , however , is not an increase in the demand schedule , but an extension along the same demand schedule . It is a larger quantity demanded in response to a more attractive price offer . This simple movement along the same schedule must not be confused with an increase in the demand schedule at each possible price . The diagrams in Fig. 28 highlight the difference : Diagram I depicts an increase in the demand schedule , while diagram II depicts an extension of quantity demanded along the same schedule as a result of an increase in the supply offered . In both cases , the value scales of the various individuals determine the final result , but great confusion can ensue if the concepts are  | not clearly distinguished when such terms as " increase " or " decrease " in demand are being used . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the effect of changes in the stock of a good . The question still remains : On what principles is the size of the stock itself determined ? Aside from the consumers ' or producers ' goods given directly by nature , all goods must be produced by man . ( And even seemingly nature-given products must be searched for and then used by man , and hence are ultimately products of human effort . ) The size of the stock of any good depends on the rate at which the good has been and is being produced . And since human wants for most goods are continuous , the goods that are worn out through use must constantly be replaced by new production . An analysis of the rate of production and its determinants is thus of central importance in an analysis of human action . A complete answer to this problem can not be given at this point , but certain general conclusions on production can be made . In the first place , while any one individual can at different times be both a buyer and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock there must be specialization . This omnipresence of specialization has been treated above , and the further an exchange economy develops , the further advanced will be the specialization process . The basis for specialization has been shown to be the varying abilities of men and the varying location of natural resources . The result is that a good comes first into existence by production , and then is sold by its producer in exchange for some other good , which has been produced in the same way . The initial sales of any new stock will all be made by original producers of the good . Purchases will be made by buyers who will use the good either for their direct use or for holding the good in speculative anticipation of later reselling it at a higher price . At any given time , therefore , new stock will be sold by its original producers . The old stock will be sold by : ( a ) original producers who  | through past reservation demand had accumulated old stock ; ( b ) previous buyers who had bought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( c ) previous buyers on whose value scales the relative utility of the good for their direct use has fallen . At any time , then , the market supply schedule is formed by the addition of the supply schedules of the following groups of sellers : 30 a ) The supply offered by producers of the good . 1 . The initial supply of new stock . 2 . The supply of old stock previously reserved by the producers . b ) The supply of old stock offered by previous buyers . 1 . Sales by speculative buyers who had anticipated reselling at a higher price . 2 . Sales by buyers who had purchased for direct use , but on whose value scales the relative utility of the good has fallen . The market demand schedule at any time consists of the sum of the demand schedules of : c ) Buyers for direct use . d ) Speculative buyers for resale at a higher price . Since the good consists of equally serviceable units , the buyers are necessarily indifferent as to whether it is old or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , then the " stock " refers to two different goods , and not the same good . The supply curve of the class ( b ) type of sellers has already been fully analyzed above , e.g. , the relationship between stock and reservation demand for speculative resellers and for those whose utility position has changed . What more can be said , however , of the supply schedule of the class ( a ) sellers ? the original producers of the good ? In the first place , the stock of newly produced goods in the hands of the producers is also fixed for any given point in time . Say that for the month of December : he producers of copper dc- tide to produce 5,000 tons of copper . At the end of that month their stock of newly produced copper is 5,000 tons . They might regret their decision and believe that if they could have made it again , they would have produced , say , 1,000 tons . But they have their stock , and they must use it as best they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a result of specialization , the direct use-value of their product to them is likely to be almost nonexistent . The further specialization proceeds , the less possible use-value can the product have for its producer . Picture , for example , how much copper a copper manufacturer could consume in his personal use , or the direct use-value of the huge number of produced automobiles to the Ford family . Therefore , in the supply schedtile of the producers , the directuse element in their reservation demand disappers . The only reason for a producer to reserve , to hold on to , any of his stock is speculative ? in anticipation of a higher price for the good in the future . ( In direct exchange , there is also the possibility of exchange for a third good ? say cows instead of fish , in our example . ) If , for the moment , we make the restrictive assumptions that there are no class ( b ) sellers on the market and that the producers have no present or accumulated past reservation demand , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DD in Fig. 29 . Thus , with no reservation demand , the supply curve will be a vertical straight line ( SS ) at the level of the new stock . It seems more likely , however , that a price below equilibrium will tend to call forth a reservation demand to hold by the producers in anticipation of a higher price ( called " building up inventory " ) , and that a price above equilibrium will result in the unloading of old stock that had been accumulated as a result of past reservation demand ( called " drawing down inventory " ) .  | In that case , the supply curve assumes a more familiar shape ( the broken line above ? S 'S ' ) . The removal of direct use-value from the calculation of the sellers signifies that all the stock must eventually be sold , so that ultimately none of the stock can be reserved from sale by the producers . The producers will make their sales at that point at which they expect the market price to be the greatest that they can attain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the given stock is expected to be the greatest.gl The length of time that producers can reserve supply is , of course , dependent on the durability of the good ; a highly perishable good like strawberries , for example , could not be reserved for long , and its market supply curve is likely to be a vertical line . Suppose that an equilibrium price for a good has been reached on the market . In this case , the speculative element of reservation demand drops out . However , in contrast to the market in re-exchange of existing stock , the market for new production does not end . Since wants are always being renewed in each successive period of time , new stock will also be produced in each period , and if the amount of stock is the same and the demand schedule given , the same amount will continue to be sold at the same equilibrium price . Thus , suppose that the copper producers produce 5,000 tons in a month ; these are sold ( no reservation demand ) at the equilibrium price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OS . The following month , if 5,000 tons are produced , the equilibrium price will be the same . If more is produced , then , as we saw above , the equilibrium price is lower ; if less , the equilibrium price will be higher . If the speculative elements are also excluded from the demand schedule , it is clear that this schedule will be determined solely by the utility of the good in direct use ( as compared with the utility of the sale-good ) . The only two elements in the value of a good are its direct use-value and its exchange-value , and the demand schedule consists of demand for direct use plus the speculative demand in anticipation of reselling at a higher price . If we exclude the latter element ( e.g. , at the Vquilibrium price ) , the only ultimate source of demand is the direct use-value of the good to the purchaser . If we abstract from the speculative elements in  | a market , therefore , the sole determinant of the market price of the stock of a good is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , as has been shown in previous sections , that production must take place over a period of time . To obtain a certain amount of new stock at some future date , the producer must first put into effect a series of acts , using labor , nature , and capital goods , and the process must take time from the initial and intermediary acts until the final stock is produced . Therefore , the essence of specialized production is anticipation of the future state of the market by the producers . In deciding whether or not to produce a certain quantity of stock by a future date , the producer must use his judgment in estimating the market price at which he will be able to sell his stock . This market price is likely to be at some equilibrium , but an equilibrium is not likely to last for more than a short time . This is especially true when ( as a result of ever-changing value scales ) the demand curve for the good continually shifts . Each producer tries to use his resources ? his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain , in the production of stock , the maximum psychic revenue and hence a psychic profit . He is ever liable to error , and errors in anticipating the market will bring him a psychic loss . The essence of production for the market , therefore , is entrepreneurship . The key consideration is that the demand schedules , and consequently the future prices , are not and can never be definitely and automatically known to the producers . They must estimate the future state of demand as best they can . Entrepreneurship is also the dominant characteristic of buyers and sellers who act speculatively , who specialize in anticipating higher or lower prices in the future . Their entire action consists in attempts to anticipate future market prices , and their success depends on how accurate or erroneous their forecasts are . Since , as was seen above , correct speculation quickens the movement toward equilibrium , and erroneous speculation tends to correct itself , the activity of these speculators tends to hasten the arrival of an equilibrium position . The direct users of a good must also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the time of purchase , their actual use of a good will be at some date in the future , even if  | in the very near future . The position of the good on their value scales is an estimate of its expected future value in these periods , discounted by time preferences . It is very possible for the buyer to make an erroneous forecast of the value of the good to him in the future , and the more durable the good , the greater the likelihood of error . Thus , it is more likely that the buyer of a house will be in error in forecasting his own future valuation than the buyer of strawberries . Hence , entrepreneurship is also a feature of the buyer 's activity ? even in direct use . However , in the case of specialized producers , entrepreneurship takes the form of estimating other people 's future wants , and this is obviously a far more difficult and challenging task than forecasting one 's own valuations . Human action occurs in stages , and at each stage an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the light of expected future developments . The past is forever bygone . The role of errors in different stages of human action may be considered in the comparatively simple case of the man who buys a good for direct use . Say that his estimate of his future uses is such that he purchases a good ? e.g. , 10 quarts of milk ? in exchange for 100 barrels of fish , which also happens to be his maximum buying price for 10 quarts of milk . Suppose that after the purchase is completed he finds , for some reason , that his valuations have changed and that the milk is now far lower on his value scale . He is now confronted with the question of the best use to make of the 10 quarts of milk . The fact that he has made an error itt using his resources of 100 barrels of fish does not remove the problem of making the best use of the 10 quarts of milk . If the price is still 100 barrels of fish , his best course at present would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fish . If the price is now above 100 , he has made a speculative gain , and lie can resell the milk for more fish . And if the price of milk has fallen , but the fish is still higher on his value scale than the 10 quarts of milk , it would maximize his psychic revenue to sell the milk for less than 100 barrels of fish . It is important to recognize that t is absurd to criticize suc h an action by saying that he suffered a clear loss of X bands of fish from the two exchanges . To be sure , if he had correctly  | forecast later developments , the man would not have made the original exchange . His original exchange can therefore be termed erroneous in retrospect . But once the first exchange has been made , he must make the best possible present and future use of the milk , regardless of past errors , and therefore his second exchange was his best possible choice under the circumstances . If , on the other hand , the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then his best alternative is to use the milk in its most valuable direct use . Similarly , a producer might decide to produce a certain amount of stock , and , after the stock has been made , the state of the market turns out to be such as to make him regret his decision . However , he must do the best he can with the stock , once it has been produced , and obtain the maximum psychic revenue from it . In other words , if we consider his action from the beginning ? when he invested his resources in production ? his act in retrospect was a psychic loss because it did not yield the best available alternative from these resources . But once the stock is produced , this is his available resource , and its sale at the best possible price now nets him a psychic gain . At this point , we may summarize the expected ( psychic ) revenue and the expected ( psychic ) cost , factors that enter into the decision of buyers and sellers in any direct exchange of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element , we are left with factors : revenue A , cost A , cost C for buyers ; and revenue A , cost A , cost B for sellers . Similarly , if we consider the sellers as the specialized original producers ? and this will be more true the greater the proportion of the rate of production to accumulated stock ? cost A drops out for the sellers . If we also remember that , since the exchange involves two goods , the set of buyers for one good is the set of sellers for the other good , cost A is eliminated as a factor for buyers as well . Only the factors asterisked above ultimately remain . The revenue for both the buyers and the sellers is the expected direct use of the goods acquired ; the costs are the exchange for a third good that is forgone because of this exchange . The revenue and costs that are involved in making the original decision regarding the production of stock are , as we have indicated , of a different order , and these will be explored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the sake of clarity , the examples of exchangeable goods in this chapter have mainly been taken from tangible commodities , such as horses , fish , eggs , etc . Such commodities are not the only type of goods subject to exchange , however . A may exchange his personal services for the commodity of B. Thus , for example , A may give his labor services to farmer B in exchange for farm produce . Furthermore , A may give personal services that function directly as consumers , goods in exchange for another good . An individual may thus exchange his medical advice or his musical performance for food or clothing . These services are as legitimately consumers ' goods as those goods that are embodied in tangible , physical commodities . Similarly , individual labor services are as much producers ' goods as are tangible capital goods . As a matter of fact , tangible goods are valued not so much for their physical content as for their services to the user , whether he is a consumer or a producer . The a , tor values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house for its services in  | providing shelter , the machine for its service in producing a lower-order good . In the last analysis , tangible commodities are also valued for their services , and are thus on the same plane as intangible personal " services . " Economics , therefore , is not a science that deals particularly with " material goods " or " material welfare . " It deals in general with the action of men to satisfy their desires , and , specifically , with the process of exchange of goods as a means for each individual to " produce " satisfactions for his desires . These goods may be tangible commodities or they may be intangible personal services . The principles of supply and demand , of price determination , are exactly the same for any good , whether it is in one category or the other . The foregoing analysis is applicable to all goods . Thus , the following types of possible exchanges have been covered by our analysis : a ) A commodity for a commodity ; such as horses for fish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as medical advice for butter , or farm labor for food . c ) A personal service for a personal service ; such as mutual log-rolling by two settlers , or medical advice for gardening labor , or teaching for a musical performance.32 In cases where there are several competing homogeneous units , supply and demand schedules can be added ; in cases where one or both parties are isolated or are the only ones exchanging , the zone of price determination will be established as indicated above . Thus , if one arithmetic teacher is bargaining with one violinist for an exchange of services , their respective utility rankings will set the zone of price determination . If several arithmetic teachers and several violinists who provide homogeneous services form a market for their two goods , the market price will be formed with the addition and intersection of supply and demand schedules . If the services of the different individuals are not considered as of equal quality by the demanders , they will be evaluated separately , and each service will be priced separately.33 The supply curve will then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one individual . This individual supply curve is , of course , sloped upward in a rightward direction . Where only one individual is the supplier of a good on the market , his supply curve is identical with the market supply curve . One evident reason for the confusion of exchange with a mere trade of material objects is the fact that much intangible property can not , by its very nature , be exchanged . A violinist may own his musicianly ability and exchange units of it , in the form of service , for the services of a physician . But other personal attributes , which can not be exchanged , may be desired as goods . Thus , Brown might have a desired end : to gain the genuine approval of Smith . This is a particular consumers ' good which he can not purchase with any other good , for what he wants is the genuine approval rather than a show of approval that might be purchased . In this case , the consumers ' good is a property of Smith 's that can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not by exchange . In relation to exchange , this intangible good is an inalienable property of Smith 's , i.e. , it can not be given up . Another example is that a man can not permanently transfer his will , even though he may transfer much of his services and his property . As mentioned above , a man may not agree to permanent bondage by contracting to work for another man for the rest of his life . He might change his mind at a later date , and then he can not , in a free market , be compelled to continue working thereafter . Because a man 's self-ownership over his will is inalienable , he can not , on the unhampered market , be compelled to continue an arrangement whereby he submits his will to the orders of another , even though he might have agreed to this arrangement previously.34,3 On the other hand , when property that can be alienated is transferred , it , of course , becomes the property ? under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction ? of the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret by the original owner can establish any claim to the property . Thus , exchange may occur with alienable goods ; they may be , consumers ' goods , of varying degrees of durability ; or they may be producers ' goods . They may be 4angible commodities or IIItangible personal services . There are other types of exchangeable  | items , which are based on these alienable goods . For example , suppose that Jones deposits a good ? say 1,000 bushels of wheat ? in a warehouse for safekeeping . He retains ownership of the good , but transfers its physical possession to the warehouse owner , Green , for safekeeping . Green gives Jones a warehouse receipt for the wheat , certifying that the wheat is there for safekeeping and giving the owner of the receipt a claim to receive the wheat whenever he presents the receipt to the warehouse . In exchange for this service as a guardian of the wheat , Jones pays him a certain agreed amount of some other good , say emeralds . Thus , the claim originates from an exchange of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the price of this exchange is determined according to the principles of the foregoing analysis . Now , however , the warehouse receipt has come into existence as a claim to the wheat . On an unhampered market , the claim would be regarded as absolutely secure and certain to be honored , and therefore Jones would be able to exchange the claim as a substitute for actual physical exchange of the wheat . He might find another party , Robinson , who wishes to purchase the wheat in exchange for horses . They agree on a price , and then Robinson accepts the claim on the warehouse as a perfectly good substitute for actual transfer of the wheat . He knows that when he wants to use the wheat , he will be able to redeem the claim at the warehouse ; the claim therefore functions here as a goods-substitute . In this case , the claim is to a present good , since the good can be redeemed at any time that the owner desires . Here , the nature and function of the claim is simple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . Even simpler is a case where ownership of property , say a farm , is transferred from A to B by transferring written title , or evidence of ownership , which may be considered a claim . The situation becomes more complicated , however , when ownership is divided into pieces , and these pieces are transferred from person to person . Thus , suppose that Harrison is the owner of an iron mine . He decides to divide up the ownership , and sell the various divided pieces , or shares , of the good to other individuals . Assume that lie creates a hundred tickets , with the total constituting the full  | ownership of the mine , and then sells all but ten tickets to numerous other individuals . The owner of two shares then becomes a %00 owner of the mine . Since there is very little practical scope for such activity in a regime of direct exchange , analysis of this situation will be reserved for later chapters . It is clear , however , that the %loo owner is entitled to his proportionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the jointly owned property . In other words , the share is evidence of partownership , or a claim to part-ownership , of a good . This property right in a proportionate share of the use of a good can also be sold or bought in exchange . A third type of claim arises from a credit exchange ( or credit transaction ) . Up to this point we have been discussing exchanges of one present good for another , i.e. , the good can be used at present ? or at any desired time ? by each receiver in the exchange . In a credit transaction , a present good is exchanged for a future good , or rather , a claim on a future good . Suppose , for example , that Jackson desires to acquire 100 pounds of cotton at once . He makes the following exchange with Peters : Peters to give Jackson 100 pounds of cotton now ( a present good ) ; and , in return , Jackson gives Peters a claim on 110 pounds of cotton one year from now . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton one year from now . The price of the present good in terms of the future good is 1.1 pounds of future cotton ( one year from now ) per pound of present cotton . Prices in such exchanges are determined by value scales and the meeting of supply and demand schedules , just as in the case of exchanges of present goods . Further analysis of the pricing of credit transactions must be left for later chapters ; here it may be pointed out that , as explained in the previous chapter , every man will evaluate a homogeneous good more highly the earlier in time is his prospect of attaining it . A present good ( a good consisting of units capable of rendering equivalent satisfaction ) will always be valued more highly than the same good in the future , in accordance with the individual 's rate of time preference . It is evident that the various rates of time preference ? ultimately determined by relative positions on individual  | value scales ? will act to set the price of credit exchanges . Moreover , the receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to repay a greater amount of the good in the future to the creditor ? the man who receives the claim , since the same number of units is worth more as a present than as a future good . The creditor is rendering the debtor the service of using a good in the present , while the debtor pays for this service by repaying a greater amount of the good in the future . At the date when the claim finally falls due , the creditor redeems the claim and acquires the good itself , thus ending the existence of the claim . In the meanwhile , however , the claim is in existence , and it can be bought and sold in exchange for other goods . Thus , Peters , the creditor , might decide to sell the claim ? or promissory note ? to Williams in exchange for a wagon . The price of this exchange will again be determined by supply and demand schedules . Demand for the note will be based on its security as a claim to the cotton . Thus , Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold ) in terms of wagons will be based ( a ) on the direct utility and exchange-value of the wagon , and ( b ) the marginal utility of the added units of cotton , discounted by him on two possible grounds : ( 1 ) the length of time the claim has left until the date of " maturity , " and ( 2 ) the estimate of the security of the note . Thus , the less time there remains to elapse for a claim to any given good , the higher will it tend to be valued in the market . Also , if the eventual payment is considered less than absolutely secure , because of possible failure to redeem , the claim will be valued less highly in accordance with people 's estimates of the likelihood of its failure . After a note has been transferred , it becomes the property of the new owner , who becomes the creditor and will be entitled to redeem the claim when due . When a claim is thus transferred in exchange for some other good ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transaction . A credit exchange sets up an unfinished payment on the part of the debtor ; in this case , Peters pays Williams the claim in return for the other good , and the transaction is finished . Jackson , on the other hand , remains the debtor as a result of the original transaction ,  | which remains unfinished until he makes his agreed-upon payment to the creditor on the date of maturity . " The several types of claims , therefore , are : on present goods , by such means as warehouse receipts or shares of joint ownership in a good ; and on future goods , arising from credit transactions . These are evidences of ownership , or , as in the latter case , objects that will become evidence of ownership at a later date . Thus , in addition to the three types of exchanges mentioned above , there are three other types whose terms and principles are included in the preceding analysis of this chapter : d ) A commodity for a claim ; examples of this are : ( 1 ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to a present good ; ( 2 ) a credit transaction , with a commodity exchanged for a claim to a future commodity ; ( 3 ) the purchase of shares of stock in a commodity by exchanging another type of commodity for them ; ( 4 ) the purchase of promissory notes on a debtor by exchanging a commodity . All four of these cases have been described above . e ) A claim for a service ; an example is personal service being exchanged for a promissory note or warehouse receipt or stock . f ) A claim for a claim ; examples would be : exchange of a promissory note for another one ; of stock shares for a note ; of one type of stock share for another ; of a warehouse receipt for any of the other types of claims . With all goods analyzable into categories of tangible commodities , services , or claims to goods ( goods-substitutes ) , all six possible types of exchanges are covered by the utility and supplydemand analysis of this chapter . In each case , different concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? such as time preference in the case of credit exchanges ; and this permits more to be said about the various specific types of exchanges . The level of analysis presented in this chapter , however , encompasses all possible exchanges of go ; *ds . In later chapters , whcii indirect exchange has been introduced , the present analysis will  | apply also , but further analysis will be made of production and exchange problems involved in credit exchanges ( time preference ) ; in exchanges for capital goods and consumer goods ; and in exchanges for labor services ( wages ) . 12 . Property : The Appropriation of Raw Land As we have stated above , the origin of all property is ultimately traceable to the appropriation of an unused nature-given factor by a man and his " mixing " his labor with this natural factor to produce a capital good or a consumers ' good . For when we trace back through gifts and through exchanges , we must reach a man and an unowned natural resource . In a free society , any piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to a man 's ownership through his first use or mixing of his labor with this resource . How will an individual 's title to the nature-given factor be determined ? If Columbus lands on a new continent , is it legitimate for him to proclaim all the new continent his own , or even that sector " as far as his eye can see " ? Clearly , this would not be the case in the free society that we are postulating . Columbus or Crusoe would have to use the land , to " cultivate " it in some way , before he could be asserted to own it . This " cultivation " does not have to involve tilling the soil , although that is one possible form of cultivation . If the natural resource is land , he may clear it for a house or a pasture , or care for some plots of timber , etc . If there is more land than can be used by a limited labor supply , then the unused land must simply remain unowned until a first user arrives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be . There is no requirement , however , that land continue to be used in order for it to continue to be a man 's property . Suppose that Jones uses some new land , then finds it is unprofitable , and lets it fall into disuse . Or suppose that he clears new land and therefore obtains title to it , but then finds that it is no longer  | useful in production and allows it to remain idle . In a free society , would he lose title ? No , for once his labor is mixed with the natural resource , it remains his owned land . His labor has been irretrievably mixed with the land , and the land is therefore his or his assigns ' in perpetuity . We shall see in later chapters that the question whether or not labor has been mixed with land is irrelevant to its market price or capital value ; in catallactics , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of property , however , the question is important , for once the mixture takes place , the man and his heirs have appropriated the nature-given factor , and for anyone else to seize it would be an invasive act . As Wolowski and Levasseur state : Nature has been appropriated by him ( man ) for his use ; she has become his own ; she is his property . This property is legitimate ; it constitutes a right as sacred for man as is the free exercise of his faculties . It is his because it has come entirely from himself , and is in no way anything but an emanation from his being . Before him , there was scarcely anything but matter ; since him , and by him , there is interchangeable wealth . The producer has left a fragment of his own person in the thing which has thus become valuable , and may hence be regarded as a prolongation of the faculties of man acting upon external nature . As a free being he belongs to himself ; now , the cause , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the effect , that is to say , the wealth produced , is still himself . Who shall dare contest his title of ownership so clearly marked by the seal of his personality ? 37 Some critics , especially the Henry Georgists , assert that , while a man or his assigns may be entitled to the produce of his own labor or anything exchanged for it , he is not entitled to an original , nature-given factor , a " gift of nature . " For one man to appropriate this gift is alleged to be an invasion of a common heritage that all men deserve to use equally . This is a self-contradictory position , however . A man can not produce anything without the co-operation of original nature-given factors , if only as standing room . In order to produce and possess any capital good or consumers ' good , therefore , he n , , tst appropriate and use an original nature-given factor . He can not form products purely out  | of his labor alone ; he must mix his labor with original naturegiven factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors is to be denied man , he can not obtain property in the fruits of his labor . Furthermore , in the question of land , it is difficult to see what better title there is than the first bringing of this land from a simple unvaluable thing into the sphere of production . For that is what the first user does . He takes a factor that was previously unowned and unused , and therefore worthless to anyone , and converts it into a tool for production of capital and consumers ' goods . While such questions as communism of property will be discussed in later parts of this book , it is difficult indeed to see why the mere fact of being born should automatically confer upon one some aliquot part of the world 's land . For the first user has mixed his labor with the land , while neither the newborn child nor his ancestors have done anything with the land at all . The problem will be clearer if we consider the case of animals . Animals are " economic land , " because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors of production . Yet will anyone deny title to a cow to the man that finds and domesticates her , putting her to use ? For this is precisely what occurs in the case of land . Previously valueless " wild " land , like wild animals , is taken and transformed by a man into goods useful for man . The " mixing " of labor gives equivalent title in one case as in the other . We must remember , also , what " production " entails . When man " produces , " he does not create matter . He uses given materials and transforms and rearranges them into goods that he desires . In short , he moves matter further toward consumption . His finding of land or animals and putting them to use is also such a transformation . Even if the value accruing to a piece of land at present is substantial , therefore , it is only " economic land " because of the innumerable past efforts of men at work on the land . When we are considering legitimacy of title , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important.38 If animals are also " land " in the sense of given original na- ture factors , so are water and air . We have seen that " air " is inappropriable , a condition of human welfare rather than a scarce good that can be owned . However , this is true only of air for breathing under usual conditions . For example , if some people want their air to be changed , or " conditioned , " then they will have to pay for this service , and the " conditioned air " becomes a scarce good that is owned by its producers . Furthermore , if we understand by " air " the medium for the transmission of such things as radio waves and television images , there is only a limited quantity of wave lengths available for radio and for television purposes . This scarce factor is appropriable and ownable by man . In a free society , ownership of these channels would accrue to individuals just like that of land or animals : the first users obtain the property . The first user , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the absolute owner of this length for his wave area , and it will be his right to continue using it , to abandon it , to sell it , etc . Anyone else who set up a transmitter on the owner 's wave length would be as guilty of invasion of another 's property right as a trespasser on someone else 's land or a thief of someone else 's livestock.39,40 The same is true of water . Water , at least in rivers and oceans , has been considered by most people as also inappropriable and unownable , although it is conceded to be ownable in the cases of ( small ) lakes and wells . Now it is true that the high seas , in relation to shipping lanes , are probably inappropriable , because of their abundance in relation to shipping routes.41 This is not true , however , of fishing rights in oceans . Fish are definitely not available in unlimited quantities relatively to human wants . Therefore , they are appropriable ? their stock and source just as the captured fish themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In a free society , fishing rights to the appropriate areas of oceans would be owned by the first users of those areas and then usable or salable to other individuals . Ownership of areas of water that contain fish is directly analogous to private ownership of areas of land or forests that contain animals to be hunted . Some people raise th difficulty that water flows , and has no fixed position , as land does . This is a completely iu- valid objection , however . Land " moves " too , as when soil is uprooted in dust storms . Most important , water can definitely be marked off in terms of latitudes and longitudes . These boundaries , then , would circumscribe the area owned by individuals , in the full knowledge that fish and water can move from one person 's property to another . The value of the property would be gauged according to this knowledge .42 Another argument is that appropriation of ownership by a first user would result in an uneconomic allocation of the naturegiven factors . Thus , suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only five acres of a certain land , while the most economic allocation would be units of fifteen acres . However , the rule of first ownership by the first user , followed in a free society , would not mean that ownership must end with this allocation . On the contrary . In this case , either the owners would pool their assets in one corporate form , or the most efficient individual owners would buy out the others , and the final size of each unit of land in production would be fifteen acres . It must be added that the theory of land ownership in a free society set forth here , i.e. , first ownership by the first user , has nothing in common with another superficially similar theory of land ownership ? that advanced by J. K. Ingalls and his disciples in the late nineteenth century . Ingalls advocated continuing ownership only for actual occupiers and personal users of the land . This is in contrast to original ownership by the first user . The Ingalls system would , in the first place , bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites where small " homestead " holdings are uneconomic would be forced into use in spite of this , and land would be prevented from entering other lines of use greatly demanded by consumers . Some land would be artificially and coercively withdrawn from use , since land that could not be used by owners in Pierson would have to lie idle . Furthermore , this theory is self-contradictory , since it would not really permit ownership at all . One of the prime conditions of ownership is the right to buy , sell , and dispose of property as the owner or owners see fit . Since small holders would not have the right to sell to nonoccupying large holders , the small  | holders would not really be owners of the land at all . The result is that on the ownership question , the Ingalls thesis reverts , in the final analysis , to the Georgist view that Society ( in the alleged person of the State ) should own the land.43 13 . Enforcement against Invasion of Property This work is largely the analysis of a market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any man 's person or property . The question of the means by which this condition is best established is not at present under consideration . For the present purpose , it makes no difference whether this condition is established by every man 's deciding to refrain from invasive action against others or whether some agency is established to enforce the abandonment of such action by every individual . ( Invasive action may be defined as any action ? violence , theft , or fraud ? taking away another 's personal freedom or property without his consent . ) Whether the enforcement is undertaken by each person or by some sort of agency , we assume here that such a condition ? the existence of an unhampered market ? is maintained in some way . One of the problems in maintaining the conditions of a free market is the role of the enforcing agency ? whether individual or organizational ? in exchange contracts . What type of contracts are to be enforced to maintain the conditions of an unhampered market ? We have already seen that contracts assigning away the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , because the will of each person is by its nature inalienable . On the other hand , if the individual made such a contract and received another 's property in exchange , he must forfeit part or all of the property when he decides to terminate the agreement . We shall see that fraud may be considered as theft , because one individual receives the other 's property but does not fulfill his part of the exchange bargain , thereby taking the other 's property without his consent . This case provides the clue to the role of contract and its enforcement in the free society . Contract must be considered as an agreed-upon exchange between two persons of two goods ,  | present or future . Persons would be free to make any and all property contracts that they wished ; and , for a free society to exist , all contracts , where the good is naturally alienable , must be enforced . Failure to fulfill contracts must be considered as theft of the other 's property . Thus , when a debtor purchases a good in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be considered his property until the agreed contract has been fulfilled and payment made . Until then , it remains the creditor 's property , and nonpayment would be equivalent to theft of the creditor 's property . An important consideration here is that contract not be enforced because a promise has been made that is not kept . It is not the business of the enforcing agency or agencies in the free market to enforce promises merely because they are promises ; its business is to enforce against theft of property , and contracts are enforced because of the implicit theft involved . Evidence of a promise to pay property is an enforceable claim , because the possessor of this claim is , in effect , the owner of the property involved , and failure to redeem the claim is equivalent to theft of the property . On the other hand , take the case of a promise to contribute personal services without an advance exchange of property . Thus , suppose that a movie actor agrees to act in three pictures for a certain studio for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , he breaks the contract and decides not to perform the work . Since his personal will is inalienable , he can not , on the free market , be forced to perform the work there . Further , since he has received none of the movie company property in exchange , he has committed no theft , and thus the contract can not be enforced on the free market . Any suit for " damages " could not be entertained on an unhampered market . The fact that the movie company may have made considerable plans and investments on the expectation that the actor would keep the agreement may be unfortunate for the company , but it could not expect the actor to pay for its lack of foresight and poor entrepreneurship . It pays the penalty for placing too much confidence in the man . The movie actor has not received and kept any of the company 's property and therefore can not be  | held accountable in the form of payment of goods as " damages . " Any such enforced payment would be an invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack upon invasion . It may be considered more moral to keep promises than to break them , but the condition of a free market is that each individual 's rights of person and property be maintained , and not that some further standard of morals be coercively imposed on all . Any coercive enforcement of such a moral code , going beyond the abolition of invasive acts , would in itself constitute an invasion of individual rights of person and property and be an interference in the free market . It certainly would be consonant with the free market , however , for the movie company to ask the actor to pay a certain sum in consideration of his breaking the contract , and , if he refuses , to refuse to hire him again , and to notify other prospective contracting parties ( such as movie companies ) of the person 's action . It seems likely that his prospect of making exchanges in the future will suffer because of his action . Thus , the " blacklist " is permissible on the free market . Another legitimate action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A urges B not to make an exchange with C , for whatever reason . Since A 's and B 's actions are purely voluntary and noninvasive , there is no reason for a boycott not to be permitted on the unhampered market . On the contrary , any coercive action against a boycott is an invasion against the rights of free persons . If default on contracted debts is to be considered as equivalent . to theft , then on the unhampered market its treatment by the enforcing agency will be similar to that of theft . It is clear ? for example , in the case of burglary ? that the recovery of the stolen property to its owner would be the fundamental consideration for the enforcing agency . Punishment of the wrongdoer would be a consideration subsidiary to the former . Thus , suppose A has stolen 100 ounces of gold from B. By the time A has been apprehended by the enforcing agency , he has dissipated the 100 ounces and has no assets by which the 100 ounces can be obtained . The maid goal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100 ounces . Thus , instead of simply idle imprisonment , the  | agency could force the thief to labor and to attach his earnings to make up the amount of the theft , plus a compensation for the delay in time . Whether this forced labor is done in or out of prison is immaterial here . The main point is that the invader of another 's rights on the free market gives up his rights to the same extent . The first consideration in the punishment of the aggressor against property in the free market is the forced return of the equivalent property . " On the other hand , suppose that B voluntarily decides to forgive A and grant the latter a gift of the property ; he refuses to " press charges " against the thief . In that case , the enforcement agency would take no action against the robber , since he is now in the position of the receiver of a gift of property . This analysis provides the clue to the treatment of defaulting debtors on the free market . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges , he in effect grants a gift of his property to the debtor , and there is no further room for enforcement of contract . What if the creditor insists on keeping his property ? It is clear that if the debtor can pay the required amount but refuses to do so , he is guilty of pure fraud , and the enforcing agency would treat his act as such . Its prime move would be to make sure that the debtor 's assets are transferred to their rightful owner , the creditor . But suppose that the debtor has not got the property and would be willing to pay if he had it ? Does this entitle him to special privilege or coerced elimination of the debt , as in the case of bankruptcy laws ? Clearly not . The prime consideration in the treatment of the debtor would be his continuing and primary responsibility to redeem the property of the creditor . The only way by which this treatment could be eliminated would be for the debtor and the creditor to agree , as part of the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails to have the property at the date due , the creditor will forgive the debt ; in short , he grants the debtor the rights of a partial co-owner of the property . There could be no room , in a free society such as we have outlined , for " negotiable instruments . " Where the government designates a good as " negotiable , " if A steals it from B and then sells  | it to C without the latter 's knowledge of the theft , B can not take the good back from C. Despite the fact that A was a thief and had no proper title to the good , C is decreed to be the legitimate owner , and B has no way of regaining his property . The law of negotiability is evidently a clear infringement of property right . Where property rights are fully defended , theft can not be compounded in this manner . The buyer would have to purchase at his own risk and make sure that the good is not stolen ; if he nonetheless does buy stolen goods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not at the expense of the rightful owner . What of a cartel agreement ? Would that be enforceable in a free society ? If there has been no exchange of property , and A , B , C . . . firms agree among themselves to set quotas on their production of a good , this agreement would surely not be illegal , but neither would it be enforceable . It could be only a simple promise and not an enforceable case of implicit theft . ' One difficulty often raised against a free society of individual property rights is that it ignores the problem of " external diseconomies " or " external costs . " But cases of " external diseconomy " all turn out to be instances of failure of government ? the enforcing agency ? adequately to enforce individual property rights . The " blame , " therefore , rests not on the institution of private property , but on the failure of the government to enforce this property right against various subtle forms of invasion ? the failure , e.g. , to maintain a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smoke , as well as air pollution generally . In so far as the outpouring of smoke by factories pollutes the air and damages the persons and property of others , it is an invasive act . It is equivalent to an act of vandalism and in a truly free society would have been punished after court action brought by the victims . Air pollution , then , is not an example of a defect in a system of absolute property rights , but of failure on the part of the government to preserve property rights . Note that the remedy , in a free society , is not the creation of an administrative State bureau to prescribe regulations for smoke control . The remedy is judicial action to punish and proscribe pollution damage to the person and property of others.411  | In a free society , as we have stated , every man is a self-owner . No man is allowed to own the body or mind of another , that being the essence of slavery . This condition completely overthrows the basis for a law of defamation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oral defamation ) . For the basis of outlawing defamation is that every man has a " property in his own reputation " and that therefore any malicious or untruthful attack on him or his character ( or even more , a truthful attack ! ) injures his reputation and therefore should be punished . However , a man has no such objective property as " reputation . " His reputation is simply what others think of him , i.e. , it is purely a function of the subjective thoughts of others . But a man can not own the minds or thoughts of others . Therefore , I can not invade a man 's property right by criticizing him publicly . Further , since I do not own others ' minds either , I can not force anyone else to think less of the man because of my criticism . The foregoing observations should firmly remind us that what the enforcing agency combats in a free society is invasion of the physical person and property , not injury to the values of property . For physical property is what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetary values , which are a function of what others will pay for his property . Thus , someone 's vandalism against , or robbery of , a factory is an invasion of physical property and is outlawed . On the other hand , someone 's shift from the purchase of this factory 's product to the purchase of a competing factory 's product may lower the monetary value of the former 's property , but this is certainly not a punishable act . It is precisely the condition of a free society that a property owner have no unearned claim on the property of anyone else ; therefore , he has no vested right in the value of his property , only in its physical existence . As for the value , this must take its chance on the free market . This is the answer , for example , to those who believe that " undesirable " businesses or people must be legally prevented from moving into a certain neighborhood because this may or will " lower the existing property value . " One method of acquiring property that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fraud involves cases where one party to an  | agreed-upon exchange deliberately refuses to fulfill his part of the contract . He thus acquires the property of the other person , but he sacrifices either none of the agreed-upon goods or less than he had agreed . We have seen that a debtor 's deliberate failure to pay his creditor is equivalent to an outright theft of the creditor 's property . Another example of fraudulent action is the following exchange : Smith agrees to give up fifteen ounces of gold to Jones in exchange for a package of certain specified chinaware . When he receives the package , after having given up the gold , Smith finds that he has received an empty crate instead of the goods that the two had agreed to exchange . Jones has falsely represented the goods that he would exchange , and here again this is equivalent to outright theft of Smith 's property . Since the exchange has been made falsely , the actual form of which might not have been contracted had the other party not been deceived , this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We therefore exclude both explicit violence and the implicit violence of fraud from our definition of the market ? the pattern of voluntary interpersonal exchanges . At this point we are dealing only with an analysis of the market unhampered by fraud or violence . We have not here been discussing what type of enforcing agency will be set up or the means it will use , but what type of actions the agency will combat and what type will be permissible . In a free market , all invasive acts by one person against another 's property , either against his person or his material goods , will be combatted by the enforcing agency or agencies . We are here assuming that there are no invasive acts in the society , either because no individuals commit them or because they are successfully combatted and prevented by some sort of enforcing agency . The problem then becomes one of defining invasive , as distinguished from noninvasive , acts , and this is what has been done here in various typical examples . Each man would be entitled to ownership over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired by production , by appropriation of unowned factors , by receiving gifts , or by voluntary exchange .  | Never has the basis of the free , noninvasive , or " voluntaryist " society been described more clearly in a brief space than by the British political philosopher Auberon Herbert : 1 ) The great natural fact of each person being born in possession of a separate mind and separate body implies the ownership of such mind and body by each person , and rights of direction over such mind and body ; it will be found on examination that no other deduction is reasonable . 2 ) Such self-ownership implies the restraint of violent or fraudulent aggressions made upon it . 3 ) Individuals , therefore , have the right to protect themselves by force against such aggressions made forcibly or fraudulently , and they may delegate such acts of self-defence to a special body called a government . . . Condensed into a few words , our Voluntaryist formula would run : " The sovereignty of the individual must remain intact , except where the individual coerced has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elaborating on the first point , Herbert continued : If there is one thing on which we can safely build , it is the great natural fact that each human being forms with his or her body and mind a separate entity ? from which we must conclude that the entities belong to themselves and not to each other . As I have said , no other deduction is possible . If the entities do not belong to themselves , then we are reduced to the most absurd conclusion . A or B can not own himself ; but he can own , or part own , C or D.5 ?  | We have seen in the previous chapter how exchange benefits each participant and how the division of labor on a market increases productivity . The only exchange so far discussed , however , has been direct exchange , or barter ? the exchange of one useful good for another , each for purposes of direct use by the party to the exchange . Although a treatment of direct exchange is important for economic analysis , the scope for direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive society , for example , Crusoe could employ Jackson to labor on his farm in exchange for a part of the farm produce . There could , however , be no advanced system of production in a direct-exchange society and no accumulation of capital in higher stages of production ? indeed no production at all beyond the most primitive level . Thus , suppose that A is a house-builder ; he builds a house on contract and employs masons , carpenters , etc . In a regime of direct exchange , how would it be possible to pay these men ? He could not give pieces of the house to each of the laborers . He would have to try to sell the house for precisely that combination of useful goods that each of the laborers and each of the sellers of raw material would accept . It is obvious that production could not be carried on and that the difficulties would be insuperable . This problem of the lack of " coincidence of wants " holds even for the simple , direct exchange of consumers ' goods , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suppose that A , with a supply of eggs for sale , wants a pair of shoes in exchange . B has shoes but does not want eggs ; there is no way for the two to get together . For anyone to sell the simplest commodity , he must find not only one who wants to purchase it , but one who has a commodity for sale that he must want to acquire . The market for anyone 's commodities is therefore extremely limited , the extent of the market for any product is very small , and the scope for division of labor negligible . Furthermore , someone with a less divisible commodity , such as a plow , is in worse straits . Suppose that D , with a plow , would like to exchange it for eggs , butter , shoes , and various other commodities . Obviously , he can not divide his plow into several pieces and then exchange the various pieces for eggs , butter , etc . The value of each piece to the others would be practically nil . Under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no marketability in exchange , and few if any would be produced . In addition to all these difficulties , which render a regime of direct exchange practically impossible , such a society could not solve the various problems of estimation , which ( as was seen in chapter 1 ) even Crusoe had to face . Since there would be no common denominator of units , there could be no way of estimating which line of production various factors should enter . Is it better to produce automobiles or tractors or houses or steel ? Is it more productive to employ fewer men and more land on a certain product or less land and more men ? Is the capital structure being maintained or consumed ? None of these questions could be answered , since , in the stages beyond immediate consumption , there would be no way of comparing the usefulness or the productivity of the different factors or products . The conclusion is evident that no sort of civilized society can he built on the basis of direct exchange , and that direct exchange , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most primitive type.2  | The tremendous difficulties of direct exchange can be overcome only by indirect exchange , where an individual buys a commodity in exchange , not as a consumers ' good for the direct satisfaction of his wants or for the production of a consumers ' good , but simply to exchange again for another commodity that he does desire for consumption or for production . Offhand , this might seem a clumsy and roundabout operation . Actually , it is indispensable for any economy above the barely primitive level . Let us return , for example , to the case of A , with a supply of eggs , who wants a pair of shoes in exchange . B , the shoemaker , has shoes for sale but does not desire any more eggs than he has in stock . A can not acquire shoes by means of direct exchange . If A wants to purchase a pair of shoes , he must find out what commodity B does want in exchange , and procure it . If A finds that B wants to acquire butter , A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then exchange this butter for B 's shoes . In this case , butter has been used as a medium of indirect exchange . The butter was worth more to A than the eggs ( say the exchange was ten dozen eggs for ten pounds of butter , then for one pair of shoes ) , not because he wanted to consume the butter or to use the butter to produce some other good in a later stage of production , but because the butter greatly facilitated his obtaining the shoes in exchange . Thus , for A , the butter was more marketable than his eggs and was worth purchasing because of its superior marketability . The pattern of the exchange was as shown in Fig. 30 . Or consider the enormous benefit that D , the owner of a plow , acquires by using a medium of exchange . D , who would like to  | acquire many commodities but finds that his plow has a very limited marketability , can sell it in exchange for quantities of a more marketable commodity , e.g. , butter . Butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike the plow , its nature is such that it does not lose its complete value when divided into smaller pieces . D now uses the butter as a medium of indirect exchange to obtain the various commodities that he desires to consume . Just as it is fundamental to human experience that there is great variety in resources , goods desired , and human skills , so is there great variety in the marketability of various commodities . Tending to increase the marketability of a commodity are its demand for use by more people , its divisibility into small units without loss of value , its durability , and its transportability over large distances . It is evident that people can vastly increase the extent of the market for their own products and goods by exchanging them for more marketable commodities and using the latter as media to exchange for goods that they desire . Thus , the pattern of D 's , the plow-producer 's , exchanges will be as shown in Fig. 31 . I ) first exchanges his plow for XI 's butter , and then uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires to use , with X2 for eggs , X3 for shoes , X4 for horses , etc.  | As the more marketable commodities in any society begin to be picked by individuals as media of exchange , their choices will quickly focus on the few most marketable commodities available . If D saw , for example , that eggs were a more marketable commodity than butter , he would exchange his plow for eggs instead and use them as his medium in other exchanges . It is evident that , as the individuals center on a few selected commodities as the media of exchange , the demand for these commodities on the market greatly increases . For commodities , in so far as they are used as media , have an additional component in the demand for them ? not only the demand for their direct use , but also a demand for their use as a medium of indirect exchange . This demand for their use as a medium is superimposed on the demand for their direct use , and this increase in the composite demand for the selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins as one of the most marketable commodities and is therefore more and more chosen as a medium , this increase in the market demand for butter greatly increases the very marketability that makes it useful as a medium in the first place . The process is cumulative , with the most marketable commodities becoming enormously more marketable and with this increase spurring their use as media of exchange . The process continues , with an ever-widening gap between the marketability of the medium and the other commodities , until finally one or two commodities are far more marketable than any others and are in general use as media of exchange . Economic analysis is not concerned about which commodities are chosen as media of exchange . That is subject matter for economic history . The economic analysis of indirect exchange holds true regardless of the type of commodity used as a medium in any particular community . Historically , many different commodities have been in common use as media . The people in each community tended to choose the most marketable commodity available : tobacco in colonial Virginia , sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ancient Greece , nails in Scotland , copper in ancient Egypt , and many others , including beads , tea , cowrie shells , and fishhooks . ' Through the centuries , gold and  | silver ( specie ) have gradually evolved as the commodities most widely used as media of exchange . Among the factors in their high marketability have been their great demand as ornaments , their scarcity in relation to other commodities , their ready divisibility , and their great durability . In the last few hundred years their marketable qualities have led to their general adoption as media throughout the world . A commodity that comes into general use as a medium of exchange is defined as being a money . It is evident that , whereas the concept of a " medium of exchange " is a precise one , and indirect exchange can be distinctly separated from direct exchange , the concept of " money " is a less precise one . The point at which a medium of exchange comes into " common " or " general " use is not strictly definable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be decided only by historical inquiry and the judgment of the historian . However , for purposes of simplification , and since we have seen that there is a great impetus on the market for a medium of exchange to become money , we shall henceforth refer to all media of exchange as moneys . The establishment of a money on the market enormously increases the scope for specialization and division of labor , irnmensely widens the market for every product , and makes possible a society on a civilized productive level . Not only are the problems of coincidence of wants and indivisibility of goods eliminated , but individuals can now construct an ever-expanding edifice of remote stages of production to arrive at desired goods . Intricate and remote stages of production are now possible , and specialization can extend to every part of a production process as well as to the type of good produced . Thus , an automobile producer can sell an automobile in exchange for the money , e.g. , butter or gold , and then exchange the gold partly for labor , partly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . The steel producers can exchange the gold partly for labor , partly for iron , partly for machines , etc . Then the various laborers.  | landowners , etc. , who receive the gold in the production process can use it as a medium to purchase eggs , automobiles , or clothing , as they desire . The whole pattern of a modern society is thus built on the use of money , and the enormous importance of the use of money will become clearer as the analysis continues . ' It is evident that it is a mistake on the part of many writers who wish to set forth the doctrines of modern economics to analyze direct exchange only and then to insert money somewhere at the end of the analysis , considering the task finished . On the contrary , the analysis of direct exchange is useful only as an introductory aid to the analysis of a society of indirect exchange ; direct exchange would leave very little scope for the market or for production . With the great variety in human skills and natural resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of money permits the splitting of production into minute branches , each man selling his product for money and using money to buy the products that he desires . In the field of consumers ' goods , a doctor can sell his services , or a teacher his , for money , and then use the money to purchase goods that he demands . In production , a man can produce a capital good , sell it for money , and use the gold received to purchase the labor , land , and capital goods of a higher order needed for its production . He may use the surplus of money income over money outlay on factors to purchase consumers ' goods for his own needs . Thus , at any stage in the production of any product , a man employs land and labor factors , exchanging money for their services as well as for the needed capital goods , and then sells the product for money to help in the next lower stage of production . This process continues until the final consumers ' goods are sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obtain their money by purchasing it through the sale of their own goods ? either durable consumers ' goods or services in production . The latter may include the sale of labor services , the sale of services of their land , the sale of their capital goods , or inheritance from those who had previously contributed such services . ' Thus , nearly all exchanges are made against money , and money impresses its stamp upon the entire economic system . Producer ,  | of consumers ' goods as well as owners of durable consumers ' goods , owners of capital goods , and sellers of labor services , all sell their goods against money and purchase with money the factors that they need . They use their net money income to purchase consumers ' goods produced by others in the society . Thus , all individuals , in their capacity as producers and owners , supply goods ( commodities and services ) and demand money in exchange . And , in their capacity as producers purchasing factors , as well as in their capacity as consumers , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange . The economy is therefore a " money economy , " and almost all goods are compared with and exchanged against the money commodity . This fact is of crucial importance to the analysis of any society beyond the most primitive level . We may sum up the complex pattern of exchanges in a money economy in the following way : Men in their capacity as : We have seen that every good is " in supply " if it can be divided into units , each of which is homogeneous with every other . Goods can be bought and sold only in terms of such units ,  | and those goods which are indivisible and unique may be described as being in a supply of one unit only . Tangible commodities are generally traded in terms of units of weight , such as tons , pounds , ounces , grains , grams , etc . The money commodity is no exception to this rule . The most universally traded commodity in the community , it is bought and sold always in terms of units of its weight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other metrical scales , that each unit is convertible into every other . Thus , one pound equals 16 ounces ; and one ounce equals 437.5 grains or 28.35 grams . Therefore , if Jones sells his tractor for 15 pounds of gold , he may also be described as having sold the tractor for 240 ounces of gold , or for 6,804 grams of gold , etc . It is clear that the size of the unit of the money commodity chosen for any transaction is irrelevant for economic analysis and is purely a matter of convenience for the various parties . All the units will be units of weight , and they will be convertible into pounds , ounces , etc. , by multiplying or dividing by some constant number , and therefore will all be convertible into one another in the same manner . Thus , one pound of gold will equal 16 ounces and will , of course , exchange for 16 ounces , should such an exchange be desired on the market . The economic irrelevance of the names or sizes of the units may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Texas use , in their exchanges , a unit known as the Houston , equalling 20 grains of gold , while the residents of Massachusetts use the Adams , equalling 10 grains . The citizens of the respective areas may make their exchanges and calculations in these terms , e.g. , Jones sells his car for " 2,000 Houstons of gold , " or , more simply , " 2,000 Houstons , " or Jones might consider the money price of eggs as being " % Houston per dozen . " On the other hand , Smith might buy a house for " 10,000 Adamses . " It is obvious that the use of the different names will complicate matters but is economically insignificant . The " Houston " is still a unit of weight of gold , and is a shorthand name for " 20 grains of gold . " It is clear that , on the market , 1 Houston will exchange for 2 Adamses.7 To avoid unnecessary complications and to clarify the analy- sis , therefore , the names of the monetary units in this work will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as ounces , grams , etc. ) rather than in terms of accidental names of only local significance ( such as dollars or francs ) . Obviously , the more valuable the units of a commodity are , the smaller the size of the units used in daily transactions ; thus , platinum will be traded in terms of ounces , while iron is traded in terms of tons . Relatively valuable money commodities like gold and silver will tend to be traded in terms of smaller units of weight . Here again , this fact has no particular economic significance . The form in which a unit weight of any commodity is traded depends on its usefulness for any specific , desired purpose . Thus , iron may be sold in the form of bars or chunks , cheese in rectangular or triangular shape , etc . Whereas other commodities will be traded in those forms suitable for production or consumption , money will be traded in forms suitable for exchange or storing until an exchange is made . Historically , the shapes of money have been innumerable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been used for storage or for exchange in larger transactions , while smaller , circular pieces , known as coins , are used for smaller transactions . 5 . Money Income and Money Expenditures In a money economy , each individual sells goods and services that he owns for money and uses the money to buy desired goods . Each person may make a record of such monetary exchanges for any period of time . Such a record may be called his balance of payments for that period . One record may be the transactions of goods sold for money in a certain period to other individuals . Suppose , for example , that Mr. Brown draws up the record of goods sold for money for the month of September , 1961 . Suppose that he has sold his services as a carpenter to a Mr. Jones in building the latter 's house and has sold his services also as a handyman to Messrs . Jones and Smith during the same period . Also , he has disposed of an old  | radio to Mr. Johnson . His account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services sold , is as follows : From the account , we know that by his sales of goods and services during this period , Brown has purchased 26 ounces of gold . This total of money purchased is his total of money income for that period . It is clear that the more money income a man receives during any period , the more money he will be able to spend on desired goods . Other things being equal ( an important qualification that will be examined in later sections ) , he will strive to earn as much money income in any prospective period as he can . Mr. Brown acquired his income by selling his labor services and a durable consumers ' good . There are other ways of acquiring money income on an unhampered market . The owner of land may sell it for agricultural , locational , or industrial , as well as other , purposes . The owner of capital goods may sell them to those interested in using them as factors of production . Tangible land and capital goods may be sold for money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good while selling ownership of its services over a certain period of time . Since any good is bought only for the services that it can bestow , there is no reason why a certain period of service of a good may not be purchased . This can be done , of course , only where it is technically possible . Thus , the owner of a plot of land or of a sewing machine or of a house may " rent it out " for a certain period of time in exchange for money . While such hire may leave legal ownership of the good in the hands of the " landlord , " the actual owner of the good 's service for that period is the renter , or " tenant . " At the  | end of the hire period , the good is returned to the original owner , who may use or sell the remainder of the services . In addition to the sale of goods and services , a man may receive money as a gift . A man does not purchase the money he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equals his money purchased , plus the money he receives in gifts . ( One common form of receipt of gift is an inheritance , the result of a bequest at death . ) Thus , Mr. Green 's account of money income for June to December , 1961 , may be as follows : As was seen in the previous chapter , in order first to acquire the good or service that a man can sell for money , he must first either produce it himself or buy it from someone who has produced it ( or who , in turn , has bought it from the original producer ) . If he has been given money , the original owner must have acquired it through producing a good , etc . Thus , in the last analysis , the first seller of a capital good or a durable consumers ' good is the original producer , and later purchasers must have produced some service of their own in order to obtain the money to acquire it . The seller of labor service , of course , produces the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must originally have appropriated unused land which he had found and transformed . On the unhampered market of a money economy , producers of commodities and services sell their goods for the money commodity , then use the money acquired to buy other desired goods .  | Money is acquired in this way by all except the producers of the original gold on the market ? those who mined and marketed it . However , the production of the money commodity , as with all other valuable commodities , itself requires the use of land , labor , and capital goods , and these must be paid for by the use of money . The gold miner , then , receives no money by gift , but must actively find and produce gold to acquire his money . With the use of money acquired in these various ways , individuals purchase desired goods . They do so in two capacities : as consumers and as producers . As consumers , they purchase consumers ' goods that they desire ; in the case of durable goods , they may purchase the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some specified period of time . As producers , they use money to purchase the services of factors of production needed to produce consumers ' goods or lower-order capital goods . Some factors they may purchase outright , to use all their anticipated future services ; some they may hire for their services for a specified period of time . Thus , they may purchase capital goods that function as " raw material " ; they may purchase some capital goods called " machines " and hire others ; they may hire or purchase the land that they need to work on . In general , just as consumers can not very well hire short-lived , nondurable goods , so producers can not very well hire capital goods , dubbed " raw material " or " inventory , " that are used up quickly in the process of production . On a free market , they can not purchase labor services outright , as was explained in the preceding chapter . Since man 's personal will is inalienable , he can not , in a voluntary society , be compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore no contracts can be made for purchase of his future will . Labor services , therefore , can only be bought for " hire , " on a " pay-as-you-go " basis . Any individual may draw up an account of his purchases of other goods with money for any period of time . The total amount of money given up in such exchanges is his money expenditures or money outlays for that period . Here it must be noted that his expenditure account , as well as his income account , can be itemized for each transaction or may be grouped into various classes .  | Thus , in Brown 's account above , he might have tabulated his income as 25 ounces from labor in general , and 1 ounce from his radio . How broad or narrow the classes are depends purely on the convenience of the person drawing up the account . The total , of course , is always unaffected by the type of classification chosen . Just as money income equaled money purchased for goods and services sold plus money received as gifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought plus money given away as gifts . Thus , Mr. Brown 's money expenditure account for September , 1961 , might be the following : In this account , Brown is spending money purely as a consumer , and his total money expenditures for the period are 24 ounces . If he had desired it , he could have subdivided the account further into such items as apples , 1/5 ounce ; hat , 1 ounce , etc . Here it may be noted that an individual 's total money income for any period may be termed his exports , and the goods sold may be termed the " goods exported " ; on the other hand , his total money expenditure may be termed his imports , and the goods and services bought are the " goods imported . " These terms apply to goods purchased by producers or consumers . Now , let us observe and compare Mr. Brown 's income and expenditure accounts for September , 1961 . Brown 's total money  | income was 26 ounces of gold , his money expenditures 24 ounces . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this period remained unspent . These 2 ounces remain in the possession of Mr. Brown , and are therefore added to whatever previous stock of gold Brown might have possessed . If Brown 's stock of money on September 1 , 1961 , was 6 ounces of gold , his stock of money on October 1 , 1961 , is 8 ounces of gold . The stock of money owned by any person at any point in time is called his cash holding or cash balance at that time . The 2 ounces of income remaining unspent on goods and services constituted a net addition to Brown 's cash balance over the month of September . For any period , therefore , a person 's money income is equal to his money outlay plus his addition to cash balance . If we subdivide this income-expenditure account into smaller periods of time , the picture of what is happening to the cash balance within the larger period is likely to be far different from a simple addition of 2 ounces . Thus , suppose that all of Brown 's money income came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September , while his expenditures occurred every day in varying amounts . As a result , his cash balance rose drastically on September 1 , say to 6 plus 13 or a total of 19 ounces . Then , the cash balance was gradually drawn down each day until it equaled 6 again on the 15th ; then it rose sharply again to 19 , finally being reduced to 8 at the month 's end . The pattern of Brown 's supplies and demands on the market is clear . Brown supplied various goods and services on the market and demanded money in exchange . With this money income , he demanded various goods and services on the market and supplied money in exchange . The money must go into the cash balance before it can be spent on goods and services.s Suppose , on the other hand , that Brown 's expenditures for September had been 29 ounces instead of 24 ounces . This was accomplished by drawing down Brown 's previous cash balance by 3 ounces and leaving him with 3 ounces in his cash holding . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money income plus the decrease in his cash balance . In sung , the  | following formula always holds true for any individual over any period of time : Money Income = Money Expenditures + Net Additions to Cash Balance ? Net Subtractions from Cash Balance Alternatively , the term Exports can be substituted for Income , and Imports for Expenditures , in the above equation . Let us assume for purposes of simplification that the total stock of the money commodity in the community has remained unchanged over the period . ( This is not an unrealistic assumption , since newly mined gold is small compared to the existing stock . ) Now it is obvious that , like all valuable property , all money must , at any point in time , be owned by someone . At any point in time , the sum of the cash holdings of all individuals is equal to the total stock of money in the community . Thus , if we consider Brown among a group of five persons living in a village , and their respective cash balances on September 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 5 ounces , then the total stock of money held in the village on that date was 34 ounces . If the data were available , the same sort of summation could be performed for the world as a whole , and the total stock of money discovered . Now it is obvious that Brown 's addition of 2 ounces to his cash balance for September must have been counterbalanced by a subtraction of 2 ounces from the cash balances of one or more other individuals . Since the stock of money has not changed , Brown 's addition to his cash balance must have been acquired by drawing down the cash balances of other individuals . Similarly , if Brown had drawn down his cash balance by 3 ounces , this must have been counterbalanced by the addition of 3 ounces to the cash balance of one or more individuals . It . is important to recognize that the additions to , or subtract ions from , a cash balance are all voluntary acts on the part of the individuals concerned . In each period , some individuals decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce them , and each makes that decision which he believes will benefit him most.10 For centuries , however , fallacious popular usage has asserted that one whose income is greater than expenditures ( ex- ports greater than imports ) has a " favorable balance of trade , " while one whose expenditures have been greater than income for a period ( imports greater than exports ) has suffered an " unfavorable balance of trade . " Such a view implies that the active , important part of the balance of payments is the " trade " part , the exports and imports , and that the changes in the individual 's cash balance are simply passive " balancing factors , " serving to keep the total payments always in balance . In other words , it assumes that the individual spends as much as he wants to on goods and services and that the addition or subtraction from his cash balance appears as an afterthought . On the contrary , changes in cash balance are actively decided upon by each individual in the course of his market actions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ounces and sold his labor services to obtain the money , forgoing purchases of consumers ' goods to the extent of 2 ounces . Conversely , in the later example , when he spent 3 ounces more than he earned in the month , he decided that his cash balance had been excessive and that he would rather spend some of it on consumers ' goods and services . There is therefore never a need for anyone to worry about anyone else 's balance of payments . A person 's " unfavorable " balance of trade will continue so long as the individual wishes to reduce his cash balance ( and others are willing to purchase his money for goods ) . His maximum limit is , of course , the point when his cash balance is reduced to zero . Most likely , however , he will stop reducing his cash balance long before this point " The previous section concentrated on the case of Mr. Brown , whose entire money expenditures were on consumers ' goods . I1 is money income , aside from the sale of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current productive labor services . His expenditures were purely on consumption ; his income was derived almost solely from his production of labor services . Every man must be a consumer , and therefore this analysis of consumer spending applies to all persons . Most people earn their income  | from the sale of their labor services . However , if we except previously produced goods , because someone must have originally produced them , all other money incomes must derive from new production of capital goods or consumers ' goods . ( This is apart from the sellers of land or its services , whose ownership must have originally derived from the finding and reshaping of unappropriated land . ) Producers of capital goods and consumers ' goods are in a different position from sellers of labor service only . Mr. Brown , for example , a seller solely of labor service , need not spend any money on purchasing capital goods . Purely from his expenditure on desired consumers ' goods , he derives the energy to be able to produce and sell labor services on the market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the nub of any civilized society , since labor services alone could produce very little ? are not and can not be in such a fortunate position . For a man to produce a consumers ' good , he must obtain labor services and the services of land and capital goods , in order to use the technological " know-how " available in the production of the good . Pushing the problem back , we find that , in order to produce a capital good , the would-be producer must obtain the necessary land , labor , and capital goods . Each such individual producer ( or group of individuals in partnership ) obtains the required factors and then directs the combination of factors into producing a capital good . This process is repeated among numerous individuals , until the lowest stage of production is reached and a consumers ' good is produced . The producer of the capital good must obtain the needed factors ( land , labor , and capital ) by purchasing them for money , and , when the ( lower-order ) capital good is completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in turn , used for the production of a still lower-order capital good , and the latter is sold for money . This process continues until the final producer of the consumers ' good sells it for money to the ultimate consumer . A simplified schematic representation of this process is shown in Fig. 32 . The solid arrows depict the movement of goods in exchange , as factors are bought by the producers at each stage , worked into a  | lower-order capital good , and then sold to lower-order producers . The broken arrows in the reverse direction depict the movement of money in the same exchanges . The producer of a capital good employed money that he owned to purchase factors of production . He then used these owned factors , along with hired labor services , to produce a lower-order capital good that he owned until he could sell it for money to another producer . The producer of a consumers ' good went through the same process , except that his final sale for money was to the ultimate consumer .  | Now let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the purchase of factors ( either outright or for hire ) capitalists . The capitalists then produce and own the various stages of capital goods , exchanging them for money until their products reach the consumers . Those who participate in the productive process are therefore the capitalists and the sellers of land and labor services . The capitalists are the only ones who spend money on producers ' goods , and they , therefore , may here be termed " the producers . " It is evident that a dominant characteristic of the production process is that each individual must produce in anticipation of the sale of his product . Any investment in production is made in anticipation of later sale to lower-order producers and , finally , to consumers . Clearly , the consumer must have money in his cash balance in order to spend it on consumers ' goods , and , likewise , the producer must have the original money to invest in factors . Where does the consumer get the money ? As has been shown above , he may obtain it from gifts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last analysis he must have obtained it from the sale of some productive service . The reader can inspect the final destinations of the broken arrows ; these are the sellers of labor services and of the services of land . These laborers and landowners use the money thus obtained to buy the final products of the production system . The capitalist-producers also receive income at each stage of the production process . Evidently , the principles regulating these incomes require careful investigation , which will he undertaken below . Here it might be noted that the net incomes accruing to the owners of capital goods are not simply the result of the contribution to production by the capital goods , since these capital goods are in turn the products of other factors . Where , then , do the producers acquire their money for investment ? Clearly , from the same sources only . From the income acquired in production , individuals can , in addition to buying consumers ' goods , purchase factors of production and engage in the productive process as producers of a good that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
