" A bad blunder has been made by the Queen 's advisers , and it is hard to see how they will extricate themselves from the booby trap . " The London Evening Standard spoke like a firm but indulgent nanny ; half a dozen other London papers chimed in with dismay , outrage , chagrin . Cause of the clamor-and envy : the news that Antony Armstrong-Jones is going to work for the opposition . <P> Armstrong-Jones , besides being Princess Margaret 's husband , is also the Earl of Snowdon and until his career ended in marriage , he was a competent freelance photographer . Weighing all these credentials , Roy Thomson , Canadian-born publisher of 93 papers , had hired Tony as " artistic adviser " to Thomson 's prestigious London Sunday Times ( circ. 1,022,913 ) . The salary-a reported 7,500 quid ( $21,000 ) - was regal enough on Fleet Street . But the rest of Fleet Street promptly hollered foul . <P> Jealousy Showing . At first the London Sunday Observer ( circ. 727,964 ) , which is challenging the Times 's Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Earl 's new job ran 17 deadpan words . Then the Observer 's wrath spilled over . " Everyone , including the Observer , " observed the Observer , " has said that a royal marriage should not preclude Lord Snowdon from doing work . But we believe he has chosen the wrong kind of job . " <P> Even while pleading the impropriety of Margaret 's spouse 's becoming a newsman , the Observer could not hide its jealousy . " It will inevitably seem unfair to rival newspapers and magazines that the Queen 's close relative is used for the enrichment of the Thomson empire . " <P> Jungle Screams . Although no other paper felt quite so strongly , few but Thomson 's Sunday Times , which had Tony in the bag , could resist sounding off . The London Daily Sketch puckered with a mild case of sour grapes : " Lord Snowdon sharpens his artistic genius for readers of the Sunday Times . " Cassandra ( William Connor ) , London Daily Mirror columnist , was moved by amusement : " Now Tony Snowdon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ' a royal Dicky-bird ' , has flown from Kensington Palace to the jungle that is Fleet Street . In a trice , the macaws , the parrots and other screaming birds in the inky undergrowth have set up a-screeching and a-yelling that splits the eardrums . " <P> Amid the general chorus of disapproval ( including the charge that Thomson wanted to use Tony to land a peerage ) , a few mild voices rose : " The Mirror hopes Mr. Jones will stick to his job . " If he did n't , added the Mirror slyly , Tony was more than welcome on the Mirror 's staff- " at considerably less money . " <P> About the only person who did not offer an opinion was the Dicky-bird himself . He was on holiday with his princess , spreading his feathers to the Antigua sun , waiting to shoulder his new duties next month . And keeping his beak shut .
