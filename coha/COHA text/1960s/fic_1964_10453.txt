worry where it comes from . Whether it 's an ode of Horace or an Icelandic saga or something that goes bang in a laboratory . " He made no comment on the answer that I drafted , but he signed it , and thereafter , without further discussion , I found my- self in charge of the letters from graduates . It fascinated me that there were so many of these . At times it seemed to me that Justinians had nothing better to do than write their old headmaster . Some of the letters were childishly boast i ng . " You will observe from the letterhead that I am now a partner in . . . " or " Did you ever , Dr. P , expect to address me as a fellow doctor ?

The Prescott they had remembered , by God , was the real Prescott ! His schedule is phenomenal for a man of eighty . He rises at six , in the tradition of the great Victorians , and reads for an hour before breakfast . He claims that a mind continually soaked in small school matters needs this daily airing to preserve any freshness . He reads speedily and broadly , with an emphasis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modernfiction , he is happiest with the Greek poets . He then officiatesat morning chapel , presides over assembly and spends a busy morning in his office at the Schoolhouse . Lunch at the head table is followed by a half hour of faculty coffee , known as the " time for favors , " when he is at his most easy and affable . The afternoon is devoted to the physical inspection of his plant , and in the course of a week he visits every part of the school grounds , some of them many times over : the playing fields , the infirmary , the gymnasium , the locker rooms , the dormitories , even the cellars and lavatories . Dinner is at home , with guests , usually visiting graduates , but after the meal he retires to his study for two more hours of paper work and conferences with boys . At ten o'clock he has a couple of strong whiskeys and the day is over . During prohibition he gave these up , and he tells me that it was a sore denial . March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great snowball fight between the first and second forms , " new kids " against " old kids . " Except in a few individual struggles , the latter prevailed ; they were bigger and stronger and had been toughened by an additional year of the rigors of Justin Martyr . The scene was like a battle canvas of the Victorian academic42school . At a distance it was picturesque , even cheerful , full of red faces and brightly colored jerseys against a white backgroundcut by stark , slaty elms . But on closer inspection the details were more lurid . I saw one little boy with a bleeding lip cut open by a piece of ice and another carried off the field with what turned out later to be a cracked ankle . Dr. Prescott did not seem in the least disturbed . " You 've got to let the boys be animals once in a while , " he answered my protest as we walked away . " Social life was more attractive when gentlemen defended their honor with swords and not with lawsuits . " " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , no , of coin se not , " he growled . " I said that life was more attractive , not better . When every sniveling calumniator knew that he Ian the chance of being called out . Just the way boys are more attractive when they 're allowed to take justice into their own hands and not squeal ! " I was learning , little by little , not to be overwhelmed by him . " I ) o you suggest that boys are mollycoddled at Justin today , sir ? " The question obviously irritated hint , for he stomped ahead of me and did not answer , but after a few moments , when I had caught up with him , he said wildly enough : " Well , of course , there 's no hazing now . All the schools have done away with it , and we had to , too . The snowball fight is the last vestigial remnantof it . You have just witnessed a rare survival , my friend . " " It did not make me nostalgic . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now his more reasoningtone . " Perhaps my bias for things English made me see a moral value in hazing where none existed . There was a great deal of cruelty in English public schools in the last century , but it went hand in hand with a certain intensity of friendship betweenboys  --  almost a passion , you might say  --  that gave a kind of golden glow to Victorian youth . Of course in America43this sort of thing was understood only at its lowest level , with the result that we took over the hazing and discouraged the friendships . It may have been this that gave our boarding schools their peculiar dryness . Oh , yes , Brian . " Here he paused to nod his head affirmatively . " The hazing had to go . " " But you never discouraged close friendships between boys , did you , sir ? " " Did I not ? " He grunted loudly . " I was one of the worst ! " " Why , sir ? " " Because , sir , " he exclaimed loudly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think a hundred examples of David and Jonathan were worth one of sodomy ! " I was too shocked to say more . But I am beginning to glimpse some of the conflicts in his nature . He is an artist as well as a preacher , an intellectual as well as a man of God . He probably adores Swinburne and forces himself not to read him . In this he differs from the famous Dr. Peabody of Groton who preached here last week . Peabody would not see the beauty in Swinburneor be tempted by the Loreleis of art . His is a simpler path . March i6 . I asked Dr. Prescott this afternoon his opinion of Peabody . He gave me one of his foxy , sidelong looks and snapped : " A man who considers that Theodore Roosevelt was America 's greatest statesman and In Memoriam England 's finest poem is well equipped to train young men for the steam room of the Racquet Club . " " That 's not where Franklin Roosevelt ended up , " I pointed out . Dr. Prescott threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but ninety percent of the Grotties wish he had ! And evaporated there ! " His laugh ended in a spluttering cough , and he leaned over until he recovered himself . " Of course , I 'm being facetious . Cotty Peabody is a great man , in his way. 44What I really resent is that my graduates are not more different from his . For all my emphasis on the humanities and his on God , we both turn out stockbrokers ! " " Oh , come , sir . You 're not being fair to yourself . Or to Dr. Peabody . " " And yet it may be just what explains our popularity , " he continued in a more speculative tone , ignoring my comment . " Most fathers would rather see their sons dead than either cultivatedor devout . They conunend our efforts , but even more our failures . Yes , the greatness of the private school , Brian , is not that it produces geniuses  --  they grow anyway , and ca n't be made  --  but that it can sometimes turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't boast publicly of such triumphs , btu t hey are still our glory . " " I wonder if 1 ) r . Peabody would agree with that . " " Dr. Peabody does n't believe in laughing at sacred things , " he said dryly . " And 1 ) r . Peabody is right . A sense of humor is excess baggage in a boys ' school . Except to fight snobbishness . " He nodded ruefully . " Yes , we need it to fight snobbishness . " " Is there so much snobbishness at Justin ? " " My dear fellow , we 're riddled witty it ! Every private school is . Snobbishness is a cancer in America because we pretend it 's not there and let it grow until it 's inoperable . In England it 's less dangerous because it 's out in the open . In fact , they glory in it . But if a boy can only see it , there may be one chance in ten that he 'll fight it . " " You mean that ninety percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have answered three questions , and that is enough , ' " he quoted irritably , " ' be off , or I 'll kick you downstairs ' ! " That was the end of our conversation for that afternoon , and it has taught me a valuable lesson . When he is in one of his destructivemoods , it is fatal to try to check him . It is as if on the heath I tried to argue with the raging Lear . My function is to listen , not to console. 45April i8 . The Reverend Duncan Moore , Rector of St. Jude 's Church in New York , was the visiting preacher this morning . I listened with the keenest interest for he is generally regarded as the most likely candidate to succeed Dr. Prescott . I 'm afraid I did not like him . He is a big , beaming , smiling , balding , large-nosed man , handsome in an aggressive way and too good a speaker ( I think ) to be truly spiritual . But of course I am horribly prejudiced . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a preacher he is drawn to humility like a lemming to the sea . His theme this morning was the war in Europe which he seems to regard as a judgment upon us for the arrogance and materialism of the inter-war decades . Mr. Moore may not actuallybelieve that God sent the war as a scourge , but he seems to think that we should pretend he did , that we should assume a superstition if we have it not . I walked to Lawrence House after the service with Mr. Ives and found him at his most sarcastic . " I feel so reassured , do n't you , Brian ? I have been foolishly worried about the war . Is n't it nice that Mr. Moore has found time to desert his fashionable parish and travel north to give us the good word ? To think that all along it has been a blessing in disguise ! " I no longer glanced about to see if any boys were within earshot . I had learned that they never were . Mr. Ives ' indiscretionswere totally discreet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the best out of things , " I urged . " Even war . " " Rot , Brian , " he retorted sharply . " And you know it , too . Nothing but death and destruction come out of war . England and France are fighting Hitler . If they can put him down , that 's all they can expect . The patient after surgery does n't emerge better than if he 'd never had a tumor . " " Even if he has faith that he will ? " 46 " Then it will be the faith that has done it and not the opera-tion . " I shrugged . " I ca n't argue with you . You know I agree . " " Then will you kindly admit that Duncan Moore is an egregiousass ! " " How can I ? " I pleaded in pain . " How can I admit that Dr. Prescott has anointed an ass ? " " Because it 's precisely what great men do . " " Moor ( ' may improve with responsibility . He will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wo n't ! " Mr. Ives exclaimed in a barklike tone that came closer to expressing fervor than any of his others . " I shall not remain in Justin a minute after Dr. Prescott goes . And I am very nn lc It afraid he will go soon . " I stopped to stare in dismay at the small hawklike figure at my side . " What makes you say that ? " I'her e arc signs , " he said flatly . " I am very sensitive to signs . " There was one , for example , in the sermon today . The new c d i f ice to he erected on the site of the old . The fresh air in stale rooms . Do n't you get it ? A glittering new Justin Martyr to be fabricated by Duncan Moore out of the rotten timbers of the old . " The calm clear blank sky , the few , almost stationary wispy clouds , the hard pink buds on the dogwood trees by the Schoolhouse , the sudden whoop of a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep clang of the Schoolhouse bell that tolled the quarter hour filled me with a sense of sadnessat the transiency of good things . My soul seemed to cry out : let me enjoy it , dear God , if this is all there will be to enjoy ! The campus of Justin may be a haven from the war , a haven from reality , but when reality is so grim , to be a haven may be a virtuous thing . Soon , only too soon , reality will burst the walls and swell the gutters of the school to boiling livid streams , but the interim is ours and is not the interim as real as reality ? 4BRIAN 'S JOURNALMAY 15 , 1940 . This is my first entry since the catastrophic invasionof the lowlands . Dr. Prescott has great faith in the Englishand French armies , particularly the English , but I have a sad tendency to identify the " good " side in any conflict with the weak side and to see the war as Brian Aspinwall against a Germantank division . It seems curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little in man . But then barbarians have prevailed before , have they not ? The dark ages did exist . May 18 , 1940 . The fiend in Europe goes from triumph to triumph . If only I were there . If only I had stayed in Oxford . Surely , even with my heart murmur they would have accepted me now . But there I go again , thinking of the war in terms of what I could do in it , even though I 'd be a rotten soldier . What would my enlistment amount to but the placation of my own grubby little sense of guilt ? Oh , ego , ego , burning like an ember in the conflagration of the world ! May 21 . Even Dr. Prescott is beginning to be depressed . " If they get France , it 's all over , " he told me this morning . " What can England do without a proper army or air force ? If she had time , yes , but where is the time coming from ? Oh , to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every useless old man like48myself should be given a rifle and rushed to the front . " He , too ! May 22 . The fall of Brussels . It 's wonderful how little the boys care . But that must be the hope of the world , indifference . If we cared , how could we live ? May 23 . Disaster has sent a peculiar ambassador into our peacefulmidst . It is Mr. Horace Havistock , Dr. Prescott 's oldest friend , who has lived in Paris for fifty years and who , with rare foresight , decided to repatriate himself only two weeks before the blitzkrieg . He stays shut up in the headmaster 's house and has appeared only once in the school dining room , where he sat at Dr. Prescott 's right . He seems much older than his host , though they are supposed to be the same age . He is very bent and brown , with thick snowy hair , and he leaned heavily on Dr. Prescott 's arm as he hobbled in and out of the dining room . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather superb . He was wearing a high wing collar , striped trousers , a morning coat and black button boots of lustered polish . Mr. Ives tells me that his valet has to get up every night at two to " turn " him in bed . May 25 . Stories about Mr. Havistock , who remains secluded , continue to enliven the faculty coffee hour . A school is like a small town , and we all need a bit of comic relief in these grim days . Dr. Prescott 's houseguest has the function as the porter in the second act of Macbeth ; he keeps the suspense from becomingunbearable . Apparently he requires constant service . Breakfast must be on the dot of eight , and when poor old Mrs. Midge , the housekeeper , comes toiling up the stairs with his heavy tray , she is apt to find him waiting on the landing , his eye fixed to his great gold pocket watch , demanding : " Pray tell me , Mrs. Midge , 49is my watch fast ? I have eight-one . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'd have fixed him ! How on earth did Dr. Prescott ever become intimate with this elegant old dandy ? Mr. Ives says it must be a case of oppositesattracting . May 26 . Dr. Prescott told me this morning that he was much upset by Mr. Havistock 's opinion of the inner state of France . " He says it 's rotten right through . That we must anticipate not only defeat but active collaboration with the enemy . " " You do n't suppose he 's judging it by his own social circle ? " Dr. Prescott looked up with a trace of amusement in his eyes . " What do you know about his social circle ? " " Nothing . But is n't it the same one that Proust wrote about ? " " Or what 's left of it , " Dr. Prescott conceded with a chuckle . " As a matter of fact , he was a friend of Proust 's . He took Harrietto call on him once in the cork-lined chamber . He would n't take me ; he said I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Horace 's social life . He may be a hothouse plant , but he sees a great deal from his hothouse windows . He is wise , Horace . Very wise . " " He is wise , anyway , in his choice of friends , " I ventured . " Oh , Horace only cut his teeth on me , " Dr. Prescott said with a laugh . " We were at school together . Since then he has gone way beyond me . But he is loyal . He remembers the old days . " " I should n't think a life in the Paris salons was necessarily going so far beyond Justin Martyr . " Dr. Prescott seemed thoroughly amused by my reservations about his friend . " Ah , but Horace did not confine himself to duchesses . He knew your hero , James . He knew Conrad and Hardy . He was intimate with Proust . Redon did the panels in his living room , and Braque the drawings in his study . Horacehas an instinctive understanding of the problems of importantpeople . He loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And how does he feel about little children ? " " Perish the thought ! " Dr. Prescott threw up his hands . " I see you have been listening to school tattle about poor Horace . No doubt Justin can make little enough of him . But come and have tea with him this afternoon and judge for yourself . " " What on earth will I talk to hint about ? " I cried in dismay . " James ! The master , " he retorted with mocking emphasis and turned to his mail . Well , I went . I was nervous all clay and my nervousness was not diminished when I carte into Mrs. Prescott 's old drawing room and found Mr. Iavistock seated before her tea tray checking each plate before dismissing the hovering Mrs. Midge . I to paid no attention whatever to my entrance . " Now , let Inc see . Is my half piece of lime there ? Ah , yes , I see it is . And is the toast buttered on both sides ? It was n't yesterday . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I think that tvill be all for now , Mrs. Midge . I 'll ring if I need any-thing. " ' 1 ' 1w world in flames and he worries about his toast being butteredon both sides ! There must have been five minutes of fussing with the tea things before he finally leaned back in Mrs. Prescott 's old chair , touched the tips . of his long fingers together before his hawk nose and gazed at me shrewdly . " Well , Mr. Aspinwall ! Frank tells me you were a friend of Harriet 's . I can imagine no greater recommendation , for she was a woman of perfect taste . Oh , perhaps not always in clothes . . . " He raised his dark eyebrows which formed a striking contrast to his snowy hair and coughed . " And yet even her clothes , in a wonderful basic Bostonian way , had style . " I looked back now into his small cold grey eyes with a greater sympathy . " It is true . She had great style . " " It is to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your generation has had little opportunity to observe it . It went out with the last war . Or even before . " There was a long pause as he took a sip of his tea and a bite of his doubly but-51tered toast . " Style , " he repeated reflectively . " Odette in the Bois as Proust describes her in Swann . " He looked up at nee now with sudden aggressiveness . " Do you agree there have been no writers since Proust ? " " Not Hemingway ? " I protested . " Not Lewis or O'Neill or Fitzgerald ? " " They had talent . " His shrug implied that this was to the man what the cravat was to the wardrobe . " I knew Lewis and young Fitzgerald . But they were not presentable . You could n't depend on what they 'd do or say . They bore in their souls the malaise of a dying world . It was art but corrupt art . " I saw there was no purpose in going on with that . " Dr. Prescotttells me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course I knew him . Do n't you know the Lubbock correspondence ? There are several letters to me in it . So he was that Havistock , the " dear , dear boy " ! Was it possible that this relic before me had once been young ? I can quite see Dr. Prescott as a youth , but not Mr. Havistock . Perhapsit was only one of James ' hyperbolean compliments . " Have you ever written your memoirs , sir ? " " Not really . I started a little book that was to be entitled ' The Art of Friendship , ' but I never got very far with it , and now I never shall . " He smiled complacently . " I 'm too old . " " But I would have thought that just the time to write mem-oirs . " " Also I 'm lazy , Mr. Aspinwall . " He shook his head solemnly as if he were proclaiming a virtue . " I was born for the oral and not the written word . Some of the pages were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a nice little thing on Rejane and a few good stories about Anatole France . But the only one I completed was the piece on Frank Prescott . About our early days . " My mouth went suddenly dry . " You would n't let me see it ? " " Oh , good gracious no . It 's highly confidential . " 52 " But if I swore I 'd never repeat a word of it ? " He looked up at me , surprised at my eagerness . " Why should you care ? When you have Frank in the flesh , what is the fascinationof ancient memories ? " " Because I want to know everything about him . How it all started , for example . The whole idea of Justin ! " " You wish to write his life ? " " Oh no , sir . I 'm not so ambitious . I simply want to know . " " You have no axe to grind ? " " But the very sharpest ! I feel . . . how shall I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enriched . The more I know , the richer I shall be . Oh , yes , I 'm quite selfish . " Mr. Havistock smiled almost pleasantly . " But not vulgar .

When I am settled in Long Island , where I have rented the only Ogden Codmau house I could find , I shall go over my papers , and I will consider your request . Yes , I will consider it . " He now tasted a piece of toast from the second tier of the tea stand , one on which marmalade had been spread , and it was evidently not his special brand , for poor Mrs. Midge had to be rung for , and a long discussion ensued . I was disappointed in him . He had taste and percept ion , no doubt , but the world that he tasted and perceived existed only for his own amusement . He liked marmalade and lie liked Proust , which seemed to put them on the same footing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures in the background , if behind the beauty of James ' fiction and of Sargent 's portraits there were not a good many limp pieces of toast that had to be buttered on both sides . May 27 . Apparently I passed muster with Dr. Prescott 's friend for I was asked to a small dinner tonight at the headmaster 's house . It was not a success . Following our host 's lead , we all deferred as respectfully to Mr. Havistock as if he had been53Walter Lippmann or Dorothy Thompson , but the old boy was in a foul mood ( perhaps his valet forgot to " turn " him last night ) and answered our questions about the war in grumpy monosyllables . It was obvious that he has no use for any schoolteachersoutside of Francis Prescott . He ended by being positivelyoffensive to poor Mr. Ruggles who had the misfortune to suggest the invincibility of a Frenchman " fighting on his own soil . " " As proved , I suppose , in 1815 and in 1870 , " he snapped . " Unhappily for Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . The French peasant may be brave enough ; peasants usually are . But in this black century of ours a country is no stronger than its ruling class , and I have known the rulingclass of France for forty years . " When the others rose to go , shortly after the silence that followed this outburst , Dr. Prescott winked at me to indicate that I should stay on . Old Horace continued to sit morosely by the fireplace and sip his brandy as he descanted on the horrors of the war . " Over here you see that things are bad , but you have no conception of how catastrophic they really are . You see that the old world of grace and leisure and art , my world if you will , or the remnants of it , is doomed . Obviously . But what you do n't see , Frank , is that your world is doomed , too . " " What do you call my world , Horace ? " the headmaster asked in the milder tone that he used with this old friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Havistock answered with a snort . " The world of the gentleman and his ideals . The world of personal honor and a Protestant God . When a civilizationcrumbles , it crumbles all together . The colors run out , the good with the bad . Roman virtue goes with the Roman arena . Voltaire and Watteau with the lettre de cachet . Francis Prescott with Horace Havistock . You ca n't pick and choose in a flood . " " Please ! You make me feel like an old piece of antimacassar. " 54 " You may laugh , my friend , but it 's just what you are . " I trembled with indignation to hear Dr. Prescott so slighted . For if he was jesting , Mr. Havistock was not . How did this old fop dare to come up to Justin to taunt the headmaster in his bereavement ! " You 'll be telling me I should retire next , " Dr. Prescott said in a gloomier tone . " Of course I will , " Mr. Havistock retorted promptly . " It 's precisely what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if everything is going to pieces , " I protested in dismay , too upset now to be silent in the presence of my elders , " why does it matter whether Dr. Prescott retires or not ? " They both looked up at me as if they had forgotten I was there , and I had a sharp sense of intrusion upon an ancient intimacy . " Because there 's such a thing as dignity , " Mr. Havistock explainedcoldly . " And dignity requires one not to hang on . " At this I lost all restraint . " What a cruel thing to say ! " " It 's a cruel world . " Dr. Prescott , turning from both of us , had arisen and was staring moodily into the fire . " There must be a limit to what is expected of the old , " he said in a grave , melancholy tone . " If we do our job , must our years be thrown in our teeth ? Where am I weaker , Horace , than I used to be ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The time was when you recited it right through by heart . " Dr. Prescott turned on him , stung . " And you claimed it was theatrical . Must I be condemned by my own high standards ? " Mr. Havistock seemed to relent a bit at this . He passed his fingertips over his temples in a brushing gesture that made me suddenly realize that for him , too , the scene might be proving a strain . " Do you remember , Frank , when you used to admire Browning ? And Pheidippides ' ? Never decline , but , gloriously as he began , so to end gloriously ' ? Do n't decline now . " 55 " But the years have taken me from Browning to Tennyson , " Dr. Prescott came back at him . " Like Ulysses , I claim that ' o1 ( 1 age hath yet its honor and its toil . ' How do you know , Horace , that no work of noble note ' remains for me to do ? " Mr. Havistock shook his head relentlessly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're still ahead . I 've always given you good advice , Frank . You wo n't get it from your graduates or your trustees . They 're all too scared of you . Believe me , my friend . " Dr. Prescott had turned back to the fire , and his face was drawn down in an expression of bitterness . Suddenly he gripped the mantel with both of his hands and kicked a log viciously . " Nobody 's scared of me , " he muttered . " Sometimes I wish they were . " " Harriet would have told you the same thing . " " Oh , go to bed , Horace , and stop croaking ! You just want everyone else 's world to come apart because yours has . " Mr. Havistock did not seem to resent this in the least . He asked me if I would be good enough to fetch his valet , and when I returned from the kitchen with Jules , he and Dr. Prescottwere actually laughing ! Of course , I know that at eighty Dr. Prescott can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a single master or boy at the school who thinks him inadequate for his job . I had hoped that he might continue a few more years and perhaps have the blessed luck to die in office . But tonight I know there is no such chance . Old Havistock is too practiced a vulture to have come prematurely to the scene of demission . It is perhaps his very undertaker 's face that Dr. Prescott has awaited . June 2 . Prize Day , and Mr. Havistock 's seed have borne bitter fruit . Dr. Prescott made the announcement of his retirement at the close of the ceremonies . It came as a complete surprise and shock to his audience. 56The weather , at least , was perfect . The whole school , in Sunday blue , and the parents sat on benches in the middle of the campus facing the dais for the headmaster and visiting dignitaries . I have never seen so brilliant an azure sky , so emeralda lawn . The awakened earth seemed to burst with promises that had nothing to do with disaster across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and the last prize given , the headmaster stood silent for a long moment before the amplifier , both hands in his pockets , his eyes fixed beyond the crowd at the point where the river path disappeared into the woods . " I have one more brief statement to make . Since the death of my beloved wife I have felt the moral support of every boy and of every master in the school . I have been buoyed up in a difficult time by close to five hundred pairs of arms . With such a backing I have almost fooled myself that I could go on forever . But time is remorseless , and I have passed by a whole decadethe biblical limit of threescore years and ten . I shall remainin office for one more year so that my successor may have time to prepare for the transition . In June of 1941 the ReverendDuncan Moore will become headmaster of Justin Martyr .

" We all rose and roared that cheer . It echoes in my ears as I write this . June 3 . Dr. Prescott has , of course , been surrounded by people since his great announcement . Graduates , parents and trustees57mill about him to try to impress their little pinpricks of sympathyand admiration into his bland , impersonal attention . I have a discreditable feeling of resentment , as if they were taking him away from me and had no right to , as if I alone and not they had any true appreciation of his greatness .

Now that I 'm going to retire I can be a spendthrift . I can blow it to the winds . " " Well , if you do n't need me , sir , " I pleaded , " then I need you ! " He coughed with a hint of disapproval . He disliked any demonstration of feeling , particularly with regard to himself . " You do n't need me , young man , but perhaps you need another year at Justin . Particularly if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you do this summer ? " " I thought I might go to Columbia for a course in Elizabethan drama . " He laughed . " It 's better reading than the papers today . PerhapsI may try a bit of it myself . " August i . New York . Since the last entry France has surrendered , and England has entered her hideous ordeal . I have been unable to write . I sit in my rented room on upper Broadwaywith windows open on a sultry silent avenue and immerse myself in Beaumont and Fletcher . It has been as if a dark curtainhad blessedly been lowered over the agonizing vividness of the past year , over death in Europe and death in Justin Martyr . It has been as if I had died and gone to a seventeenth centuryspirit kingdom inhabited by jealous sovereigns and crafty nephews , by ambitious cardinals and cynical clowns , by melancholyand madness , bones and diadems . This morning I received a large brown envelope from Mr. Havistock containing the typescript of his chapters on Dr. Prescottand the following note : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted . I make you a present of il . The world is full of asses , but they are particularly abundant among the loyal graduates of New England church schools . ustin Martyr is no exception . Poor Frank is so surrounded that you may be the only chink through which he can be seen . Unless you become an ass , too . Do n't . Your f riend from another century , H.H.As I read the words I felt again the throb of my ancient faith . God 's presence had been suspended , not withdrawn , and I blush for my craven doubts and turn to Mr. 1lavistock 's piece . FROM HORACE HAVISTOCK 'S " THE ART OF FRIENDSHIP " As I LOOK back upon a long and ( I hope ) non-useful lifetime over decades devoted to cultivating the luxuries and letting the necessities go scrape for their sordid selves , I am perfectly clear that the greatest and most indispensable of the former has been that of my friendships . The art of making these , distrusted of women , has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pursue it abroad , but I will always remember and will here gratefully record that my first lesson was taken under the ashen sky of a New England winter . I met Frank Prescott when we were sixteen , at St. Andrew 's School in Dublin , New Hampshire , in the fall of 1876 . Had he not been in my form , I should certainly not have been able to last out till Christmas . It was bad enough that I was at once a new boy and a fifth former , an incongruous situation , but it was a good deal worse that I had been brought up exclusively by nurses and tutors and kept safe until well past puberty from the savage competition of my contemporaries . How I happened to be suddenly shorn of my curls and stripped of my velvet suits and isolated with members of my own sex  --  total strangers every shrieking one of them  --  involves my telling something of my own beginnings . I am the youngest child of a marriage of June and January , and , alas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Havistock , 6ohad children of an earlier match who were older than my mother ; he was sixty at my birth and survived to my thirtieth year . He was a huge , big-bellied , bulbous-nosed , pig-eyed bewhiskeredold-school New York gentleman , magnificent in his authoritarianism , but testy , snappish and accustomed to obedience . A great deal that he said was banal , and all of his aphorismswere platitudes , but he looked like a business leader and certainly acted like one , and in his generation appearances counted for more than they counted later when scalawags like Gould and Fiske had taught New Yorkers to be suspicious of everyone . I doubt if Father would have been president of the Merchants ' Bank and a trustee of New York Central a generation later . He was not in the league , financially , mentally or immorally , with the new magnates of steel and rail , but he had the happy good sense to have learned to get on with them and to be able to make them feel that an invitation to 310 Fifth Avenueor " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hacl dreamt of in their log cabins or steerage days . This good sense , I may add , he conveyed to his children , and it has proved the most valuable gift of the few with which he endowed us . My older brothers of the second bed enjoyed Father 's rude health , but I was a rheumatic child , subject to constant respiratorycomplaints , and was turned over at a tender age to the ministrations of the one person who wanted me , a faded , ailing , old maid half-sister who presided timidly over her terrifying father 's table and who , because of the difference in age of more than a generation , was addressed by her demi-siblings as " Sister Sue . " She , clear creature , was full of recipes and quaint medicinalsuperstitions ; she ventured out of doors in only the balmiestweather and then swathed in furs and scarfs over the black of her perpetual mourning for perpetually dying cousins . My childhood was spent in upstairs parlors before small well-tended fires , reading English and French fiction while Sister Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories Grant in the Wilderness , Sherman riding to the sea , my brother Archie winning a tennis match or the bray of laughter from downstairs at Number 310 where Father was entertaining the Hone Club , were part and parcel of a men 's world , happily no more real and not nearly as exciting as the romances of Dumas or Jane Porter . I managed to protract this dreamlike existence to my fifteenth year and might have stretched it to my own maturity had poor Sister Sue not died of a breast cancer . Of course , it was not put that way to me . " She was tired and went to sleep , " was the Havistock diagnosis . And I was discovered , or perhaps I should say " realized , " by my family for the first time , an ungainly , despairing , dressed up doll , abandoned on top of the pathetic little heap of her possessions . Everyone tried to be kind , but their kindness congealed into something more brittle when the great doctor , from whom Sister Sue had guarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to be in fully adequatehealth for boarding school . My brother Archie , as oldest of the second bed , now " took me in hand , " promising Father that he would have me ready in a few months ' time for St. Andrew 's where all my brothers had gone . He went straight to work , firmly and I think fairly , with lessons and exercises and instruction in sports , but all his preparationswere blown to bits by the first crisp blast of an autumnalNew England wind and the terrifying shouts from the football field on the day that he delivered me to and abandoned me at my new abode . It is important briefly to describe St. Andrew 's , as it existed in the seventies , because it later became the model of all that Frank Prescott thought a school should not be . Life there , outside of classes , was totally disorganized . The boys played informallyat football and baseball , making up their own rules , but they were quite at liberty , if they pleased instead , to roam the62New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were equally at liberty to haze the weak and to group themselves into fierce little competing clubs . They bathed but once a week and never changed , even when exercising , from their stiff collars and itchy flannel underwear , so that the evening meal after a hard game of soccer was a trial for the sensitive . I will admit that they seemed to have enjoyed themselves , but to me the school was anot her Dotheboys Hall . I was always cold , always dirty and generally disliked . I was mocked and chastised , not only by my peers in the fifth form but by boys much younger who quickly grasped the idea that I was hopeless at fisticuffs . I was called " Frenchy " because of my suits and " Willow " because of my walk . Archie 's standards of clothes , however Spartan in contrast to Sister Sue 's , seemed grossly luxurious to St. Andrew 's . From the morning bell and my pail of icy water to even in prayers and the threat of a turtle in my bed , life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The faculty lived in a world of their own , as remote from the daily problems of the boys as the quaint Gothic gingerbread buildings which gave to the little campus the air of an English college in a puppet show . In this they followed the example of the headmaster , Dr. 1 Lowell , a tall , spare , otherworldly cleric , garbed in rather dirty black , who never used any term of addressbut a vaguely benevolent " Illy clear " and who made no secretof his low opinion of boys , or " apes " as he blandly called them . He had the iron will of the tencperless religious fanatic , and he exercised absolute authority over the small areas of school life that broke through the icy wall of his spiritual preoccupation . He cared for our souls and only for our souls ; he took no interest in games or recreations and used to revile the human body as an " unlovely thing . " An uncompromising Episcopalian , he would remind boys whose families were known to be friendly with Unitarians or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social level in the hereafter , and he63was said to have fired a boy who came to his study to confess that he was suffering from doubts as to the apostolic succession . Yet the extraordinary thing about America in the last century was that Dr. Howell was not only revered by graduates ; he was held in respect and awe by the boys . He is a legend in the vastly expanded St. Andrew 's School of this day , and to suggest that he was a bigot and a tyrant would be regarded as appalling heresy by a generation which knows him only from the great Chase portrait in the school dining room , a fabulous study in the El Greco manner of zealous faith and asceticism . I myself looked up to him as a creature happily exempted from my own sordid tribulations . I admired his detachment from problems that I regarded as inevitably , if humiliatingly , my own personal doom . Watching him drive his pony cart about the campus , so blissfully unaware of the cold , the rain , the horrid little boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a priest in the Middle Ages who has had the sense to understand that only by the cassock could he escape the armed strife and dominate the armored figures , I could almostpersuade myself that I , too , might one day be a free soul . Frank Prescott at first seemed as remote as the headmaster . He was also a fifth former but , unlike me , he had been in the school for three years , and he led our form , not only in studies but in athletics . His short , thick figure and broad shoulders made him a superb tackle in football , a game which he played with a passion and roughness that was more the way it came to be played in the nineties than it was then . But Frank , however respected and admired , was not as popular as one might have supposed . He cared too little for the opinions of others , and he could be brutally outspoken in his speech . He was a silent , moody boy , and there was an air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and in those big calm brooding wide-apart brown eyes . He was an orphan of small means but of the best Boston con-64nections , a distant cousin of the historian , and even as a boy he had the natural dignity of a New England aristocrat . To me he was a romantic , Byronic figure from the beginning , an impression that was intensified when I learned that he was an orphan , the only child of a father who had died a hero at Chancellorsvilleand of a beautiful , grief-stricken mother who had quickly followed him to the grave . Frank never joined the others in making sport of me , but then he never seemed to notice me at all . The episode that brought us together was an attack launched upon me with iced snowballs by three fourth formers one early December afternoon as I was leaving the library . After pelting me unmercifully , they threw me in the snow and would have jumped upon me had not Frank at that moment appeared down the path . When he shouted at thew to leave me alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one , the smallest , stood his ground . " What business is it of yours , Prescott ? " he cried shrilly . " He 's a new boy , is n't lie ? I le 's fair game . Who the hell do you think you are ? God a l m i gh t y ? " Frank stepped forward quickly and struck the boy so viciously across the mouth that he fell his length on the snow . When he struggled to his feet I saw that his lips were Needing . " What did you do that for ? " he shrieked , but for all his outragehe dared not make a move to strike at Frank , nor did his two friends , hovering , take any step to conk to his aid . " To teach you a lesson about upperclassmen . " " But he 's a new boy ! " my persecutor insisted again . " I do n't care . He 's a fifth former , and you 'd better remember it . " When I was alone with my rescuer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffocation of my gratitude I stammered so badly that I made no sense . Frank cut me short with words as brutal as his blow to the other boy 's cheek . " I did n't do it for you , Frenchy , do n't worry . I did it for the65honor of the form . Pick up your ridiculous hat . You 're a disgrace to us , allowing yourself to be beat up by fourth for mers . Why did n't you even put up a fight ? " " They were three to one ! " He did not deign to answer this , but strode off , leaving me to the shame that he felt I ought to feel . But I have never wasted much time on shame . I have always freely accepted myself and my limitations . What struck me most as I stared after that broad , retreating back was the vision of how different life would be if I could always count on such a protector . Might it not make life even at St. Andrew 's bearable ? Now the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school could possibly aspire to a friendship with such a boy as Frank Prescott , particularly after the rebuff which I had just received . There were two reasons : first , that I was quick enough to grasp that the rebuff had really come from Frank 's dislike at being thanked for striking a smaller boy , and second , that I was already unconsciously developing the theory of friendship around which I was to build my life . This theory was simply that any man who wants strongly enough to become the friend of another will succeed if there are no unbridgeable class or racial gaps and if he wastes no time in worrying about his own inferior attainments . The unlovable Boswell pursued and captured Paoli , Rousseau and Voltaire before he even started on Johnson . I am known today as a veteran collector of paintings and bibelots , but the collection of which I am proudestis that of my friends . They are a distinguished and variegatedlot , beginning with Frank Prescott , and ending ( at least to date ) with Scott Fitzgerald . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the fifth form study corridor to knock on Frank 's door . " I know you do n't want to see me , " I began , " but one good turn deservesanother . I 've been thinking of what I could do for you in return for what you did for me , and I 've decided the only thing I 'm any good in is French . I had a real mademoiselleand used to talk it with her . I can help you , if you 'll let me try . " Frank stared at me with unfeigned astonishment for several moments and then broke into a rude laugh . " Well , I 'll be damned , " he exclaimed . " If Frenchy does n't want to teach me to be a frog ! " " Very well , if that 's the attitude you want to take , " I retorted with what I hoped was a chilling dignity . " But I meant it nicely , Prescott . " I went back to my own study , and fifteen minutes later he knocked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May I sit down ? I 'm having the devil of a t in-e with this chapter of Emilie . " I discovered that winter that I was a first class tutor . Indeed , I could have made my living at it had my situation in life so required . I even ga fined a small headway against Frank 's Boston accentwhich must be one of the greatest obstacles the Gallic tongue has ever encountered . But the friendship , for all my assiduousness , developed very slowly . Frank had too little time for human relationships . He studied hard , read a great deal and exercised violently . When he did allow me to accompany him on one of his long Sunday hikes , I would be too exhausted keeping up with his quick stride to have the energy to break his silences . Yet he tolerated me , that was the great thing . I never had to fight with him the usual adolescent 's snobbishness which frowns on the least companionship between a popular and an unpopular boy . Frank may have cared little enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared as little for anyone else . Gradually , a more personal note came into our colloquies as we walked together to chapel or as we sat side by side at meals . Frank had an aunt , a Miss Jane Prescott , to whom he was very devoted , and I told him about Sister Sue . It was a bond , if a tenuous one . Others followed . We discovered that we both liked Greek drama and despised Lord Tennyson . That we both liked chess and sneered at checkers . That we both revered the shade of Lincoln and deplored a civilian Grant . But Frank had terrible prejudices which would sometimes make a clean sweep of all the little ropes and grappling hooks that I kept casting up to his decks . He passionately believed that an age of heroes had died with his father in the red clay of Virginiaand that a generation of jackals now gorged itself on the bloated carcass of valor . He completely blew up at me when I suggested that the Civil War might have been avoided had more people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues . " You New Yorkers would compromise with the devil himself to save your pocketbooks ! " he exclaimed bitterly . " You must have all fainted with relief when you found out , after war did come , that you could still make money out of it . We Bostonians , poor idealistic fools , went south to fight while you bought substitutes . The Prescotts died poor while the Havistocks filled their cashboxes ! " He was a strange , proud , bitter boy , and he could be very cruel indeed when he wanted . I did not mind his outbursts against New York or my family which I felt were more or less justified , but I minded very much one night , in front of the whole dormitory , when he volunteered a wicked parody of my early ablutions on a cold winter morning . It was such an unexpectedblow , so brutally repudiating to what I was just beginning to look upon as friendship , and he did it with such unexpected and fiendish skill , that I burst into tears and embarrassed everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made my great bid . Archie had suggested to Father that I be allowed to ask a friend to visit us in Newport , and I invited Frank . I had an unfair advantage in that I already knew that his only alternative to a hot summer in Boston with his Aunt Jane was to tutor a rich brat of a Prescott cousin on the Cape . Perfectly fairly , he expressed no gratitude when I made my offer ; he simply informed me that he would have to consult his guardian . The latter , fortunately for me , approved of this solution of his ward 's summer and even advanced the funds for an outfit that would not disgrace a Prescott amid theHavistocks , and Frank was delivered to me in early July , bound , so to speak , in summer wrappings . It was a curious reversal of our roles , that he , the athlete and school leader , should become a boy put up , almost as a charity , for the summer to be a playmate for the delicate and difficult Horace . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put things back in their proper place . Newport in the seventies was beginning to show signs of turning into the silly jumble of derivative palaces that it later became . The little white hand to which Henry James was to liken the summer colony of his childhood was already filling with gold . But the essence of the old Newport was still there , the Newport of Julia Ward Howe and romantic Gothic and ladies ' archery contests on small bright green lawns , the Newport , as James was again to put it , " of a quiet , mild , waterside sense , one in which shores and strands and small coast things played the greater part . " It was a Newport that had not yet succumbed to the Vanderbilts and Goelets , and the only Newport I have ever cared for . Our house , which was grand for those days , stood in the centerof a twenty acre plot on Bellevue Avenue surrounded by a huge , beautiful lawn shaded with great elms . It was an AlexanderJackson Davis structure of smooth brown stucco , utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd , protruding conservatories . As its arched windows , though multitudinous , were tiny , it was utterly dark within . Father , still magnificent at seventy-seven , with his five young sons , four of whom , at least , were handsome blades , continued to be an impressive figure in the summer colony . His bays were the sleekest , his carriages the most gleaming , and when the six of us , in black coats and striped grey trousers , marched down the aisle to our pew in Trinity Church of a Sundaymorning , it must have been a pretty good show . All of the family were immediately attracted to the silent , handsome boy whose good manners ( for Frank 's manners withadults were always perfect ) never seemed to compromise rugged independence of thought . He had a bit of a row with Father over the reconstruction of the South , but he won it decisively . Father was one of a small persistent group who , de spite the posthumous sanctification of Mr. Lincoln , still regardedthe late President in the rail-splitter tradition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought Lincoln " soft " on the South , positions that might seem inconsistenttoday but which then quite commonly went together . When Frank , one night at dinner , spoke up loudly to condemn the loss by the living of the precious unity for which the dead , including his own father , had been sacrificed , there was no further waving of the bloody shirt . The summer was a happy one for me . Frank , as a guest , reined in much of his natural sarcasm and took me sailing almost every clear day . He loved to poke about the rocky inlets along the coast and to fish and swim from the boat , and he loved returning in the early evening and watching the spires of old Newport against the setting sun . I was asked to parties now , because all the girls were interested in Frank , and I discovered , not without a pang of adolescent jealousy , that he had a very distincttaste for their company . I wanted to keep him to myself , but I was shrewd enough , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this direction would be fatal to our still precariousrelationship . It had to be my consolation to remember that back at St. Andrew 's there would be no silly girls to giggle at his least funny remarks and to lead him on to talk , unbecomingly , of his prowess in sport . I believed then , as I believe today , that men are at their most attractive in the company of other men . I paid for the entire happiness of that summer in a single incidentthat occurred after our return to school . I do not know if it happened because of Frank 's restlessness under the burden of his imagined duty of gratitude , or because he felt cut off from the other boys at so marked an association with one who70was still considered " different , " or because he was stifled by the now compulsory blanket of friendship that the summer had seemed to throw over us . At any rate , one night at the sixth form table during a general discussion of our future careers , he answered my innocent question about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to hear : " Oh , I 'm going to Newport in a red and yellow blazer to court the richest heiress I can find . And when I 've married her , I 'll lie back in silk sheets like a Havistockand puff at Turkish cigarettes and be so , so above the poor old vulgar world . " My eyes filled with tears ( I still had n't learned to repress them ) , and I abruptly left the table . In my room alone I reviewedthe history of my relationship with Frank . I considered each aspect with what I hoped was a minimum of self-pity and decided in the end that the pain outweighed the pleasure . The little bits of kindness that he occasionally tossed me did not compensate for his cruelty . I was not even angry as I came to my sad conclusion . I felt sincerely sorry for him . He would probably go through his life antagonizing everyone who tried to be nice to him , slapping away helping hands and spitting in sympathizing eyes . Well , so it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the like of him . I did not speak to Frank for the next two weeks , and he took no not ice of it . He was busy with football , and as one of the school prefects he had to act as an assistant to Dr. Howell . But one afternoon , when he had sprained his wrist and was unable to play his favorite game , he appeared at the door of my study and without the least hint of an apology for his past conduct , blandly suggested that we take a walk . When I told him that I did not care to associate with a person who had pretended to be my friend and later made public mock of me , he simply laughed . " Do n't be an ass , " he said . " Come along . I thought we might sit in chapel for a bit and then watch the football . " " Why sit in chapel ? " I asked in surprise. 71 " Because it 's nice . " He walked down the corridor , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was his way of apologizing . I could choose between my pride and Frank , and I have never been one to spite my face by hacking off its features . I hurried after him , and we walked to chapel where we sat for half an hour in adjoining choir seats , absolutely still and silent , while Frank stared up at the big , beautiful altar window that portrayed , in glowing whites and reds , the transfiguration . I found the experience a bit embarrassing , as if we had happeneduninvited into God 's house and caught him in his dressingroom . Religion to the Havistocks was a formal matter . God and man met only in their Sunday best , and one did not talk about him , any more than one talked about one 's hostess at a party , except in terms of perfunctory respect . I suspected , however , that God meant more than this to Frank , not from anything that he had ever said , but from the way he closed his eyes in prayer . One knew then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that half hour at chapel he may have been with the father whom he had never known , coughing blood in the mud at Chancellorsville or with the poor little white shadow of a mother , roaming the dark corridors of the Marlborough Street house with crooning moans . Or he may have simply been opening the pores of his soul to the Holy Spirit and passively allowing it to enter . I have never had any faith of my own other than one in that of others , a curious kind of heretical suspicion that God would not abide in such as me but might abide in such as have been my friends . Call it what you will , faith or superstition , it has got me through most of a long life . Frank nodded to me at last , and we left the chapel . " That was bully , was n't it ? " he asked , and I was embarrassed again by the unexpected adjective . We walked down to watch the football which bored me but which seemed of unending fascination to Frank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the membersof both teams , when an odd thing happened . We suddenly saw the headmaster hurrying across the field , waving his umbrellaand shouting in a shrill tone . I had never seen him on the athletic field before , much less running . When he reached the scrimmage heap he tried to pull away one of the boys by his legs , and I could now make out his high voice exclaiming : " Do n't kill him ! Do n't kill the boy underneath ! What are you doing ? Dear God , what are you doing to him ? " All the boys stood up now bewildered , and we heard the embarrassed but respectful coach explaining to Dr. Howell that the scrimmage , far from being an organized pogrom , was a natural , indeed an integral part of the game . Dr. Howell , however , did not seem in the least embarrassed by his mistake and proceeded on the spot to draw up a new code of rules . Why was it necessary for the boy carrying the ball to be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply to touch him ? I was thoroughly enjoying the discomfort of the players when I realized that I was alone , and , turning , saw Frank stridingswiftly away towards the Dublin Lake Road . I ran after him and caught his arm , but he shook me impatiently off . " Do n't you want to see how they settle it ? " I asked . " Honestly , it 's a circus ! " " To you it is . You do n't care about football . " " Well , if you care so much , why do n't you stay and argue with him ? " " Oh , what the hell , Horace ! " he exclaimed impatiently . " We 'll be out of here in the spring . Let 's go on to the lake . I need a walk and some air . Let that old baboon turn it into a game of tag if he wants . " " You call Dr. Howell a baboon ? " I cried , scandalized . " I thought you admired him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perplexityas if he would never come to the end of my quixoticism. 73 " For what do you take me ? Admire that bigoted , sanctimonious jackass ? " I remember distinctly that it was then and there that I de cided that I would have to establish limits to the domination of Frank Prescott . " You go too far , " I retorted . " You always go too far and get violent about things . Dr. Howell is rather superb , really . He 's a kind of symbol , like a sovereign or pope . He 's above the vulgar hurly-burly of school competition . " " Above it ! " Frank shouted . " What business does he have being above his boys ? Football is a tough , hard game , the way life is , except for a few favored souls like the Havistocks . A headmaster ought to be down on that field playing with the boys himself . He ought to be in that scrimmage , not whimperingabout it ! " " Dr. Howell ? Would you want to kill him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules , then , and what a scrimmageis . You 're the most impossible romantic , Horace . You have to visualize him as some kind of Michelangelo prophet with flowing robes and a thunderstorm in the background . You ca n't bear to see him as a silly , preoccupied old boy in a dirty black suit pulled around the campus in a pony cart because he 's too lazy to walk ! " I burst out laughing . " Can you blame me ? " " Oh , to hell with him . " Frank gave it up and slapped me painfully on the shoulder . " He 's not worth a row . But I can promise you there wo n't be any Howells in my school . " " In your school ? Are you going to have one ? " " Maybe some day . " Ile shrugged , but I knew at once by his suddenly averted eyes and the quick set of his jaw that he was entirely serious . " Why not ? Do n't you think I could manage one ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well . Would it be a church school ? " " Certainly . " " But would n't you have to be a minister ? " " I 'm going to be a minister , Horace . " He turned to look at me hard now , and those glittering brown eyes defied me to smirk . " I 'm going to be a minister and a schoolmaster . You asked me once what I was going to be , and I put you off . Well , there it is . I 'm going to England next year because I think an American schoolmaster should know all there is to know about English schools . My guardian 's arranging to get me into Balliol , at Oxford . Would you like to go to Oxford with me ? " " I should love it ! " It was all very startling , but I have always made decisions quickly , and this was an easy one . Harvard had loomed before me like an extension of St. Andrew 's , and the prospect of a life abroad and shared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your school , too . You remember I taught you French . " But a sudden horrid doubt assailed me . " Would I have to play football ? " Frank threw back his head and roared with laughter . " God forbid ! No , you could teach French and handle the mothers when they thought I was being too hard on their precious darlings . " I was enchanted that in two minutes ' time my entire future , which until then had been such a dreary blank , should now be so cheerfully disposed of . " Where will the money come from ? " " For the school ? What about yours ? " " I do n't think I have any , " I reported ruefully . " Father alwaystells me I 'll have enough to live on decently , ' whatever that means , provided I stay a bachelor . If I want to marry , I shall have to work . " Frank seemed to find this enormously funny . In fact , his mood was exuberant now , almost hilarious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required of you . Do n't worry about the money . I have some rich cousins . There 's always a bit of money to be had for a worthy cause in Boston . For example , my guardian was able to find a trust fund to pay for the education abroad of any descendant of my great-grandfather . " " So that 's why we 're going to Oxford ! " Frank winked . " Let 's put it that I 'm killing two birds with one stone . " I realized that the half bantering , half solemn temper of the conversation had been Frank 's way of telling me that my long submitted bid for his friendship had been accepted . There was never anything else said to establish this , but nothing else , to a boy of Frank 's reticences , was necessary . I had weathered his coldness , his rebuffs , his actual insults ; now they would cease . Once admitted to Frank 's intimacy  --  and I am proud to say that very few have been  --  one found oneself a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he expected me , for example , to attend the college of his choice and to help him in the creation of a school of which he would be headmaster . But that was the way I wanted it . I was quite willing to settle for the junior position provided only that I was at liberty to speak my mind . For the rest of the school year we walked together on Sunday afternoons and made elaborate plans for the future . He lecturedme about my triviality and sophistry and tried to interest me in sport , while I mocked him when he took himself too seriouslyand laughed at his moodiness . The element of the femalein my nature matched well with the masculine in his ; in many ways our relationship was like that of a strong , singlemindedhusband and a clever , realistic wife . I quite realize that in the days in which I am writing , it will be impossible for a reader of the last sentence not to jump over a Freudian moon , but I belong to a simpler and less polluted generation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will insist to my dying day that it has nothing of sex in it . For a time it seemed that I had everything in life that I could possibly want : a friend whose approval made me at last a re-76spectable figure on the little campus of St. Andrew 's and a Europeanfuture , just around the corner , that loomed , like the great pack on a Santa Claus ' back , with spires of old cathedrals and castle turrets jutting out of its open end . I had , for the first time in my life , everything that I seemed to desire , with everybody'sblessing , to boot . And what did I feel ? Simply a small , half-recognized , vaguely tickling ennui . It was my first lesson from the gift-bearing Greeks . The trouble , I found , lay in the very core of my supposed happiness : in my intimacy with Frank . He , too , had never had a confidant before , and once he had overcome his initial reticences , he helped himself , in increasingly liberal doses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to me , no doubt , had I had confidences of my own of equal value . But I had little to show for my years of loneliness but my daydreams and fantasies , and he had the whole complicated structure of his school , created in his mind over the adolescent years , course by course , master by master , building by building . No wonder he had been a silent and moody boy . I.ike Frankenstein , he had been locked away in a mental laboratory , creating his monster . I call it a monster because I had already begun to fear that it would swallow me . To him it was something far , far different . To him it was nothing less than the source of regeneration of a modern world that had been corrupted by carpetbaggers and venal politicians . Frank believed passionately that the maw of civil strife had swallowed all that had been finest in the generationbefore us and had ended , fittingly enough for such a holocaust , with the assassination of the sainted Lincoln . Grant was to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the plight of a nation of ex-warriors grubbing for gold . And God would work through Francis Prescott , a humble instrument selected to reward his father 's sacrifice , to raise up new leaders of men . " I know it is what my father would have wanted of me , " he would tell me somberly , over and over . " It is the only way I can give to God what he gave . " 77I used to visualize Frank 's God with a little shudder as a despondentgeneral , sitting , chin in hand , on a campstool by a tent , like one of those lithographs of Napoleon in Russia , surveying the field of that day 's defeat and waiting for a miracle in the morning . Frank 's father , his own faith and his projected school were all inextricably intertwined , and my early knowledge of this gave me an insight into some of his later peculiaritiesas a minister which were to baffle and shock so many . Frank was never to be interested in any souls but those of his boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted about the administration of Frank 's still fictional academy ; I had to try to improve my own spiritual qualifications to become a member of his imagined faculty . He sought to discover the state of my religious life and asked me questions about my family with the sometimes brutal frankness of one who had none of his own . I have always been the kind of egotist who likes to talk around , rather than about , myself , and I found his probing painful . Our talks on Sunday used to go something like this : " I 'm afraid you must face the fact , Horace , that your family is a peculiarly worldly one . I doubt if I 've ever in my life seen such an emphasis on appearances . Indeed , your father seems to believe in nothing but the appearance of believing . " " That 's what he calls setting an example . ' " " You admit , then , he 's a Pharisee ? " " I admit he 's a magnificent one ! If you 're going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . " Frank would shake his head , whistle and quicken his pace , and I , stumbling after him , would simply pray that the glories and fascinations of old England would soon divert him from his favorite topic . My prayer was to be fully answered in six months ' time , and I was again to learn the malevolence of those seeming generous Greeks. 6FROM HORACE HAVISTOCK 'S " THE ART OF FRIENDSHIP " OUR three years at Balliol were a happier time for me than for Frank . I developed my character into the essential shape which it possesses to this day , while he pursued his down a side street that dwindled to a dead end . Yet of the two of us he seemed the more content . He took immediately to English life and English ways . It was as if he had suddenly discovered his natural environment . He was heartier , louder , funnier , more companionable and far better dressed , for the Prescott trust permitted him to become a bit of a dandy . He loved the solid masculine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone houses with their roaring fires , the hunting on foggy moors and the long dinners at long tables glittering with more jewelry and silver than seemed quite decent . He had many letters of introduction from Boston , some to the highest places , and he was much taken up as a Yankee who could talk back without being rude , who could praise his own country without seeming shrill and who was a first class oar and shot . It seemed to me that he spent rather more time visiting castles than schools and that his talk was more of foxes and of wines than it was of masters and boys , but I supposed that this was all part of his education . That is one of the joys of going to school abroad ; whatever one does can be chalked up to the8oimbibing of atmosphere . If Frank , however , seemed to be neglecting the project of his lifework , he did not neglect his courses , for he ended up with a first in " greats " and was offered a fellowship . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction of Paris . On vacations in France I was apt to spend my time in the capital glutting myself on theatres and art galleries , while Frank bicycled alone through the countryside from cathedraltown to cathedral town . When he did come to Paris , he was taken up with pursuits where my presence would have been only an encumbrance , or at least so I assumed , for unlike most young men even of that era , we rarely discussed girls . He was always extraordinarily tactful ( when he was not deliberately being rude ) , and knowing my nature less earthy than his own , he must have supposed that I did not like to be reminded of my uncarthiness . Actually , however , I would have been delighted to hear of his conquests . I had grown up while in Oxford and had learned to apologize to nobody for taking my pleasures primarilythrough the eye and ear . The crisis towards which we were heading and that I was too obtuse to anticipate exploded at the end of our second year when Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serious young men in the last century and was treated as a very grave event . Today , of course , it could n't happen because nobody has any faith , or if they do , they find it unfashionable to talk about it . But Frank had a very deep one and had been confirmedat his own request at the age of fourteen . His idea of teaching was inextricably tied up with the Episcopal Church , and the only kind of school that he could contemplate founding had always been a church school . I knew instantly , therefore , what a serious matter it was when , pacing back and forth before the fire in my room one night , and stopping occasionally to take a somehow wrathful sip from the glass of whiskey on the mantel , he announced to me that he doubted the divinity of Christ. 8i " You 've been reading too much Renan , " I suggested . " I 've been reading a great deal besides Renan , " he said with a snort . " I 've been reading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fact that Renan has one terribly valid point . Jesus obviously believed that the resurrection of the dead would occur within the lifetime of his contemporaries . Verily I say unto you , There be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom . ' " He became very dry of tone now , like a lawyerwith citations . " Matthew 16:28 . And again in 10:23 . And again in 24:34 . And again in Mark , 9:1 . And again in Mark , , 13:30 . And again in Luke , 9:27 . And again in Luke , 21:32 . " I could n't help smiling at this show-off of memory . " But not in John ? Has n't John always been your favorite gospel ? " " I find it trivial of you , Horace , to describe a gospel , like a magazine , as a favorite . " " Well , whatever you want to call it then . The most spiritual ? " Frank seemed even more pained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it once as the most sophisticated . In any case , you are partially right . The prediction is not made in the same words in John . But you will remember that Jesus hinted that John might not have to die . Which could only have meant that he would live to see the second coming . " Here he paused and shook his head . " Matthew , Mark and Luke must have meant something by all those statements . And certainly the early fathers took them literally . It explains so much of the casting away of the world . The church had to be totally reconstructed when Christians finally realized that they were in for the long pull . " His worries must seem absurd to twentieth century readers . The teachings of a protestant Christ have long been watered down to a gentle ripple of aphorisms about the poor and meek , and nobody troubles his head any more about the question ofdivinity . It is probably the work of thousands of loose thinkers like myself . I had read Renan and found his pastoral idyll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding relief in death from his impossible , self-imposed mission a charming one . I now suggested this to Frank . " Charming ! " he cried in disgust . " Is there nothing more important to you than charm ? Is that all the gospels mean to you ? Charm ? " " Well , I do n't see the point of getting all worked up about them . Maybe the Catholics are right in not encouraging the reading of the Bible . Look at the funk it 's got you in ! " " How can a man not be in a funk if his whole life depends on it ? " Frank paused to take another fierce gulp of his drink . " Do n't you see , I want to be a minister ? How can I preach the gospel of a deluded mystic who traveled about the countryside foretelling the end of a world that never came ? And consider , Horace , the presumption of such a man if he was not God . How did he dare threaten the multitudes with damnation ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's God or nothing . " Frank shook his head again , slowly and gravely , half a dozen times . " You call the Sermon on the Mount nothing ? " " You can find the same principles among the Essenes . There 's nothing in the least original about them . " He shrugged impatiently and continued to pace about , his voice rising sharply as his argument became more violent . " What I can not stomach , at least in the founder of my faith , are the miracles . As the work of God , they are awe-inspiring . As the work of a mortal , they reduce themselves to the slickest kind of sleight of hand . ' Go thou to the sea and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up , and when thou hast opened his mouth , thou shalt find a piece of money . ' Go your way into the village over against you : and as soon as ye be entered into it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereupon never man sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you , Horace , it wo n't do . Even the miracleof the loaves and fishes becomes a cheap catering trick . " At last he had shocked me . I have always thought it the worst possible taste to depreciate religious values . One certainily did not have to swallow the Bible , but a great many reputable people had , and out of respect for them , if nothing else , one should maintain a discreet silence . When it came to heresy , I found that I could , after all , be a Havistock . " You should have more respect , " I reproved him . " After all , even if he was mortal , might he not have been divinely in-spired ? " " Divinely inspired to say he was something he was n't ? How could that be ? " We kept reverting to the subject again and again , all that winter and spring , until , alas , I was fearfully bored with the whole topic . I finally suggested that he take his problem to our master at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first reluctant to do so ; he did not share in the popular cult of the " fowler . " I pointed out that at least the master was an acknowledgedtheologian , and I eventually pushed him through that door out of which , like Omar , after " great argument about it and about , " he eventually emerged  --  with the same doubts . But in his case , unlike Omar 's , an important practical decision had been taken . He was bright-eyed and feverishly cheerful , and he discussed his faithlessness no more . Jowett was certainly never Frank 's idea of a great man . The Master 's plump , soft figure , his silvery white smooth hair , his pink , clear countenance and treble voice , his cerebral , epicene manner and the intellectual ( and at times social ) snobbishness of his conversation struck the young American athlete as the epitome of all that was worst in English education , of all that his school , if he ever founded one , was not going to be . I , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdotes and in the great names which so frequently adorned his discourse . I knew that I could qualify under none of the three headings to which his intimates were sup-84posedly limited : peers , paupers and scholars , but I was determined that I would nonetheless attract his notice . He liked funny stories and he liked gossip , and the first time that Frank and I were asked to dine at the Master 's House I was full of both . " Havistock is a bit of an ass , " Jowett later told a blunt Yorkshirelad who bluntly repeated it to me . " And an American ass at that . But a dinner party is pleasanter for his company , and how many men can you say that about ? " How many indeed ? I should like his encomium on my tombstone . Jowett took Frank more seriously , as an aggressive and possiblydangerous Red Indian . During that same first dinner Frank actually suggested a correction in our host 's famed translationof Plato . Had he been wrong , it would have been the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I have said , Jowett liked scholars . " And to think that such illumination should come to us from the antipodes ! " the Master exclaimed , raising his hands . " The Old World can only bow its head . " The tone may have been bantering , but he took out a notebook to record Frank 's correction . Did that wise old man feel a tremor of satisfaction when the brash younger one came to him with his doubts ? I think not . Jowett was fundamentally kind . Frank 's problems , at least in their initial form , were elementary enough , and the Master was about to suggest a dozen explanations of what Christ had meant by the day of judgment . But he soon discovered that his Yankee pupil had a flare for theological disputation that would have made him at home in the Byzantine Court . Jowett 's arguments simply stimulated Frank to deeper research , in Latin , Greek and even Hebrew texts , until he was able to challenge the Master on equal ground . " If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was actually swallowed by the whale , " Jowett retorted at last , 85 " the church is no place for you . You 'd better go back toy the fresh breeze of your western prairies . " Of course , they had totally opposite religious temperaments Jowett admired philosophy ; Frank cultivated burning zeal . ' 1 one Christianity had been better stated by Plato than by Christ ; to the other Christ was all . Frank belonged among the disciplesof Phillips Brooks and A. V. G. Allen who gave to Jesus the supreme position in the Trinity which , according to Henry Adams , the thirteenth century had given the Virgin . To Jowett such Christology had a distasteful smack of evangelicism and American exaggeration . To him the life and death of Christ was the life and death of Christ in the soul , the imitation of Christ . As a Platonist he saw everything on earth as broken arcs which merely suggested the perfect rounds above . Christ was essentially a larger segment of arc . To insist that he had to be either all God or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth . Nonetheless he might have enjoyed indefinitely his theologicaldebates with a mind as keen as Frank 's had it not been for bitter memories of the conflict which had torn the Church of England , years before , on the publication of his own views of biblical interpretation . Jowett had come out all right in the end , but the memory of that fuss and feathers over the exercise of a harmless bit of rationalism had given him an abiding distaste for religious controversy . He had little respect for the clergy and barely regarded himself as one of them . " I wonder if any really great men are ever clergymen , " he speculated one afternoon at tea in my rooms . It was his first visit , and I was very proud . Frank , of course , picked him right up . " Hildebrand ? Ximenes ? Richelieu ? " " I 'm not talking of statesmen in cassocks , Prescott , but of clergymen . Why would a great man want to shackle himself with the gene of a creed ? " " Luther was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 86 " Ah , Luther . I should have anticipated the name of a rebel from the citizen of a separated arm of the Queen 's realm . " " But surely , Master , " Frank retorted , " a martyr like yourself should sympathize with rebels . " Jowett 's face was inscrutable , and I was breathless . I had never heard anyone twit him before with his ancient heresy . But Frank , it seemed , got away with everything . The Master gave him a long , shrewd stare and said : " It 's a pity you were n't a young man in 1776 , Prescott . I 'm sure you would have greatly enjoyed it . " " Would you , Master , have enjoyed the reign of Mary Tu-dor ? " Jowett grunted . " Perhaps the bar should be your profession . I 'm told that lawyers and judges occupy a unique position in your great nation . Can your courts not invalidate laws of congress ? Fancy . I propose , then , that you make your fortune at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The judge in this commercial era is the only person who can enjoy the esteem of the worldly with the detachment of the philosopher . Even the proudest burghers dare not yawn when he quotes Latin . " " At home our judgeships are the spoils of politics . " " Be a politician , then ! " " You are full of alternatives , Master . " " They are all the old can offer . " Frank was repelled by this , and though he remained on friendly terms with the Master he did not again seek his advice in personal matters . He had a young man 's distaste for compromise ; it seemed to him that one must make a clean choice betweenGod and Mammon . At the time it was Mammon , and there was no further talk of his being a minister or a schoolmaster . What surprised me most was how much I minded . One might have thought that the new , more secular Frank would87have been closer to the easygoing and worldly Horace . Yet such was not the case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone out of the relationship . In my own odd way , if I could get along without God , I could not seem to get on without God in Frank . I felt that he was turning into someone he was not meant to be  --  a good person , no doubt , but not the person I had visualized . In brief , I suppose I thought myself let down . After all , I , too , had had a stake in that school . I had hitched my modest but well-appointed wagon to a star , and now , looking ahead , I saw it was only anotherwagon . I could have done as well on my own. 7FROM HORACE HAVISTOCK 'S " THE ART OF FRIENDSHIP " FRANK and I came back to America in the fall of 1881 , and he visited with my family for several weeks . He had little idea of what to do or where to live and was disconcertingly open to suggestions . My brother Archie , who had always liked him and found unaccountable his intimacy with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into business . He persuadedFather to give him a letter of introduction to Chauncey Depew , and Frank went off to call at the New York Central offices . He came back , dazzled , to tell us that he had been offered a job in his first interview . " But I daresay it 's not very adventurous to start right off in the biggest company , " he concluded . Archie rebutted vigorously what he called the " vulgar " Americanfallacy that the big fortunes were all made in new ventures . " Stay with the tried and true , " he warned Frank . " That 's what the big boys understand . The profit is never out ' of a good business . Central will double again . " So Frank went to work for the Vanderbilts , the " brownstoneMedici , " as he called them . His heart was certainly never in railroads , but his shrewd intuition and his quick grasp of detailmade him a useful assistant to Depew who was later to be the first chairman of the board of trustees of Justin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the90railway great was manifested in a series of witty monologues that he used to perform for his intimates and , years later , for the boys at school . His best was of William H. Vanderbilt , interviewedby the press on board his Wagner palace car , shifting in his plush chair , coughing , snapping his eyes , playing with his watch fob , mumbling , shy and miserable , and ending finally with a high squeak : " The public be damned ! " The companion piece was of the same gentleman in his art gallery bargaining with a dealer for a gory Meissonier battle scene . Frank would stand , his hands behind his back , his nose two inches from the purported canvas , studying the detail of a helmet . But there must have been a dose of admiration in so exact an observance . Frank all his life had a grudging , half-concealed fascination for big business . He used to say that if you sold out to Mammon , you might as well get a seat in the Inner Temple . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in a boardinghouse on lower Madison Avenue and spent his salary on his clothes and pleasures . Ile continued the habit that he had acquired in England of being a hit of a dandy , and on Sundays he hired a horse to ride in Central Park . With his looks , his name , his confidence , his case of manner and his amazinggeneral knowledge , he soon became a popular extra man in society . New York was worldly and Frank was poor , but this is always forgiven a bachelor , and was he not a Boston Prescott ? Even the mothers of heiresses did not frown at Frank 's brown eyes and broad shoulders . He and I once again played reversed roles in that period , for I found ( as I always have since ) New York society distinctly tiresome . There was opulence , but it was a heavy , tawdry opulence , blinking out at one from heavily laden dinner tables where sour , sleepy-eyed magnates and their stertorous , bigbustedwives overate . There were no artists , no philosophers , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , there were none of those wonderful , worldly-wise , sympathetic91older women , in whom London and Paris abounded , former beauties or demimondaines , who could talk to a young man of love and art and politics and give him a sense of the continuity of charm in the history of civilized men and women . My health was bad again ; I had constant colds and was beginningalready to show symptoms of the arthritis that has nagged me all my life . I spent my days in the comfortable firewarmedthird floor sitting room in which I had lived as a child with Sister Sue at 310 Fifth Avenue . All my brothers were married and had moved away , and Father , turning senile , thought only of dinner invitations which were becoming so rare that I had the mortification of having to solicit them from his old friends . There was little to tempt me away from the manuscriptof a novel that I was writing about Newport in the RevolutionaryWar . It was not a good novel , and it was never published , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days . Inevitably , with my sedentary life and Frank 's active one , we saw less of each other . He never let a week go by without callingat the house , but the daily intimacy of our English years was gone , and I found that I wanted another confidant , perhaps even a confidant who was more interested in me and in the things I cared about than Frank , for all his kindness , ever could be . Even in his Mammon days , he always leaned to the general while I tumbled head over heels into the particular ; he loved ideas and I personalities ; he was all for argument and I yearned for gossip . Neither of us , obviously , could be all in all to the other . It came as a bit of a shock to me , as it undoubtedly will to the reader of these pages , that my new friend should have materializedat last in the shape of a beautiful and popular young woman , a scant year older then myself . I met Eliza Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish fellow but a very kind one , who , when not pursuing the old and grand , likeMrs . Astor , could give charming parties where , over the best of food and wine , something not too far from conversation was occasionally born . Eliza was a bit in advance of the Gibson girl , but to some extentshe anticipated her . She had thick rich auburn hair , a high ivory forehead , hazel eyes that gazed at one unflinchingly , the straightest of noses and a chin that would have been almost too resolute had it not suggested the proud princess of fairy tale . Eliza moved , too , like a princess , but I think she may have done so to offer an effective contrast to her free candor of mannerand a laugh that was as hearty as the West from which she came . She was the only child of a widowered father , a gnarled old leathery ' forty-niner who had once purchased a senate seat and who had now come to New York to retire on Fifth Avenue and launch his beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his past and something worse about his present , namely that his reputed fortune was largely fictional , but it helped that he , a morose old bird , did not want to go out , and everyone was charnicd by his ( laughter . Eliza was far too clever to try to compete with New York girls in their own specialties ; she knew that the out-of-the-ordinary , properly handled , could be an asset , and she introduced into her conversation a directness , a forthrightness , a kind of high honesty that seemed designed to fill the stuffy interiors of Manhattanwith a fresh wind from over the Rockies . Instead of playingthe mincing little thing who wanted to be shielded  --  from nothing  --  by a masculine arm , she appeared to offer herself as a brave , free companion to a man , the kind of woman who could fire her rifle alongside him in the Indian-besieged stockade , an Elizabeth Zane with an apron full of gunpowder . But there was a pointed difference . Elizabeth Zane had not been playing a role , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that the cardboard fortress trembledin the breeze but Horace Havistock , and nobody guessed that he smelled or saw such things but Eliza Dean . It was ofrecognition of each other 's skill that formed the rock , albeit a slippery one , on which our friendship was based . Like myself , she needed a friend and confidant , and he had to be not only a man , for she was one of those women who had littleuse for her own sex , but a man who would not spoil their specialintimacy by falling in love with her . Had it not been for this latter qualification , so firmly set forth at the beginning , I think I might have . Certainly I came as near to falling in love with Eliza as I ever came to falling in love . But I knew that I would have repelled her , awkward reedy creature that I was , and I was glad to settle for friendship and to content myself with being fussed over , like a doll in the hands of a very determinedlittle girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upholsteryand a coachman in red livery . She used to pick me up twice a week at Number 310 and take me driving in Central Park as far north as the terrace and the Bethesda Fountain and sometimes all the way to Cleopatra 's Needle . If it was a good day , we would get out at the Mall and stroll . It was part of her act of independence to be always unchaperoned . " You should n't be writing a novel about the Revolution , " she told me on one of those excursions . " What 's happening today is far more exciting , right here in Manhattan . Why , you could fit all of revolutionary New York into five or six blocks of the city today ! " " I 'll take those five or six blocks , thank you . And I 'll leave you that . " I pointed down to the Angel on the Bethesda Fountain that we were passing . " In fact I 'll make you a present of everything north of Union Square . " " You 'd make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why do you care so much about power , Eliza ? Is it so important to be able to order your fellow men about ? Of course , they 're all your slaves , anyway . " " Not Horace Havistock . He 's safe . " There was a tiny glint94in her eyes as she folded her hands in her muff . " You see , we 're utterly different , you and I. You can be perfectly happy just watching the pageant of power . And occasionally sneering at it . But I have to be involved . Oh , do n't think that I have a mere vulgar craving for money and preferment . " Her hazel eyes were turned on me now , full of a fine scorn at such a concept . " When I speak of power , I mean involvement in all the wonderful things that are going to happen here . Politically and artisticallyand scientifically . Big business is only a precursor . A herald of the Athenian age . And I want to be in the center of that age ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' as you see yourself , and being a spectator , as you see me , is n't in the choice of seats . You want a box . " She considered this carefully , in all fairness to me . " All right , I want a box , " she agreed . " Boxholders , after all , can at least be decorative . They 're part of the show . " " Like a queen , you mean ? In a royal box ? " " Well , you put it very crudely . But , all right , if you must . Let 's say a queen . " " And will it just be you there ? Will you be a virgin queen , all alone , or will there be a William for your Mary ? " " Oh , there 'll be a William , " she answered , with a nod . " There will indeed be a William . I think I even visualize him . " " Divinely tall and most divinely fair ' ? " " He need be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if his face shows character . I shall want him , of course , to have brains and imagination , and ambition , of a noble sort . He need not have money , but he should be able to make it if necessary . I have no wish for a dreamer or for a dry academic type . I want a man of intellect who is also a man of action . " " In other words , " I suggested with a smile , " a man who is capable of enjoying the success you expect him to achieve ? " 95 " Precisely . Am I presumptuous ? " " Let 's say you 're optimistic . What fascinates me , Eliza , is that all the things you want are noble things , yet the mere fact of your wanting them is enough to make you . . . well , may I say the most charming of materialists ? " " You may say a materialist . I make no bones about being a materialist . " Indeed , it occurred to me , glancing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neckpiece that she was the portrait of what she professed to be . " But it 's only fair to myself to add that I consider us all materialists . What do we have to choose from but material ? The question is : do we pick the good or the shoddy ? " " Who are your candidates ? " Eliza laughed her loud , smooth clear laugh . It was a remarkablelaugh for a woman , so assured and resonant , so chuckling , with just a hint of scorn that was somehow not in the least wounding . I think it was her laugh that made me almost love her . It seemed to warn you that its owner could take you over , but that you might be better off taken over . " You do n't expect me to tell you that , do you ? " she demanded . " Who are yours ? Do you have a man to meet my high requirements ? " " As a matter of fact , I do . You seemed just now to be sketchinghis likeness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've never mentioned him , so I assume you do n't . " " Oh , Horace , who ? " " I do n't think I 'm going to tell you . You 'd simply grab him , and I may want to keep him for myself . " " Dog in the manger ! You ca n't marry him . " " True . Perhaps the woman has the greater right . But I 'm a very selfish person . I do n't always regard greater rights . " " What an odious pig you are , if I may change my metaphor . You 'd better hide your friend very carefully , then , because I warn you , I shall now be on the watch ! " 96And she was . Nothing could have whetted her curiosity more than my refusal to give her Frank 's name . It was comic to watch her maneuvers and machinations , and the pleasure of it came near to compensating me for the realization  --  one might almost say the prognostication  --  that she would , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely in the smaller New York society of that time than it would have been today . In fact , it was almost inevitable that two young people who dined out as frequently as Frank and Eliza did should ultimately meet . When Eliza discovered one night that her handsome dinner partner was a Balliol man and a friene of Horace Havistock 's , the fat was in the fire . As I learned later from Frank himself , she had burst into her vigorous laugh and exclaimed , to his astonishment and mystification : " So it is you , at last ! Could Horace have planned it this way ? " With him it was a case of love at first sight ; with her , of love at first foresight . I assumed uncomfortably that my poor personalityhad been the kindling to set off the torrid blaze of their initial conversations , but I daresay I was soon consumed . I do not mean that they tore me to pieces , but I am sure that they laughed over my foibles and agreed that I was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse , whether the idea was ever actually articulated or not , there must have been in the air between them the contrast between the puny baby of friendship that I offered to each and the full grown , wonderful glory of the kind of thing that they offered each other . Oh , yes , they made a beautiful couple , Frank and Eliza , Gibson boy and Gibson girl , standing like newlyweds in an insurance poster to represent all the brave new things that life seemed to offer . I could not help but be a bit disgruntled ; the sexual happiness of others has always an excluding effect . Frank had first called at Number 310 in an agony of embarrassment , stomping about my third-floor sitting room with dark-97ened countenance , until he had finally managed to stop and blurt out : " Do you care for her ? " When he had been assured that I did not , at least not in the sense that he meant , I had been royally and painfully thumped on the back and hugged . Poor fellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my way if he had found that I was courting Eliza , and I believe he would have done so . But touched as I was by the loyalty and integrity of my friend , I did not find his companionship in the months that followedvery stimulating . He was a greater bore on the subject of Eliza than he had ever been on his school , for he assumed that I , as her friend and intimate , was as interested as he in her greater glorification . Did I know that she had the good taste to prefer German to Italian opera ? Was I aware that she was an expert horsewoman ? Had I ever encountered such a natural generosity of heart or a mind so cultivated and yet so unspoiled ? Was she not head and shoulders above the simpering ninnies who cowered behind their growling mammas and waited for some ass of a moneybag to propose ? " It 's uncanny , Horace , " he would always end . " I never dreamed that I would meet a girl so close to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect ? " It was even harder on me to be subjected to the same kind of confidences from Eliza . Never have I known a couple who seemed so uncritically enthusiastic about each other , and the remarkablething was that their enthusiasm seemed to wax with better acquaintance . I understood it with Frank , for at this period of his life , or rather just prior to his meeting Eliza , he had been showing an increasing taste for extremes . He had talked about giving up his job for the Fiji Islands ; he had written reams of florid poetry that made very little sense , and he had filled a sketchbook with pictures of the most grotesque monsters . I discovered that he even spent his Sundays at the city hospitals , reading to patients . It was all perfectly all right , 98 but a bit quixotic , a bit bizarre . Eliza , on the other hand , for all her capacity for excitement , had a very level head . I sus- petted her of puffing her feelings and demonstrations a bit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deify Frank , " I told her one afternoon in the Park , " but sooner or later we have to let him drift back down to earth . Granted that he has brilliant gifts , but what has he done with them ? What is he so far but a young man at Central who is n't even engaged to a Vanderbilt ? " " He 's engaged to me . " " Is he ? Since when ? " " Since yesterday . " " Well , congratulations ! Has your father consented ? " " Oh , I have n't even asked Father . I 'm my own mistress , you know . Father 's living on an annuity . When he gave me what little I have , he said : Here it is , Liza . There ai n't going to be no more . You 're on your own now , my gal , and make the most of it . ' " " I trust he gave you enough . " " How much do you think ? " I calculated rapidly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst into her high laugh . " Really , Horace , you old New Yorkers are beyond anything ! Where do you get that financial sixth sense ? " " You mean I was right ? " " A bull's-eye ! But how did you know ? I thought I was sup- posed to be rich . " She shrugged her disdain of such things . " Anyway , we wo n't starve . Frank 's going to get ahead in Cen- tral . Mr. Depew told me so himself . And he can go from there to anything . The state legislature , congress , an ambassador- ship . Oh , you 'll see , Horace . Frank may need a little pushing , but look who he 's got to push him ! " " He 's an unpredictable man , " I said grudgingly . " That 's exactly the excitement ! But do n't you see , with the talents he has , where can he go but up ? " " Do you know he once wanted to be a minister ? " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd have been . But he 's left all that behind . " " Yes , " I said with a little sigh . " He seems to have left it all a good ways behind . " I believed it when I said it . Afterwards , Eliza always thought that I must have suspected something , and she never forgave me for not giving her an earlier warning . But I could not have . I had reconciled myself completely to the idea of Frank as a railroad man . I had fully accepted the notion that the aspirationsof his days at St. Andrew 's had been mere adolescent religiosity . Frank , to my mind , had simply reverted to the traditionof his family , as I was reverting to that of mine . But , indeed , his exhilaration of that period was by no means all love . Love seemed to have been rather the catalytic agent that had started the vibrations of every emotional chord in his being , vibrations that boded to be powerful enough to survive even the removal of the agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dinner meeting of the Hone Club at our house , where Frank and I were guests . After the last of the old boys had left and I had escorted Father to his bedroom , I was very tired , but Frank , who was never tired himself and did not understand the condition in others , suggested that we have a drink of whiskey before he left . I told him flatly that I wanted to go to bed , but he did not even hear me . He was standing by the long table where Father kept his newspapers , turning the pages of one in sheer nervous activity . This was unlike him , as was the odd little feverish glitter in his eye , and I was suddenly attentive . " Have you something to tell me ? " He did not turn . " Yes . " " About Eliza ? " " No . I mean yes . Yes , in the sense that nothing happens to me that does n't concern Eliza . " " Something nice ? " ioo " Something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a smile that I can only describe as radiant . No other adjective would fit it . " I 've found my old faith again . I 'm going to Boston to see Phillips Brooks on Saturday . He thinks he can get me into divinity school in a month 's time . " At this I went to the sideboard to pour myself a generous helping of whiskey . It would mean a terrible headache in the morning , but that no longer mattered . I sat on the sofa , tucked my feet under me , and simply murmured : " Tell . " Frank walked about the room as he told me of his reconversion , his voice jagged with a tense excitement , his hands strayingover the surface of tables , tapping books and bronzes , his shiny eyes roving and not seeming quite to take me in when they rested on me . I did not move , except when I took a discreetsip of my drink , nor did I speak , even when he paused for a possible comment . His monologue went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision , a visitation , whatever you want to call it . I know that sounds like the most incredible arrogance or the most incredible naivete  --  perhaps both  --  but I do n't care . I 'm way beyond caring ! It did n't happen to me without preparation , as it happened to Paul on the road to Damascus . Oh , no , I was prepared . Only the stubbornest kind of ass could have resisted so much preparation for so long . For , you see , Horace , there 's something you do n't know about me , something I have n't told a soul . Not even Eliza , at least till the other day . And that is that even after I lost my faith in Oxford , I 've never stopped reading the New Testament and the early fathers . In the past year I 've read the gospels every night when I came in for two or three hours , in Latin , in Greek , even in French , trying to approach them freshly . Do you know , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sha n't . " All I 'm really trying to tell you is that the figure of Christ became consistent to me . He is the same in all the gospels . Indeed , he is the only thing that is . Verses began to ring in myears at odd times during the day at the office . ' Why cal lest thou me good ? None is good , save one , that is God . ' The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the Father do . ' For I came down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me . ' " Oh , yes , Horace , it is divinely assured selflessness . The selflessnessthat comes from an absolute knowledge that the praise or scorn of the world is a total irrelevance . The mortal part of Jesus , the assumed shell of the Godhead , hardly exists in the gospels , except for a few twinges , the agony in the garden , the cry from the cross . And even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain of the Father over what men are doing to his son and hence to themsleves . It is the rejection , not the torture that concerns him . And I began to see that the discrepancies and oddities of the gospels are the discrepancies and oddities of mortal writers , mortal witnesses . " He paused here so long that I thought I had to say something . " Was that your vision ? " " Oh , no . " He became even graver now . " My vision came a month ago , one night when I had not been able to sleep . I had lain awake , thinking about the passion , until almost dawn . I suppose you will say that I fell asleep , exhausted at last , and dreamed my vision . It does n't matter . It was equally real , awake or asleep . It was the sudden appearance by my bed of my father . No , not by my bed . He was somehow everywhere in the room , I ca n't explain . He did not look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miniature , yet I knew that it was he . He was very pale , haggard , perhaps unshaven , in uniform , and for some reason he had his left arm in a sling . He shook his head slowly at me and said in a reproachful voice  --  but , oh , the kindest , Horace , you ever heard , the very kindest !  --  Frank , my poor boy , how many times must you be told before you see ? ' " Here Frank , overwrought , dropped suddenly into a chair and102 covered his face with his hands . " To think I had to have a sign ! To think I had to disturb my poor father 's spirit before I be- lieved ! To think I was worse than Saint Thomas ! " His voice rose now to a pitch that made me apprehensive of hysteria . " Unless I could see the print of the nails and put my fingers into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side , I would not believe . And Christ was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his own apostle , and took my fingers and made me feel the print of the nails in his flesh and took my hand and thrust it into his side . Oh , Horace , if only I am spared long enough to make some return for that ! " I felt at last that I had to pull him up . " Is there any reason to think that you wo n't be ? Do you interpret your vision as imply- ing an early demise ? " He looked startled for a minute , as if at hearing me talk at all . Then he smiled , his old smile , and he was Frank again . " No , of course not . And forgive me , old fellow , for running so off at the mouth . I 've given you a dose of it , have n't I ? But that 's what friends are for . I had to tell somebody . " " Have n't you told Eliza ? " " Oh , yes . But not in quite such detail . Women hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to was my giving up Central to become a minister . " " I can imagine . And how did she take it ? " " She was a brick , Horace . A perfect brick . Which I 'm sure comes as no surprise to you . " He rose now , looking tired him- self at last , and came over to put his hand on my shoulder . " It was a shock to her , of course . She had n't planned on being a minister 's wife , much less a schoolteacher 's . She broke down at first and actually wept . Oh , it was hard , I can tell you . But the next day she was much calmer . She said she 'd have to think it over while I was in Boston . But I have an instinct that she 's go- ing to stick . " " No doubt she is readjusting her vision to include an arch- episcopal palace . " " Now , Horace , do n't be mean . Go to bed and pray that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife ? And you know she 'd love it when she really got into it ! " " Yes , " I said bitterly . " I can see it all . Jo 's Boys . " At that he left me , good-natured enough to laugh , and I finished my drink , deriving a sour satisfaction by contemplating how wretchedly I was bound to feel in the morning . Eliza was cool and quiet the next time that she took me driving . She was as beautiful as ever , and everything she did , even pouting , she did with a natural grace , but it was evident that she was thwarted , terribly thwarted , and frustration is the hardest thing in the world for a woman to make attractive . When she did begin to talk , it was to question me closely on how long I had known of Frank 's state of mind . " Well , does it matter , " I finally put to her , with some impatiencein my tone , " how much I guessed and when ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you wo n't accept that . But the important thing is that Frank has found his faith again and is happy . Personally , I 'm delighted . " " It 's all very well for you to say that . It does n't affect your future . " " On the contrary . If Frank ever starts his school , he may renewhis old offer to me to be a master . It could change my whole life . " " You ? A master ? " " Well , why not ? " I demanded , stung by her tone . " Do you think all masters have to be athletes ? Do you think there are no sensitive boys who might profit by a cultivated teacher who cares more about art and literature than football ? I know I might have been much less miserable at St. Andrew 's had there been a Horace Havistock on the faculty . " " I 'm sure you would have , " she said placatingly , retreating before my sharpened tone . " You must remember that as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . However , " she104 continued with a sigh , looking pensively across the Mall , " it ap- pears that yawning gap is going to be amply filled . " I glanced around . " You mean you 're going through with it ? " Her answering look was aloof and steady . " I thought that I had told you . Frank and I are engaged . " " But it has n't been announced . I should think you were both still free to withdraw . " " What makes you think I want to ? " What indeed ? And what made me so sure that she ought to ? When I look back upon my decision of that afternoon , it strikes me as sufficiently mu tinny . How did I , who had never interfered to the smallest degree in the affairs of others , who had confined myself to chatter over the past and passive spec- ulation as to the future , have the courage , or perhaps I should say the nerve , to betray my best friend by plunging into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And how , furthcrmote , did I manage to do it without any qualms of coilscicucr ( besides the shivering from my natural tension at the idea of any act ion at all ) when I knew that my soul was full of a conmplirated jealousy that Eliza and Frank should each be taking the other from me ? Yet I seemed to have had no doubt at all that I was doing the right thing . Could the angel or imp that had sent Frank 's father to him have intervened again through rue ? " Do n't marry him , " I said flatly . " Do n't marry him , I beg of you . " Eliza did not even blink as she stared at me . Yet she seemed to sense that such impudence must have sprung from a strong conviction , based on something she had yet to learn . " Why should I not ? " " Because you 'd make each other miserable . " She drew a quick breath . " I think you underestimate me , Horace . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superb . You 'd handle them all magnificently , the little boys , the mothers , the masters and their wives . You 'd be beautiful and gracious and decorative and brave . Oh , you 'd do it to the queen 's taste . And the better you did it , the worse it would be for both of you . Frank would see that he had taken you from the great world where your talents were meant to shine and squandered them in a New England backwater . And you would see it , too . Oh , you would , Eliza ! No matter how desperately you tried to hide it from him . You would both always know that you had been sacrificed . " Eliza ran the tips of her forefingers gently across her eyelashes . I wondered if she was catching a stray , rebel tear . If so , her gesture had made the others retreat . It was difficult to tell such things with Eliza . " Perhaps I should be subtler than you think . " " Impossible . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one thing that you discount . That you , of course , would have to discount . It so happens that I love Frank . " " Oh , love . " " Yes , love ! " she exclaimed angrily . " Do n't smile at me in that cool , cynical way . If you could see how immature you looked ! Only little boys and old men sneer at love . I happen to love Frank Prescott , and he happens to love me . " " Great lovers have made great sacrifices . " She opened her lips to retort and then closed them . Somethingabout my persistence evidently frightened her . " How can you go on that way ? " she cried in exasperation . " How can you be so sure about what other people should do and not do ? " " Because I know you , Eliza . I know what we have in common . Something that has nothing to do with Frank . We 're hopeless egoists , you and I. We want the nicest things , oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the best thing about those nice things is always going to be the little personaltouch that we can give them . You 'd never see Frank 's school in any other light than as a backdrop for a beautiful headmis tress . An inadequate backdrop , at that . And ultimately it would become a backdrop for the pageant of the splendid good sportsmanship of Mrs. Prescott who has given up the world for her husband . I can see you , Eliza , in maturer years , grey and slim and still so lovely , confiding to some soft , admiring longhairedsixth form Horace Havistock , over tea and crumpets , the secret chagrin of your sacrifice . " Eliza 's eyes really blazed at this . " Stop , Tom ! " she called to D her coachman . " Mr. Havistock is getting out . " " Really , Eliza ! " I protested . " In the middle of the Park ! " " Then I 'll get out ! " she retorted , and in another moment she was out of the carriage and walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take Mr. Havistock home ! " she called back over her shoulder . " I 'll walk . " I told Tom to trail her at a discreet distance , and although she must have known we were there , she never turned her head as she strode resolutely forward . At first I was amused , but as I continued to watch her straight , fast-moving figure from the slowly joggling carriage I became uneasy . Could I have been wrong ? Had I underestimated that strong , beautiful creature who swept along ahead of me , causing every passerby to turn and stare ? For fully half an hour we must have continued our strange procession , while I shifted back and forth between convictionand doubt , until I noticed that she had stopped and was waiting , still without turning , for us to catch up . As Tom brought the carriage slowly abreast of her , she turned abruptly and got in . " Home now , " she said and sat in silence , her head averted from me , her brooding eyes taking in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what I 've decided , " she said at last , still without looking at me . " If I do give Frank up , I shall expect you to do the same . " " You mean , give him up as a friend ? " " No . I mean , give up the idea of being a schoolteacher . In his school , at least . " " I doubt if I 'd be asked in any other . " " Then there it is . You wo n't be a schoolteacher . " I had not really thought I had much wanted to be , but now , in the perverse way of humans , I felt that I might be giving up the one occupation for which I was suited . " But why ? " I demanded in bewilderment . " Why should you care ? Is it just spite ? " " You should know me better , " she retorted scornfully . " I do n't do things out of spite . I may , as you say , be an egoist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , if I give Frank up , it will be because I want him to be free and untrammeled in his new life . If you can sense the corruption in me , it is , by your own admission , because there 's a dose of it in you . Let there be none of it at all in Frank 's school . " It is odd , but I think I was flattered . I had always been consideredsuch a nonentity where human relations were concerned that the idea that I might have an influence , even a corrupting influence , on one as strong as Frank penetrated my heart with a fierce little sting of pleasure . To be allied with this magnificent girl in a team that might detract Parsifal from his quest of the Grail was to be given at last , was it not , a role in the opera ? And was n't Eliza correct ? Had I not felt in my own heart that things were most right with Frank when he had been most alone with his God ? I made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my word , " I told her solemnly , " that I will never be a schoolteacher . " " Even if I should marry Frank ? " " Oh , particularly not then ! " I exclaimed . " I could n't bear to see a chapter of the gospel turned into a chapter of Trollope . " After this , we finished our drive in silence , for I understood , with absolute clarity and for the first time in my life , what aio8woman was like . I knew then and there that Eliza would never forgive me . I did not see Frank for several days , but when he called next at the house I was at once aware from his somber face that Eliza must have communicated her decision . Walking about my room as I sat by the fire , he told me about it in harsh , clipped phrases . A life in the church , he said dryly , was evidentlynot the life for Eliza . He then excoriated New York , its society , its money , its worldliness . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agreed . " Oh , what a bloody ass I am ! " he cried suddenly , turning on me with a violence that made me jump . " As if a girl like that would want to tic herself up with a shaveling priest who has n't even taken his orders ! I wooed her under false pretenses , Horace . It is I who ani vile ! " Then he canmc and sat by the fire and stared into it moodily for five good minutes . When he spoke his voice had a curious softness that I did not remember having heard before , like a sigh after the passage of some terrible pain . " I thought I was not going to have anything to give up , Horace . I thought I was to have no test . I knew that I could leave the Central and all its rails and the fortune that glittered at the end of them with joy . With joy ! But I dreamed that I would step forward into the service of God with a strong , beautiful woman on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last chapter of a Thackeray novel . 0 God , what fatuousness ! " He leaned his head suddenly down in his hands and actually sobbed . " Of course , she was the sacrifice you wanted , Lord . So be it . Thy will . Thy will . I should be happy to be able to give up something so dear ! " After this outburst , which left me in a rigid shock of embarrassment , he played backgammon with me in morose silence for a full hour and then went home . Never again would he discuss109Eliza with me . In fact , he reverted to the fifth former at St. Andrew 's who had had no need to communicate his inner discomforts . But then why should he have ? Presumably he had discovered a higher source of consolation . He resigned from Central the following week with the full approval of Mr. Depew who was much impressed that a call to the ministry should have been heard above the worldly bustle of his office . Frank even received a hand-written letter of good wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent objections to his step . He then departed for Cambridge to commence his divinity studies , which were apparently to be paid for by another of the mysterious Prescott trusts , and for the first time in seven years I ceased to see him regularly . It was a great light out of my life , but I had learned that one had to have spare luminaries . I visited Frank in Boston on several occasions in the next two years . I stayed with his dear old aunt in Marlborough Street , and he came over from Cambridge to spend the evenings with me . He seemed in good spirits , but preoccupied with his work , and it was no surprise to any of us when he graduated first in his class . He spoke in a kindly tone of his classmates , but I knew him well enough to sense that he was discouraged by the quality of their intellects . He was to struggle all his life to avoid condescension to his fellow clergymen . " If the church , " he once told me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into New York Central , it would soon conquer the world . " But , of course , it did n't so appeal . It did n't , if the truth be told , fundamentally appeal to Frank . He took orders only because he wanted to found a church school , and he sought to get his studies and ordination behind him as quickly as possible . He had one diversion , however , and that was Harriet Winslow . She was totally different from all the girls in whom I had ever observed him to take an interest , but in her own way she was quite as individual and quite as remarkable as Eliza Dean. 110She was plain , but magnificently plain , with a high , intellectual brow , a large , thin , very white aquiline nose and green eyes that seemed to look through the toughest barricade of one 's own complacency . A grand-niece of Emerson , she could read Latin and speak German , but she had the reticence of a lady about pushing herself forward . She was neat , efficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She belonged to the inner circle of Boston society , the only society in America that Frank ever really enjoyed , being like its English counterpart , unpretentious , self-assured , eccentric and , in parts , genuinely intellectual . Harriet won my everlasting loyalty by understanding from the beginning that , different though we were , Frank had no better friend than I. She proceeded promptly to establish her own independent relationship with inc and on two occasions invited me to lunch at her family 's without Frank . It was evidentto me that in her quiet but unyielding fashion she was determined to marry him and had accepted as entirely natural that his feeling for her was never going to be what hers was for him . I applauded her resolution in 1ny heart ( needless to say , we never discussed it ) , for it scented to me that she had everythingFrank needed in his chosen life , and so indeed it has proven . I think she even had money , but how does one tell with Bostonians ? I have never known how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , she always had the heart and the intelligence neither to resent nor to apologize for the fact that she was second best . When , standing at the side of the newly ordained Francis Prescott , I watched his bride approach us down the aisle , I knew that on that afternoon in Central Park by the Bethesda Fountain I had done the best job in my life . Nor was it only for him . It was for Eliza , too . She gave up the false start of Manhattan and returned to the West when her father died where she married the man who had bought his111mines . He was much older and left her hugely rich . Thereaftershe married Byram Shaw , of Wilson 's cabinet , and had a splendid career in Paris when he was ambassador . She lives today in a Genoese palazzo on Du Pont Circle in Washington and gives those great diplomatic-political receptions of which everybody knows . She has aged gracefully , but she has become even more Western in tone and manner than she was in the early days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her distinctive mark . She has always been cordial to me , but our intimacy has never been resumed . When David Griscam was making his big fund drive for Justin Martyr and asked me for the names of possible donors , I gave him Eliza 's . He wrote to her twice , but received neither acknowledgment nor contribution . She must have felt that she had done enough for the school. 8BRIAN 'S JOURNALNOVEMBER 15 , 1940 . Here I have been back at Justin for two months without a single entry , but the purpose of my journal is Dr. Prescott , and I have not seen him alone more than twice since the term started . However superior I run the risk of sounding , I can not feel that it is my mission to record what everybody could record and what , it now seems , everybody is recording . Poor Dr. Prescott has become a public event . I am no longer his assistant because Mr. Ives , who is also retiringin the spring , has turned over his own executive duties to Mr. Anders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But worse than this , it is difficult even to get near Dr. Prescott . The whole world of Justin 's graduates and friends is awake to the fact that it is his final year , and all want a last glimpse of him in office . Every week that goes by contains a " last " something that must be duly commemorated : the headmaster 's speech on the school birthday dinner , his " fight talk " before the Cheltongame , his halloween monologue on parlor night . Graduates come up for a look , a handshake , a snapshot , a bit of talk . Dr. Prescott lives as publicly as a monarch at Versailles . But whereas Louis XIV had only one Saint-Simon among his courtiers , the Rector of Justin seems to have as many as he has graduates . I sometimes feel that I 'm the only person on the campus who 's not actively engaged in " writing him up , " and I 've only stopped because I want to be the only one. 114There is a professional cameraman here now to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in the headmaster'slife . A recording has already been made of one of his sermons . And there is a big easel up in his study in the Schoolhousewhere an artist paints him as he works at his desk . I feel that if I so much as stop by to bid him good morning , I run the risk of seeming to be trying to encroach my little ego on the glorious illuminated page of his personal history . Yet he himself has never been more wonderful . He seems totally resigned to the circus of these final months ; he is more than philosophic  --  he is benign . He smiles with unfailing charm at the gaping world about him . The agony of decision is over , and he appears to be reconciled to the prospect leaving his creation in inferior hands . Perhaps he has reflected that those hands , after all , are also in God 's . Nothing in his headmastershipbecomes him more than the leaving it . January 21 , 1941 . He sent for me last Monday and suggested that I attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do become a minister and if you decide to go on with teaching , you will have to face the fact that you 'll always be stuck with sacred studies . It might not do you any harm to see how I do it . After all , I 've been at it half a century . " This morning I sat in the back of the classroom hung with maps of the Holy Land and the Roman Empire which adjoins his office and watched him with the second division of the fifth form . Like all great plans , his is basically a simple one . Fifth formers have had their biblical and church history , and Dr. Prescott tries to tie the church into their other courses . He calls on a boy and asks what he is studying that day in Latin , history or mathematics and takes the discussion from this . Today he chose history , and Jimmie Abercrombie answered on the day 's assignment . " The Thirty Years ' War , sir . " " Dear me , all of it ? " 115 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evans was planning to discuss the role of Richelieu . " " Ah . The role of Cardinal Richelieu . Do you know , Abercrombie , what the Pope is supposed to have said when Cardinal Richelieu died ? " " No , sir . I do n't believe it was in the lesson . " " Must we limit ourselves to the lesson , Abercrombie ? May we not talk , you and I ? May we not seek a bit of truth , hand in hand , so to speak ? " " Oh , yes , sir . I suppose so , sir . " " Thank you , Abercrombie . The Pope is supposed to have said : If there be a God , the cardinal will have much to answer for . If not . . " Here Dr. Prescott gave a monumental shrug . " Well , if not , he led a successful life . ' Have you any comment on that , Abercrombie ? " " Well , of course , I believe in God , sir . It seems strange that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Popes in the seventeenth century were in some ways very broad-minded . As to what things popes were allowed to say . Then you would agree that the cardinal had much to answer for ? " " I suppose he did his best , sir . " " For mankind ? Or for France ? " " Oh for France , sir . That was his duty , was n't it ? To his king ? " The headmaster 's deep brown eyes here fixed on Abercrombiefor a moment of silent reverie . " Evidently he thought so . Do you know what he said on his deathbed ? " " No , sir , it was n't . . . " " In the lesson . I am aware of that . But I will tell you . He was asked if he had forgiven his enemies . I have none , ' came the serene reply , but those of France . ' The man who has been called the architect of modern Europe was evidently satisfied with his handiwork . Think of that , Abercrombie ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see , Abercrombie , that you are not in a speculative mood . Let us return to the letter of the lesson where you may feel more at ease . What was Richelieu 's policy in the Thirty Years ' War ? " " To support the Protestant cause , sir . " " You astound me , Abercrombie . I had thought he was a prince of the Roman Church . " " He was , sir . That 's why he had to do it secretly . Sometimes he helped the Catholics , too . He had to keep the civil war going in Germany as long as he could . " " Had to , Abercrombie ? " " Yes , sir . To weaken the power of the Hapsburg alliance . " " Do you think that was ethical , Abercrombie ? " " It worked , sir ! " Dr. Prescott laughed cheerfully now . " What a pragmatist we have in our midst ! Does it mean nothing to you , Abercrombie , that millions may have died to effectuate that policy ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France the first power in Europe . It was n't his fault if people in other countries were stupid enough to fight about religion . " " And would it have been the duty of the British government during our own civil war to support both sides to prolong the conflict ? " " Perhaps that was different , sir . " " Why ? We were stupid enough to fight about slavery , were n't we ? " " Very well then , sir , perhaps it might have been Britain 's duty . From Britain 's point of view . " " Bravo , Abercrombie ! You have the courage to be consistent . I do n't know that I agree with your ethics , but I concede they might have been those of my old master at Balliol , a most esteemed scholar . They are certainly those of the political world . But let me put you one more question . A general question , Abercrombie , having nothing to do with marks or lessons . As you look abroad today at a Europe in flames , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not occur to you that the cardinal 's inspiration may have been something less than di-vine ? " " Perhaps , sir . Yes , sir . " " Thank you , Abercrombie . I guess I made it sufficiently clear what answer I wanted . " April 2 , 1941 . I had an experience today which may have been a reminder of my " call . " It has certainly added to the little store of material in this folder and restimulated my zeal as a recorder . But before relating what happened I must briefly describe Mr. David Griscam , chairman of the Justin trustees . He has not appeared in these pages before as I had not thought him of such significance in Dr. Prescott 's life . His appearance is deceptive . He is reputed to be a very good friend of the school . He was taken into Justin early in its history as the penniless child of an absconded financier and has ever since rather lavishly demonstratedhis gratitude . Despite a brilliant career at the New York bar , a wealthy marriage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ives , has always remained his primary interest . But he does not believe that a trustee 's functionis simply to raise money , nor does he always behave with the subservience that Dr. Prescott has come to expect from his board . Or rather , according to Mr. Ives , he may behave with subservience at Justin but acts otherwise when he gets back to New York . He has distinct ideas of his own , and they are not always the headmaster 's . Certainly , at least , he looks acquiescent . That is what first put me off . He makes a great fuss over Dr. Prescott , who does n't like to be made a fuss over . I suspect Mr. Griscam of being one of those outwardly deferring , inwardly resisting men118who care more about the fuss they 're making than how it is received . He is of middling stature , with a good head of smooth grey hair , tranquil grey eyes and what he must consider , from the way he keeps turning his profile to the viewer , an aristocraticRoman nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small man who would like to seem larger , the guest who is trying to look like one of the portraits in the club . I do not mean to be uncharitable , but Mr. Griscam is a most enigmatic character . This afternoon I met him and Dr. Prescott walking back from the river . I nodded respectfully as they were about to pass , but the headmaster reached out and caught my arm . " Come , Brian , and join two old men who are bored with each other 's company . We 'll have a look at the baseball and then have some tea . " His firm grip admitted of no refusal , and I obediently joined them . The headmaster was in a curious mood . He was joking , but his jokes were very dry , like his inclusion of Mr. Griscam , who must have been fifteen years his junior , in the term " two old men . " " I have never much cared for baseball , " Dr. Prescott continuedas we walked , " but that 's my generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport , a clean , silent game . " As we crossed to a little summit overlooking the diamond , we passed two boys with tennis rackets coming from the courts in back . " Oh , yes , I allow the fifth and sixth forms to elect tennis now , " he said , noting Mr. Griscam 's stare , " so long as some of them feel they can not stomach baseball or crew . You see , David , there is no end to my broadmindedness ! Despite my great age and imminent retirement I continue , as they say in magazine fiction , to grow . ' " " Who persuaded you of that ? You used to call tennis a game for mollycoddles . " " This young man here . " 119 " Aspinwall ? " I felt the prick of Mr. Griscam 's quick suspiciousstare . " None ether . Oh , he is quite transforming me . He is my Father Joseph or my Colonel House . Or my John Brown , dependingon the point of view . " Mr. Griscam smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does he spike your tea with whiskey ? " he asked . " No , Brian is too pure . In fact , I may have to spike his . " Dr. Prescott paused for a moment as we watched the baseball . " He made a persuasive argument that it might be as developing to a boy 's character to stand out against organized sports as to play them . That it takes courage to be a mollycoddle ! " He turned on me now in a sudden quixotic reaction against the very argument by which he had allowed himself to be persuaded . " Perhaps we have reached the point where we must talk of courage in such terms . Perhaps it does take guts to face a frown , a sneer , a clatter of teacups . There was a time when it took courage to have one 's tongue branded or one 's ears shorn off or to be broken on a wheel . Do n't tell me physical courage is n't the greatest ! " He walked away abruptly from the diamond , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The war will teach our young men that . Oh , yes , alas , it will . " Mr. Griscam asked where we were going . " To tea , of course . Or whiskey . Whichever you want . I can see you have no eye for baseball . There 's only one subject on your mind . Prize Day . " We had tea in a corner of the square study from whose wide west window one could see across the campus to the chapel . The twelve Caesars occupied niches in three walls covered from floor to ceiling with books . Since his wife 's death Dr. Prescott never uses the living room or parlor except for large occasions . Mr. Griscam began talking of plans for Prize Day . He said it should be celebrated as a jubilee and not a leavetaking . " I 'd like to see it as a day of thanksgiving , Frank , " he explainedearnestly , " with as many graduates coming back as can be accommodated . A thanksgiving for Francis Prescott . We could run buses down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an ovation to your fifty-five years in office . " " You see what they 're trying to do to me , Brian ? " Dr. Prescottdemanded with a wry smile . " They 're trying to bury me with praise . To mummify me with laudation . In the next months , or years if I am spared , I shall be choked with testimonials . I 'll become like a bad marble statue in a public park with puckered brow and those wrinkled trousers that the Victoriansculptors used to carve so lovingly . Ugh ! If I live to be ninety I may catch a whiff of the same kind of horror that Wendell Holmes went through . I may even get to like it . That 's the worst of it . " " But it wo n't be like that , Frank . It will be a simple ceremony , deeply felt . " " Do n't tell me what those things are like , David . I 've spent my life attending them . I do not wish this Prize Day to be different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . That 's all there is to it . Is that understood ? " Poor Mr. Griscam looked crestfallen . " But we 've made such plans , Frank . You mean it 's really no ? " " I mean it 's really no . " Dr. Prescott allowed his lips to crease into the briefest smile . " I 've always said that if a headmaster'svocabulary were limited to a single word , he might still get by with no . ' " And then he added , as if with a sense at last that he might have been too rough : " Besides , I 'm not really leaving Justin . I 've rented the Andrews cottage just down the road . " " Oh , have you ? " Mr. Griscam asked . " I did n't know that . " " I suppose I am entitled to select my own place of abode , " Dr. Prescott said dryly . " After my retirement , of course . " " I was n't suggesting the contrary . " " But you do n't approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fair to Duncan Moore ? " " Well , he must learn to put up with it ! " Dr. Prescott rose now and paced heavily across the room . " There 's got to be some limit to what 's demanded of the old . We have to step down when we still feel able to go on . We have to keep out of the way of our children . We have to avoid embarrassing youth with the reminder of what it will come to . " " Do n't I know ! " " Pshaw , you 're a child , David . Sixty-five , is n't that it ? Besides , you have a pot full of money . That 's the only way to be respected by the young in this country . " " It is n't a question of age , " Mr. Griscam insisted . " It 's a question of you . You do n't realize the force of your personality . How can Duncan Moore be anything while you 're still here ? " The headmaster seemed now to regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaxing note in his voice . " You 'll see , David . In my little house I 'll be no more trouble than if it were my grave . Anyway , I 've already signed the lease . And all three girls approve . I sha n't , at any rate , be inflicting myself on them . With or without my hundred knights . " Mr. Griscam obviously saw that further argument would be vain . " Well I did n't come to advise you about your retirement , Frank . I did n't even come , despite what you say , to praise you . I came to . . . " " Bury me ? " Dr. Prescott sat down again at the table and , raising his cup to his lips , drank off half of it rather noisily . " Have the trustees asked you to commission a fitting mauso-leum ? " " Nobody has asked me to do anything . This is entirely my own project . " Mr. Griscam paused , and my heart jumped when he proceeded to say exactly what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to write your life . " " Great Scott , man ! " Dr. Prescott exclaimed , putting down122his cup with a clatter . " Is Griscam on Inter-Vivos Trusts to become Griscam on Prescott ? " " I 've known you since I was a child , " the chairman continued stubbornly . " I 'm one of your earliest graduates , and I 've been a trustee of the school longer than anyone . Who else is more qualified ? Ca n't I have a try at it ? " " A try ? How on earth can I stop you ? " " By asking me to stop . " The headmaster shook his head impatiently . " I should not dream of giving so small a matter the dignity of a refusal . You may do as you choose . " " But would you cooperate ? " " How ? " " By talking to me about your life with some degree of can-dor ? " " Never ! " " Then how am I to do it ? " " That 's your problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own Stracheyfication ? " Dr. Prescott 's tone was sharply mocking again . " Do you think I want posterity to know all my foibles through the probing lawyer 's eye of David Griscam ? No , if you must write a book about me , why not do it in the great Victorian tradition of the two-volume life and letters ? With plates of bad portraits covered with onion skin and an index listing my characteristics , such as courage , magnanimity , foresight , judgment , prudence , and so forth ? " " Who would read it ? " " I would ! If I have lived only to be your subject , David , and you only to be my biographer , why should n't we both get some fun out of it ? " " Let 's talk of something else , " Mr. Griscam said with a sigh . " You 're obviously not in a mood for this today . " " No doubt you 'll find Duncan Moore an easier headmaster to handle . " 123I was suddenly sorry for Mr. Griscam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home into his poor trustee who now said in a voice that trembled : " You know how much of my life you 've been , Frank . It 's bad taste to pretend I wo n't regretyou . " But he should have known that Dr. Prescott was an old hand in dousing sentiment . " That 's just why I 'm staying ! " he cried remorselessly . " That 's why I 'm taking the Andrews house . " I got up as I heard the " outside " tolling the end of afternoon sports and excused myself to get ready for the Lawrence House study period . Not since my first month at Justin Martyr had I been happy to leave the headmaster 's presence . I would not have believed that he could be cruel . I had not , however , heard the end of it . Tonight , as I was walking down my darkened dormitory after bidding the boys good night and switching off the overhead lights , I saw ahead through the open door to my study that I had no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his back to the doorway , studying the little portrait of Samuel Richardson which hangs over the mantel . This is my one great treasure , given me on my twenty-first birthday by Mother and Father . Painted on copper , it depicts the father of the English novel at the height of his glory , with a seraphic smile on his serene , round face and a black velvet cap on his bald head , holding a manuscript on a board stiffly out before him . " Which one do you suppose he 's writing ? " Mr. Griscam asked , without turning , when he heard my step . A frequent visitor , he is at home anywhere in the school . " Oh , Clarissa , " I exclaimed . " At least , that 's what I like to think . " " He does n't seem to be undergoing many of the pangs of creation . " " But should he ? Should n't the man who 's writing the greatestof English novels beam ? " " Clarissa ! " He turned to me now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is it really that ? " " Well , to me it is . I do n't think anyone else could have writtenso wonderfully about a villain without , deep down , admiringhim . The way Milton admires Satan . But I feel Richardsondetests Lovelace . " " You do n't think he envies him a bit ? " " Oh , no ! " But now at last I pulled myself together . " What am I thinking of , Mr. Ambassador ? Wo n't you sit down ? " " Please do n't call me ' Mr. Ambassador , ' " he replied as he settled himself in the armchair by my desk and pulled out his pipe . " I no longer am one , and , besides , Panama is a very small country . I hope you do n't mind my popping in on you ? " " I 'm most honored . " As he filled his pipe , I continued , a bit constrainedly : " But you read Richardson ? You like him ? " " I know that note of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English teachers are always shocked to find that Wall Street can be literate . You think of us as bullying sparrows who peck canaries to death because we can not sing . As men who may collect but who never read . " " I 'm sure you must do both . " " Oh , I 've picked up a few nice things . Especially in the Elizabethans whom Dr. Prescott tells me you admire . To me they 're all gold and ebony . They light up the sky of our grey world . Do n't you find it so ? " I think it was at this point that I began to have a glimmer of sympathy for Dr. Prescott 's disputatiousness with the chairman of his board . There is something about Mr. Griscam that makes one want to take issue with him . It may be the implicationin his tone that it is a higher thing for him , a busy man of affairs , to have discovered literature than for a poor teacher . Yet his words imply humility . " I find I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I replied . " I do n't see it 's so vitally important for women to be chaste . I mean so much more important than anything else . And I do n't think it 's so terrible to die . Why were they so obsessed with symbols of transiency : grinning skulls and graveyards ? I know we have only a few petty moments of mortal time , and I think it 's quite enough . " Mr. Griscam nodded his head slowly as he seemed to considerthis , as I am sure he always considered everything . " Do n't you think Frank Prescott is a bit of an Elizabethan ? " he asked . " Not , of course , that Harriet was not chaste . " He smiled , and I objected to his smile , even while I speculated that he might be one of those unfortunate persons who always say the wrong thing when they mean to be kind . It would not be so much that he lacked heart as that he feared that he lacked it . " Frank has a bitter sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as gloomy as Hamlet when the mood seizes him . " " Yet he has faith , " I protested . " Oh , yes , he has faith . It 's his keel . No matter how much rumbling and tossing about he does , you can be sure he 'll alwaysstraighten up in the end . Sometimes I wonder if he does n't put on the show just to give us a scare . " I shivered suddenly with resentment . Who was this lawyer to condescend to Francis Prescott ? Did he think we were his puppets , playing with little crucifixes and ideals up here in Justin Martyr ? " You do n't like Dr. Prescott ! " I could hardly believe that I had uttered the words , even while they were ringing in my astonished ears . Mr. Griscam , however , did not blink . He is too practiced an advocate not to take immediate advantage of a witness 's emotionalism . " It 's hard to tell , is n't it ? " he answered calmly . " All I know is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dislike one 's god . " " I 'm sorry , " I muttered , raising my fingers to my now burningcheeks . " I spoke too hastily . I had no right . " " You had every right , my dear fellow . Every right in the126world . My trouble may be that having done a good many things for the school , I subconsciously expect more consideration than I get . And what is anything I 've done compared to what Frank has done ? Nothing . Frank is Justin Martyr . " He stared into the empty grate of my fireplace and nodded sadly . " Yes , I suppose it 's only too possible that I should resent Frank . Just as it 's only too painfully evident that he resents me . " " For the same reasons ? " " Oh , there are many reasons for his resenting me . I wo n't tell you all of them , but I 'll tell you one . Frank does n't like to face the fact that it takes diplomats as well as soldiers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Napoleons . " " And you 're his Talleyrand ? " " In some ways . Of course , the world loves soldiers and hates diplomats . " IIe shrugged and then looked around at me with that curious little flare of defiance that I had noticed before . " But I 'd like to see it get on without us ! Frank knows that . Frank , of course , knows everything . But he wants his board of trustees to be like the scaffolding around an edifice under constructionand to come off when the building is finished . " He suddenly spread his arms wide . " And there is Justin Martyr , bright , inviolate , a shining Valhalla in the sky ! Well , I agree with him , that 's the funny thing . I make no bid for personal praise or glory . At least not consciously . I realize that the greatest diplomat , by definition , must be the one of whom nobodyhas heard . And that 's the way I would have written Frank 's life . " " Tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For the first time I heard the naked bitterness in his tone . " He 's too afraid that I 'd make myself the real hero . But I would n't have , Aspinwall . I swear I would n't . I wanted to write that book . I wanted to write it more than I 've wanted anything in years . " " You can still write it . " 127 " Without his blessing ? Would you ? " " No . But you might wait until . . . until . . . " " Until he 's dead ? He 'll never be dead for me . No , Aspinwall , I give it up . I give it up once and for all . It is you who must write the book . " " I ? " My voice was a whisper . " But I 'm not even a Justinian . " " That may be all to the good . There are those who would say : why should a young man who has known Prescott only as an octogenarian be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that maybe only such a person could do it . In any event , I do n't want to talk about it . " He rose from his chair and knocked the ashes out of the pipe that he had only so recently lit . " The whole subject is very painful , and I 'm not going to keep you up talking about it . You will note that I have put an envelope on your desk . It contains my notes for the first two chapters of my life of Frank . It is yours to do with as you wish . " " But , Mr. Griscam , " I protested in distress , " what reason do you have to think I even contemplate such a project ? " " Only that Horace Havistock told me he had given you his papers . I was terribly jealous for a bit . I had gone to see him in Westbury with the express purpose of raiding his desk . Ah , well . " He smiled and held out his hand . " It 's a job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No sooner had I taken his hand than he pulled it away and was gone . Obviously he did not trust to the durability of his own magnanimity . Had I had only myself to consider I would have hurried down the corridor after him and stuffed his manuscriptinto his pocket . But I had to consider that I might be only an agent . That I might not have the right to refuse. 9DAVID GRISCAM 'S NOTESA BIOGRAPHER should commence by stating his prejudices , if he knows of any , and I will undoubtedly antagonize my reader at the outset by affirming that I have none . " But you 're a lawyer ! " he may object , to which I answer : " Exactly . But a good lawyer , such as I claim to be , must be without prejudice . " It seems hard to irritate one 's audience at the outset , but as I am bound to do it sooner or later I may as well have it over with . People do n't like my type . They resent the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always reasonable , always willingto hear both sides . Because I am everybody 's trustee or on everybody 's board , because I have the gift of being able to get any old chestnut out of any old fire , people take for granted that I 'm dull . I , in turn , resent this . I have tried all my life not to be narrowand stuffy . I believe I know as much about Elizabethan drama as any man living , short of the great scholars , and my collection , which I am leaving to Justin Martyr , is full of treasures . I have always been a staunch democrat in the very heart of republicanism , and under Franklin Roosevelt I served as assistantsecretary of the Treasury and later as ambassador to Panama . I was enthusiastic for the New Deal when most of my friends were for laissez-faire , and as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Justin Martyr I consistently backed Dr. Prescott in130every one of his great forward-looking steps . Yet my son Sylvester , a conservative bank vice-president , and my daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both regard me complacently as an old fogy . Emmaline , my wife , who has devoted her life to good works , is nearer the mark . She simply regards me as a hopeless materialist , which all of us , except Emmaline , basically are . I must stop before my introduction dwindles into an old man 's querulousness and state the essential prefatory things . I was the only child of a wretched marriage , born to the memory of wealth and the prospect of poverty . I can not remember my father , Jules Griscam , but I have always been told that he was a dark , flamboyant , charming man , full of wit and brassy impudence , the contemporary picture of a villain and the oppositeof myself . 1-ie dazzled the Joneses ( Mother 's family and old New York ) ( tiring the brief period of his success and dazzledmy mother , who had never been dazzled before and never was to be again . After the collapse of his insurance company and the discovery of his pcculations he fled to Argentina where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his widow and son a pile of debts which in those days it was considered a sacred duty to pay , so that I started life with a price on my head . Grandpa Jones took us into his old brownstone , full of black walnut and stained glass , paid for my upbringing and supported Mother , and to this day I have never been able to figure out how he was able to make us feel so keenly the load of our obligation without ever even hinting at it . It was a trick peculiar to the family , and I think in time I may have mastered it myself . Mother was that most irritating of females : the kind who believesimplicitly and forever in her male progenitor . No wonderFather told her nothing of his business troubles ! She minded the shock of his disaster mostly because of its jarring Affect on Grandpa , and she lived thereafter a life of muted apology , acting more as a plain , submissive paid companion tothe old man than as a daughter . Even as a child I resented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my uncles in their youthful arrogance . I wanted to be her champion and take her away from the eternally superior Joneses . I wanted to make a fortune and put her back on top of their world . But my dreams dissolved into slush before the hum of her constantadmonitions : " Be sure to tiptoe when you go by Uncle Andrew 's room in the morning " ; " Be careful not to interrupt your Uncle Timothy when he 's reading his paper , " and " There 's a good boy , fetch your grandfather 's shawl . " How I hated it all ! And the cruelest thing they did was to give me no excuse to hate them . I went to day school until I was fifteen when I was entered in the fourth form of Justin Martyr . I was sent there because it was a new school and cheaper than the others , and because the headmaster , Francis Prescott , had been a good friend of my Uncle Timothy Jones when they had worked together in New York Central . He often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike other family visitors , always took notice of the lonely littleboy hiding on a landing , behind a chair or under a table . Prescott would reach out suddenly in passing to grab and haul me forth , tousle my hair or pick me up and swing me about his head . Sometimes he would even bring me a present or take me into the backyard to play at catch . I was dazzled , a bit uncomfortably , to find myself so tossed about by this hearty young man . I suppose I appealed to his sympathy because the shame of my father 's disgrace attached itself to my woebegone appearance . When he departed for divinity school , acting on a decisionthat to me seemed as quick as it was quixotic , I felt sadly abandoned . Justin Martyr in 1891 was only five years old , with forty boys , six masters and one big yellow barn of a building that stood up barely in the midst of a large field near the village of New Paisley , thirty miles west of Boston . People were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardworking headmaster who combined the functions of minister , teacher , coach , tutor and superintendent , that future must have still seemed a good way off . For me , anyway , coming from the gloom of the old Jones house on lower Madison Avenue , the first months there were a kind of paradise . The atmosphere seemed more that of a large happy family than of an academy . The masters , including Prescott , were all young and played football with the boys ; everybodyate together at three round tables , and the Prescotts entertainedthe whole school at parlor games and singing on Saturday nights . Discipline was handled by simple reprimand or occasionalextra chores , and sick boys were put up in the headmaster'swing and looked after , when a trained nurse was not required , by Mrs. Prescott , who also taught the German classes . But above all there was a comradeship between the boys , even between those of different forms , which inevitably disappeared as the school increased in size . Dawn must give way to morning , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , who later became a somewhat austere figureto the multitudes of students who passed under his allencompassingbrown stare , was then on easy , even bantering terms with the older boys . He had a natural authority and could check the least familiarity with a glance , and he could be terrible in his tempers , but the occasions for them were rare . I was a modest boy and tended to keep myself out of his way in fear that he might think I was presuming on our old intimacy . I determined that I would win his respect independently of the family connection , and to do this I worked hard at my books , paid an almost fierce attention to his sermons in the little church in New Paisley where the school worshiped and flung myself recklessly at the biggest boys on the football field . As I was a rather small fifteen , I got badly battered a few times , and once the headmaster himself picked me up , patted me on133the back and said with a laugh : " You 're a tough little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a game . " How I thrilled at those words ! Human beings , however , can not be happy together for long ; the compulsion to mar a scene of content is , in my now long experience with my fellow men , sooner or later irresistible to the average observer . You may think you 're going your own way , inoffensively enough , modestly enough , not even whistling under your breath , but make no mistake . Someone is watching you and watching you with hate . How could it be otherwise ? Animals live to kill and be killed , and if our food is supplied at table , the hunting instinct must still be satisfied . Every garden has a snake , and every boys ' school a Hal Leigh . Need I describehim ? Surely the reader can see him , big and brash and sneering , popular with the boys who preferred the dirty story in the cellar to the clean play of the football field , feared by the weak , suspected by the strong , a brute , a bully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was he , one morning at recess time , when we were eating our crackers and discussing a test in mathematics , who brayed out : " Ask Griscam . His old man was a wizard at all that . He could multiply by a million , divide by himself and come out with zero . " I flew at him with a wild confidence that the wrath of the insanewould make up for the difference in weight . It did not . My schooldays were not to be those of Tom Brown . I did not even manage to blacken one of Leigh 's eyes before he had knocked me over and kicked me down a stone stairway where I sprained both a wrist and ankle and cut an ugly gash in my head . While I was in the dispensary afterwards , having the cut treated by Mrs. Prescott , her husband came in and asked me how the fight had started . I imagined that he suspected the truth and would have gladly punished Leigh for his cruelty , but I refused to tell him a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mute in concealing the indiscreet presence134 135of a lady in his bachelor apartment than was I in shielding the hated Leigh . It was my code of honor , and I gloried in it because I thought it was the headmaster 's . I did not realize until years later that he was first of all an eminently practical man . The glory that I felt , however , was no match for my rancor against the unchastised Leigh . He made no further remarks about my father , it was true , but was his silence the equivalent of my limp or the pain in my wrist ? I brooded over my injuries , both to my honor and to my person , until it seemed to me that I could not endure another week at school without some kind of retaliation . For all the power of Prescott 's personality and the weakness of Leigh 's , it was the latter which now discolored for me the light green of the woods and leered over a pale spring sky . I dared not assault Leigh again , for a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the headmaster 's anger . I could not even complain to my friends about his viciousness without repeating his remark about my father . If I were to have my revenge , it would have to be underhanded , and how then was I ever to look Mr. Prescott in the face again ? Unhappily for me , on a half holiday , the perfect opportunity presented itself . Several boys , including Leigh , had gone canoeingon the river , leaving their schoolbooks and papers in piles just inside the boathouse . I noted that Leigh had carelessly left on top of his pile the paper about the Punic Wars on which he had been working all term . It took only a minute to stuff his thesis in my pocket , all but the last page , and leave the door ajar so that the strong wind scattered the copybooks and notes over the dock and into the water . I then hurried off , unseen , to burn the Punic Wars , knowing that it would all seem an accident , as the discovery of that final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so in fact it turned out , but loud as were the howls of Hal Leigh at the loss of his masterpiece , instead of joy in myheart I felt only a sick depression . Even after the headmaster had agreed to give Leigh a mark for the lost paper higher than the original would have probably received , so that my act of vengeance had actually benefited my foe , I felt no relief . I had proved to myself that I had inherited my father 's character , and it could now be only a matter of time before I made this manifestto the world . I could visualize already the nodding heads and deep shrugs of my maternal uncles . As the spring deepened and the spirits of the boys rose , my own continued to decline until , morose and moody , my marks became affected . I caught a severe cold and in my state of dejectiona fever followed , and for some days I was seriously ill in the Prescotts ' house with a day and a night nurse . But howevermuch I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erode the vigor of my sixteen years , and I soon found myself on the road to a vulgar recovery . It may have been my need for a compensating drama that made me confess to the headmaster at my bedside the whole sorry tale of Hal Leigh . He was wonderful in that he accepted it with the same gravityin which it was offered . " Of course , you did a very wrong thing , Davey , and one that I would not have expected of you . But on the other hand , I would not have expected you to have received such provocation . " He shook his head sadly . " And right here in Justin Martyr , too . Yet perhaps it is all for the good . You have to learn , my boy , to live with your father 's reputation . You need not be ashamed of it . Indeed , it would be very foolish of you to be ashamed of it . But you must accept it , because  it is a fact . " " It 's hard to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very hard . I do n't minimize it . " " Your father was a hero . " " And that has its problems , too , Davey . The good Lord deals us our different hands to play , but do n't you suppose he keeps136 1 137score according to how we play them ? I find a hero in mine . Played one way he can set me . Played another he gives me rubber . Your father may seem a liability to you , but he can also be a challenge . " " To what ? " " To a grand slam ! Look , my boy : you have a name that is temporarily discredited . So be it . You have had a lonely childhoodwith uncles who are too afraid of being demonstrative to be properly kind . Oh , I know them . " He nodded slowly as I stared , fascinated by this new candor . " You have a mother who has been overburdened with disappointment . " I did not know then , but , of course , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother had refused to leave his bedside to come to mine . " But look now for your trumps . You have a first-class mind , a well-made body , an aptitude for friendship , high ideals and honesty . Are you to be put out of the game in the first rubberwith all that ? " " You really think I 'm honest , sir ? After what I 've just told you about tearing up Leigh 's paper ? " " Your telling me proves it . It was wrong , to be sure . But you had great provocation , and now you have made confession . It would be maudlin to dwell on it further . " " And you believe in me ? " He smiled , for the first time , at the intensity of my tone . " I do believe in you , my boy , " he said and patted me on the head . " Now get some rest . " During the three weeks of my convalescence Prescott tutored me for an hour a day , and when I rejoined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that age I had some dim appreciation of the remarkable keenness and scope of his mind which could reduce anything , an eclogue by Virgil or the War of the Spanish Succession , to a few vivid terms that would glue the material in all but the stupidest mind at least until whatevertest was pending . But Prescott was being far more than abrilliant tutor ; he was nursing a sick soul . His kindness was overwhelming , without ever being in the least sentimental , without even , perhaps , being personal . He raised the great beaker of his hope to my lips like a communion cup and watched with grave countenance as I drank , and when he took it away , I knew that it was because I had had enough . There was no question of turning my convalescence into a party . He talked to me of God and of his early doubts and of the loneliness of his own childhood . He talked of the futility of any action in life that was not service to others . He explained to me and made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward circumstances , but could be created only within . And then he made me laugh , too , by talking of the past and poking fun at the Joneses and persuading me not only that they were less formidable than they appeared but that they might even be human . When he came to my room with the telegramannouncing poor old Grandpa 's death we knelt together in prayer by my bed , and I found that I was actually weeping . I was too clever , and also at this point too well acquainted with the headmaster 's character , to make the smallest effort , after my return to a normal schedule , to trade upon convalescentdays . I adored Mr. Prescott as I had never adored anotherhuman being , but it was a worshipful kind of emotion , and I was able to sublimate it into violent activities and studies . I rose to be second in my form , and in my last year I was one of the school prefects . I was not big enough to be very effective at football , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Justinian . The best part of sixth form year was that the prefects were in constant contact with the headmaster , and we could feel that we ran the school in a sort of partnership . Mr. Prescott treated us almost as equals and even allowed me to share in one of his melancholy moments . We had been out together on a cold winter afternoon , snowshoeing on the crisp surface , and as we came back , it was already dark , and we paused138 139for a moment on the crest of the hill overlooking the school and stared down at the lighted building so far below . My heart was so full that I exclaimed : " I ca n't bear to have spring come ! " " Why not , Davey ? Are you so fond of the winter of our dis-content ? " " I 'm so fond of Justin , sir . I ca n't bear the thought of gradua-tion . " " But Justin is only a prelude , " he protested . " It is nothing but a simple first course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life for any boy , I should know I had failed indeed . " " But it 's the whole banquet of life for you , sir . " " It is that , Davey . " His smile was grave as he stared down at his school . " It is that indeed . " " And how happy it must make you ! " " Very happy , " he agreed in a rather somber tone . " I am most blessed . I have what I wanted . I have what I prayed for . And do you know what I pray for now , Davey ? " " What , sir ? " " That the sin of boredom shall never fall upon me . " I said nothing , awed , for I knew that in that moment we were as intimate as we ever again should be . Graduation was a sad time for me , although Mother came up for it , urged , no doubt , by Mr. Prescott . My friends thought me very emotional , for there were tears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still respectable . I felt that I was emergingfrom a Garden of Eden that might be artificial by the standardsof a world that had first applauded and later persecuted my father , but I was armed with the faith that that garden had nonetheless prepared me for that world . I went to Harvard and made a good record there , but I was never as happy as I had been at school . Harvard was already the world , and although I could cope with it I had not learned to cope with it joyfully . I went back to Justin , now rapidly expanding , on so many weekends that at length Mr. Prescott hadto warn me in a friendly fashion that I might be neglecting the social duties of a college man . It was then that I asked him if he would consider me for the faculty of Justin when I graduated . We were walking to the river , and he grasped my elbow as he debated , too long for my comfort , the answer . " Are you so sure you want to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " " No , that wo n't do . You 'd have to want to teach anywhere to be able to teach here . " " Then I want to teach anywhere ! " " It might work out . " He removed his hand and strode on . " But not until several years after your graduation . You must see more of the world first , Davey , if you 're to teach boys to deal with it . And I ca n't help but wonder if a life at Justin would be the happiest life for you . Your father 's name received its blemishin New York . Is n't it there that you must seek to remove it ? " " Is that so important ? " " Not to my thinking . But I thought it was to yours . " " You mean I should pay his debts ? " My question , I fear , was belligerent . " No , Davey , " he said patiently . " I mean you should bury his old reputation under the monument of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable and kind , and who but I had given him the notion of the importance of my father 's crime to me ? Of course he saw instantly that Justin was a haven for me , a refuge from a world that I deemed cold , if not actually sneering . He wanted no escapists in his school , and he was right . But at the time I refused to discuss the matter any further , and we reached the river in silence . I had been rejected by too many people in my life to be a good sport about being rejected by Francis Prescott . I0DAVID GRISCAM 'S NOTESONCE I had squarely turned my back on schoolteaching and resolved to become a lawyer , I never wavered again . My poor mother died only a year after Grandpa Jones , and my inheritancewas just sufficient to put me through Harvard and Harvard Law . After that I got a job with Prime &; Ballard , a small but lucrative " family " law firm , which is now Prime &; Griscam and one of the last of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from theatre tickets to divorces ; we file their birth certificates and we bury them . I started as Mr. Prime 's law clerk and became in turn his son-in-law , his partner and his executor . It was an old-fashioned success story . I discovered not only that I enjoyed my law practice , but that I was admirably adapted to it . I am by nature reserved , patient , of even temper and a good listener , and I love the challenge of domestic puzzles . I became a specialist in the multiple prejudicesunder which Americans suffer in the spending of their money , according to whether it has been earned , married or handed down , and I learned to stay within the framework of the sacred mores surrounding these categories while putting the dollars to work to the greatest advantage of the whole family . I even found that it was occasionally possible to persuade old New Yorkers that money could be used for pleasure . Once Mr. Prime had made me his partner everything seemed142 143to go my way . I was even assisted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fictional heroes . I bought from my father'screditors some supposedly worthless gold-mining stock at the price for which he had pledged it , and it turned into a very good thing . What happier ending could there be to the grim saga of the paternal obligations ? Was it not what ought to have happened to the conscientious , debt-assuming Victorian son ? Paradise was on this earth , where it belonged , and I thrilled with my first sense of the Midas touch . But the greatest reward of my successful professional life came with a letter that I received from Mr. Prescott on the occasionof my twenty-ninth birthday . He wrote that he had for some time wanted a younger point of view represented on the school board and that he was suggesting my name to Mr. Depewas the first graduate trustee of Justin ! It was like him not even to ask my permission . He knew only too well that I would jump at the chance . From the very beginning , except for my diplomatic years , I never missed a meeting of the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have been worthwhile to attend them if only to watch Frank Prescott handle my fellow members . He would stare hard at the one who was putting the question , not a muscle moving , his big brown gaze seeming to encompassnot only the question but the motive behind it . He would nod briefly , express his satisfaction that the point had been raised , immediately associate himself with the complaint , if any , contained , sometimes even rephrasing the question to give it a sharper lunge , and then proceed to defend his administration , then to counterattack , then to defend it again . It was Prescott against Prescott in a duel whose brilliance distracted the attention of the audience from the fact that Prescott was also the referee . I asked few questions myself for I found it more instructive to gather knowledge on my own . My great project , which I nursed for a year before I even began to sound out the other trustees , was to double the size of the school . Justin in 1go6 had reached an enrollment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum number of boys that a headmaster could get to know personally . I doubted that he could get to know even that many . It seemed to me that the attractive intimacy of the school 's early days had been lost forever when the roll call had passed fifty and that having lost that , we might as well push on to four or five hundred . If we went too far , of course , the essential character of the school would be lost . The point was to find the greatest number of boys on whom Prescott 's genius could still successfully operate . Otherwise we were wasting him . Could any other conclusion follow ? The trustees , on the whole , were responsive , particularly when I made it clear that I would take charge of the necessary fund raising . I had already discussed this with Mr. Prime who had promptly offered me a leave of absence . " It 's precisely the little push that your career needs at preciselythis moment ! " he exclaimed , briskly rubbing his hands . " You should see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'll all have heard of the great job that Prescott is doing at Justin , and they 'll be glad to see you , even if they do n't give you a cent . You 'll be identified with a great cause . We lawyers have to take advantage of these things , you know . After all , we ca n't advertise . Go to it , my boy , with all my blessing ! " " I was n't thinking so much of what it would do for me , " I protested , taken aback by such crassness . " I was thinking of Prescott and the school and perhaps a little bit of the rehabilitationof my father 's name . " " Well , that 's fine , dear boy , that 's fine , " Mr. Prime said soothingly . " There 's no reason you should n't knock off several birds with a stone as round and smooth as this one . " It was agreed among the trustees , after the project had been reduced to a simple outline listing the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to approach Prescott , and with the paper in my pocket and their blessing on my head , I journeyed apprehensively up to Justin for the first conference . In his study , leaning over the surface of his large uncluttered desk , a fist in each cheek , Prescott moved only his eyes as I talked : to my face , to the blotter , back to my face again . There was not even a hint of surprise in his own and certainly none of gratification . Obviously , he had been forewarned . I began to feel as if I were making a too lengthy confession of a misdeed that was more unattractive than criminal . When I leaned down to pull the outline from my briefcase he finally raised a hand . " Whoa , David , whoa ! " " Do n't you even want to see it ? " " I do n't want to see anything for just a minute , thank you , " he said in a cool , gruff tone as he stared , seemingly through me , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I need a little time to pull myself together now that your propositionhas finally come . " As he sighed , some of the frostiness went out of his tone . " I always knew it would , you know . From you or another . No matter how much the conception of a school may be one 's own , sooner or later , if it has any use , any currency , it is bound to pass into the public domain . We can keep only our failures . Obviously , I can not keep Justin . " " But it seems to me , sir , " I suggested , for I now called him " sir " and " Frank " alternately , " that with two hundred boys you 're already pretty well in that domain . " " I had hoped not , David . " He shifted his gaze to me from that imaginary audience that he so often seemed to be addressing . " I have tried to preserve some remnant of family atmos-phere . " " And you have succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . cisely that what is left of it is still compatible with a larger school . You have to recognize , sir , that not only has Justin quadrupled since its beginning , but you yourself have changed . You ca n't expect to be as intimate with the boys as when you were a younger man . You have become a rather awe-inspiring figure , like Arnold of Rugby . But the advantage of being on a pedestal is that more people can see you . " Of course , I was an idiot to have used such an image , but I was excited and nervous , and now that it was out , I could only bow my head to the angry storm . " Then why not expand the school to a thousand or more ? " he demanded , spreading his arms mockingly . " Why not build auditoriums throughout New England so that all the world may see me ? " " I doubt we could raise the money . " Prescott turned sullenly to the outline that I now placed on his desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he muttered . I must have sat for fifteen minutes in silence while he studied it . " Is this supposed to be final ? " he asked at last . " Oh , no , sir . It 's simply a draft . A suggestion . " " A draft . " His mood seemed to deepen dismally . " It would have to be changed , of course . But that 's not the point . It could be changed . The point is that so could the headmaster . And I think that you may well need a new headmaster for this magnificentnew academy of yours . " This struck me at last as a false note , and for the first time in my term as trustee I showed impatience . After all , I had worked for months on the project , and he had not even suggested that I might , however mistakenly , have the school 's welfarein mind . " If you do n't like the plan , Frank , the plan will be scrapped . The idea was not so much to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry if you find the admirationof your board so offensive . " He looked up at me quizzically , taking in my change of mood and reflecting , perhaps , that there might be grounds for it . " I 'm not acting , David , or putting on airs . You do n't know what you ask of me . It 's hard on the personality to be a headmaster . " 146He tightened his lips into the thin line that always marked his moments of peculiar candor . " It 's particularly hard on mine . It develops all my tendencies to strut and bully . Here I am , covered with mud from the bottom of my own little puddle , and you want to pitch me into a larger one ! " " It would n't be like you , Frank , to deflate the school because you were afraid it might inflate your own ego . " He gave me a shrewd look , grunted and returned to the outline . After another long silence I realized that the conversation was over , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without even an interchange of farewells . The following weekend I returned to the school , but Frank hardly spoke to me , and when he did , he was barely civil . At tea on Sunday afternoon , before leaving for my train , in HarrietPrescott 's living room , which for all its clutter of books and family photographs and heavy , dark boy-proof furniture still managed to suggest some of its mistress 's early New England austerity , I watched her fill my cup from the fine old silver urn that I remembered from " parlor night " in my own school days . Harriet was the bony kind of woman who begins to look old at thirty-five but after fifty seems younger than her contemporariesand more distinguished . At this point she had just started to dye her hair the chestnut color that it was always to remain . She did it , I am sure , not to seem young but to seem ageless , which , with her pale skin , her big , Emerson nose and dull brown dresses , she always succeeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out with me . " Oh , he is that , " she agreed readily . " You should hear the catalogue of your iniquities . But do n't worry . It will pass . " " Do you think I should not have brought the matter up ? " She considered this a moment , putting down the cup that she had half filled . " It 's hard to say . If I thought that nobody else ever would have , I might say yes . You see , I like the school as it is . But now it can never be as it is again . If your plan is re-147jected , we 'll always be a small school that could have been a big one . We 'll always be justifying ourselves . " " You make me feel very badly . " " You should n't . You 're probably quite right . If one goes in for education , one might as well educate as many as one can . It 's up to Frank and myself to live up to your plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Far from it , " she said very seriously . " One should never laugh at growth . It 's like laughing at life . " " You resent me , anyway , " I said gloomily . " Of course you do . Frank will never forgive me for interfering with his school . " " If he does n't , it will be because he ca n't forgive himself for wanting what you want . " I stared in astonishment at those cool green eyes in which a glimmer of amusement was just discernible . " He wants a bigger , Justin ? " " Oh , yes . Frank is ambitious , you know . For himself and the school , though they 're sometimes confused . But do n't imagine he 'll admit it . On the contrary , he 'll growl and grumble . He 'll blame the whole thing on you . He 'll talk about the vulgarity of size . Only he 'll go along . At the last moment . He 'll go along , fighting you every inch of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a bumpy road ! " Harriet was right . Prescott ultimately announced to the trustees his willingness to entertain the " Griscam " project , but only on condition that the plan be entirely revised and that the proposed fund for new masters ' salaries be doubled . If Justin was going to increase in quantity , he argued , it would have to increase as well in quality . It would have to achieve the highest academic rating in all of New England . Similarly , the spiritual side of school life would have to be re-emphasized , and the project was again conditioned on funds to be raised for a new chapel designed by an architect of the headmaster 's choosing . And finally he stipulated that the committee to go to the148 I 149public for money under my chairmanship was to operate under his own constant review . It was the most dictatorial program ever presented to my knowledge by a headmaster to a board of trustees , yet the latter acceded to it without a protest or a dissentingvote . It established definitively the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long tenure of office . The principal burden of working under his conditions fell , of course , upon my shoulders . Prescott proved to be a remarkable , indeed an indispensable fund raiser , but I could never be sure that he would not undo six months ' good work with a single burst of temper . When I organized dinners for friends of the school and asked him to speak , he would always comply so eloquently , so humorously , so winningly that I believe no tongue could have opened more purses . Yet behind the scenes no Italian tenor of the Metropolitan could have behaved more outrageously . Ile would fuss and fret over what he called the " Hippodrome " that I had prepared for him and demand in clipped , biting tones if his performance had been up to expectations , if his words had been converted into coin at as favorable an exchange as at the previous dinner . He would describe himselfpathetically to friends as David Griscam 's dancing bear , led by a ring through its nose from laughing village to smirking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I might not have given the whole thing up . She preserved at all times her extraordinaryequilibrium and helped me to understand the sufferingeven of the ambitious artist when he finds his work marketedon a national scale , and to see that Frank was having to learn to share his life 's dream with every starched shirtfront that I had gathered in a dozen gilded halls . It must have sometimesseemed to him that the very soul of Justin Martyr would dissolve into the smoky air over the soiled plates and stained napkins and fade away with the waves of stale laughter evoked by his own jokes . Far worse , however , than the private scenes between us , which had no effect on the fund raising , were his violent reactions to any gifts to which he chanced to see conditions , expressedor implied , attached . Sometimes he was perfectly right , as when he ushered to the door without further ceremony a man who had offered him fifty thousand dollars to admit his delinquent son to the school . At others he was too suspicious of interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuading him that a graduate 's offer to build handball courts was not necessarily an improper attempt to add a new sport to the curriculum . But the episode that made him angriest of all was that of the two new dormitories . The donor of one had modestlyleft its naming to the headmaster , while the donor of the other , in order not to seem a lone egotist , had stipulated that both buildings be named for their contributors . Prescott 's indignationat such meanness threatened to cost us not one but two dormitories , and only by the greatest diplomacy was I able to persuade the modest donor to allow his name to be used and to restrain the headmaster from mortally insulting the other . Yet for all our difficulties , the money poured in . We had almost reached our goal , except for the chapel , and I thought I was close to a pledge for that from Shelley Tanager , a Chicago meat-packer who had a boy in the fifth form , when the episode occurred that was to detonate the mounting tension betweenPrescott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . I was spending a week at Justin , where an office and secretary had now been assigned to me , and breakfasting with the Prescottswhen Frank explained the troublesome business of the " trots . " Apparently translations of Latin and Greek texts had been circulating among the boys , and the masters had been complaining of a growing uniformity in recitations . The sixth form had made raids on desks and studies and confiscated a number of trots , and severe penalties had been meted out , but the practice had stubbornly continued . It was particularly gall-150ing to Prescott , himself an accomplished classicist , to be faced with so widespread a resistance to a proper study of the ancient tongues at just the moment when he was determined to raise academic standards in proportion to the contemplated new enrollment . " It 's the kind of thing one expects of little boys , " he grumbled , " but it 's most offensive to find it in the upper forms . I 'm told it 's particularly rank in the fifth . And here we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next fall those are the boys on whom I must lean to run the school ! " " Let us hope for good things of the summer . " " It 's nothing to be facetious about , David . It 's the kind of rot that can bring a school down . " " But , surely , all schools have trouble with trots , " his wife put in . " I remember distinctly using one at Miss Yarnell 's , in French class . " Prescott glared down the table while Harriet imperturbably continued to pour coffee . " I have announced to the fifth form , " he continued , " that any member who is hereafter caught using a trot will not be welcome back next year . " " Is n't that rather stiff ? " I asked . " Perhaps it is . But I have given fair warning . It seems to be the only way to impress upon them that as sixth formers they will share with me and the masters the responsibility of administeringthe school . " I was faintly bored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see that the use of a trot would necessarily disqualify a boy from being a good administrator , but I assumed that Prescott'swarning , however fierce , would at least accomplish its purpose . I did not dream that any fifth former would be such a fool as to risk his school career for a dozen lines of Ovid . Yet as early as the third day of my visit , when I was following the boys after morning chapel over the path , soft with spring mud , to the Schoolhouse , Prescott came up beside me with the bad news. 151 " You 'll be sorry to hear , David , that a fifth former has not seen fit to heed my admonition . You 'll be even sorrier to hear who it is . " The hope of spring vanished from that day , and the light blue of the sky faded to a dead winter 's whiteness . " Shelley Tanager 's boy ? " Prescott nodded and then shook his head roughly as if to confoundthe boy and his father and perhaps myself as troublemakersin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something akin to triumph in his eye , almost of downright malevolence , which ended by exasperating me . When I thought back in later years on this scene I wondered if I could not date from it the first appearance of a new trait of hardness in Prescott , a hardness that was to grow , along with his great fame , in the coming decade and a half , culminating at last in the terrible episode of my own son , Jules . No one could write Prescott 's biography without considering this side of him . It was a spasmodic , inconsistent hardness ; a boy might spend six years at Justinwithout once encountering it , and I think most did . But those few who ran afoul of the headmaster in this period were apt to remember him for life with bitterness . " Is there no doubt about it ? " " Well , he denies it . " Prescott shrugged contemptuously . " He says the trot was put in his desk by his roommate , Max Totten . It seems sufficiently curious that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays , should find it worth his while to frame ' his benefactor . " " But not impossible . " " Ah , yes , would n't it be nice , David ? And then we should not find ourselves in the uncomfortable position of having to expelthe son of our potential benefactor , should we ? " Prescott 's voice rose in a cascade of sarcasm . We had reached the Schoolhouseand were standing outside the big windows of the assemblyhall where some of the boys could see , but not hear us . " You must not be so anxious to save the hides of those who can152be useful to us . Let us not gain the world and lose our souls ! " " Has it occurred to you , " I demanded sharply , " that you may be condemning this boy for the glory of spitting in his rich father'seye ? " For once I saw that I had the upper hand ; for once Frank Prescott was taken by surprise . It was part of his charm that he should not have made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be ? " he asked soberly , raising his eyebrows . " That would be a very terrible thing , David . " " I 'm only suggesting that you should not leap to conclu-sions . " " Would you care to be present when I see the boy ? He and Mr. Mygatt , the master who made the charge , will be in my office after assembly . " " I should indeed be interested . " " You may act as his counsel if you wish , " he said , and as he turned to go into the Schoolhouse , he gave me one of his slow , unsmiling winks . " I 'm sure that Shelley Tanager 's father can afford even the charges of a partner of Prime and Griscam . " I sat in a corner of Prescott 's office , unintroduced and almost unnoticed , during the arraignment . The master , a rather oily , olive-complexioned fellow , told his story while Shelley Tanager , junior , a tall , slight boy with curly blond hair and the pouting face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sullenly listened . The master had suspected Tanager of continuing to use a trot , although punished for it once already , and had been on the watch . He had searched the study which Tanager and Max Totten shared the night before while the school was at supper , and had found nothing . Half an hour later , during study period , he had knocked on their door , sent both boys on contrived errands and had then discovered the trot , open and face downward , as if hastily concealed , in the first drawer of Tanager 's desk . Nobody but Tanager and his roommate had entered the study between the two searches. 153 " And you deny , Tanager , that you placed it there ? " Prescott asked in the dry , melancholy tone that he used for such inquests . " I do , sir . " " If you did not , I take it there 's only one other person who could have . " " Only one , sir . That 's correct . " The boy 's expression was certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his accusation , as if his own malevolence should somehow be taken as ample evidence . " Why should Totten have had a trot ? " Prescott continued in a sterner voice . " He was a first-rate Latin scholar long before the first of these wretched books appeared on the campus . " " How do you know , sir , when the first one appeared ? " Prescott had to nod to acknowledge the unexpected justice of this . " But when do you suggest that he could have concealed the trot in your desk ? When did he have time ? " " How should I know ? It was his trot . " " His , you say . Yet you were caught with one yourself three weeks back , is that not so ? " " Yes , sir . " " And phrases from this trot , the one Mr. Mygatt discovered in your desk last night , have been found in your written exer-cises . " " If that 's so , I got them from Totten . He sometimes helped me with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's improper ! " " Yes , sir , but it 's not using a trot . " And so it went , for a quarter of an hour , Prescott 's questions , like those of a cross-examining lawyer , rising in vigor and hostility . He mercilessly pointed up the contrast between Max Totten the able student , brilliant athlete and natural leader and Shelley Tanager the dunce , the fumbler and lone wolf . Was it likely that the former would resort to a trot that he did not154 need and then use it to compromise a roommate for whom he had never shown anything but kindness and whose father was his own sole support ? Was it not more likely that Tanager , jeal- ous of the superiority of his friend both at home and at school , should have sought to cast his own blame on those stronger shoulders ? But Tanager would concede nothing , even if he could explain nothing , and when he had been dismissed , I pro- tested to Prescott against his roughness . " But the boy not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " he 's trying to get his friend expelled ! " " Are n't you begging the question ? " " Well , what more do you need to convince you , David ? Do you have to eat the whole apple to tell it 's rotten ? " " Perhaps you would allow me to ask Mr. Mygatt a few ques- tions . " " Sir , a whole history , ' " Prescott quoted impatiently and turned away in his swivel chair as I addressed myself to the mas- ter who had been listening with awe to our testy exchange . He had probably never heard the headmaster contradicted before . " Tell me , Mr. Mygatt , when you asked Tanager to go on that fabricated errand , where exactly were you standing ? " " In the doorway to his study . " " How was he able to leave ? " " Why , I stepped aside , naturally . " " Did you step back , or did you step forward into the study ? " Mygatt , perplexed , considered this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that because I saw Jimmie Dunn across the way reading a magazine , and I made a mental note to speak to him later about it . " " And when you returned to the study occupied by Totten and Tanager , Tanager was gone ? " " Gone ? Oh , yes . He had gone to the library , as I told him . " " But Totten was still there ? " " Well , only for a second . I sent him off , too . " " How long had you been in the corridor ? " - JJ " Oh , two seconds maybe . " " Not more ? Even in the exercise of your inspection of young Dunn 's reading habits ? " Mygatt flushed . " No , sir . A few seconds at the most . " " But long enough for Totten to have placed that trot in Tanager'sdrawer ? " " Oh , not possibly , sir . Besides , I should have seen him . " " How ? Through an eye in back of your head ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in a courtroom , " Prescott interrupted . " You happen to be in my office , addressinga member of my faculty . " " I 'm very well aware of that , sir . I suggest that I am using no stronger language than you used to Tanager . A boy 's whole life may be at stake here . " Prescott faced my stare for a moment and then nodded . " Proceed . " " I meant , sir , " Mygatt volunteered , " that I would have been aware of the boy 's movements . I was standing so close . " " But has the headmaster not just described Totten as a brilliantathlete ? " I pursued . " And does not that imply physical coordination ? What would be simpler for an agile boy , while your back was turned , to have crossed a small study , opened a drawer and pushed a book in ? " " But I would have heard him , Mr. Griscam ! " " If he did it stealthily ? Come , Mr. Mygatt , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not impossible . " Mygatt glanced at the headmaster in appeal , but the latter only scowled and grumbled : " Answer the question , Mygatt . It 's a fair one . " " Very well , then , sir . I suppose it was n't actually impossible . Only I ca n't see . . . " Thank you , Mr. Mygatt , " I interrupted firmly . " And now to the matter of the trot itself . Where is it ? " " In the faculty room . The Latin masters have been examiningit to see what phrases they can pick up in their exercises . " 156 " You mean they 've been handling it ? " " How do you mean , handling it ? " " I mean touching it . Putting their fingers on it . " " Well , inevitably . " I groaned aloud . " I suppose a print test would show half the fingers of the faculty . " " You do n't mean you 'd go in for fingerprinting here ? " Prescottasked , shocked . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence ! " I exclaimed . " Let me ask you , Mr. Mygatt , to lock the trot up until this investigation is over . " I turned to Prescott . " Will you allowme to see Totten alone ? " He shrugged . " Most certainly . I shall see that he 's sent directly to your office . " " Not for an hour , please . I 'd like to study his file first . " At my own desk , with the door closed , I studied the contents of the manila folder marked " Totten , Max , Form of 19o8 . " There was a passport-size snapshot of him , full face , showing a high forehead , a big jaw and nose , every feature giving the impression of strength and cauclor except for the small dark eyes . I learned that his father had been an impoverished cousin of Mr. Tanager 's and that he had grown up an orphan in the millionaire'shousehold , earning his keep by bolstering , morally and intellectually , his feebler cousin . He appeared to have the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but despite what were evidently engaging manners he was not popular with his formmates . He was considered " political , " according to one master 's report and " insincere " according to another 's . In each case , I noted , the reporting master disagreed with the boys whom he quoted . Max Totten was evidently a student who knew how to ingratiate himself with the faculty . When he came in , he struck me as even bigger , darker and more attractive than I had visualized . Unlike his cousin and roommate , he was already a man. 157 " What can I do for you , Mr. Griscam ? " he began , politely enough . I explained , slowly and carefully , the accusation made against Shelley Tanager and the damning nature of the evidence . All this he knew already and shook his head with a very proper commiseration . I then proceeded to relate Mr. Mygatt 's story , beginning with the search of the study during supper and takingit step by step to the discovery of the trot . Totten listened to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching for the least reaction to his discovery from my recitation that if he had planted the trot in Tanager 's desk , Tanager , and later Tanager 's father , would necessarily know of it . For Mr. Mygatt 's first search , of which Totten could not have previously known , had established that the trot had not been in the study before the boys had come in after supper . He did not so much as blink . " Mr. Mygatt might have put it there himself , " he suggested blandly when I asked for his comments . " Why on earth would he do that ? " " To curry favor with the Rector . He 's like that , you know . " " I ca n't believe it , Totten ! " He shrugged . " It was only an idea . I 'd do anything to see poor Shelley cleared . He 's the oldest friend I have in the world . " I had to pause here to reflect . The only thing I had not consideredwas that Totten might not have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tanager seems to think . " His eyebrows rose . " It 's not , sir ? What does Shelley think ? " " He told Dr. Prescott that you had put that trot in his desk . " Totten looked at me steadily for a moment , but his expressionstruck me not so much as alarmed or shocked or even as very much surprised , but simply as interested , intensely interested . " It must have been you or he , " I pursued. 158 " Or Mr. Mygatt , " Totten retorted with a smile that struck me suddenly as impudent . With a familiarity in marked contrast to his former deference , he rose from his chair and went to the window where he stood looking out , casually twirling the shade cord . He must have remained there in total silence for almost three minutes while I stared at his back . I assumed that he was concocting an alibi , and I was too interested in what it might be to interrupt him . " Or dear little mincing Mygatt , " he said at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , Totten , that Mr. Mygatt is a member of the faculty of this school and that I am a trustee . " " Oh , keep your shirt on , Griscam , " he retorted with a cool , shocking insolence , turning back to me with a now brazen smile . " You and I do n't have to kid ourselves , do we ? You 're scared shitless this little affair will do you out of old Tanager 's dough , are n't you ? " " Totten ! I shall have to report you to the headmaster . " " What the hell , lay off it , will you ! " His barking tone startled me with its authority . " I knew when they put a shyster like you on my trail , the game was up . All right , so I put the goddam trot in little Shelley 's desk . Is that enough for you ? Can I go now ? Or shall I give old Prescott other grounds to throw me out by kicking you first in the tail ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that grinning , insinuating , oddly unhostile countenance , I found that for all my years at the bar , I had no idea what to do next . It was he who solved it . He walked slowly up to me , still smiling , and suddenlystuck out his hand . Hypnotized , I took it , at which he laughed aloud , winked and left the room . Certainly he had a kind of disgusting animal charm . There was an uncomfortable democracy in his total cynicism . I sighed , shuddered , shook my head and prepared to make my report to the headmaster . Prescott took my news like a gentleman . He put his arm about my shoulders and gave me a hug . " You 've saved me from159an act of brutal injustice , David . I must learn a proper humility with regard to your profession . I confess to the ancient and un worthy prejudice against lawyers . I have always accused them of not seeing the forest for the trees . Yet I was the one who could n't see those trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have torn up young Tanager , a tender sapling , roots and all . Yes , there was prejudice . Because the poor boy was unattractiveand unathletic , I would have had him vicious , too . While the one who was clever enough to cast himself in the image that I set up was the real rotter . Oh , it 's a lesson for me , David ! " Harriet Prescott , however , professed to find the whole thing incredible . " I 'm not going to say it to anyone else , " she told me as I circled the campus with her and her dogs before lunch . " Obviously , if Max Totten has confessed , I 'm bound by it . But I will say to you , David , that it baffles me . I 've watched that boy carefully . He always came to my parlor nights . I feel that I know him and that I like what I know . The boys may not , but I do . He 's more mature than the others . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to make up for it in life . Oh , yes , he 's devious and sly and intriguing . He 'd use a thousandtrots and swear on the Bible he had n't . But I ca n't believe that he 'd have placed that trot in Shelley Tanager 's desk . His one virtue is loyalty ! " I was greatly troubled , for I knew Harriet to be a shrewd judge of character , considerably shrewder , even , than her husband . Also , it occurred to me that it was odd that Totten , even if guilty , should have confessed to an action that would forever embroil him with his patron , Mr. Tanager . Why would he not have brazened it out ? Might he not have convinced the father that the son was lying , or at least mistaken ? And , after all , he had nothing to lose by trying , for this way he was both expelled from Justin and damned with the Tanagers . After our walk I went to the chapel , so soon , as I hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and prayed earnestly for guidance , but I
