For the orderly Belgians , the Congo conference in Brussels had been a three-week nightmare . Even as they were preparing to announce the Congo 's imminent independence , Joseph Kasavubu , 42 , the top Congolese leader , stomped out of the conference and disappeared for two weeks . Another delegate , for obscure reasons , packed up and vanished in the direction of Communist East Berlin . New delegations arrived almost daily from the Congo and demanded places at the talks ; by last week nearly 100 were seated around the table , and , transporting them by limousines having proved impossible , they moved from hotels to sessions in chartered streetcars . Meetings were a mad mlange of inflammatory speeches , door-slamming walkouts , rival press conferences and angry communiqus as 60 Congolese parties and innumerable tribal chiefs jockeyed for position in the race to lead the vast new nation-to-be . One delegate tried to restrain the others by quoting an old tribal saying : " He who tries to eat before the others burns himself . " Chief rival for the power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk in Stanleyville who served six months in jail in 1958 for embezzling $2,400 in postal money . He was arrested again after nationalist riots last November in which more than 20 were killed . Released from a Congo jail three weeks ago to lead his Congolese National Movement delegation at Brussels , he arrived proudly showing wrists bandaged from wearing tight handcuffs . <P> Kasavubu 's Abako group campaigned for a loose federal system in the new Congo , since its strength is mostly confined to the Leopoldville province . Lumumba , whose party group has wider geographical sup port , felt he would do better with a centralized regime . In the end the Belgians worked out a compromise modeled on the U.S. system with elaborate assurances of local and provincial authority . <P> The Belgians agreed to practically all the Congolese political demands in the hope that independence will result in happy economic cooperation .
