IT almost seemed last week as if Western opinion were divided only between those who felt that the U.N . was about to die and those who believed that it was already dead . <P> Quite a few were ready to welcome its demise . <P> When the Security Council blocked any action against India 's aggression in Goa , Adlai Stevenson , recalling the League of Nations ' failure to oppose aggression , gloomily warned : " We are witnessing the first act in a drama which could end with the U.N . ' s death . " British Foreign Secretary Lord Home , criticizing the U.N . action against Katanga , warned that Britain might withdraw its financial support . In Washington there were demands for congressional investigation of U.S. policies toward the U.N . <P> But the U.N . is not dying , nor is it behaving very differently from its usual form . Instead of either gloom or wrath , the week 's events should have evoked a new , realistic appraisal of what the U.N . really is and what it can accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those who had consistently overestimated the U.N.-either by regarding it as the supreme source of law and morality ( the liberals ) , or as a world conspiracy to undermine U.S. and other nations ' sovereignty ( the right-wingers ) . The U.N . is , of course , neither . <P> While it has created , in a very small way , something like an international civil service and the beginnings of a supranational loyalty , it remains no more than the sum of its parts-and expresses , often enough , only the lowest common denominator of its members ' policies . It can never be several things that overly enthusiastic supporters have , to its own disadvantage , wanted it to be . It can not solve major world issues ( Berlin , nuclear testing ) because of the veto system , which accurately reflects the realities of a divided world . It can not be a substitute for national policy , and should not be an easy dumping ground for problems . <P> It is not , as President Kennedy said last fall , " the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps reduce but can not replace the use of force for urgent national self-interest . That is why some observers who do not necessarily approve of Nehru 's actions in Goa feel , nevertheless , that Stevenson became somewhat too sweeping in his condemnation of the use of force . Since Korea , the U.S. has used force in Lebanon and may have to use it again in Cuba or Viet Nam . <P> The New Facts . What seemed particularly annoying about the U.N . ' s position on Goa was that Afro-Asian nations which , like India itself , have always preached patience and compromise to the U.S. , did not even raise a whisper of protest over India 's Charter violation . As Paris ' Le Monde put it : " One could hope that a few voices would be heard in the neutralist camp to deplore , in however friendly a fashion , the Indian decision . It seems that anticolonialism excuses everything . " Obviously unable to line up any support from Afro-Asian nations to censure India , the U.S. dropped the matter with unseemly haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.N .
