txt Electrical signals from pieces of brain kept alive in glass tubes for as long as two weeks have been recorded by scientists at the medical branch of the University of Texas . This is believed to be the first report of brain signals from fragments of the tissue maintained outside the body in a completely artificial medium . In addition to what can be learned from the achievement itself , the techniques that made it possible promise far-reaching applications for research . It may now be possible , for example , to map out the functional development of the brain . Stages in the structural development of that organ have long been known . The new research // ghoul d permit scientists to find out precisely when and in what structures electrical activity a first appears and how it spreads throughout the tissue . The achievement should also have important medical applications .

The report of this achievement was made by Dr. Alastair W. B. Cunningham , Marshall Daugherty and Billy J. Rylander . The Texas scientists , like many others before them , had tried for a long time to get electrical activity from pieces of brain tissue in culture . This had been done with peripheral nerves and with developing brains in intact embryos but never with explants of brain fragments in an artificial medium , Dr. Cunningham said in a telephone interview . The reason for failures may have been that the fluids in which workers tried to grow , embryonic brain tissue did not correspond closely enough quantitatively to its natural environment , the scientist suggested . All the necessary ingredients were in the artificial media but -. apparently not in the correct proportions . At least this is one conclusion that might be drawn from the Texas results . Natural Tissue Fluids The scientists struck on what seems to be the right formula for growing electrically active brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance of heart muscle ' in tissue culture . Chick embyro heart tissue in standard culture media did not perform as well as it could or should have , Dr. Cunningham said , and so an exhaustive study of natural tissue fluids was be , gun to arrive at a better syn , thetic one . After about a year of this work , the scientists arrived at a formula for the proportions of ingredients in an artificial medium that corresponded closely to those in natural tissue fluid . Not only did the new culture medium greatly improve the function of embryonic heart , Dr. Cunningham said , but elec-trical signals from chick ern. bryo brain fragments were recorded on the first experiment . The scientists continued using chick embryo brain throughout their experiments . " We realized we may have stumbled on something big , " , the scientist said , " so we spent the next six months trying tcv make sure we really had brain , signals and not something ; else .

Tests Were Negative All those tests were negative , ' and the scientists felt justified in opening a communication to the current number of Nature with the following : " Since July , 1959 , we have been recording spontaneous potentials from explants of brain tissue culture * * * " The signals were described ; further as step-like combinations of positive and negative electrical pulses lasting from a ? half to one and a half seconds each with a magnitude of up to , twenty-five-millionths of a volt. ! They were " not unlike the signals generated in the whole , brain , " Dr. Cunningham said . The 37-year-old Scot , who left I the University of Edinburgh eight years ago for research at ! the Gulf Coast university , said , he hoped the new findings would help in obtaining funds for new laboratory equipment with which to ask certain basic questions . of brain tissue that could not ' have been posed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
