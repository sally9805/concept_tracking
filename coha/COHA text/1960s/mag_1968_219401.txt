As a judge on Hitler 's dreaded wartime People 's Court , Hans-Joachim Rehse signed 231 death sentences . Last year a West German lower court sentenced Rehse , now 66 , to five years in prison as an accessory to " legal murder . " Plainly convinced that the sentence was far too light , the Federal Court in Karlsruhe ordered a retrial on the grounds that he was either wholly responsible or wholly innocent and should be sentenced accordingly . Last week a Berlin criminal court touched off a nationwide uproar by acquitting Rehse . <P> Catcalls and outraged shouts of " Pfui , Pfui ! " interrupted Judge Ernst-Juergen Oske 's reading of the verdict . A man in the audience rose and cried : " Millions were murdered-and now a sentence like this ! " As Rehse , his greying head raised high , tried to walk from the room , an elderly man slapped his face and cried : " Shame , you blood judge , for all the victims you have on your conscience ! " Berlin Mayor Klaus Schtz called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. deputy chief of counsel at the Nrnberg Trials , who now lives in Frankfurt , described the ruling as " the greatest setback of German justice since 1945 . " For once , the New Left and the right-wing press of Axel Springer found themselves in agreement . Both condemned the judgment as outrageously lenient . <P> Death to All . Under Rehse 's cold eye , leniency was rarely a problem . He sat in judgment of a schizophrenic boy who wrote from a juvenile asylum requesting " weapons , munitions , cameras , explosives and a diamond ring " to overthrow the Nazi regime ; of a Catholic priest who dispatched an appeal for a " humane peace " to a Swedish bishop ; of an internationally famous biologist who told a friend that he expected the Third Reich to crumble . All were condemned to death . To be sure , Rehse served only as a member on the bench of one of Hitler 's most notorious political judges , " Raving Roland " Freisler , who escaped the Allies ' justice by dying in an air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court noted last year that German judges always act collectively . <P> Judge Oske 's reasoning took another tack . It is one that could , if it is accepted as a precedent , free 45 remaining former Nazi judges and prosecutors from prosecution . Oske insisted that Rehse and his seven fellow judges on Freisler 's dreaded Volksgerichtshof did not deliberately subvert the law as then applicable . Thus , while the sentences in which Rehse participated were " inhuman as seen today , in times of war no nation and no state can get along with normal means of defense . Germany was in a life-and-death struggle . " <P> At 42 , Oske hardly qualifies as a remnant of the Nazi judiciary that survived the war . His legal education came after the war , and he has established a reputation as a competent , calm and fair judge . Overwhelmed by the reaction to his decision , he suffered a nervous breakdown a few days later . Meanwhile , as 7,000 left-wing students demonstrated against the verdict on Berlin 's Kurfrstendamm , Chief Federal Prosecutor Ludwig Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the acquittal .
