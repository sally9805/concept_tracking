The assembling audience finds a huge , projected triptych made up of three identical photographs of W. Somerset Maugham by Karsh . Fifteen minutes before the performance , a musical potpourri made up of songs popular from 1874 to 1966 begins , played in random , non-chronological order . At the same time , the photographs begin to change , one by one . We see Maugham at two , at ninety , at forty ; with his friends : Churchill , Shaw , Ethel Barrymore , Chaplin ; , and in various parts of the world : France , Spain , Japan , Tahiti , Russia . The melange of sights and sounds ends . The curtain rises . GARSON KANIN , wearing a dinner jacket , stands , spotlit , at the right side of the stage . The left of the stage is in darkness . GARSON KANIN December 15 , 1965 . Beverly Hills.Somerset Maugham is dead.A few minutes ago , at the beginning of the eleven o'clock news on CBS , the announcer speaks the teaser . " Life in the sky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories and others after this message . " A commercial , during which I say to Ruth , " I 'm afraid he 's gone . It has that sound . " " Yes , " she says.The announcer returns with the news we have been half-expecting , half-dreading for the past five days . It is over , then . Our good friend is no more . An era ends . A most civilized and articulate link with a gentler time is broken.As with the death of all great men , his is only partial . His ravaged body will soon be ash . His brain is blacked out , his spirit extinguished . But the best of him , his work , remains . In addition , those of us who were fortunate enough to know him have a legacy of rich remembrance.He lived for ninety-one years , ten months , and fifteen day . Did anyone ever cleave to life more tenaciously than he in his final years ? We are all , if sane , expected to do so , and yet , Somerset Maugham astonished all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle . His enemies called it stubborn ; his friends thought it valiant . Why were we surprised ? Simply because throughout the long course of his life and especially during the last two thirds of it , he seemed to regard existence , with a cynical eye , as a cosmic practical joke . Only fools took it seriously , he observed.There are those who say he was inspired by the example of his brother Frederick , Lord Maugham , who lived to be ninety-one . Others claim he was arbitrarily aiming for one hundred . He is said to have said that it would amuse him to outdo Bernard Shw . And one waggish chum suggested that Maugham simply could not bear the idea of a span shorter than that of his difficult mother-in-law , Mrs. Barnardo , who lived to be one hundred and two . ( A match is lit across the stage , and lights come up slowly on SOMERSET MAUGHAM , who sits in a large armchair , lighting a cigarette . Beside him : a small table with an ashtray , a decanter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a telephone . Lights come up on the full stage . From this point on , the lighting plot follows the focus of the action : intensifying on the character who should have the attention of the audience , dimming on the other . Throughout , however , it must be remembered that WSM is the portrait and GK the painter . Thus , the concentration of light should be always on WSM . Further , the light will suggest night , day , interior or exterior , suiting the text ) In the winter of 1954 , he was spending a few months in London at the Dorchester . My wife and I called on him and were delighted to find him in great form . When we arrived , we found him sitting in front of the television set , watching an inane quiz program . ( The sounds of the program are heard ) He motioned us to chairs . p. 3 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM It www will end shortly . Sit down . Get them a drink , Alan . GARSON KANIN ( To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He jumped up  --  I mean jumped ! ( WSM does so )  --  moved with great rapidity to the set and struck it dumb . ( WSM does so . The sound goes off ) The picture , however , was left on and continued to flash , squirm , bounce and jerk for the next hour and a half in frustrated silence . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM You do n't mmm mind that , do you ? It keeps on all day long and all nnn night , so far as I know . GARSON KANIN Why ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Because  --  it is an innovation . ( WSM sits ) GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) We sat down to talk , to catch up with one another after almost a year . ( To WSM ) Well , have you had any adventures since we last saw you ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Yes . I ddd died . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) The final word was slightly delayed and partially stammered , adding to the shock effect . ( To WSM ) Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come now , you  --  you of all people should recognize a fine dramatic opening . ( He takes a sip of his drink ) The rest of the story is this : I fell ill , and was taken to a hospital in Lausanne  --  excellent  --  where all sorts of things I did not want done to me were done to me . I grew weaker by the hour and was drugged a good deal of the time . Surgery of some sort was performed and after a few days , the doctors conveyed to me the intelligence that I was better than ever . Now , I 'm a doctor myself , and so I did not believe them . A young , American intern said something about " being out of the woods " , whatever that may mean , and actually clapped me on the shoulder . But no one knows more about the patient than the patient , and I knew that I was not functioning as I should  --  as I had been for eighty years . There was no point in telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could . That night , I refused the sss sedation . I felt it might do me in and rob me. of the resources I needed . I began to sink . The doctors returned . I felt needles in my arm and in my bum . Time ended . It might have been an hour , or a century . The light began to change . ( The light on him intensifies ) To my surprise , it did not grow darker  --  but lighter ! ( The light on him is now very strong ) It became iridescent , blinding . I could sense my pulse fading and my heartbeat slowing , and still the light increased in intensity , and then a most exquisite sense of relief set in and continued . ( The light on him fades rather quickly ) Very like a ppp prolonged orgasm , if you please , but not merely of the genitals  --  a great final orgasm , a giving up of the whole being : body , spirit , soul , all . I knew that the end had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it so exceedingly pleasant . ' I do n't mind this at all , ' I thought . ' Half an hour in the dentist 's chair is far worse . Oh well , ' I mused as the last of life left me , ' I 've had a good enough time , and all in all it 's been a most gratifying experience . ' Then something told me to let go . And I smiled and I let go . And ddd died . ( He lights a fresh cigarette with the butt of his last ) Imagine my consternation when I was awakened by a ccc cold thermometer being pressed into my anus . I moved away and shouted sss something vile and stayed cross all the day . It was not until teatime that I realized my good fortune . Now that I knew what death was like , I need no longer fear it . I can describe it accurately  --  natural death is the final relaxation , nothing more . GGG Give them another drink , Alan . p. 5 GARSON KANIN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the age of eighty . Almost everyone around when I was around , called him " Willie " . It was something I could never bring myself to do and even now I do not know why . He was never " Willie " to me . For one thing , I was awed by his great age . He was nearly forty years my senior . For another , it was not a name which , in my opinion , suited him . I can not think of Hank Ibsen , of Gus Strindberg , or Tony Chekhov , or Charlie Dickens , or , it follows , Willie Maugham . April 1949 . New York.Somerset Maugham is a stammerer . He does not stutter . He stammers . That is to say , he does not repeat a consonant over and over again before completing a word as n-n-n-n-n . Rather , his organs of speech seemed blocked . Stuck . Making the sound more like nnn night . I had always thought that " stutter " and " stammer " were synonymous until one night in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail . Obviously , he has given much time and thought to the subject , although he discusses it rarely . In his many autobiographical works : THE SUMMING UP , POINTS OF VIEW , STRICTLY PERSONAL , A WRITER 'S NOTEBOOK , and so on , he scarcely mentions it.In 1933 , he wrote an introduction to a special edition of Arnold Bennett 's THE OLD WIVES ' TALE . I always found him to be somewhat patronizing toward Bennett . He was fond of telling teasing stories about Bennett 's gaucheries and pretentions and stinginess  --  as when Bennett once set up a mistress but offered to share her with Maugham for the purposes of economy ! Yet , there was always a soft spot somewhere in his feeling for Bennett , a sense of compassion . I wonder now if it did n't have something to do with the fact that Bennett , too , stammered . Consider this passage from Maugham 's essay on Bennett : p. 6 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Arnold was afflicted with a very bad stammer . It was painful to watch the struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was torture to him . Few realized the exhaustion it caused him to speak . What to most men was as easy as breathing , to him was a constant strain . It tore his nerves to pieces . Few knew the humiliation it exposed him to , the ridicule it excited in many , the impatience it aroused . The minor exasperation of thinking of a good , amusing , or apt remark and not venturing to say it in case the stammer ruined it . Few knew the distressing sense it gave rise to of a bar to complete contact with other men . It may be that except for the stammer which forced him to introspection , Arnold would never have become a writer . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) I think Maugham was writing there as much about himself as he was about Arnold Bennett . He finds a graceful , objective , selfless way to express his feelings on the subject , to convey to us something of the agony of his own affliction . December 1954 . London.Maugham was honored last night by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only three other men have been so feted . Charles Dickens , William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope . Maugham must have had deep feelings of time and tide when he recalled that it was his father , Robert Maugham , who had proposed Thackeray for membership in The Garrick Club . The occasion was stately and moving , but began in a disquieting , nerve-testing way . Maugham was introduced  --  ( WSM rises and moves to the front and center of the stage )  --  took a standing ovation , and , when the guests had regained their seats , began his address . p. 7 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Mister Chairman . MMM Members of The GGG Garrick . There are mm many virtues in growing old . ( A pause ) GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) He paused . He swallowed , he wet his lips , he looked about . The pause stretched out . He looked dumbstruck . The pause became too long , far too long . He looked down , studying the tabletop . ( WSM does so ) A terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill ? Would he ever be able to get on with it ? Finally , he looked up . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I 'm just ttt trying to think what they are ! ( WSM returns to his chair ) GARSON KANIN 1951 . St. Jean-Cap Ferrat.Mr . Maugham is a fast eater . I am a slow eater , especially when the food is superior , as it is here . These two facts have been causing twice-a-day friction . Maugham is always served first . Thus , the person sitting on his left is the last to be served . When there are six or more , Maugham has finished every morsel on his plate by the time the guest on his left is being served . He then puts down his utensils , lights a cigarette , and smokes it impatiently , looking about at everyone 's plate . At the first luncheon , I admit I was perhaps too slow , because I made the mistake of trying to talk . Everyone had finished . He looked at me. p. 8 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Why do n't you eat it , then ? GARSON KANIN I am . ( A pause ) WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Oh . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) But I took the hint and wolfed what remained . Later , when we moved out onto the terrace , I said to him , ( To WSM ) Do you agree that most of the human friction in the world is caused by variations in rhythm ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Of course . I can imagine a sharp little story about a man and a woman ddd deeply in love who come to a bitter end of their relationship bbb because she eats swiftly and he eats slowly . GARSON KANIN Why do n't you write it ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I no longer write short stories . I am now the well-known essayist . GARSON KANIN How about an essay , then , on the subject ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM One could do a good one , you know . The various rhythms in which people behave most certainly affect compatibility . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly or too slowly , as the case may be . And the difference in the rhythm of card playing may be the worst of all . Now , all of us who play have been mmm maddened sometimes by slow players . I , for my part , refuse to take part in games with slowpokes . And when it comes to the rhythm of physical contact or lovemaking , I suppose an adjustment of the rhythm makes for successful relationships and the failure to adjust makes for unsuccessful ones . Rhythm , I suppose , is the mmm major element in the organization of the universe . Think of the rhythm of the seasons . Consider that almost every object is rhythmic in the sense that it is a rrr repetition of a pattern . Your face , for example . If I put a line down the mmm middle of it , I 'd have a half which is then repeated for the other half . Most beautiful trees are symmetrical . And flowers . And animals . And art objects . The heartbeat , rhythmic . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) And I gather that 's what makes poetry so ppp passionate and music so moving . From this , it 's only a short bbb bridge to form . One might say that a non-rhythmic thing is lacking in form . All the words surrounding this idea mean the same thing in the end , do n't they ? Rhythm , form , tempo , pace , organization , balance . Form . That , I suppose , has been the major preoccupation of my life . Form . ( Hawaiian music fades in and continues to the end of this section ) p. 9 GARSON KANIN 1953 . St. Jean-Cap Ferrat.At Claudette Colbert 's party last night  --  a Hawaiian luau of all things  --  the South Seas atmosphere mellowed Maugham , and he talked of Tahiti and of his travels in that part of the world . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I do n't enjoy ttt travel . I find it interesting , but nnn not enjoyable . GARSON KANIN Why do you do so much of it then ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I do n't , any longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has been in the past year to London , Paris , Vienna , Madrid , Zurich , Venice , and Abano , but I suppose he does not call this traveling in the way that he used to . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM But when I did , it was to find mmm material . Do you imagine I would have written THE MOON AND SIXPENCE had I not gone to Tahiti ? Some think I went there because of the book . It was actually the other way about . I did the book because I went there . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) The party got going for fair shortly after dinner . ( WSM moves to the front of the stage and sits , cross-legged , on the floor ) We had all become accustomed to the restful posture of sitting on the ground and were reluctant to leave it . So there was a lot of crawling about and lolling . At one time , Claudette was the only one on her feet , seeing to things . Then my eyes hit Maugham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beckoned to me . I went to him at once . ( He moves to WSM ) p. 10 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Sit down . Here . ( GK does so ) I would like to have some intellectual conversation with you . GARSON KANIN Very well . Do you think there is a God ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I do n't know . I do know that you 've chosen a qqq question which I 've pondered a good deal . As you can see , I am a very old man , and I have lived a full life in many parts of the world . I 've known many thousands , encountered hundreds of thousands , and seen mmm millions . I 've talked and listened and read  --  I suppose it would be accurate to say that I 've tried to find an answer to that question in one way or another all my life . Now here I am , nnn nearing the end , and the best I can offer in reply is to say , " I do n't know ! " Not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agnostic view seems to be a cop-out . I 'd rather have someone hold a strong opinion than try for the middle . Do n't you agree that in these matters  --  hope , faith , belief  --  a positive wrong is better than a negative right ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I would n't know about that , but  --  did you say " cop-out " ? GARSON KANIN Yes . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM What does it mean ? p. 11 GARSON KANIN It means to make an excuse for not acting . They used to say " cop a plea "  --  now it 's cop-out . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM ' Cop-out ' . Is it underworld in origin ? GARSON KANIN Probably . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Ah , the American language ! I admire it , but I ca n't www write it . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) We were being offered brandy . He took some . I declined , and persisted . ( To WSM ) Well , now , what about God ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I hesitate to cop-out , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists or no , I can not tell for certain , but I am www willing to say that I think it mmm most unlikely . ( The Hawaiian music fades out ) GARSON KANIN 1951 . St. Jean-Cap Ferrat.Today at last , he takes us up to his study . It is atop the house , reached by a separate staircase . He explains as we mount it that he added on this part of the structure . The room is large and spare . There is not much in it . One wall of books , mostly by him . I am turned around and can not get my bearings . I know we are high up , but I can not see the view from any of the windows . ( To WSM ) Which way is Nice ? p. 12 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM ( Pointing ) There . I had the view blocked off . This room is for working , not looking . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) It is the one room in the house without pictures , save one . Over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a portrait of a woman  --  head and bust . A round , adorable face , high color , red hair , saucy expression . She suggests immediately Rosie of CAKES AND ALE . ( To WSM ) Who 's this ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM ( Quietly ) The woman I loved . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) There 's a beautiful , painted door that leads to a small terrace . He tells us that it 's a door from one of Paul Gauguin 's cabins in Tahiti . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM See , here , at the bottom  --  the stained part . That 's where his ddd dog peed on it . But it means much to me  --  having Gauguin 's door in my room . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) The table at which he writes is outsized . I estimate it at about eight feet long . It 's solid and two or three inches lower than average ( to accommodate his short stature , I suppose . ) It 's neat and tidy . I compliment him on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I accept that because I lll look after myself up here for the most part . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) We start down . I notice that he glances at the portrait of Rosie again . Cocktails . He is surprised when we decline . He asks if we want something else , suggests tomato juice . We accept . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Winston drinks a great deal and manages well . As for me , I am blessed by nature with a fortunate mechanism . If I consume one more drop that I should , I become violently ill on the instant . It 's always been so . When I was a student  --  and on a pub crawl  --  one too many and I would be incapacitated for ddd days . It 's a great bit of luck for me , that valve . I wish everyone had one . Actually , I 've only been drunk three times in the course of my life . Each time I thought I was going to enjoy the experience and each time I was disappointed . GARSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of his pictures . He tells of the increasing difficulty of keeping them safe . Whenever he leaves St. Jean-Cap Ferrat for any length of time , the paintings are stored in the vault of his bank in Nice . And of course , he explains , he pays regular fees to the Thieves ' Union . ( To WSM ) The what ? p. 14 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Yes . The Thieves ' Union . It 's been in existence here on the cte d'Azur for as 111 long as anyone can remember . When I first arrived in 1928 , a committee paid a call . They were most correct and formal and explained that my property would be exempt from mmm molestation upon payment of a nominal fee . There was no profit in this , they insisted  --  not for anyone  --  but there were expenses involved . GARSON KANIN At home we call it " protection " . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Quite so . Well , I told them that as a matter of principle , I would pay nnn nothing . They were extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took their leave . A few days later something was stolen from the house . I am not going to ttt tell you what it was . The following week  --  something more  --  a lawnmower and a wheel from one of the cars . On the first of the month , the same committee came again and made the ppp proposal as though it had never been mmm made before . This time I accepted . I 've always paid them . The rates have gone up several times and nothing has ever been stolen . Of course , I still put the pictures in the vvv vault when I leave . It does n't do to offer temptation . ( He lights a cigarette ) p. 15 GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) He smokes . He smokes heavily and enjoys it . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM It may be that my lungs , having twice suffered tuberculosis and twice bbb beaten the disease , may have reinforced themselves to uncommon sturdiness . In any event , I have no intention of ddd doing anything about it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such great pleasure at so small a risk . Worrying about it may make me ill sooner than smoking itself . GARSON KANIN February 3 , 1949 . New York.Today I asked him again about that morning routine of his because , candidly , it is giving me some trouble . He reiterated that no matter what or where , he had his breakfast at eight and got to work by nine . ( To WSM ) But how do you do it ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I do it by doing it . Not by thinking about it or ttt talking about it or considering it or analyzing it . Do you see ? GARSON KANIN Yes , sir . What 's next for you in the way of work ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Well , I 'm considering a final autobiographical book . Different in form from the others . Essays , perhaps . People no longer write essays . A pity . It 's such a nnn nice form . p. 16 GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) Later , I express the hope that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall never do that . I shall most certainly nnn never write another play as long as I live . But then , that is not so much of a promise , since I certainly sha n't live very long . GARSON KANIN How can you be so sure ? How can you know that tonight just before you go to sleep , or in the morning , as you 're shaving , you may not be struck by the best idea for a play you 've ever had ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I know because I no longer think in the category of plays . Moreover , I have never been ' struck ' , as you put it , by an idea for anything . It 's more a case of mmm mining with me . Mining and refining . When I was interested in the theatre , I would turn up an idea for a play daily . Often two or three . Assuredly , most of them were ppp poor . But they were ideas . When I was interested in short stories , these ideas would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No more theatre for me . With all its glamor , I found it a frustrating and maddening world , full of childish people  --  charming but childish . I adored them , but they often nnn needed spanking , and how does one go about spanking , say , Ethel Barrymore ? p. 17 GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) We talk of Ethel . He was , he confesses , at one time hopelessly smitten with her . And then he returns to the starting point . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM ( Sadly ) No . Never another play . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) There was I , sipping my single sugarless bourbon old-fashioned and trying to remember that one glass of wine would be all  --  and there sat old Maugham , tossing off a huge martini , another , wine , brandy , the works . Throughout dinner , cigarettes . After dinner , a big cigar . Me , rounding out my shaky first year of no smoking . I asked him if he thought his early years as a medical student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live  --  that is , in the physical sense . Might this not have been a decisive factor in his longevity ? The knowledge and experience , the clinical ability to diagnose , to recognize symptoms quickly , to care for his body.His reply was in the negative . He said that he owed his life today , from the medical point of view , to his discovery of an outstanding American-Jewish doctor , now resident in the United States , named Dr. Max Wolf . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Recommended to me by a ddd drunken neighbor of mine in the South of France . This is the same doctor who has kkk kept Elsie Mendl alive all these years  --  whether you think that is a ggg good thing or not ! But I must say this : it was indeed my study and training as a doctor , and my work at St. Thomas 's , which taught me all I know of human nnn nature . I learned more about people than merely what their bbb bodies had to tell . And what I learned  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons  --  is that ppp pain and suffering do not ennoble the human spirit . Not at all . Pain and suffering bbb breed meanness , bitterness , selfishness , cruelty . It is only happiness which ennobles. p. 18 GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) A little later it was strange , more than strange , to see Maugham 's face change , and to hear his voice segue into another key , when the subject of Syrie , his wife , was introduced . Now , Ruth knows Syrie far better than I do , but both of us have always found her to be a perfectly amiable and warm lady . We see no reason not to say so to him . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Liza has never shown the slightest inclination toward looking after herself or supporting herself in any way . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) What 's this ? We were talking of Syrie a moment ago , and now he 's onto Liza , his daughter . Is he getting tired ? Potted ? Should we stop ? Or is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not at all . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM This unfortunate condition is entirely the fault of her mmm mother . A foolish woman who has never been interested in anything really except social position . She is , and always has been , a snob . She brought Liza up to believe that nothing in life is mmm more important than the right sort of marriage . I blame her not only for what she caused me to mmm miss in my life , but for what I know she is going to cause Liza to mmm miss in hers . p. 19 GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) With some effort and no little skill , we manage to steer him off this subject and onto a more palatable one . The house at St. Jean-Cap Ferrat . ( To WSM ) What about it ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM It takes twelve to run it . Twelve the year round . It is an extremely bbb beautiful structure , and a pleasant place to live , but it is a bad writing lll location . GARSON KANIN Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stream of life , with people , with happenings of import . As such , you see , it is ideal for rest or for retirement , but it is not a ggg good place for a working writer to live . GARSON KANIN But do n't most writers long for a getaway place  --  away from what goes on , so that they can work without distraction or interruption ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Oh , yes , now and then . For a time . I was talking about an abode , a ppp permanent residence . No , the best imaginations want constant stimulation . Sights and sounds . I am impatient with those who make a mystique out of an honest craft . Good God ! Molnar wrote some of his bbb best plays on the tables of coffee houses in Budapest . And your Willa Cather sat in a luxurious apartment on Park Avenue and produced some of the loveliest prose in our language . p. 20 GARSON KANIN 1953 . St. Jean-Cap Ferrat.In my workroom at Les Rochers today , Maugham notices the many French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He teases me about my apparent efforts to learn the language . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM You will begin to mmm make progress only from the moment when you realize that what you are attempting is qqq quite impossible . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) I ask for help . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM We all of us lll learn in different ways , of course . It 's largely a question of aptitudes . Many musicians can memorize whole concerti easily and find it impossible to remember a ttt telephone number . Memory is a trick , in any case . Still , there does seem to be a single principle which guides lll learning , and that is  --  repetition . In the theatre , the French word for rehearsal is repetition , n'est-ce pas ? For myself , let me tell you what I 've found to be the most useful mmm method . It is simply to read aloud in the language you are attempting to acquire . Plain things are best . Newspapers or popular magazines , including the recipe columns and advice to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the language of the ordinary mmm man , living his everyday life . Take the newspaper , then , and begin to read it aloud . You may be mispronouncing ddd dreadfully , accenting impossibly , and making no sense whatever . No matter . Continue to read aloud confidently and at the ttt top of your voice . Do this each day for an hour or more . The result will astonish you . What happens , do n't you see , is that your body begins to learn the language  --  to speak automatically as it were . Your ttt tongue and ttt teeth and palate and ears and the whole complex nnn nervous system begin to respond . Speech is a physical thing to a ggg great degree and once your organs of speech are adept , they will transfer their abilities to the brain . p. 21 GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) A little later he returns to an elaboration of this idea . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM When I was beginning to lll learn to write , I was told that one learns by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nnn night . Then it occurred to me that I ought to copy the masters . You 've seen art students in the mmm museums , sitting before masterworks and copying them . I considered that this sort of thing might be of help to me . My principal models were Henry Fielding and Charles DDD Dickens , William Hazlitt and Cardinal Newman , Defoe , and above all , Anthony Trollope . For a long time I put apart a certain period of my www working time for the purpose of copying out pages from the works of my masters . It was tedious , yet I feel sure that I gained a great deal from this practice  --  some think I gained too much !  --  but I 'm not at all sorry I did it . I do n't know what my bbb brain learned from all this , but I am certain that my bbb body learned to write . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) We talk , then of Anthony Trollope and his methods . Maugham recalls that it was Trollope who said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of sealing wax with which to affix his posterior to his chair.And I recall an account of Trollope going up to London to pick up a rejected manuscript from a publisher , getting on the train to return home , laying the bulky bundle on his lap face down , and beginning to write a new book on the backs of the pages of the rejected one . p. 22 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM There you have it ! A perfect example of the nnn needed spirit for a career in the arts . GARSON KANIN 1954 . London.He makes a sweeping statement tonight about the Italians which makes me impatient . ( To WSM ) But that 's just a generalization . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Perhaps so , but without generalization there would be no conversation . GARSON KANIN 1950 . New York.During a pause in the conversation last night , Maugham said : WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I should like to tell you of two recent experiences in my life which have mmm moved me and touched me very ddd deeply . One took place only the other day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Plaza . I was dining there with a friend . The maitre d'hotel came over and presented us with a lovely bottle of Krug . He explained that a gentleman in the dining room , having recognized me , and being eager to extend his ccc compliments and his appreciation for the pleasure which my work had given him , had sent this handsome gift . I accepted it , of course , and asked him to tell me who the gentleman was in order that I might be able to thank him . The maitre d'hotel said that the gentleman had ddd departed some time earlier , and had given him instructions that the champagne was not to be brought to me until well after he 'd gone . I ca n't tell you how affected I was by this great and anonymous kkk kindness . ( He lights a cigarette ) The second incident took place in Spain some months ago when I was traveling there . I stopped for a nnn night or two in a charming hotel in Cordova . When I was ready to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car , returned to the desk , and asked for my bbb bill . The clerk at the desk said to me , " Mr. Maugham , for you , there is no bill . " I could n't imagine why this should be . The clerk went on to explain that the owner of the hotel had expressed such indebtedness for the edification  --  that was the word he used  --  which my writings had given him , and considered it such an honor to have me at his hotel , that he implored me to accept his hospitality ggg gratis this time , and at any time in the future when I chanced to be in Cordova . In all the years I have traveled , such a thing has never happened to me , which perhaps explains why I was so very stirred by the incident . p. 23 GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) I said I could not be more surprised at his surprise and that I found it hard to believe this was the first time such a thing had happened . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in any case , does not see why this form of recognition should be common . ( To WSM ) I 've been given to understand that in Europe men of letters are respected and revered . In France , they 're given tax benefits by the government which amount to subsidies . And did n't I read , only the other day , an account of Ibsen coming into his habitual cafe at one o'clock to read the papers , and everyone in the room rising as he entered and being reseated only after the celebrated man had taken his place ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Yes , I suppose that 's ttt true . ( He smiles ) I saw him once . GARSON KANIN You saw Ibsen ? Where ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM In a cafe in Berlin . He came in and sat down at the table always reserved for him . His stammtisch . I must say , he looked extremely angry , vexed , and ddd disagreable . But then , of course , he was all those things , was n't he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . Apocryphal ? Does it belong here ? Well . Lady Cunard , he relates , once entertained Maugham at dinner . Directly following , Maugham announced that he had to leave . Lady Cunard protested . Maugham said p. 24 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I must get to bed if I want to keep my youth . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) And Lady Cunard said , " But why did n't you bring him ? We would have loved having him ! " Years later , sitting alone with Maugham , I repeated this story and asked if there was any truth in it . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Yes , some . It was a joke I 'd heard at the GGG Garrick and I told it to Lady Cunard . I suppose she then repeated it , ccc casting me in the major role . I see her point . It 's better  --  mmm more telling her way . GARSON KANIN And you do n't resent her having done that ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM No , no . Having practiced the art of elaboration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to take offense . We all use it . Did n't T.S . Eliot name it  --  rather neatly , I thought  --  " The Objective Correlative " ? GARSON KANIN 1954 . London.He is smoking more than ever before . I notice it , and mention it . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Yes . I 'm trying to mmm make up for lost time . GARSON KANIN How do you mean ? p. 25 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Well , last year I fell ill and my doctor made me promise to stop smoking for at least three months . I stopped and I found myself mmm more miserable than I 'd been in years . I enjoyed nothing . My rhythms were sss shattered , and my reflexes insulted . I turned as mean as cat 's meat , but the bbb blighter had frightened me and I continued to abstain . After a month I thought I would die of the ddd deprivation sooner than of the danger . Still , I persisted . I quit on the fourth of January and smoked not at all until the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way through , and I gave it up . I did n't feel disgraced any more than a Channel swimmer does who makes it two-thirds of the way across . That damned doctor assured me that if I stopped for three months I 'd never wish to sss smoke again . He was wrong . I wanted it mmm more and more . So , as you see , I 'm smoking again . I feel no ill effects , my sweet nnn nature has returned , and all is well . GARSON KANIN But maybe if you had stopped for three months , you never would have wanted to smoke again . Now you 'll never know . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Do n't be a bbb bloody bore . GARSON KANIN You 're like a movie producer I know in Hollywood . p. 26 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Heaven forbid . GARSON KANIN He 'd had a severe heart attack and he said to me , " Dr. Prinzmetal told me I could go back to the studio and work if I promised him that I 'd lie down three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , once after lunch , and once around five or six o'clock before I went home . I tried it for a few days and it knocked the hell out of my schedule . So you know what I did ? I called up Dr. Prinzmetal , got him purposely in the morning when he was real busy in his office , see , and I gave him a fast heart-to-heart . I said to him , ' Listen , Doctor , how would this be ? Instead of lying down three times for an hour each time , I 'm willing to lie down five times a day . How 's that ? Five times , not three ! ' So , he said , ' That 's even better . ' And I said , ' But as long as it 's going to be five times , how about if I just make it a half an hour each time ? ' And you wan na know somethin ' ? The schmuck went for it ! " ( A pause ) WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , yes . You set up this contest with the doctor and you beat him at it . You outsmart him , as you would in a bridge game . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Shut up . p. 27 GARSON KANIN But who 's the loser ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Shut up ! GARSON KANIN 1950 . New York . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I 'm having a grand time not only because I 'm mmm making pots of money out of the television and the film , but all my expenses are being paid somehow . It has been explained to me , but I ddd do n't understand it and I 've no intention of trying to . Of ccc course , if I were paying the expenses , I 'd make ddd damned sure I did understand . And I 'm having a splendid run at cards , too . Yes , a grand time . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) He has been shopping . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I love to shop in New York . It 's by far the most vvv varied , rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dote on Macy 's and Bloomingdale 's , especially the adventure of the escalators . Recently , in one day , I bought pajamas at Macy 's , grand tinned goods at Gristede 's , a Renoir at Rosenberg 's , and seeds for golden bantam corn at Max Schling 's . How can one ddd deprecate a city where such a ddd day is possible ? GARSON KANIN October 1954 . London . p. 28 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I 'm going to tell you something www which I ca n't very well say publicly at the peril of seeming ungrateful or unappreciative or ungracious , and that is I find this Grand Old Man stuff excessively irksome . I ddd do n't in the least feel like a Grand Old Man , but to say so would spoil the fun . And I should n't like to be a spoilsport . We British are fond of our old people . We like to dress them up and applaud them , whether they 're kings or queens or prima donnas or ppp painters . If they are old , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The French tolerate them  --  the old , that is  --  which seems to me mmm more sensible . The Americans ignore them , more sensible still ; and some African tribes simply throw them away , which sss seems to be the most sensible of all . Do n't you see how embarrassing it is to have attention called to one 's age and at the same ttt time , one 's infirmities ? Mine are not my fff fault . I ca n't help my fading sight , or my poor hearing , or my raddled crocodile skin , and I ddd dislike having attention called to any of these things . In point of fact , what old people would like best of all would be to bbb be left alone . But one ca n't say that . Now can one ? GARSON KANIN 1958 . Nice.Trouble tonight at the Villa Mauresque . I have been talking about Thornton Wilder and the countless debts I owe him . He has been a kind and firm master and has done more for me , I suppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enormous popularity and literary standing , he seems to me less appreciated in America than he should be . And I wonder in passing whether this might not be a result of the fact that he is not and never has been a politically aware man . He has always been a scholar and a teacher , an academic person rather than a social one . p. 29 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I do n't see that that has anything to ddd do with it . ( He lights a cigarette nervously ) GARSON KANIN But is n't a writer supposed to reflect his times ? Was n't Chekhov politically aware ? Was n't Dickens ? Ernest Hemingway ? And what about  --  WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM RRR Rubbish ! GARSON KANIN ( To the audience )  --  he shouted after a good deal of difficulty in enunciating the word . Then , not completely pleased with the force of it , he rasped out a second , higher reading . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM RRR Rubbish ! This idea of writers being politicians and pundits nnn nauseates me . Politics is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have any real connection unless a writer is fff foolish enough to choose a political figure as a character . Or unless a political figure is misguided enough to attempt to write . I 've done what I do for a very lll long time , and I can assure you that I nnn know what I 'm talking about . GARSON KANIN ( Placatingly ) I 'm sure you do . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM ( Sarcastically ) Oh , are you ? The trouble with these well-meaning creatures who get themselves all involved in ccc causes of one sort or another and allow their feelings about such things to spill over into their work is that they run the risk of becoming swiftly outdated . Causes change , do n't you know , and so do issues . And if these are substituted for lasting things , the works themselves become old newspapers and mmm magazines . Look at Wells and Galsworthy . Oh , yes it 's true enough that Dickens used every sort of situation and condition , but that 's not what made him great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't much care about the social implications or the injustices on the statistical scale . p. 30 GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) His passion is such that his stammer has disappeared . Strange , because , as a rule , when he gets excited , the stammer gets worse . But now , he enunciates even so difficult a phrase as " statistical scale " with apparent ease . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I 'm a storyteller and I do n't feel I need to apologize for that . It 's a perfectly honorable calling . I do n't need to pretend that the stories I tell are going to cure the ills of the world or influence men to be good rather than bad . If it happens , let it happen . Some of my stories may well have the opposite effect and make good men bad , but I 'm afraid that can be no concern of mine . I must tell the stories as they occur to me , as I feel them . I 've no objection to anyone getting involved in anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days , engage . But I think it dangerous to get it mixed up with one 's work . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) He 's often referred to as cold and hard , detached and unfeeling . I do n't find him so . He seems to me to be sensitive , perhaps oversensitive . And sometimes , capable of deep emotion . 1950 . New York.Maugham on the phone this morning . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM ( On the telephone ) I 'm sorry I did n't call you as soon as I arrived , but the fact is , a bbb butler I sacked burned my address books . All of them . It was the bbb bastard 's revenge . He was with me for about twenty-five years and after he 'd been with me for about a year , I saw that he would n't do , but somehow it took me a while to get round to sacking him . I 'm a bbb bit sorry . After all , one can acquire a new address book , and , if necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be mmm more difficult to find a new bbb butler . p. 31 GARSON KANIN September 1953 . St. Jean-Cap Ferrat.We are just back from London where we have taken some important steps toward the production of THE MATCHMAKER with Tyrone Guthrie directing.We go up to Maugham 's to dinner . He wants to know all about London . What is playing in the theatre ? What do people think of the present government ? Who is there ? What is being worn ? What is being sung at the opera , danced at Sadler 's Wells , where did we eat and what ? I feel sure that all visitors are put through this cross-examination . It is how he keeps in touch.Finally , he asks about our plans , and Ruth takes off . She tells him the whole , long , complicated history of THE MATCHMAKER from the time Thornton wrote it as THE MERCHANT OF YONKERS . About Tony Guthrie staying with us while putting on CARMEN at the Met and talking about good unproduced plays one wintry night , he and Ruth finally agreeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on . Maugham is pleased for Ruth and says he looks forward to seeing her again on the stage.He asks who is going to put it on . We are astonished that the name Tyrone Guthrie does not mean more to him . Ruth begins to tell him and to remind him that Tony was the one who directed THE COUNTRY WIFE at the Old Vic in 1936 , which he so admired . But he continues to frown . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM It sounds a ddd difficult play . I hope he 's a good man . p. 32 GARSON KANIN ( To WSM ) Let me talk , huh ? I can assure you that he 's as fine a director for the theatre as is now living anywhere . And take my word for it , because this happens to be one of the subjects on which I am an expert . Tony Guthrie will do this play surprisingly and brilliantly . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Yes . Well , that interests me ggg greatly . What interests me even more is to know on what other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mock-pompously ) Why , of course . I am an expert on Mark Twain , American jazz , Gertrude Stein , nutrition , Zen Buddhism , Benjamin Franklin , films , and fucking . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Is that so ? ( A pause ) Do tell me all you know about fff Franklin ! GARSON KANIN April 1959 . New York.A note this morning from Maugham from the Plaza in answer to the flowers we sent him . It reads . ( WSM picks up the note and reads . The lights begin to fade , all except the two spots : one on GK , the other on WSM ) WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM ' Ruth , my angel . What makes you so good and sweet and how the hell does poor Garson manage to cope with it ? I could n't and I tell you right now that I withdraw the offer of marriage I made you the other day.Thank you for the flowers . They are so well chosen  --  white to symbolize my innocence of the wicked ways of the world , and mauve to remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childlike fashion I 'd like to think . Perhaps there is a lesson here that you think I should do well to ponder . Well , I will.Darling , it 's sweet of you now that you are rich and famous and flashing with jewels not to forget the friends of your humbler days.Bless you.Willie . ( The two spotlights fade swiftly ) @x The curtain rises . The positions of the players have been reversed , and both have changed costume . WSM wears the Japanese kimono of the famous Graham Sutherland portrait . GK wears a different dinner jacket . GARSON KANIN 1953 . London.Maugham comes to dinner . I make him a martini . ( He carries a martini to WSM and gives it to him . WSM takes a sip . To WSM : ) Is it all right ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM No , it 's not . GARSON KANIN Oh ? What 's the matter with it ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM It 's not cold enough . A martini should be very cold . ( GK takes the martini and starts away ) What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I 'm going to make it colder . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM And just how do you propose to do that ? GARSON KANIN Remix it . With more ice . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM That will make it www weaker . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) By now , I 'm ready to throw it at him , instead : ( To WSM ) Well , please tell me what to do . p. 35 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I 'll show you . ( He gets up and steps to the rear of the stage ) GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) We step out into the library and there he gives me a short , but concise , lesson in martini-making . We start from scratch , chilling the glass , chilling the shaker , measuring and mixing the ingredients carefully by shaking not stirring . Finally , and only for a few seconds , adding a great mass of ice and giving the whole thing a couple of final shakes before pouring . ( WSM returns carrying two martinis . He hands one to GK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , too . ( They drink . ) He is right , it makes all the difference . ( WSM returns to his chair.From that time on , I could always prepare a satisfactory martini for Mr. Maugham . Years later , I was able to improve upon his instruction . I had visited some serious drinkers in Washington , D.C. They were so jealous of the strength of their martinis , that they would not allow ice to make contact with the ingredients at all . They prepared shakers of martinis and put them into the deep freeze for an hour or so . When the martinis were served , they were ice cold and full strength . I relayed this important intelligence to Maugham . He tried the method immediately and reported to me that he was greatly indebted , adding that it was the only thing of true value that he 'd ever learned from me ; . We had a hell of a lot to drink tonight but we ate so much that we did not get as smashed as we might have , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I became wildly indiscreet and asked all sorts of questions which might have occurred to me had I been sober , but which I surely would not have asked . For example , I asked him if he considers the London theatre homosexually dominated or controlled . p. 36 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Partly . GARSON KANIN Would you say principally ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM No . GARSON KANIN Would you say that this influence is growing or diminishing ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Growing , I should think . GARSON KANIN Well , do you think this a good thing or a bad thing ? Or do you think it does n't matter one way or the other ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I think it mmm most unfortunate . And something which should be checked , if possible . GARSON KANIN Why ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Because it spoils the www women , do n't you see . It makes them hard and rather cynical . When there is no ppp premium for femininity , it fails to develop properly . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) Later I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good father to Liza . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I swear I tried to be . GARSON KANIN ( To WSM ) But that is n't what I asked you . p. 37 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I 'm quite aware of that . I think I was as ggg good a father as she and the circumstances permitted me to be . I 've always provided for her and for her children when that was necessary . I have n't demanded any loyalty or ddd duty . I care for her . But remember , she was always somewhat torn . And whatever others might have thought or might think , I always considered her mother a bad influence upon her . GARSON KANIN Would you like to have had more children ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Yes , I suppose so . They 're extremely interesting and ttt teach one a good deal . They teach one about one 's self  --  things not possible to learn otherwise . GARSON KANIN What would you say was the principal requisite of a father ? ( WSM thinks ) WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KANIN Do you think you did that for Liza ? ( A pause ) WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM No . ( GK moves closer to him ) GARSON KANIN May I ask you an indiscreet question ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Good Lord , I was just thinking it was about ttt time for a discreet one ; p. 38 GARSON KANIN How many times in your life have you proposed marriage ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Once . GARSON KANIN ( Disappointed ) Oh . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM What ? GARSON KANIN Well , that 's not very exciting , is it ? You proposed once and you were married once . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Would it make it mmm more exciting for you if I explained that the woman to whom I ppp proposed refused me ? GARSON KANIN Yes , it would . ( audience ) And then he tells about his one great love affair . In a preface to CAKES AND ALE written twenty years after the book 's first publication , Maugham wrote : WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM " I like CAKES AND ALE because in its pages lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the model for Rosie Driffield . " GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) He tells , feelingly and movingly , of meeting this woman ( Nan , in real life ) , of knowing love for the first time , of thinking with her that it was a passionate burst that would burn itself out in a few weeks . Instead , the affair lasted for eight years.Then , quarrels and complications and indecision as to marriage . She goes away and does not tell him where she has gone . After a time , he begins a desperate search and traces her to the United States , to Chicago . He is prepared now , buys a ring , goes to Chicago and finds her and proposes . She refuses him . He is stunned , can scarcely believe it . He thinks it a joke , a tease of some sort.She says simply , " I ca n't marry you . " p. 39 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Why not ? Are you already married ? GARSON KANIN " No . I 'm not . " WILLIAM SOMERSET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Do you love me ? GARSON KANIN " Yes . With all my heart . " WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Do you believe that I love you ? GARSON KANIN " Yes . " WSM Then why ? GARSON KANIN " I ca n't marry you ; " ( To the audience ) He says that his doctor 's mind immediately leaped to the clinical , especially since he knew Chicago to be a rough , tough town . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Are you ill ? GARSON KANIN " No , not at all . " WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Will you think about it ? Will you reconsider ? GARSON KANIN " I ca n't , " she says stubbornly.The mystery made him impatient . He shouted at her . There was a scene . It was no use . They parted . He says that many , many years later , she told him that what had happened was that when he finally proposed to her she had just learned that she was pregnant by another man . A casual thing , an accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen tears in Maugham 's eyes until tonight , but as he comes to the end of this account , there they are . p. 40 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM She never had the child . She had a miscarriage . But our moment had passed . Yes . She ddd died only two or three years ago . ( A pause ) I often wonder what course my life might have taken had it not been for that fff freakish happenstance . GARSON KANIN 1958 . Nice . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Ruth , my dear , what do you think of this ? I had a letter from a lll lady in America . She said she 'd read many of my books and clearly I am a sage who knows everything about everything , especially love . GARSON KANIN " Well , you probably do , " says Ruth . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM But wait . She was a pragmatic ppp party and was n't writing simply to compliment me , but to get some fff free advice . She wanted to know , first , how to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided to reply , and so I rrr wrote her , and said , " The only way to get a man is to be sexually attractive , and the only way to hold onto him is to be sss sexually satisfactory . " She never acknowledged mmm my advice . Although I can assure you I was absolutely in earnest . Do you agree ? GARSON KANIN " Not entirely , " says Ruth . " It 's not as simple as you make it out . It 's a much deeper secret than that . " p. 41 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Such as ? GARSON KANIN Ruth smiles . " If I told you , it would n't be a secret anymore , would it ? " WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I mmm might have known ! GARSON KANIN 1953 . St. Jean-Cap Ferrat.Title talk this afternoon up at Maugham 's . ( To WSM ) I like most of your titles well enough , but not OF HUMAN BONDAGE . Now , there 's a dud . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Oh ? I think it 's ggg good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Perhaps you would have ppp preferred the original title : THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT OF STEPHEN CAREY . GARSON KANIN Hardly . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Strange what fashion is . When the bbb book was written , that first title was thought to be ideal , but when I revised it , I decided to give it a fresh nnn name as well . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) Suddenly , I remember Alan Jay Lerner 's joke when he heard that OF HUMAN BONDAGE was being made into a musical show . Alan volunteered a title , and I tell it to Maugham  --  WORST FOOT FORWARD . Maugham just looks at me , stonily . He does not care for the witticism . ( To WSM ) Now , you must admit that 's funny . p. 42 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Must I ? GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) On to other things . ( To WSM ) Did you really say that intelligent people read practically nothing after the age of thirty ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Of course . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time ! WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Because I 'm nnn not intelligent . GARSON KANIN I think you are ! WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM That 's because you 're nnn not intelligent ! GARSON KANIN 1954 . St. Jean-Cap Ferrat.The visit last night was especially interesting because Maugham is just back from Dr. Niehans ' clinic in Switzerland . He and Alan have both taken the daring , revolutionary treatment . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I feel strange . I can ddd describe it no other way . Strange . Not myself . Not ill , nor especially well . Simply  --  well , strange . I suppose part of it is that we 've had no alcohol for weeks , and I have not sss smoked . It 's all part of the cure , you see . p. 43 GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) Cynically , I wonder if it may not be the principal part of the cure , or the cure itself , but I say nothing.Maugham looks unchanged to me . He talks at length about Dr. Neihans and about the rumors that the Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taking it . He names many others , and describes what it is like . It sounds like a transfusion of some sort . It seems drastic and dangerous to me , but I withhold comment , because what the hell do I know about it ? It has been investigated thoroughly by him and by Alan . It must have passed muster since they both went and did it . I gather Maugham would like to live on and on . Whatever his denials , I note he goes constantly and regularly to cures in Germany and Italy , watches his diet , exercises , and now this . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I do n't know that it 's worth a ddd damn , and there 's always the risk that something as vvv violent as this may kkk kill one , but in my advanced years , it seems a worthwhile risk , a good gamble . There may be something in it . If so , well and good . If not , well , I have n't ggg gambled many years away , have I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining room tonight , I stop to look at an unusual painting which hangs on the wall to the right of the doorway . A few minutes pass and I realize that I am not alone . I become aware of a presence behind me and to my left . I turn and see Maugham observing me . He is smoking . p. 44 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM You do n't know a ddd damned thing about pictures , do you ? GARSON KANIN No , I do n't . But how would you know that ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I can ttt tell from the way you were looking at that one . GARSON KANIN Really ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Yes . Just as one knows when KKK Kenneth Clark looks , that he knows all about pictures . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) The subject of my ignorance does not vaguely interest me , so I make pass-the-time conversation . ( To WSM ) Who painted this ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Kenneth Clark did n't ask . He knew at once . GARSON KANIN No doubt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He touches GK 's arm ) Do n't feel too bbb bad . Very few guess it . It took even Kenneth Clark three minutes . FFF Finally he turned to me and said , " The only painter whose work I know who could have painted that head and that arm is Toulouse-Lautrec. " p. 45 GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) So , without it having been planned , he takes me around and shows me his collection . ( During the following , WSM and GK move about , looking at pictures . From time to time , they stop . ) ( To WSM ) Matisse . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Two cheers GARSON KANIN Do you know him ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Yes , but I mmm met him only recently . A remarkable old gentleman . Everything about him is very nearly dead except his ttt talent , which is livelier than ever . He 's absolutely bedridden , you know , but he sketches and paints and cuts out colored paper incessantly . Like most old mmm men , he can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his work . I 'm rather like that myself , I expect . This picture of his , called " The Yellow Chair , " is so bbb beautiful and means so much to me that once , when I was talking to him , I thanked him for it and told him how much I appreciated what he had done to mmm make my house a far more pleasant ppp place than it would have been without his lovely decoration , and the word made him angry . " Decoration ! " he cried . " Decoration is nothing but a lot of merde ! " Imagine Matisse using a word like that about ddd decoration . Of course , the French use it more easily than we do . Still  --  and of all people  --  Matisse , who is most certainly the supreme ddd decorator of the twentieth century . You do see what I mean , do n't you , about old mmm men often talking foolishly about their work . ( He and GK stop again ) This is a portrait of me painted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side looking at it ) Hardly a lll likeness , but it is an interesting painting . p. 46 GARSON KANIN Alice Toklas told us the other day that when someone objected to Picasso that his portrait of Gertrude Stein did n't look like her , he said , " Do n't worry , it will ! " WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM ( Laughs ) Rather like Matisse . Someone once criticized a ppp picture of his and said it did n't look like a woman . And Matisse snapped , " It 's not supposed to be a woman , it 's supposed to be a ppp picture ! " GARSON KANIN ( Pointing to it ) This Laurencin . Why do you look so startled in it ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Probably because all the while she was painting me , she was ttt telling me the story of her lll life . You will notice I 'm wearing a robe . She asked me to do so because , she said , ' she 'd never painted a collar and cravat and did n't want to take the ttt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I thought it only fair to give her the robe as a souvenir . I suppose it 's a good enough picture , but I ' m ddd damned if I would n't rather have my robe back ! ( He looks at GK , touches him ) I do n't much like advice and I try nnn never to give it or to take it , but I should like to advise you nnn never to give anyone anything upon an impulse . ( He and GK stop , finally ) Yes . It 's a good collection because it 's a ppp personal one . I 've never bought a picture I did n't like , no matter how much I was advised to do so by the kind fff friends who 've helped me . Gerald Kelly and Kenneth Clark and Jean Cocteau and others , and from time to time I 'm sure I 've passed up bbb bargains . The pictures are friends and if one is going to live with them , they have to be ccc congenial . So , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is my own . I 've listened to expert advice , but I 've made my own decisions . A collection reflects or should reflect the personality of the ppp possessor , and that 's what mine does . I 've heard it said I do n't give a ddd damn about pictures and buy them cheaply to sell them expensively . Nothing could be further from the ttt truth . I 've never sold a picture ! I 've traded some , but never sss sold one . The fact that they 've greatly increased in value is nnn no more than a happy accident . I 've also been accused of buying them as a tax ddd dodge , but I 'm damned if I know what that means or how it could be done . But then people say all sorts of nasty things , especially out of envy or jealousy or just pure bloody-mindedness . Yes , I suppose the pictures are worth a great deal . How much I 've no idea . I 've arranged for their ddd disposition . Some of them will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to various galleries in London , a few to some galleries nearby , and I have sss surprising plans for several . ( He studies GK ) You should try to learn more about pictures , but you ca n't learn from anyone but yourself . It 's not a question of value or prestige or reputation , but only one of feeling . You must learn to feel through your eyes . Do you understand ? ( During the following , WSM removes his kimono , and puts on a wild , mod jacket ) p. 47 GARSON KANIN 1954 . London.Our host , a well-known London bitch , comes on pretty strong tonight at the mention of Maugham 's name . He is one of the few people here who does not like Maugham and he sounds like this : WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM ( As the bitch-host ) " But , my dears , you ca n't be serious ! Sweet ? Why , he 's the devil incarnate . I tell you he 's the antichrist ! No , wait , let me tell you . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . On and on . He was marvelous to him  --  he 's not a bit generous , you know , but he simply lavished things on this particular Friend . One of the things he gave him was a beautiful gold-and-lacquer cabinet with a lock , and You-know-who kept all ( As the bitch-host ) his personal letters and documents in it . And then , one morning , to Willie 's amazement , Friend suddenly announced that he 'd got married  --  do n't you adore it ?  --  married to this very rich , very old thing . Of course , Willie was furious  --  up the wall  --  and when Friend said he did n't see why it should matter to them , Willie called him every name he could think of , and he could think of plenty . Then Willie demanded his letters back . Just imagine the old flal having been so idiotic as to have written and written , but Friend told him he could whistle for them . Willie tried everything  --  good Lord , he even tried me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then it happened . He 's always been a lucky old bastard and his luck held out . Friend simply died one night after too much  --  exercise ! Willie read the news with his morning tea , got right out of bed , dressed in striped trousers and morning coat and black tie , put on his bowler , and was the very first one there to pay his condolences . He sat for an hour talking to the hysterical widow , and finally as he was about to leave , kissed her and said , " I gave him this cabinet you know . " " Yes , I know , " said the widow . " He loved it so . " " And it was always understood , " said Willie , " that if anything should happen I was to have it back . " " Oh , do have it back , " she said . " I know he would have wanted it so . " And Willie  --  now just get this  --  had a van outside and stepped to the front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before anyone knew what was happening , had whisked the cabinet and his letters and God knows what else out of the place . Everyone knows the story . Of course , there are variations , but I swear that what I 've told you is the true version . So do n't tell me about The Old Party . I know him inside out . He 's the wickedest man in London ! " p. 48 GARSON KANIN " The second wickedest , " says Ruth . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM ( As the bitch-host ) What ? GARSON KANIN " Nothing . " WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM ( As the bitch-host ) Oh . GARSON KANIN May 1946 . New York.Dinner at the Colony tonight with Maugham and Vivien Leigh . Strangely , they have never met . It all begins in high . Vivien falls in love . As for Maugham , I have never seen this side of him  --  the gallant , the courtly gentleman , the man on the make . Every warm instinctive exchange passes between them . Vivien is enormously impressive with her tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her glorious speech . It is a pleasure to sit there and shut up and listen . He pays her , compliments more beautifully than I have ever heard compliments paid . I feel almost an intruder , but nothing could induce me to leave . There are cocktails and wines and the food is superb . Once again we all discover the deep delights of conversation , especially of the intimate variety.But after dinner , I make my first blunder of the evening , saying , " How about a stinger ? " WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Good Lord , I have n't tasted that dangerous concoction in years . p. 49 GARSON KANIN " I never have , " says Vivien . So the stingers are ordered and do what they are supposed to do . Mine must have detached me from the face of the earth , because presently I hear myself saying to Maugham : ( To WSM ) Vivien and I had one hell of a scrap the other night , and it was all on account of you . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM How so ? GARSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEN AND NOW , and I referred to the play in it as MANDRAGOLA , which is the way we say it in America . At least , it 's the way we said it when I was at the American Academy and we did the first act of it as an examination play . ( To the audience ) Maugham 's eyebrows are arched . Vivien wants to talk , but I will not let her . ( To WSM ) I know it 's said differently in England , and differently in Italy , but we say MANDRAGOLA . So , of course , my friend here put me down pretty sharply and  --  ( To the audience ) Vivien interrupted . " Not sharply enough , " she said . " I do n't know why he insists upon being so stubborn . We all know it 's pronounced MANDRAGOLA . " I take over again . ( To Vivien ) Just a minute , baby . We 've got the horse 's mouth right here . Mr. Maugham , what is the correct pronunciation ? p. 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no question that the name of the play is MMM MMM  --  ( He takes a sip of his stinger )  --  is pronounced simply MMM MMM  --  GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) I was horrified . Something of our nervous excitement had communicated itself to him and he was stuck on that " M " . ( WSM is still trying ) In this case it was not possible for him to switch to another word . Under the table I saw him snap his fingers and punch his palm . ( WSM does so ) Above the table his anguished face was still trying to free that word . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM ( Finally ) MMM MMM **25;2391;TOOLONG ! GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) " There ! " said Vivien . " What did I tell you ? " December 1954 . London.At Jamie Hamilton 's tonight , after dinner , the ladies retired , and Jamie invited us all to close ranks . The port came on and the cigars and looser talk . Suddenly , I was startled to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which obituaries are prepared at the offices of THE TIMES , who writes them , who assigns them , which are especially good , which ones poor and so on . Jamie asked me , " Of course , in America , you do n't have this sort of thing , do you ? They just have rewrite men knock them up for the obit page , is n't that so ? " " Well , I 'm afraid I do n't know , " I said hoarsely , because I could not take my attention from Maugham who sat there calmly smoking . When I was able to shift my focus , I looked around to see if I could tell whether anyone else was thinking what I was thinking , which was that it certainly bordered on the tasteless , or at least showed a want of feeling or a lack of judgment , to have introduced this subject in the presence of Maugham , who is , after all , eighty years old.He did not seem to mind . Then Jamie told about being asked to write the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written some of the recent ones . In time , I was able to convey via eye to Jamie that I thought we ought to get off this . He agreed and immediately communicated with the others . There was a long pause . I think everyone at the table was sorry about the lapse , and for a few seconds no one could think of what to say next.Suddenly , Maugham chirped up : p. 51 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I 've read mine ! GARSON KANIN Clark : " Have you ? That 's most unusual . " Jamie : " How did you happen to get hold of it ? " WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Why , he sent it to me  --  the editor . He asked me if I 'd be ggg good enough to check it for accuracy . I did so . When he called the following day , I said to him , " Well , I find it aaa accurate enough , but not half www warm enough . " So he invited me to tidge it up , and I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ! GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) Later that evening , Maugham tells a pip of a story . There was an imposing hostess in London who maintained a famous , formal , carefully planned and arranged salon . Each occasion had a particular subject and the great lady ( damn it , I did n't catch her name ; he articulated it sloppily and I did not want to call attention to this by asking him to repeat it ) . At any rate , the lady would choose a subject and invite ten or twelve or twenty of the greatest authorities in England on this particular subject to attend . Like all great salons , it was a men-only affair . One woman running it all , and the guests men without women . One night on , say , slum clearance ; one night on big-game hunting ; another time might find all the experts on Sanskrit present ; or J.M.W. Turner , or London theatre history . One night , the one he is telling about , the subject was Lord Byron . Maugham was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has written about Byron and talked about him , but he does not consider himself an authority by any means . p. 52 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Neither , apparently , did she . At these events the ggg guests were seated not according to title or rank or even age , but according to their sss standing in expertise on the subject of the evening . Of course , this put me somewhere bbb below the salt . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) He goes on to tell how wonderfully she managed it all , introducing just the right questions at the right times . No other subject was considered remotely fit for conversation . He says he heard tremendously impressive talk , and powerful opinions . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM The greatest authority , sitting on the hostess 's right , did most of the talking ; but as the evening wore on she became aware of the fact that the man she had been told was the second greatest authority and therefore had seated at her left had said nothing . He seemed to be enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much as a word . With the skill of a practiced conversation steerer , she waited for a propitious moment , turned to him and said , " But we have n't heard from you , sir . " " No , madam , " he replied , " and you sha n't . You see , I 'm not at all interested in Byron ! " Naturally , she was astonished and asked , " Indeed ! Why not ? " " Because , madam , " he replied , " Byron was a bugger ! " The hostess dropped her fork and splattered her front as she expostulated , " Oh , dear me . Oh , no . Oh , that could n't be ! " In panic , she appealed to the man on her right . " Could it ? It is n't true ? " The greatest authority replied grimly , " Yes , madam , I 'm afraid it is quite true . I must answer your question in the decided affirmative . " The hostess , her evening ruined , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . " Then the man on her left , realizing how he had upset her , touched her arm and said , " But you 'll be pleased to know that in later life he redeemed himself  --  by having a ppp passionate love affair with his sss sister ! " That is the sort of dinner party one can look back upon with ppp pleasure . p. 53 GARSON KANIN June 1958 . Nice.We gave a dinner party tonight . At La Reserve , to celebrate Maugham 's 84th birthday . In the course of it , I asked him ( To WSM ) How long did it take you to learn to live ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Eighty-four years . GARSON KANIN And which did you find harder to learn ? To write or to live ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I ca n't answer that . I 'm sorry . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) We talk of other things for a time , then , during a pause : WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Let me try to answer that question of yours in another way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have never enjoyed living . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) Later . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I had a neighbor in St. Jean-Cap Ferrat . I could tell you his nnn name , but I wo n't . You 'll see why in a moment . He was an old mmm man , my age precisely , and he had a rather young wife and she was in despair . She found it desperately enervating to sit by him and see him sss slowly lose his grip on life . All sorts of ddd doctors came in and had different diagnoses , but when I called to see him , it was clear to me that the poor brute was simply suffering old age . Since it was a mmm malaise I shared with him , I knew all about it and its symptoms and mmm manifestations . I strongly recommended that he go to Dr. Niehans ' clinic , as I have done . He did nnn not do so at once , but when it seemed that all else had fff failed , his young wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you choose , but in a month 's time he was up and about and quite cured . He sent me a handsome gift in thanks , and his young wife has nnn never spoken to me since . p. 54 GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) During coffee . ( To WSM ) I suppose the great thing about your work is that you 're always able to make truth seem like fiction and fiction seem like truth . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I take that as an exceptional compliment and I thank you for it . GARSON KANIN Ruth asks , " Do you get lots of compliments ? " WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Not so many as I would like . Let me tell you about one of my fff favorites . It was during the war , and I was asked , along with many other writers , to make my books available on a royalty-free basis for the fff forces . I had a letter from a GI in the South Pacific who said , " You are my favorite writer . I 've read three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a single word . " Another compliment that stays in my mind is the one paid to me by your Gene TTT Tunney . He told me  --  I ca n't remember where  --  probably when I was staying with Billy Phelps . William Lyon Phelps , is n't it ? While I was staying with him in  --  ? GARSON KANIN Probably New Haven . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Yes , I suppose it was . And Mr. TTT Tunney came to call one day and surprised me by telling me that when he was in training for his fight with Jack Dempsey , the only book he read was OF HUMAN BONDAGE . He won the fff fight , did n't he ? p. 55 GARSON KANIN Yes . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Well , that 's what makes it a ccc compliment , do n't you see ? If he 'd lost , it would n't have been a ccc compliment at all ! GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) I tell him about Felix Frankfurter 's cable on the recent occasion of Thornton Wilder 's sixtieth birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GREAT DECADES LOVE FELIX . Maugham frowns , sharply . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I know that your friend Frankfurter is a mmm man of great intellect and I would not for the world dispute him since I am not a mmm man of great intellect , but I wonder if his message to Thornton is not rrr romantic . For my own part , I 've noticed in studying the obituary pages that the sixties are extremely unhealthy . Once those Alps have been ccc crossed , the seventies often appear to be a restful plateau , but , oh dear , those sixties ! As I entered them , I was convinced that I was fff for it . I suppose that was why I wrote THE SUMMING UP , in which I set down everything I knew and which I thought worth imparting . The damned thing 's turned out to be an embarrassing anachronism . But there it is . What can I do ? GARSON KANIN November 1942 . Washington , D.C.Maugham is in South Carolina . XX has been down to visit him . The Doubledays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 4F farm boy named Religious . About ten days after he arrived , he asked the Doubledays to dinner . They were astounded when on came a superb onion soup , truite au bleu , canard a 1'orange , a wondrous salad , and an almond souffle . They could not imagine who was in the kitchen . Religious , of course , and no one else . Maugham had trained him . The Doubledays have been describing the event all over the country , but no one wants to believe them . March 1943 . Washington.Ruth saw Maugham 's daughter , Liza , over the weekend in New York and they talked about the famous Doubleday dinner . Liza is not in the least surprised . " Oh , yes , " she says , " Pa always trains the cooks and maids and gets the house running just right . He knows all about such things . He ca n't do it himself , but he knows how it should be done and how to get others to do it . " London . 1953 . Diminutive as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What can it be ? Is he , literally , shrinking ? I 'm certain that he weighs less than ever before . And that he is somehow changing shape as well . Toward the end of the evening , he says : p. 56 WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I believe that if one is small , as I am , there is a possibility that Death may overlook one . GARSON KANIN Christmas Day 1954 . Paris.The talk tonight is about cures at Abano , Montecatini , and Bad Gastein . About New England food and his love for Boston baked beans . And then about the placement of the sexual force . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM The sexual force . The French have it mainly in their speech . They love to talk about it . Americans have it in their hearts  --  all sentiment and romantic notions . The Russians  --  in their arms and legs and torsos  --  those back-breaking hugs ! The Germans have it in their heads for the purpose of intellectualizing , philosophizing , analyzing . Now , the Italians  --  ah , the Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the lovers on earth . We might all learn from them . GARSON KANIN What about the British ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Oh , they do n't have it at all  --  not anywhere ! GARSON KANIN December 1954 . London . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM What is most difficult about the ppp passage of time is to stay in the fashion . The problem is that the constant repetition of a way of ddd dress or a way of speech or of life is comfortable . And we do n't any of us much like to change . But fashion waxes and wanes . I recall when CAKES AND ALE was considered a shocking book from the mmm moral point of view , so much so that there was some question as to whether or not it would be published . Compare it with some of the things that are printed nowadays . And that was only about twenty-five years ago , no more . I suppose one ddd digests and becomes accustomed to a certain idea or a certain word . When that has been used a good many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it is necessary to take the nnn next step and the next and the next . I wrote a line in THE CONSTANT WIFE that caused a stir . I thought it ppp perfectly innocent and telling , but real , do n't you know ? It comes in the third act , at the point where a young woman and her mmm mother are discussing a man . The daughter asks , " How does one know if one 's in love ? " The mother replies , " My dear , I know only one test . Could you use his ttt toothbrush ? " " Why , no , " says the daughter . And the mother says , " Then you 're nnn not in love with him . " Many said I 'd gone too far . I received outraged letters . I was , for a time , notorious as that vulgar , tasteless , anything-for-effect , cheapjack ddd dramatist . Compare that little sally with what they hear now , what ? p. 57 GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) We talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engenders . He gets onto the subject of his old friend Max Beerbohm . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Max , you know , solved the ppp problem of adjusting to the present by stepping out of it . What he did was to leave London , leave England , and move to Rapallo , where he continues to live as though he were still living at the ttt turn of the century . He dresses in the same way , reads pretty much what he read then , writes practically nothing , nor does he draw . He has fff frozen himself , as it were , in time . But what 's most astonishing is that without lifting a finger he becomes mmm more and more famous , more celebrated and highly thought of . Someone said that his reputation grows with every bbb book he does n't write . Whereas I keep working like a bbb bloody fool and am constantly told that it 's not as good as my last . GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) I suggest that perhaps the wisest thing to do is drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that in years to come people will say , " Oh , what he would have accomplished had he lived ! " WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM I wrote LIZA OF LAMBETH in 1897 , and though it was not a sensation , it was sss something of a success . The most important critic of the ddd day , Edmund Gosse , liked it and wrote an excellent review . I never knew him well , but I used to run into him once in a while and for the next forty years every ttt time we met , he would look at me in a patronizing way and say , " Oh , yes , Maugham . LIZA OF LAMBETH . Such a good book ! How clever of you never to have written anything else ! " p. 58 GARSON KANIN I 've been meaning for years to ask you something  --  to tie up  --  loose ends . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM You 'd better hurry . Look at me  --  better still , look at the ccc calendar . GARSON KANIN No , thanks . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I ask of my friends these days is that they last through lunch ! " ( GK smiles ) What was the loose end ? GARSON KANIN It 's about you in South Carolina during the war . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Yemassee , yes . Lovely . GARSON KANIN And about a famous dinner you gave the Doubledays . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Onion soup , truite au bleu , canard 1'orange , endive and beetroot salad , almond souffle . GARSON KANIN And prepared after you 'd been there only a week  --  WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Ten days . GARSON KANIN  --  by a farm boy  --  WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM His name was ' Religious ' . p. 59 GARSON KANIN  --  who 'd probably seen nothing but soul food all his life . And presto-chango  --  he turns out a gourmet dinner fit for the most exacting epicure . Come on , now . Is it true ? WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Oh , yes , quite true . GARSON KANIN But how were you able to provide what the Doubledays described as a perfect dinner after ten days with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything like it before ? It 's hard to believe . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Actually , it 's no ttt trouble . No trouble at all . Unless you call trouble having the same meal eight nights running ! GARSON KANIN Well , sir , whatever may be said for you or against you , you certainly are a practical man . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM Is that for me or against me ? GARSON KANIN I do n't know . Some of each , I suppose . Thornton said something on the subject recently . He said , " I can take care of my immortal soul , but who 's going to take care of my laundry ? " ( WSM laughs ) WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM When next you see Thornton , tell him that a ppp practical Old Party suggests that if he takes ggg good enough care of his laundry , his immortal soul will take care of itself . ( He raises a warning finger ) But never the other way about ! p. 60 GARSON KANIN ( To the audience ) It has all been jolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once he is serious . WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM No . No matter what its miseries , life should be ggg grasped ! GARSON KANIN ( To WSM ) Ruth sometimes says , " It pays to stay alive . " ( A long pause ) WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM ( Quietly )
