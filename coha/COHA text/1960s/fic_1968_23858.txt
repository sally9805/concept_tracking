AN EXORCISM a story by Bernard Malamud Fogel , the writer , had had another letter from Gary Simmson , the writer who would he writer , a request as usual . He wrote fiction but still had n't jelled . Fogel saved letters from writers but was tempted not to save Simmson 's although he had begun to publish . I am not his mentor though he says he is my student . If so what have I taught him ? in the end he placed the letter in his folder . I have his others , he thought . The older man was n't sure why he had saved them , except perhaps to save . Eli Fogel was a better than ordinary writer but not especially productive or successful . He hated the word . His productivity was limited by his pace which for reasons of having to breathe hard to I enjoy life , was slow . Two novels in fifteen years . My limp is symbolic , he thought . His leg had been hurt in a bicycle accident as a youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He limped , he thought , for his lacks . Fogel regretted never having married , blaming this mostly on his devotion to work . It 's not that it has to be one or the other , but for me it was one ornone . Etymologically I 'm a monomaniac . It simplified life but reduced it  --  what else ? Still , he did n't pity himself . It amused him rather than not that the protagonists of his two published novels were married men with families , their wounds deriving from sources other than hurt members or primal loneliness . My imagination saves me , he thought . Both his novels had been received with praise , though not much more ; and Fogel had for the past six years labored on a third , about half finished . Since he refused to write book reviews , lecture , or teach regularly , he ran into money problems . He had from his father a small inheritance , almost five thousand yearly , a sum that seemed to shriqk in value as time went by ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the prickly side , at writers ' conferences , one or two the summer . Thus with what he had he made do . It was at one of these conferences , in Buffalo in June , and then at another in mid-August of the same summer , on the campus of a small men 's college in the White Mountains , that the writer had met , and later renewed a friendship with Gary Sirnmson , then less than half Fogel 's age ; a friendship of sorts , mild , fallible , but for a while satisfying ; that is to say , possessing the attributes and possibilities of friendship . Gary , a slight glaze apparent in his eyes as he listened to Fogel talk about writers and writing , wanted , he confessed with serious face and worried brow , more than anything to be a writerI " desperately " ? the word inciting goose bumps all over Fogel 's flesh , putting him uff for fifteen minutes , He sat in depressed silence in his office chair as the youth fidgeted . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to get there , " the youth replied . " Got to get where ? " " I want to be a good writer someday , Mr. Fogel . " " It 's a long haul , my boy , " Eli Fogel said . " Make a friend of time . And stay clear of desperation . Desperate writers tend to be bad writers . Vice versa , their badness increases their desperation . " Gary nodded as though he had learned a lesson forever . He was only twenty-one then , a curly-haired senior in college , with broad fleshy face and frame . On his first appearance at the Buffalo conference he wore a full reddish moustache , pointed and waxed at both ends , that he later shaved off after meeting Fogel . He was six feet tali and his height and breadth made him look older than he was , if not wiser . For a while after his talk with Fogel he pretended to be a more casual sort , one who took his time and got it right . He pretended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never had a disciple and felt affection for the boy . Gary livened things up , making the writer less lonely . One could see him in the distance coming with his yellow guitar . He played without distinction but sang fairly well , a tenor aspiring , related to art . " Sing me ' Ochi Chornyye . ' Gary , " Fogel said , and the youth obliged as the writer sighed and became pleasantly melancholic , thinking what if he had had a son . Touch a hand to a guitar string and Fogel had a wet eye . And Gary offered services as well as devoted attention : got books Fogel needed from the library ; drove him into town when he had errands to do ; could be depended on to retrieve lecture notes he had left in his room  --  as it were in compensation , though Fogel required none , for the privilege of sitting at the writer 's feet and plying him with questions about the art of fiction . Fogel , moved by his amiability , willingness , all he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a writer 's life , invited him , sometimes with one or another of his frends , to his room for a drink before dinner . Gary brought along a notebook to jot down remarks Fogel made  --  his table talk . He showed Fogel the first sentence he had copied into the hook : " Imagination is not necessarily id , " causing the writer when he read it to laugh uncomfortably . So did Gary . The older man felt the note-taking was silly but did not object when Gary scribbled down long passages , although he doubted he had wisdom of any serious sort to offer . He was wiser in his work  --  one would be who revised often enough  --  than in the living of life , more or less off the tip of his tongue . He wished Gary would go to his books for answers to some of the questions he asked and stop treating poor Fogel as though he were a guru . " You ca n't dissect a writer to learn what writing is or entails . One learns from experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a writer , Gary . I 've said that in my lectures . All I can do here is talk about writing and hope somebody talented is listening . I always regret coming to these conferences . " " You can give insights , ca n't you ? " " Insights you can get from your mother . " " More specifically , if I might ask , what do you think of my writing thus far , sir ? " Fogel reflected . " You have promise  --  that 's all I can say now , but keep working . " " What should I work most for ? " " Search possibility , inside , outside , and beyond the fact . I have the impression when I read your stories , the two in Buffalo and the one you 've given me here . that you remember too much . Memory is an ingredient , Gary , not the whole stew and do n't make the error of living your life as though it were a future fiction . Invent , my boy , invent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemed worried . Fogel lectured four mornings a week at 8:30 so that he could spend the rest of the day at work . His large bright room in a guest house close to a pine grove whose fragrant essence Fogel breathed as he wrote on a cracked table by a curtained window , was comfortable even on hot afternoons . He worked every day ( half-day on Sundays ) , quitting as a rule around four ; then soaked in a smallish stained tub , dressed leisurely , whistling through his teeth , in a white flannel suit fifteen years in service , and waited , holding a book before his nose , for someone to come in for a drink . During the last week of the White Mountain conference he saw Gary every night . Sometimes they went to a movie in town , or walked after supper along a road by a stream , the youth jotting down in his notebook good and bad sentences given off , grain as well as chaff . They went leisurely until the mosquitoes thickened , or Fogel 's limp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly yellowed , and white shoes he whitened daily , one with a higher heel than the other . Fogel 's pouched dark eyes , even as he spoke animatedly , were contemplative , and he listened with care though he did n't always hear . In the last year or two he had lost weight and his white suit hung on his shoulders . He looked small by Gary 's side although he was shorter by only three inches . And once the youth , in a burst of affection , his one truly imaginative act of the summer , lifted Fogel and held him breathless in the air . The writer gazed into Gary 's gold-flecked eyes , and that he found them doorless to the self filled him with remorse . Or Gary drove them in his noisy Peugeot to a small piano-playing bar by a crossroads several miles the other side of town , sometimes in the company of one or two women , occasionally a colleague but usually students ; and this made it a fuller pleasure because Fogel enjoyed being with women . Gary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , one night brought along one of the most attractive Fogel had seen . The girl , about twenty-five , with mixed dark and dyed blonde hair in a pompadour , wore a red dress draped tight on her long-waisted body , the breasts ample , loose , her buttocks , shapely , sweet . A rare find indeed ; but the youth , either senseless , sullen , or stoned  --  he confessed to smoking a joint now and then  --  gave her scant attention . He glanced at her once in a while as if trying to remember . Sad-eyed , she gnawed her underlip between gulps of scotch on the rocks , her jaw working as she watched his eyes roving amid the dancers on the floor . Too bad she does n't know how much I appreciate her , Fogel thought . Where does he get so many lovely girls  --  he had been equally effective in Buffalo  --  and why does n't he bring the same one two nights running ? One of them , for instance this blessed creature , would last me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be beat , but he seemed after a short while unmoved by them , although it was rumored he enjoyed an active heterosexual life . He has so many and goes through them so quickly , where does he think one learns longing ? Where does poetry come from ? She 's too good for him , Fogel thought , not knowing exactly why unless she was f good for him . Ah youth , ah summer . Once again he seriously considered the possibility of marriage . After all , how old is forty-five ? ? not , in any case , old . A good twenty-five or thirty years to go , enough to raise a family . For his companion the writer had asked along a schoolteacher from his class , a Miss Rudel from Manhattan , unmarried but not lacking a sense of humor ; nor did she take her dabbling in fiction seriously , a pleasant change from the desperate women writers who haunted the conference , creating desperation in place of art . He looked her over and found her wanting . As usual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair . Perhaps because the evening had acquired a sexual tone he began thinking of Lucy Matthews , a desperate woman writer presently attending his lectures . About a week ago , after going through a shoe box full of exasperating stories she had left with him , representing the work of the past year , he had told her bluntly , " Mi6s Matthews , let 's not pretend that writing is a substitute for talent . " And when she quietly gasped , cracking the knuckles of one hand , then of the other , he went on , " If you are out to save your soul , there are better ways . " The lady gazed bleakly at Fogel , a slim woman with fair enough figure , tense neck , and anxious gray eyes . " But Mr. Fogel , how does one go about finding out the extent of her talent ? Some of my professors have told me I write quite capable stories yet you seem to say I 'm hopeless . " Tears brimmed in her eyes . Fogel , out of mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned himself she might interpret that as encouragement , and it would be less than honest to encourage her . She was from Cedar Falls : and this , it turned out , was her fourth conference of the summer . She lived on conferences and conferences lived on her . Fogel vowed once more to give them up forever . Lucy Matthews plucked a Kleenex out of her handbag and quietly cried , waiting perhaps for a good word , but the writer , sitting in painful silence , had none to offer . She got up and hurriedly left the office . But at ten o'clock that night , dressed in a taffeta party dress , her hair brushed into a bright sheen , briskly perfumed , Lucy tapped on Fogel 's door . Accepting his surprised invitation to enter , after three silent sips of bourbon and water , she rose and with a solid twist of her arms , lifted her noisy dress over her head and stood there naked . " Mr. Fogel , " she whispered passionately , " you are n't afraid to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if I could hold you in my arms I would be close to both  --  art and truth . " He felt as though he had stepped with both feet into a Sherwood Anderson story . " It just is n't so , " Fogel said . " I would frankly like to sleep with you but not for the reasons you 've given . If you said to me , ' Fogel , you may he an odd-looking duck but you arouse me tonight and I would gladly go to bed with you ' ? could you say that ? " " I will fellatio you if you prefer that instead , " she whispered . The writer gazed at her with tenderness . " Thank you but I 'm the sort who prefers the embrace of a woman . Would you answer my question ? " Shivering around the shoulders , Lucy Matthews came to her finest moment at writing conferences . " I ca n't truly say so . " " Ah , too bad , " Fogel sighed , disappointed . " Anyway , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bernard Malamlid 's short stories and novels have won many awards ; in 1967 " The Fixer " received the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize . He is now completing a novel of related stories , to be called " Pictures of Fidelman . " She slipped on the dress at her feet and departed . Fogel especially regretted the loss because the only woman he had slept with that summer , a college girl chambermaid in a Buffalo hotel he had stayed at in June , had hurt him dreadfully . " Are you dreaming about something . Mr. Fogel ? " Gary asked . " Not about me , " said Miss Rudel . " Only vaguely , " answered Fogel . " An idea for a story . I bet ? " " One never knows , " the writer sighed . When the conference had ended , Gary , waiting outside the lecture barn , asked him , " Will I ever be a good writer , do you think , Mr. Fogel ? " " It depends on your commitment . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have faith in me . " " Even if I have no faith in you . Who is Eli Fogel , after all , but a man trying to make his own way through the woods . " Fogel smiled at the youth , and though not knowing exactly why , felt he had to say , " One must grow a spirit , Gary . " The youth blinked in the strong sunshine . " I 'm glad we 're both writers , Mr. Fogel . " The next spring , a wet springtime , Fogel wandering in damp hat and raincoat in the periodical room of the N. Y. Public Library , without forethought plucked off the shelf a college magazine and came upon Gary Simmson in the table of contents as the author of a story called " Travails of a Writer . " He was surprised because they were in correspondence and Gary had not told him he had published his first story . Maybe it is n't such a good story ? Reading it quickly Fogel found it was n't ; but that was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed him . The story concerned a Mr. L. E. Vogel , a sarcastic , self-centered , although not thoroughly bad-natured middle-aged writer , with a club foot , who wore in summertime a white suit , the pants of which dripped over his heels , an old-fashioned straw hat , and the same yellow knitted necktie , day after day . He was a short man with a loud laugh that embarrassed him , and he walked a good deal although he limped . One summer he had taught at a writers ' conference in Syracuse , New York . There the writer had fallen for a college girl chambermaid at the hotel he had lived in during his two weeks of lecturing . She had slept with him for kicks after learning he had published two novels . Once was enough for the girl , but Vogel , having had a taste of young flesh , was hooked hard . His feeling blazed . He fell in love with the girl , could not banish her from his a story by Bernard illalaniud 79 thoughts , constantly sought her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers of marriage , until she became sick of him . To get him off her back  --  give him something else to worry about  --  she arranged with her boy friend to enter his room with a passkey and give him a bad time . Vogel . soaking in his afternoon tub . heard someone shout , " Fire , everybody out ! " He rushed out of his bath . was grabbed by the arm and shoved into the hall by the boy friend , who pulled the door shut after him and disappeared down the stairs . The writer . naked and wet , wandered like a half-drowned animal in the huge hotel hall , knocking at doors that were slammed in his face , until he found an elderly lady who gave him a blanket to cover himself and phoned the manager for a key to his room . Vogel , brokenhearted by what the girl had done to him  --  he understood at once that she had contrived the plot and for what reason  --  packed up and left Syracuse a full week before the conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on writing . " End of " Travails of a Writer . " When he arrived home , Fogel , after hanging up his raincoat , dashed a white pitcher of daffodils to the kitchen floor and kicked with his bad leg at the shards and flowers . " Swine ! Scum ! Have I taught you nothing ? " Fogel , wounded , incensed , humiliated to the hilt , ( the story revived the memory ; he suffered from both ! in a rare rage cursed Gary out . He wished on him a fearful punishment , even conceived himself setting the youth 's curly head on fire . Ultimately reason prevailed and he settled for writing him a scalding letter . Where had he got the story ? Probably it was rife as gossip . He pictured the girl and her boy friend regaling all who would listen , screaming over the funny part where the hairy-chested writer wanders in a wet daze in the hotel hallway . Gary might easily have heard it from them or friends of theirs . Or perhaps he had slept with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good God . had he put her up to it ? No , that 's going too far , he thought . Why then had he written it ? Why had n't he spared Fogel this shame and misery , though it was obvious he had not expected him to read the story ? That was n't the point ; the point was that he had n't refrained  --  out of friendship  --  from writing it . So much for friendship . He detested the thought that the boy had sucked up to him all summer in order to collect facts for the piece . Or possibly he had heard the story and been tempted by it , Fogel hoped . after the White Mountain conference . He had probably harbored the " idea " 80 AN EXORCISM during the summer but did not decide to write it until he got back to San Francisco where he went to college . All he had to do was salt the anecdote with some biographical details of appearance , a few mannerisms , and the tale was as good as written , acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody had whispered , " It 's about Eli Fogel , a real writer . " The possibility of libel had not even suggested itself to Gary ; he had probably thought of it as a sort of act of homage : this good writer I know portrayed as human being . He had n't been able to resist . After a summer of too much talk of writing he had felt the necessity of having something in print , at once , no matter what . He had got it down on paper as received . It invented nothing , was in essence a memoir once removed . Fogel , after regaining objectivity , sat at his desk facing the landlady 's garden behind the house , and dipping his fountain pen in black ink , began a letter to Gary : " I congratulate you on the publication of your first story although I can not rejoice in it . " He crossed that out and on another sheet of paper wrote : " I read your story in San Francisco Unicorn . What have you got to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's in the self ? Where 's insight , wisdom ? Your story , as is , signified little and one wonders why it was written . Perhaps it represents the desperate act of one determined to break into print , without the patience  --  the art ultimately  --  to transmute a piece of gossip into a fiction ; and in the process betraying a friend . To be satisfied with recapitulating , as it were , an idea for a fiction , here and there a dib or dab of disguise or extension , is not enough . One cheats the reader as well as himself in not re-creating as art the reality that changes them both . If this poor thing indicates the force and depth of your imagination , I suggest you give up writing . " " L. E. Vogel , indeed . Yours truly , Eli Fogel . " " P. S. Look up ' travail . ' It 's an experience not easy to come by . " After sealing the letter he did n't send it . We all have our hangups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , life is n't that long . He tore it up and sent a Picasso postcard instead , a woman with six faces sitting on a chamber pot . " Dear Gary , I read your story in Unicorn . I wish I could say it was a good story , but it is n't , not so good as the ones I read last summer that you could n't get published . I wish I had had your opportunity to write about Vogel ; I ca n't begin to tell you what I would have done with him . " He received by airmail a four-page single-space letter from Gary , apologizing . " To tell the honest truth I was kind of anxious about my writing . I could n't finish a story for months after I left the W. M. conference , and no doubt took the easy way out . I know that does n't excuse me at all . All I can say is I am sorry , and hope you will forgive and forget . Once I reread the story in the Unicorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I have hurt our friendship , which I truly would n't want to do , I am willing to try to do better if you have the patience . I mean try to be a better friend . " Also I recently read in an article about Thomas Wolfe , that he said it was all right to write about people you might know  --  base stories on what they were like  --  hut it 's wrong to include their address and phone number . As you know , Mr. Fogel , I have a lot to learn about writing , that 's for sure . As for what you could have done with the same material , please do n't compare your magnificent powers with my poor ones . " I enclose a picture of my latest bride as well as one of myself . " In the envelope was an underexposed snapshot of a long-haired brunette in briefest bikini , sitting on a blanket by Gary 's yellow guitar , on a California beach . Leaning on one arm she stared distantly , certainly not happily , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and tide . She looked worn , cheerless , as though she had been had and was , in her own mind , past having . This girl knows life . She was for Fogel so true , lovely , possible , present , as he gazed , so beautifully formed that he thought of her as a work of art and audibly sighed . Gary , the hero himself of the other , overexposed , colored snap , probably taken by the discontented lady , wore white bathing tights , prominent genitals , and a handsome sunburned body , spare , dark , leaner than when Fogel had seen him last . His eyes as he stared at the camera contradicted the flickering smile on his face . Perhaps he was not looking at the unhappy lady but through her . The youth darkened in bright sunlight as the beholder beheld , or was Fogel prejudiced ? On the back of his picture Gary had scrawled , " You may not recognize me so well , I 've changed , I 've lost weight " " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the postscript of his reply forgiving Gary . He had urged patience in writing . " If you push time , time pushes you . The next thing you know you 're writing in a hurry . The next thing you 're writing anything . One loses control . " " Not in the marital sense , " Gary explained when he appeared in person at Fogel 's flat , in dungaree jacket and field boots , wearing a five-day growth of beard after driving practically nonstop across the country in a new secondhand station wagon , during the spring recess . He had brought his guitar and played " Ochi Chornyye " for Fogel . They were stiff with each other . Fogel , despite good will , felt at first distaste for the youth but by degrees relented and they talked exhaustively . The older man had several times to set aside the image of himself dripping along the hotel hallway before he could renew affection for the youth . The guitar helped . His singing sometimes brought tears to the eyes . Ah , the human voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have misjudged his capacity to relate or he does it better now . And why should I bear him a grudge for his errors , considering the number I made myself as a young man ? It was therefore freer talk than they had engaged in last summer , as though among equals , about ninny more interesting matters than when Gary was hastily taking it down to preserve fur humanity . Yet as they conversed , particularly when Fogel spoke of writing , the youth 's fingers twitched as though he were recording the older man 's remarks in an invisible notebook , causing him later to advise , " Do n't worry if you ca n't remember everything word for word , Gary . Have you read Proust ? What he ca n't remember he invents ; even what he remembers he invents . " Not as of yet but he 's on my list . " There was still something naive about him though he was bright enough and gave the impression he had experienced more than one ordinarily would at his age . Possibly this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of room to stuff in experience . Fogel was at the point of asking what women meant to him , but it was a foolish question so he refrained ; yet all he meant was to suggest that the unmarried state was not necessarily a happy one . But Gary was young , let him find his way . Fogel decided he would prefer not to be that young again . The youth remained for three days in the writer 's small guest room in his rent-controlled flat in a three-story brick house on East Seventh Street . Gary one night invited over some friends , Fogel adding two or three former students , including Miss Rudel . A noisy crowded party flowered , especially pleasurable to Fogel when Gary sang , strumming his guitar , and a young man with a thin beard and hair down to his shoulders accompanied him on a recorder . The young a story by Bernard- Malamud 85 people played records they had brought along , and danced . A girl smelling of pot and dancing barefoot . kissed Fogel and drew him into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard , he decided , really there were no steps , so he pulled off his shoes and danced in his black socks , his limp as though choreographed in . At any rate no one seemed to notice and Fogel had an enjoyable time . I should do this more often , he thought . Damn ; the long book , it 's a short life . He again felt j grateful to the youth for lifting him , almost against the will , out of his solitude . On the morning he left , Gary , bathed , shaved , lotioned , glowing in white T-shirt and clean cords , tossed a duffel bag into the station wagon and stood talking at the lowest stoop step with Fogel , who had come out to see him off . The writer sensed that Gary was saying something preliminary although he was ostensibly saying goodbye . The youth , after new introductory noises in his throat , apologized for bringing " this " up but he had a request to make if Fogel did n't mind . Fogel. after momentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for admission to one or two writing centers in universities on the West Coast and he sort of hoped Fogel would write him a letter of recommendation . " I do n't see why not . " " Gee , thanks , Mr. Fogel , and I do n't want to bug you but I hope you wo n't mind if I put your name down as a reference on other applications now and then ? " " What for , Gary ? Remember , I 'm a working writer . " He had felt momentarily uneasy , not that he would mind filling out an application or two for the boy , but as though he were being asked to extend credit beyond credit earned . " I promise I 'll keep it to the barest minimum . Just if I apply for a fellowship to help me out financially , or something like that . " " That seems all right . I 'll consider each request on its merits . " " That 's exactly what I 'd like you to do , Mr. Fogel . " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him why he wanted to be a writer . " To express myself and also create art , " Gary quickly answered . " To convey my experiences in a way that enlarges the consciousness of my readers . You might also say , to become part of them so neither of us is alone . " He hesitated , seeming to stiffen a little . " Why are you writing ? " " Because it 's in me to write . There 's an expression in German which translates into , ' I ca n't 86 AN EXORCISM do otherwise . ' " Fogel laughed embarrassedly . " That does n't contradict what I said , " " I would n't want to contradict it . " Fogel did not say that Gary remembered his summer notes perhaps better than he knew . The youth thrust forth his hand impulsively . " Pm grateful for your friendship as well as hospitality , Mr. Fogel . " " Call me Eli , if you like , " the writer said , touched . " I 'll certainly try , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Is morality part of fiction ? I mean does it have to be ? A girl I go with here said it does . I would like to have your opinion . Fondly , Gary . " " It is as it becomes aesthetic , " Fogel replied , wondering if the girl were the brunette in the bikini . " Another way to put it is that nothing that is art is merely moral . " " I guess what I meant to ask , " Gary wrote , " is does the artist have to be moral ? " " Neither the artist nor his art . " " Thanks for being so honest with me , Mr. Fogel . " In rereading these letters before filing them , Fogel noticed that Gary 's salutation had not contained his first name , always his last . Better that way , he thought . In two years Fogel lost an additional four pounds and wrote only seventy more pages of his novel . He had hoped to write one hundred and fifty pages but had unaccountably slowed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a difficult one . I hope to live to get it done . The writer at times had visions of himself dying before it was completed . It was a terrible thought . Fogel , seated dead at the table , staring at his manuscript , pen in hand , the page ending in scrawl and blot . He had had several bad months last winter , quite bad , as though sitting each day on knives , and thought himself blocked , but slowly wrote himself out of it . After a short affair with Miss Andel , who had insistently urged him to make more time for her , because for a while he was also sitting at his table nights , he gave her up and took to cigars . He found he enjoyed a small one after supper each evening ; he loved the world a little better . I must be content to be Eli Fogel at his best , despite limitations . He had n't seen Gary during this time though they still corresponded ; Fogel sometimes left his letter around for weeks before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was driving east before Christmas and could he call on Fogel ? The writer had replied he thought notuntil his writing were going better . Gary then wrote , " You must have some kind of ESP , because the same thing has happened to me . I mean not writing . The last six or seven months I have been down in the dumps . I think it 's mostly because I have been up tight about future worries after I get my M.F.A. in June , including money worries , and when to write if I have to work full-time . Otherwise I 've had two long stories published , as you know , in the last year " ( both sluggish pieces ; Fogel had read them and they were like unrisen loaves of bread . Gary said they had been " definitely invented . " One was about a sex-starved man , and the other about a sex-starved woman ) " and I 've been thinking ahead because I want to begin a novel and wonder if you would recommend me to the MacDowell Colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get started on it ? " Fogel wrote , " Gary , I 've recommended you without stint for everything you 've asked for because you had shown promise and I thought you ought to have a chance to prove yourself . But I 'd be less than honest if I did n't admit I 've been doing it uneasily lately , because there 's such a thing as overextending good will . However , I will think it over if you can send me something really good in the way of a fiction , either a new story or the opening chapter or two of your novel . " He got in reply , hastily , Gary . The youth appeared nine days later , as Fogel was in the street on his way to the liquor store on the corner . He heard the bleat of a horn , then a dark green VW Microbus with black-curtained windows drew up to the curb , and Gary Simmson stepped out of the door and pumped the writer 's hand . " I have a new story for you , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beach ; stood dark-suited , handsomely moustached , yet as though missing a limb without the guitar . A briefcase he carried did not make up for it . " I 'm sorry I could n't warn you but I came up quite suddenly and as you know you have no phone , " He paused in embarrassment , suffering his usual opening stiffness although Fogel smiled gently at him . " Have you had supper , Gary ? " " Not as of yet . " " We 'll go upstairs and have a bite . " " Neat , " said Gary , loosening . " Gee , Mr. Fogel , it 's a pleasure to see you after all this time gone . You 're looking okay but a little thin and pale . " " Vicissitudes , Gary , vicissitudes . Not to mention continual labor , which is the only way I about to suggest they invite people party but thought it premature . They ate a simple meal . Fogel cooked a tasty souffl ? . There was salad , Italian bread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen over coffee . In Fogel 's studio Gary snapped open the briefcase lock he had nervously been fiddling with . They were at once alertly attentive to each other , Fogel detecting an odor of perspiration . Gary proved it by wiping his face with his handkerchief , then twice around the neck , loosening his tie to get under the collar . " This is the first draft of a story I did the other day , my first in months . As I wrote you in my letter , I just was n't making the scene for a while . I got the idea for this story in a flash the night before last . I was planning to drop in on you yesterday but instead spent the day on twenty cups of coffee in this girl 's room while she was out working , and finally knocked off the story . I think it 's good . It feels good to me and if you 're not doing anything special tonight , Mr. Fogel , would you care to hear it ? " " A first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you finish and then let me read it ? " " I would gladly do that if the closing date for the writers ' colony application was n't this coming Monday . I do n't really think I could get it done by then . I 'd like to work on it another week at least , and the only reason I suggest reading it to you is so you will have a quick idea of the merits of what I 've done up to now . " " Well then let me read it myself , " Fogel said . " I get more out of it that way . " " My typing is n't so hot , as you well know . Lots of things are crossed out , and it 'll be hard for you to make out . corrections in my lousy handwriting . What 's more I find I get ideas as I read aloud which I later make notes on and use in revision . " Fogel nodded , removing his shoes to ease his feet . So did Gary . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his papers . Fogel , rocking slowly in his rocker , gazed melancholically at the pile of his own manuscript on his writing table , and beyond that , at twilight through the window . Remembering his own youthful aspirations the writer said the equivalent of a short prayer that the story might be good . The youth brushed his lips with a wet thumb . " I have n't got a title yet but I was thinking of a story by Bernard Malamud 87 calling it ' Three Girls in One Night . ' " He began to read and Fogel 's rocker stopped creaking . The narrator of the story was George , a student at Stanford University who had driven to New York , and having nothing to do one spring day , had looked up Connie , who had been in love with him last summer . She lived in the West Village in an apartment with two friends , Grace and Buffy , pretty girls ; and soon George , while eating with them , on learning that none of the girls was going out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one right after the other , tonight . It would be a sort of test of himself . Connie , he figured , he had been in before and knew the way back . Grace was uneasy when he looked at her and he saw that as an advantage . Buffy , the best-looking of the lot , seemed a cool drink of water , aloof , maybe impossible but he would n't think of her as yet . It was a long night and he was n't in a hurry . George invited Connie for a walk and later bought her a drink in a bar on Sullivan Street . While they were drinking he told her he had n't forgotten Last summer in Bloomington , Indiana . Connie called him a shit for bringing it up . George , after saying nothing , said it had been one of the best summers of his life . Then he became deeply silent . They had a second drink and in the street she softened to him and walked close by his side . It was a warm airy evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was his impression that Buffy was a pothead but Connie said that was ridiculous , Buffy was the most stable of them all . She worked for a youth program as secretary in charge of anything . Her father had been killed in the Korean war and she was devoted to her widowed mother and two younger sisters in Spokane . " What about Grace ? " Connie admitted that Buffy had a lot more patience with Grace than she had . Grace 's problems , though she did n't say what they were , were more than Connie cared to contend with . " Even when she has a good time she comes home in a horrible funk and pulls her eyelashes out one by one while standing at the mirror . " After a while George told Connie that he had loved her last summer but had n't been willing to admit it to himself . His father had got hooked into an early marriage and he did n't want to , because his father had regretted it all his life . Connie called him a shit again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was willing to sleep with him he said he had a mattress in his VW bus and why bother 88 AN EXORCISM going upstairs where the others would know their business ? Connie laughed and said she had never made love in a Microbus but was willing to try if he parked it in some quiet private place . which George said he was willing to do . In the bus he gave it to her the way he remembered she liked it . Connie went to bed with a headache . She had said he could stay in the living room till morning and no later . " That 's our rule and Huffy does n't like it if we break it . " George sat on the sofa for a while , then looked into Grace 's room . Her door was open and he went in . Grace wore a terry-cloth robe and said she did n't mind talking with George so long as he got no strange ideas . She was n't careful with her robe and he saw her large bruised breasts through her nightgown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He asked her what she meant by strange ideas and she said he knew what she meant . George told her about some girl friends he had in California who had given it to him in interesting ways . She listened with slack mouth and uneasy eyes , drying her hair . He asked her where the gin was , he would make the drinks . She said she was n't interested . He asked her then if she wanted to split a joint . " I 'm not interested , " Grace said . " What interests you ? " George asked . " I 'll bet you slept with Connie . " " Why do n't you ask her ? " He said then that he knew what interested her . George got up and though she grabbed both his hands , he freed one , forced her chin up and French-kissed her . She shoved him away , her robe falling open . George , pretending to be a prize fighter , went into a crouch , ducked , then feinted with his left . With his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped and was about to cry . Instead , after a wavering hesitation , searching his face she swung to him , her eyes unfocused , grinning . When they kissed she bit his lip . George rapped her between the legs with his fist . Grace came close again with a quiet moan . He began to pull off her robe but she caught his hands , then shut the door . " Not here . " " Put on a dress and meet me downstairs . " She came down in a green dress , nothing underneath but her bruises . Grace followed him into the bus . " I love you , " she said . George handed her his belt and said she could hit him a few whacks but not too hard . Huffy had been reading in bed . She said come in when he knocked . but seeing who it was , drew up her legs and asked him not to since it waslate and she had to go to work in the morning . George offered her one of the joints he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He asked her if she would mind talking for a few minutes , then he would go . Huffy said she honestly would . George told her he was leaving for the war in the morning . She asked him , after a while , if he wanted to go , and George said no . " Then why do n't you refuse to serve ? " He said he had been a coward most of his life and it was time he faced up to something . She called it an unjust war but George said you only die once . He offered her a joint again and she lit up . Huffy smoked for a few minutes , then said it was n't turning her on . " Nor me either , " George admitted . " Why do n't you get dressed and come out for a walk ? It 's a nice night . " When she asked him had n't he got enough walking with Connie and Grace , he told her she was the one who had really roused him . " Before I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be five years older than you . " " That does n't change my feelings . " " What malarkey , " she said . George then said goodbye . He thanked her for supper and for talking to him . " See you after the war . " " Connie said you were staying the night ? " He said he was sleeping in his bus downstairs . He had to be at Fort Dix at seven , and before that had to deliver the car to a friend who would drive it to Jersey , then keep it for him while he was away . He was leaving at 5:00 A.M. , and no sense waking up everyone in the house . " Are you afraid of death ? " Huffy asked him . " Of course , why should n't I be ? " He shut her door and went downstairs . In the bus George , removing his shirt , wondered if he ought to shave now or in the morning . Then there was a tap on the door . It was Huffy in skirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a coil at the Beck , fell over her right breast . She wore a gold bracelet high up on her left arm . When they returned it was still a warm breezy night . After talking quietly awhile they entered the Microbus . George plowed her three times , and the third time , towards morning , she came at last . As they lay on the mattress , smoking , she asked him whether he had also had Connie and Grace that night . and George admitted he had . " Ah . " said Fogel. his bad leg trembling a little . He got up and lowered the shade , then stepped into slippers . He had forgotten there was no liquor and felt angered at the empty bourbon bottle . He drank an unsatisfactory glass of water and went back to sit in the rocker . Gary had finished strong and was at the edge of the couch in his tennis socks , his feet turned inward . He was watching his feet , occasionally casting furtive glances at Fogel . " You like ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind if you slog it to me , Mr. Fogel , so long as you tell the truth . " " Would George have all that sexual energy ? " " That 's no particular problem , " Cary said . " I don't. see why not . " " I guess Connie is right in characterizing him as a shit . That 's the sort you meant to portray ? " " Well , an antihero is an antihero , " Gary said defensively . " That 's what he 's supposed to be  --  in answer to your question . What the story means is that 's how the crow flies or words to that effect . In other words , c'est la vie . But how do you like it is what I want to know ? " " Have you noticed how , sooner or later , the writer confronts himself in his fiction ? It has of course happened to me . " " Look , Mr. Fogel , " Gary said , " are you hinting George is me ? " " That occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoes with a glaze of annoyance in his eyes . " If so , that 's your hangup , not mine . Other people have imagination , too , you 're not the only one . An idea for a story is an idea for a story no matter where it comes from . It does n't have to have some kind of pedigree . And so whether George is me or not is actually none of your business , I 'm sure you will admit . It has nothing to do with the quality of the story . " " I think you 're right , Gary , " Fogel admitted . " Fiction is by definition not biography or autobiography when the writer means it not to be . The biographical fact is dissolved in the sauce of invention but how successfully depends on the writer 's talent . Flaubert said , ' Everything the artist invents is true . ' We come back to art . " " I agree with you on that . " " So here 's the way I feel about your story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . The narrative is cleverly constructed . The characters are real enough , whether I am enamored of George or not . All in all , the story is an improvement on your last two . " " Well , that 's a lot better , " George said , in a happier frame of mind . " As for recommending you to the MacDowell Colony , " the writer went on , " that 's another question . Though your story shows an advance it a story by Bernard Malamud ? 89 is n't exceptional although you may improve it in the rewriting . However , I would advise you not to send in an application just yet but to do another year 's work as best you can . I 'll read what you have done , next spring , and you can apply then . If most of your work is of a high level I 'll recommend you strongly . " Gary rose with both arms in the air in anguish . " Jesus , Mr. Fogel , give me a break . What am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no father who left me a trust fund of five thousand bucks a year as you told me your father did . " " Ah , you have me there , " sighed Fogel . " Well , " he said , getting up from the rocker , " we 'll have to hash this out further , Gary , but first I must have a drink . I was on my way to the liquor store when you drove up . " Gary courteously offered to go for him but Fogel would n't hear of it . The writer limped down the stairs in his slip-pers . At the curb stood the green VW bus . Despite himself the sight of it incensed Fogel . He went to the corner and on an impulse returned to try the door handle . The door was open . The back seats of the bus had been removed and on the floor lay a worn thin striped gray mattress . Those poor girls , thought Fogel . That son-ofa-bitch . He 's an opportunist and writes out of fear that he ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bourbon . After a minute of reflection he ordered a pint of cheap whiskey . Returning to the house , the writer climbed the stoop and deposited the bourbon in the vestibule . He descended the stairs with the pint bottle in his pocket . Stepping into the bus Fogel pulled the door shut . The curtains were drawn ; he did not flick on the light . What he was about to do surprised Fogel yet did not . I have the better imagination , he thought . Opening a small silver penknife he used to sharpen pencils , the writer , on his knees in the dark , methodically slashed the mattress across its length and breadth and then poured whiskey over it . He lit the soaked cotton stuffing with several matches . It stank as it horned with a blue flame . Fogel left cautiously by the doors on the street side . He went up the stoop and recovered the bottle of bourbon . After the firemen had put out the blaze and Gary had driven off in his burnt-out bus , the writer took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up . Fogel got one last letter from Gary , saying , " Honi suit qui mal y pense . " He enclosed a few leaves of poison ivy . Harper 's Magazine , December 1968
