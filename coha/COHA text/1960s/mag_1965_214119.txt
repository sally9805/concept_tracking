Bothered by all the moral , legalistic and unrealistic arguments over Viet Nam , Military Historian S.L.A. Marshall offers some blunt battlefield advice in the current New Leader . " Long service with the military , " admits retired Brigadier General Marshall , " colors my own view . " It also " nourishes the suspicion that peace is so important that its safeguarding should not be entrusted exclusively to the judgment of civilians . " <P> One judgment he questions in particular is the bland statement by Defense Secretary McNamara that U.S. forces can not be protected in Viet Nam against enemy sneak attack . " It is a self-imposed jeopardy , " Marshall writes . " In operations of war , if you do not have security , you do not have anything . The sending of enough field forces to cover our own installations was the one move that might have initiated a revival of confidence . Amid doubt all around , it would have been an earnest of the American intention to see the show through . There is always time for such moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk . " <P> Marshall believes that the U.S. has been much too cautious in Viet Nam for fear of Chinese Communist intervention . The Chinese , he feels sure , are unlikely to enter the war . " Chinese and Communist Vietnamese interests are by no means identical . " Besides , there are " insuperable logistic difficulties . " The distance from the Chinese to the South Vietnamese border is 650 miles , and the route lies over rugged terrain through a narrow coastal strip that can be easily attacked from sea or air . Moreover , Chinese transport remains as shoddy as it was during the Korean War . Whenever Chinese troops moved more than 450 miles beyond their supply lines at the Yalu , they bogged down . <P> " However intransigent , " concludes Marshall , " the men of Peking are not reckless . They look for the soft touches and hit only when opportunity yawns wide . For these reasons , all the talk about blundering into another Korea-type war in Southeast Asia seems to me as idle as is the fear behind it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if those who make policy recoil from chimeras , they will forfeit what chance remains to help South Viet Nam save herself .
