The Sand Castle ( Jerome Hill ; De Rochemont ) is a gay and whimsical pipe-dream made of nothing more consequential than a boy 's day at the beach . Turned loose while his mother goes shopping , the boy ( nine-year-old Barry Cardwell ) makes a routine protest at having to mind his kid sister ( played by Barry 's own sister , four-year-old Laurie ) , then jogs across the sand looking for adventure . Barry 's luck is bad ; he is pelted by a flock of children who have made themselves a fort . He wanders off moodily , trailed by his tiny blonde caboose . Then he finds a shovel , and inspiration strikes . He heaps up a great pile of sand and begins turning it into a castle . <P> As the boy works , the day 's sun worshipers arrive-a fat man , a skinny woman , a pair of lovers , a fisherman , a pyramid of musclegrowers , an artist who fretfully resketches his picture as the sandcastle takes form and draws admirers . Producer-Director Jerome Hill handles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the naturally ridiculous business of hide toasting . Two women wage a war of radios , a frogman draped in seaweed evokes a squeak of fright from Laurie , a paper nose shade makes the skinny woman look even more like a toucan . The sound is realistically blurred ; one hears the sea now and then , and occasionally the scrape of feet on sand or the rubble of unimportant conversation . <P> Thirty minutes of this would have made a charming short , but Hill takes the chance and imaginatively spins his whimsy to feature length . He calls forth a rainstorm . Everyone leaves the beach except Barry and his sister , who fall asleep under an umbrella beside the castle , which after several hours of work is as magnificent as Mont-Saint-Michel . Till now the film has been black and white ; suddenly Barry begins to dream in color . A toy knight boldly marches through the castle and looks in wonder at cut-out caricatures ( cleverly drawn by Hill himself ) of the day 's beach people . There is a grand , nonsensical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is an enemy approaching ? Barry wakes to find , in the black and white world , that his mother is calling him . As he and Laurie leave the beach , the tide washes in , further with each wave , and hungrily consumes the sandcastle.
