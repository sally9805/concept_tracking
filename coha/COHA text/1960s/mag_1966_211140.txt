Talking to reporters in Boston , Comedian Jerry Lewis was sounding jeremiads as the new season got underway . " I have no desire to get back into TV , " he said . " It 's dull . It 's canned . It 's tasteless . It 's been swallowed up by Madison Avenue . Right after the dinner hour , we hear all about underarm deodorants , bad breath , dentures . It 's disgusting . There is an easy way to make it on TV-you learn their ten commandments , which start with Thou shalt kill , ' ' Thou shalt lie , ' ' Thou shalt be a cutthroat . ' " <P> Jerry , who does the nightclub bit these days , may be recalling that atrocious bomb of 1963 when ABC invested many millions on a 40-part series of his fooleries , then canceled out after only 13 . But he does have a point . As every discriminating viewer knows , the selection factor for TV shows is not the survival of the fittest but dog-eat-dog . And last week it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their old tricks . <P> About the only interesting developments are a 100% switch into color , the casting of more Negroes , and evidence that the producers are increasingly getting off their back lots and onto location . <P> The brightest , slickest comedy of the opening week was The Hero ( NBC ) , out of the same shop and mold as last season 's hit , Get Smart . Richard Mulligan is cast as an actor who is cast as an actor in a TV western series . In real life he is a suburban dude and a sort of all-round schlemiel . Between ( and sometimes during ) takes , he is horse-shy , allergic to sagebrush , and as rugged as Mr. Peepers . But the sight gags are inventive , and the dialogue is literate . The only other situation comedy worth a twirl is That Girl ( ABC ) , a sort of My Sister Eileen , starring Danny Thomas ' saucy daughter Mario . She is much snappier than her material , and at 26 is unmistakably a hot new talent . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anyone from nine to 90-IQ , that is . The Green Hornet ( ABC ) , concocted by the man behind Batman , is played straight . Only changes from the 1936-52 radio version are James Bond-type hardware and a bigger-beat theme song , blown by Al Hirt . There is nothing wrong with the show that can not be cured by turning off the set . Tarzan ( NBC ) has a vaster menagerie than last season 's high-rated jungle epic , Daktari , and just as soupy a scenario . Ron Ely is mesomorphic enough as Tarzan , but he is a trifle too citified-his call of the wild is Johnny Weissmuller 's voice . There is no Jane , but the first episode featured Nara , a blind bush girl who got Tarzan to rescue her seeing-eye lion . <P> Science fiction is once again rearing its preposterous head . The Time Tunnel ( ABC ) meanwhile provides a new dimension for last year 's Lost in Space . Project TicToc headquarters is housed 800 floors below the Arizona desert and is developing capability to thrust explorers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first human test pilot is propelled back five decades , finds himself in the Atlantic on the Titanic . The captain naturally thinks his visitor is some kind of nut and locks him up .
