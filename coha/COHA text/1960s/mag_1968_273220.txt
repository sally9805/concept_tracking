THE NETHERLANDS <P> By all accounts there are plenty of Americans who have decided not to vote at all in next month 's presidential election - and lots of others who wish they did not feel that they have to . Across the Atlantic , however , there is a band of Dutchmen who would like nothing better than to help pick the next President of the U.S. Since they can not , they have formed a group called Aktie ( for Action ) Precedent to try to influence U.S. votes . <P> At the heart of their effort is an IBM-supervised mock election sampling the presidential choices ( including Senator Eugene McCarthy ) of 4,000 presumably representative Hollanders . Says Hendrik Jan Diekerhof , 58 , a retired Dutch army chaplain who runs Aktie : " The actual voting electorate in the U.S. is no more than 1% of the world population . That 1% decides for us in matters of war and peace , racial relations and the fight against poverty . The U.S. President meddles in our affairs . We should meddle in his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has since attracted the support of Dutch religious , labor and political groups of the center and non-Communist left . Diekerhof himself is a mem ber of the Dutch Labor Party executive , and active in the New Left . He and other Aktie leaders have organized street theaters , panels and teach-ins in hired halls all over The Netherlands during the past few weeks . Last week in Driebergen , near Utrecht , one listener wondered why Aktie was not making similar efforts with the Soviet Union . Diekerhof answered : " We do not know how to influence the Kremlin . We have always been against what goes on there , and Czechoslovakia shows how right we are . But we are also against what is happening now on the other side . There we can raise our voice , so we do . " <P> Diekerhof and most of Aktie are critical of the outgoing Administration 's Viet Nam policies . To support the movement , Aktie has sold more than 30,000 copies of a 55-page booklet called The White House-to-House Plan , which takes positions akin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " dirty war . " The booklet 's back page is a multiple-choice questionnaire for mailing to the New York Times , and most of those who have sent it in share Aktie 's views . Diekerhof insists , however , that Aktie is not anti-American . " The McCarthyites are our friends , " he says . " They represent the other America to us. "
