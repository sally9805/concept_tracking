To a point , the harp seals of maritime Canada live fortuitous lives . The gray-tan harp-so called because of a harp-shaped black blotch on its back-cannot swim at birth and dies if whelped into the frigid ocean off Labrador . By a generous natural coincidence , however , whelping occurs just as spring thaws begin to break up the winter ice in the Gulf of St. Lawrence . Taking advantage of the breakup , pregnant cows among the 800,000 harps make their way south . Swimming down the Labrador coast and through the Strait of Belle Isle , they enter the broad Gulf of St. Lawrence . In the sheltered waters of the gulf , the herd instinctively turns the ice floes into floating maternity wards . <P> Females flop onto the smoother ice to bear their offspring . The newborn pups , plump bundles of snow-white fur , with limpid dark eyes and chic whiskers , spend a full month bleating helplessly on the ice and fattening on the richest maternal milk produced by any mammal . At the end of the month , when their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Stout Oak Clubs . Not all of them make it . Of the 250,000 harp-seal pups born in the gulf each year , nearly one-quarter may die at the hands of their natural enemy-man . Their white coats have long been prized for boot and glove trimmings and for fur jackets . In the gulf , a horde of hunters invade the floes on foot , by boat , on ski-equipped planes and in recent years by helicopter . Hundreds of sealers- " swilers " in the Newfoundland dialect-conduct a brief but grimly efficient slaughter . With stout oak clubs they move systematically through the herd , beating the whitecoats to death with raps on the skull . Only if a hulking 300-lb. cow seal chooses to fight for her baby will a swiler sometimes spare it . But most cows , especially the older ones , abandon their pups and escape into the water . <P> The killing continues until 50,000 pups , the legal limit , have been slaughtered . Then , after ten days or so , the Canadian hunters move on to " the front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they and Norwegian hunters slay perhaps another 200,000 seals in the course of a 13-day no-limit hunting season . In most years-this year so far has been disastrous for the hunters because of patch ice-fishermen and farmers from the Atlantic provinces can hope to make from $600 to $1,000 for their brief moonlighting stint as swilers and thereby double their meager incomes . For Canada , the hunt results in $1,500,000 in annual exports . <P> Outrageously Inappropriate . A veteran swiler can complete a kill in less than a minute . The hunter , his face smeared with seal blood to cut down ice glare and prevent chapping , grabs a 60-lb. pup by a hind flipper , whacks it on its soft skull , spins the pup over , punctures the throat and then neatly skins away pelt , flippers and blubber with swift strokes of a razor-sharp knife . The process commences at dawn , continues until dark and turns the once pristine ice into an ugly palette of dirtied snow , crimson blood sprays and grotesquely skinned carcasses . Watching this month 's carnage TIME Correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings of the ice pack shimmering in the sun , the industrialized slaughter of 50,000 helpless and incredibly cuddly young animals seemed not so much cruel or unwise but simply outrageously inappropriate .
