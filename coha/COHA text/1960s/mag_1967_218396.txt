Criticism is the order of the day at the annual convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors . From inside journalism , it usually involves shortcomings of public figures and organizations that are telling newsmen the wrong things-or not telling them enough . From outside , it is the newspapers that are not saying enough , or are saying it wrong . Last week 's meeting produced both complaints . <P> According to CORE 's national director , Floyd B. McKissick , " Today there are only two kinds of statements a black man can make and expect that the white press will report . First is an attack on another black man calling him an Uncle Tom a charge McKissick himself has made once or twice or a fanatic or a black nationalist . The second is a statement that sounds radical , violent , extreme-the verbal equivalent of a riot-Watts put into words . " <P> McKissick urged the editors to " think back over the past months . You will begin to realize that the Negro is being rewarded by the public media only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a switchblade , or only if he sounds outlandish , extremist or psychotic . " He added : " How many of you report even what middle-class Negroes do ? Your social column , your engagement column , your local events column . We 'd like to feel that what we did on the local scene was important . You know , we like news clippings too . " <P> A committee of the assembled editors offered some criticism of its own . Although an unofficial poll of some 100 editors showed that most of them support President Johnson on Viet Nam , the committee chose to add that " the war has escalated to the accompaniment of an almost unbroken succession of pronouncements that it was going in the opposite direction , or at least that something else was happening . " The committee noticed " some slight improvement " in recent months , but in general , " President Johnson continues to hurt his image and his credibility by consistently trying to make the news sound or seem better than it is.
