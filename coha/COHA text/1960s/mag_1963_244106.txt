The U.S. Government is entering a period in which its antitrust powers are wider than ever , but its chief trustbuster promises to be more selective in wielding them . Antitrust enforcement has always been unpredictable at best , but until recently it concentrated its fire on such common practices as price fixing , market splitting or the domination of a nationwide market by sheer size . No longer ; nowadays , antitrust frequently means antimerger . Many businessmen are confused and worried about two court decisions in the past year that have given the Government broad authority to block virtually any corporate merger that so much as threatens to lessen competition even on a local level . " The only way to avoid antitrust action nowadays , " grumbles a leading Chicago lawyer , " is to have two companies so small that they do n't even matter . " <P> " We Just Forget It .

" When we see a merger possibility that we think we 're going to be attacked on , we just forget it , " says Executive Vice President Gene Trefethen of Kaiser Industries . Stauffer Chemical dropped its plans to buy American Viscose Corp . when the trustbusters showed interest .
