Gales had driven Indian summer from New England , and the temperature was a blustery 34 as Barry Goldwater arrived in New Hampshire last week . Goldwater 's Concord welcome was warmer by far . Nearly 500 stomping , shouting Goldwaterites were on hand , while only a handful of 50 had greeted Nelson Rockefeller on his trip into the state on a balmy afternoon two weeks earlier . <P> Goldwater went to New Hampshire , where he presumably will meet Rocky in next March 's presidential primary , to speak at a memorial dinner for the state 's late Republican Senator Styles Bridges . There 1,100 diners paid $10 apiece to help endow the Styles Bridges chair in Government at New England College . Bridges 's widow Doloris and Republican Senator Norris Cotton , who is Goldwater 's New Hampshire manager , both drew pointed parallels between the philosophies of Goldwater and Conservative Bridges . Proclaimed Cotton : " The finger of fate is upon the forehead of Barry Goldwater . " Goldwater contented himself with a denunciation of overcentralized government . <P> In Rockefeller 's home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner at the New York Hilton . He charged that Kennedy 's term thus far " adds up to nearly a thousand days of wasted spending , wishful thinking , unwarranted interventions , wistful theories and waning confidence . " While Goldwater 's lines read well , his formal delivery was flat , and it was only while answering questions at a news conference that he really caught his listeners ' interest . If he were to run for President , he said , he would seek delegate votes " everywhere , " including New York State . As for Rocky 's challenges to debate , Goldwater snapped : " I do n't want to become allied with my enemies . These days the Governor is talking like Eleanor Roosevelt-God rest her soul-and Herbert Lehman . " <P> During his week , Goldwater unnecessarily got himself into some steamy political water . Often in the past , he had advocated that the Tennessee Valley Authority be turned over to private enterprise . Now he answered a needling letter from Tennessee 's Democratic Representative Richard Fulton , who asked the Senator if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To Fulton 's astonishment , Goldwater wrote back , affirming that he was " quite serious in my opinion that TVA should be sold . " Tennessee Republicans , who have high hopes of carrying their state for Goldwater next year , blanched in dismay . Wailed one : " TVA ranks right behind God , mother and country down here , and Barry knows that damned well ; yet he still goes around shooting from the hip . "
