Tennis fortunes wax and wane-and Australia 's mostly wax , while the U.S. 's mostly wane . The Aussies have won the Davis Cup in eleven of the past 13 years ; the U.S. has not even reached the Challenge Round since 1959 . But last week U.S. fortunes took a distinct turn for the better . The U.S. team had already beaten Mexico and Britain handily . Now it needed only to get past India in the interzone finals to challenge Australia for the cup . <P> Out in Bombay the Indians did their bit to make the matches interesting . Captain Ramanathan Krishnan inspected the Cricket Club 's slick clay court , groaned , " The Yanks will murder us on this , " and ordered a new court to be built immediately-out of sand , an old Indian recipe guaranteed to take the bounce out of the ball , to say nothing of the Yanks . On the appointed day , the temperature was in the 90s , flocks of cawing crows hovered low overhead , and Indian fans heckled the Americans ' both from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Dennis Ralston blasted a serve past Krishnan and the linesman signaled a clean ace , the galleries set up such a hullabaloo that the umpire shrugged , and replaced the linesman . <P> India won the skirmish , but the U.S. won the war . Ralston , the Peck 's Bad Boy of tennis , for once kept his temper under control , beat Krishnan at his own sandy game , with short volleys and dinky drop shots that won in straight sets , 6-4 , 6-1 , 13-11 . Texas ' Chuck McKinley , mounting the same kind of whirlwind attack that earned him the Wimbledon championship , needed only 72 minutes to dispose of India 's Permjit Lall , 6-4 , 6-3 , 6-0 . Ralston and McKinley then won the doubles to give the U.S. a 3-0 lead and turn the last two singles matches into a meaningless exhibition . Final score : U.S. 5 , India 0 . <P> Australia may once again prove too strong for the U.S. when they meet in Adelaide next month . But the Aussies are worried enough to try luring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing going for them : cheek . " I know these boys can beat the Aussies , " crowed U.S. Captain Robert Kelleher . " It 's just a matter of applying the right pressure at the right time . "
