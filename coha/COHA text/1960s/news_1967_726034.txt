txt Sanitation Commissioner Samuel J. Kearing Jr . announced yesterday that he had dismissed 12 departmental employes who had refused to answer questions about alleged bribery by private refuse collectors at the city 's East 91st Street marine transfer station . The dismissals came as it was learned that a grand jury would investigate the probability that a pattern of corruption existed at several of the 25 other cityowned transfer stations , incinerators or landfill sites . Private companies are required to pay fees to have the city dispose of their waste . Commissioner Kearing said he had been told of alleged payoffs at the Gansevoort incinerator and marine transfer station , at 14th Street and the Hudson River , and at the 52d Street marine transfer station in Brooklyn . Expects Other Payoffs " I 'd be very much surprised if there were n't payoffs at other sites , too , " Mr. Kearing said . " There is a continuing problem of temptation where department personnel come into contact with private sanitation companies . " Personnel at the various disposal sites have been shifted to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites are under surveillance by a confidential squad . Internal security measures are being directed by former State Police Capt . Edgar D. Crossweil , whom Mr. Kearing recently appointed departmental inspector general with the rank of deputy commissioner . The investigation is now in the hands of District Attorney Frank S. Hogan . Grand Jury Investigation The fourth December grand jury , whose term was extended last week to March 31 , will take up the matter of alleged bribery at the dumping stations and will complete an investigation already under way into alleged payoffs within the department for promotions to higher-salaried positions . The grand jury has been investigating the alleged payoffs for promotions since Dec. 15 without any publicity . It was learned yesterday that Assistant District Attorney David A. Goldstein had taken 30 witnesses before the grand jury , among them several of the 55 employes who had been slated for promotion at a ceremony Oct. 4 . Ceremony Called Off The ceremony was called off the day before when reports reached City Hall that payments of $500 and $1,000 had been made to departmental higher-ups to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among 18 suspended by Commissioner Kearing on Dec. 2 after Commissioner of Investigation Arnold G. Fraiman reported that they had split up to $500 a day in illegal cash payments from private carters who dumped garbage at the 91st Street station . In paying their fees to the city , carting companies are supposed to run their trucks onto electric scales that measure the stubs from tickets they buy in advance . The racket consisted , according to Mr. Fraiman , of a collusive arrangement by which the truckmen paid the sanitation men about half the fees in cash , which the sanitation employes , allegedly pocketed . Those suspended included the regular crew of the 91st Street station and two members of a confidential inspection unit who had been assigned to check on the 91st Street operation and who then allegedly shared in the bribes . Frank Creta , who was in charge of the confidential inspection unit , put in his retirement papers last month and will be retired when his terminal leave expires on Saturday . In announcing the dismissal of the 12 , Commissioner Kearing said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city investigation , these men have violated Section 1123 of the City Charter , making their dismissal mandatory . Any further action in these cases is now a matter for the District Attorney with whom we are cooperating fully . " The two members of the inspection unit , who still await a departmental hearing on their refusal to testify in Commissioner Fraiman 's inquiry , are Frank G. Casale , 48 , of 873 68th Street , and Joseph Moschella , 40 , of 666 Carroll Street , both of Brooklyn . One other employe is awaiting a similar hearing and three others , who answered questions in the inquiry , face hearings on charges of misconduct . The Uniformed Sanitationmen 's Association - had sought in Federal Court to compel the reinstatement of 16 of the suspended members and to enjoin use of a wiretap involving alleged violations . Judge John M. Canella last week dismissed the union 's applications . The union said then that it would appeal .
