The 1968 presidential race may well be remembered as the campaign of the hecklers . Since there was little substantive debate on the great issues , the most striking phenomena were the boos and catcalls , four-letter words and shouts of " Sieg heil ! " Hordes of hecklers dogged the trail of every candidate , punctuating their speeches with yells and raspberries . <P> Who were they ? Most were college students , but their politics varied . They included antiwar protesters and radicals who believed that the present political system must be shouted ( and broken ) down . Others were dissenting moderates , trying to goad candidates to speak more explicitly on the issues . <P> The overall effect , however , was not the stimulation of fuller debate . The hecklers ' chief accomplishment was generally to disrupt meetings and render the candidates momentarily speechless . Wallace alone found a use for the barrackers . He pointed to long-haired protesters as " anarchists , " as exemplars of the breakdown of order and respect . When the hecklers booed , Wallace bowed and blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , adding that he needed the hecklers ; silence caused him to flub his lines more than once . But late in the campaign he ran into a reverse form of hectoring . Lank-haired students wearing Wallace buttons cheered him wildly and chanted , " Kill for peace ! " Such demonstrations left him dumfounded . <P> Help for Lincoln . Rowdies are hardly new to American politics . In the 1828 campaign , crowds castigated Andrew Jackson and his wife Rachel as bigamists because her divorce from her first husband was not final when they married . To forestall protesters in his bid for the Republican nomination in 1860 , Abraham Lincoln was not above packing the galleries of the Chicago Wigwam with his cheering friends . Ulysses S. Grant 's hopes of a third term as President were thwarted by pro-Garfield hecklers on the convention floor in 1880 . <P> Four years later , Republicans accused Grover Cleveland of siring an illegitimate child , and anti-Cleveland mobs cried derisively : " Ma , ma , where 's my pa ? " , to which Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! " * For all that , presidential candidates in the past were usually spared the ignominy of being heckled to their faces . <P> In other countries , heckling is a sometime thing . The French do not even have a word for it . In Japan , speakers were once measured by their ability to stare protesters down , but heckling has become rare since World War II . Heckling is most common in Britain , where it is something of an art , designed to test a speaker 's combativeness and quickness of wit . Appropriately , the word comes from the Middle English " hekele , " to tease or comb flax , or broadly " to tease with questions . "
