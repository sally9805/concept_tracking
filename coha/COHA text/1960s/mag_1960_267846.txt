THE TRIAL BEGINS ( 128 pp. ) - Abram Tertz , translated by Max Hayward-Pantheon ( $2.95 ) . <P> " Of course there will be a world revolution . . . Let me warm up something for you to eat , " said Granny . <P> In the immemorial unrevolutionary manner of all grannies everywhere , this old Russian woman is giving soothing reassurance to her little grandson Seryozha , who has been developing adolescent doubts about the state religion . They are characters in The Trial Begins , perhaps the most remarkable novel to have come out of Russia since the Revolution 43 years ago . <P> The novel , really a philosophical fable , is an unusual book on several counts . The author , fortunately for him . is unknown . " Abram Tertz , " his pseudonym , is the name of the Jewish hero of a ballad that passed the rounds in Moscow during the wave of anti-Jewish propaganda officially stirred up over the fake " Doctors ' Plot " against Stalin 's life in 1952 . The book 's manuscript was smuggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France . <P> The story 's narrator purports to be a ditchdigger in the Kolyma River forced-labor camp , which has been almost empty since a recent amnesty- " only some 10,000 of us , dangerous criminals , were left . " With bitter irony , he professes to have flushed the torn-up manuscript of his book down the toilet . It was recovered and pieced together only through the diligence and ingenuity of Tolya and Vitya , two secret policemen , members of " the dread invisible army , " who have invented a special sewer-searching technique for screening the citizenry 's most private acts . <P> Cancer Sticks . The Trial Begins is classed as " socialist surrealism ' ' by the editors of Encounter , where it first appeared in English last January . The label is just . Part of the complex plot is focused on Marina , a Bolshy bitch who is married to Globov , a public prosecutor , and model of Soviet Russia 's successful man ; she is also probably the mistress of Karlinsky , the philosophizing public defender . Marina procures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her figure . Mad with rage when his wife brutally tells him of this , Globov smashes everything in their apartment-only one birthday present , a bust of " The One . " " The Master " ( i.e. , Stalin ) , being miraculously preserved . In revenge , Globov sends a doctor he suspects of having performed the abortion to the Kolyma River forced-labor camp . Actually , in a satirical parallel to the " Doctors ' Plot , " Rabinovich is innocent . <P> With great skill and economy , Author " Tertz " evokes the gruesome private life of the Soviet Organization Man . At a dinner , some MVDs are relaxing . " The more they drank , the less they talked . Other people in their cups shouted and brawled , but these , with every glass and every bottle , sank deeper into immobility and silence . . . Globov liked these people-kindly men of whom perhaps half the world was terrified . . . How deluded was the mercenary Western press whose scribblers portrayed these men as somber villains . In reality they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , employed in cases of the utmost gravity , used his leisure knitting gloves and embroidering doilies . . . "
