When one prizefighter hits another in the head , his objective is to render the opponent temporarily unconscious by a simple concussion , which usually leaves no permanent damage . But a hard blow can also bruise the brain , breaking some of its blood vessels and destroying nerve cells . This kind of damage can kill . The death in Manhattan last week of Benny ( " Kid " ) Paret , 25 , after nine days in a coma , from brain injuries suffered in his world championship bout with Emile Griffith , underscored the charge that " in boxing , the aim is to maim . " <P> The medical mechanics of head injuries and knockouts in boxing are complex . A welterweight like Griffith delivers a punch with an average force of 10 foot-pounds of kinetic energy . What this force does to a fighter 's head depends not only on how and where the blow strikes but on the position of the struck head and the state of the supporting neck muscles . <P> Inner Bruises . If a fighter is alert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin tucked in , he can take many full-force punches to the head with relatively little risk of brain injury . Only rarely does an exceptionally powerful blow to the chin break or unhinge the lower jaw and drive bony structures back to damage the lower part of the brain . <P> If the fighter has his head a bit higher and less securely anchored by his neck muscles , a severe blow to practically any part of the head will make the skull move in the direction of the punch . The jelly-like brain does not accelerate as fast as the rigid skull , so part of the brain is in effect struck by bone . Usually the effect is no worse than that produced when any fleshy part of the body is hit with a hard object : a bruise , from the breaking of minute blood vessels . A long succession of moderate contusions ( bruises ) , which cause slow , leaky hemorrhages , may permanently damage small parts of the brain , causing the " punch-drunk " state in veteran pugilists . <P> Broken Vessels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck muscles are relaxed , so his head can bounce like a punching bag on a spring . Such was the case with the groggy Paret on the ropes in the twelfth . With a trip-hammer succession of alternating right uppercuts and left hooks , Griffith slammed Paret 's head from side to side . Different parts of Paret 's brain were hit by the overlying skull with enough force to break blood vessels between the middle ( arachnoid ) and outermost ( dura mater ) layers of the brain 's covering ( meninges ) . The resulting accumulations of blood and clots ( called hematomas ) , together with multiple bruises and severe swelling , exerted intolerable pressure on several parts of Paret 's brain and cut the elaborate circuitry of the nervous system at a number of points . He would have fallen , which might have saved his life , but <P> Griffith 's punches helped to hold him up . When neurosurgeons got to Paret , they drilled holes in his skull and removed as many hematomas as they could reach , but it was too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the pressure of the hematomas had crushed too much of the brain 's structure and killed too many of its delicate , irreparable nerve cells .
