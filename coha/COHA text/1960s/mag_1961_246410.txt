As if rehearsing his invective for the big Party Congress , Nikita Khrushchev chose U.S. Senator Margaret Chase Smith as target for Moscow 's crudest and weirdest verbal blockbuster of the week . What angered the Russian was Republican Smith 's Sept. 21 Senate speech chiding Democrat John F. Kennedy for " turning to emphasis on conventional weapons " when the U.S. needs to increase its nuclear superiority over Russia . Khrushchev 's reply went to Britain 's former Defense Minister Emanuel Shinwell and 58 other Labor M.P.s who had urged Russia to stop nuclear testing . <P> Roared Nikita : " Who can remain calm and indifferent to such provocative statements made in the United States Senate by this woman , blinded by savage hatred toward the community of Socialist countries ? " Shrilly , Nikita went on , " It is hard to believe how a woman , if she is not the devil in disguise , can make such a malicious man-hating appeal . She should understand that in the fire of nuclear war millions of people would perish , including her own children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tigress even , worries about her cubs , licks and pities them . " <P> Back home in Maine , Senator Smith , a childless widow , shrugged off the blast , suggested , " Mr. Khrushchev is angry because American officials have grown more firm since my speech . " But Laborite Shinwell was sorry that the U.S. took so little heed of Moscow 's noise , commented , " Although Khrushchev makes a slashing attack on Americans in his letter , he emphasizes that he wants peace . I am convinced he means it if we will play ball with him . "
