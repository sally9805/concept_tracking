txt The Gary teachers union called a strike early today against 45 Gary public schools , beginning Monday , over the Gary school board 's refusal to recognize the union as bargaining agent for 1,300 Gary teachers . The strike declaration was issued by officials of local 4 of the union after school board officials failed to answer a union ultimatum with a midnight deadline . Charles Smith , president of the union , said the local would go on strike if the school board did not recognize the union by that time .
