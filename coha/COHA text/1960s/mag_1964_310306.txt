SOUTHEAST ASIA <P> In Hawaii this week , on the President 's orders , Dean Rusk , Robert McNamara and Maxwell Taylor will sit down once again with top U.S. diplomats and soldiers to discuss the deteriorating situation in Southeast Asia . Lyndon Johnson obviously wants to avoid any drastic action until after the elections , but events may not permit such delay . In the growing debate about what to do , what are the alternatives ? <P> Neutralization <P> Some prominent U.S. voices are convinced that the military commitment in Viet Nam should never have been taken over by the U.S. from the defeated French and must now be liquidated as soon as possible , at almost any cost . Columnist Walter Lippmann , for one , thinks that an honorable and perhaps successful way out lies in Charles de Gaulle 's proposal for neutralization . Though never spelled out by De Gaulle , this would mean a negotiated peace under auspices of the U.N . or of a renewed Geneva conference , to strengthen by international guarantees the vows made-and since broken-in the original 1954 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mansfield , George McGovern and others , who see defeat and humiliation for the U.S. as the only fruits of continued fighting in South Viet Nam . <P> Proponents of neutralization do not deny that , at the very least , it would increase Chinese " influence " in the area ; as the University of Chicago 's Hans Morgenthau argues , this influence has always existed and can not be prevented short of a head-on war with China , and perhaps not even then . But some believe that a neutralized South Viet Nam would encourage North Vietnamese Premier Ho Chi Minh to become a kind of Tito in the shadow of Red China . In one view , expressed by Asian Expert Bernard Fall , Ho Chi Minh is afraid of U.S. air strikes , which could destroy his struggling economy , and if suitably threatened he would accept a neutral , more or less independent South Viet Nam . <P> <P> Most neutralization advocates , however , agree that at present the Communists are doing so well in South Viet Nam that the U.S. could n't get neutralization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve the military situation . This means , in effect , urging the South Vietnamese , not to mention the American " advisers , " to fight and die with only an uncertain neutrality as the declared prize-a dubious war aim , to say the least . On balance , the State Department and Pentagon are convinced that any agreement to neutralize Southeast Asia , even if one would be concluded , could not be enforced . It would be , in Dean Rusk 's words , " a formula for surrender " merely a cover for Red infiltration and eventual Communization of all Viet Nam , which has been the clear Communist purpose ever since Laos was " neutralized " in 1962 . <P> <P> Withdrawal
