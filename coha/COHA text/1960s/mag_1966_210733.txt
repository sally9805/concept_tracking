Harper &; Row . $5.95 . <P> <P> For 30 years , along the course of a newspaper career that carried him to the copy desk of the Cleveland Plain Dealer , Robert Manry nourished a secret dream . In 1958 he paid $160 for a sailing hull rotted by age and neglect . Repaired , refitted and baptized on fresh-water shakedown cruises , Tinkerbelle slipped her moorings at Falmouth , Mass. , on June 1 , 1965 . Seventy-eight days and 3,200 miles later , the 13-ft. sloop touched shore in Falmouth , England , the smallest sailing craft ever known to have crossed the Atlantic . <P> <P> Manry is the most unprepossessing sort of adventurer .

To the adventurer , the climax was the saddest part of the voyage . " Only twelve miles to go , " he tells Tinkerbelle , whom he regarded throughout as " my dearest companion , " and then he adds : " The thought brought on a faint stabbing of pain .
