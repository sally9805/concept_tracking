ARMED FORCES <P> ( See Cover ) <P> Deep in " Indian country , " the Viet Cong 's jungled heartland , a lone U.S. helicopter flapped furiously down on an abandoned dirt roadway . Even before the Huey hit the ground , its six passengers were out and running . Their faces streaked with camouflage paint , their black and green " tiger suits " blending into the foliage , their black-stocked M-16 automatic rifles at the ready , they faded swiftly into the perennial twilight of 80-ft. trees , impenetrable bamboo thickets , and tangles of thorn and " wait a minute " vines . This was " Lurp Team Two , " a long-range reconnaissance patrol ( LRRP ) of the 173rd Airborne Brigade , sent to seek out two Viet Cong regiments that their outfit was itching to locate , engage and destroy . Within moments , Team Two was itself in imminent danger of destruction . <P> It did not take long for the patrol to discover that it had landed smack in the midst of a Viet Cong concentration . As skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle warfare , Team Two soon realized that the enemy was following its every move . Each time Staff Sergeant Glide Brown Jr . halted his men , they could hear a couple of footfalls close behind-and then a bristling silence . As the jungle dusk deepened into blackness , Brown set up a defense perimeter and listened more closely . Above the keening of insects , geckos and night birds , he heard the snap of two fingers and the snick of a rifle bolt not 30 yards away . " We 're getting out of here , " he whispered . " They 're just behind us . " <P> Linked up head and tail like circus elephants by their " escape ropes , " each humping half a hundredweight of gear , * the muzzles of their rifles still taped to keep out gunk , the scouts took advantage of distant artillery salvos to mask their footfalls on the way back to a prearranged retrieval zone . Brown , in the lead , groped his way back through the blackness by memorizing the map and counting his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 67 times , he calculated the team had covered 100 meters . Back at the landing zone , Brown 's whispered message filtered into the PRC transceiver : " Four seven , this is Papa Two . I 'm in trouble . This is Papa Two . . . " No reply . The triple-tiered jungle canopy drowned his call to the pickup helicopter . Brown moved his men soundlessly across the clearing and set up a radial defense-each man flat on his back , head to the center of the circle , his M-16 ready-behind a tangle of fallen trees . <P> Hanging Tough . Team Two measured the passage of the night in careful inhalations , silent exhalations , and the clack of bamboo signal sticks used by the Viet Cong patrols that passed within 50 feet of its hideout . Then , at 2 a.m. , a single shot blasted the night : Brown 's radio man , shifting his M16 , had accidentally triggered a tracer round - almost certainly disclosing the team 's position . Brown hung tough , hoping that the cross-wave of jungle echoes would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn the team moved back in to hunt out the Viet Cong base camp . <P> Only after Brown had spotted a concentration of black pajamas did Team Two withdraw . As enemy sniper bullets stitched around and between them , the scouts blasted back with fragmentation grenades and bursts of automatic fire that chopped
