Philosophers are seldom in the head lines , yet they are often the true revolutionaries of some succeeding age . Karl Marx blueprinted the political upheavals of the 20th century in the reading room of the British Museum ; Soren Kierkegaard 's fiery polemics , scorned by the sturdy burghers of Copenhagen , are the foundation of existentialism . Today , a number of Roman Catholic intellectuals believe that a little-known thinker of commensurate stature has been patiently laying some philosophical land mines for the future . He is Canadian Jesuit Bernard Joseph Francis Lonergan , 60 , whose followers assert that history may reckon him a mind to rank with Aquinas and Newman . <P> Some reasons for their enthusiasm are argued in the latest issue of Continuum , a lively , intellectual quarterly sponsored by Saint Xavier College in Chicago . The 244-page issue is devoted to analyses of Lonergan 's work , including articles by English Jesuit Frederick Copleston , historian of philosophy , and by two of the nation 's most theologically astute Catholic laymen : Continuum 's Editor Justus George Lawler and Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " cognitional structure . " <P> The Nature of Knowing . Lonergan is not an easy thinker to appreciate . His dense , elliptical prose , studded with references to Thomas Aquinas and modern physics , makes its points in a methodical and mind-wearying manner . One typical passage hammers home a conclusion with : " In the thirty-first place . . . " Another problem is Lonergan 's disinterest in hurrying his ideas into print , or giving them wide circulation . Many of his most important lectures exist only in Latin mimeographed notes made by his students ; like the late Ludwig Wittgenstein of Cambridge , his reputation rests on the memories and convictions of his peers , a scattering of essays and book reviews , and one authentically towering masterpiece : a study of human understanding , called Insight , published in 1957 . <P> Lonergan has written or lectured on subjects as varied as economic ethics , the philosophy of education and the spiritual meaning of the family . But his primary intellectual task has been the analysis of two dry epistemological problems-the nature of knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an age of verbal confusion , in which different disciplines find it frustrating to communicate with one another . Both problems , essentially , are philosophic ones that Theologian Lonergan undertook to solve partly out of pedagogical necessity . He found it impossible to teach theology correctly without first establishing a viable underlying philosophy , which led him in turn to consider the fundamental question : What does it mean to know ?
