Other space news of the week : <P> At Fort Eustace , Va . a helmeted engineer from Bell Aerosystems Co. leaped a truck with a " rocket belt . " With 100 lbs . of tanks , tubes and nozzles strapped to his back , he began his flight by flexing his knees and turning a valve . With an earsplitting racket , superheated steam from decomposing hydrogen peroxide jetted out of two down-pointed nozzles and slowly lifted him off the ground . In a 15-sec. flight he cleared the Army truck and made a perfect two-foot landing 150 ft. from his takeoff . The Army , which is paying for Bell 's Rocket Belt , is still uncertain about its military value on earth , but Bell spokesmen see a grand future for it when the U.S. has colonized the moon , where gravitation has only one-sixth of its strength on earth . By releasing a few bursts of steam , rocket-belted colonists will soar easily over the moon 's scratchy topography . In fact , a Bell man cautioned , they will have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Long concerned with the U.S. kitchen , engineers of Whirlpool Corp . ( dishwashers , freezers ) escaped into deepest space . Worried that dull food during long journeys may drive astronauts dotty , Whirlpool last week was busy testing a space kitchen designed to serve Swiss steak , baked ham , filet of sole , cakes , cookies and other goodies out of gleaming bins and refrigerators . There will be three electric ovens ; from nozzles hot and cold water will spurt into collapsible tubes containing dehydrated coffee or fruit juice , so that the weightless spacemen can drink by squeezing the liquids into their mouths . Built under Air Force contract , the Space Kitchen weighs 818 lbs. , of which only 236 lbs . is food . But as of now , there is no rocket big enough to launch a kitchen-equipped spaceship . <P> " What will be done , " asked scientists of Aerojet-General Corp. , " with the body of a man who dies on a space voyage ? " Answering their own question , they pointed out that " there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The coldest scientific efficiency would be to place the corpse in the spaceship 's ' digester ' system . However , the digester system will be one that receives all of the astronauts ' waste materials and regenerates them as food and water . So disposing of the cadaver in this way would simply be too revolting because of the cannibalistic implications . Thus the most palatable solution at this point seems to be a space version of a ' burial at sea . ' After suitable rites , the dead astronaut would be simply pushed out into space . And there , because of the vacuum and the intensity of the sun 's heat , his body would eventually evaporate and vanish into the vastness of space . "
