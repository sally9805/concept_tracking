txt FOCUS on Britain What 's ahead ... Britain is staring harder than ever before at the state of its defenses . This defense stocktaking  --  perhaps the most soul-searching in British history  --  will be finished sometime next year . Whatever emerges is likely to impact profoundly on Britain 's role " east of Suez . " That there will still be a role is certain . British membership in the Commonwealth solders it firmly to the future of several African and Asian nations , Australia , and New Zealand . And the basic safety of several governments  --  Singapore , for one  --  hinges directly on British muscle in Asia . But the Labor government thinks Britain has tried to be more ambitious than its economic prospects permit , It has been a nuclear power , a European power , and a global power . Some of these roles are bound to be scaled back . If they are n't , defense expenditures will never fit into the ? 2-billion budget limit Prime Minister Harold Wilsun has set for defenses by 1970 . Queen Elizabeth next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Britain . It is also one of the most advanced of its kind in the world . It is the Loch Awe project in Argyllshire , Scotland . This Loch Awe monster will store electricity by storing water . A giant darn has been built more than 1,000 feet up Ben Cruachan . And the basin between the ben 's several peaks has been turned into a lake . At night , when demand for electricity is low and good power would otherwise go to waste , water will be pumped up from Loch Awe to the storage lake behind the darn . Then when everybody at once needs power the flow will be reversed , generating enough to answer all needs . The whole project cost ? 24 million ( $67.2 million ) . The Queen will turn on the power Oct. 15 . Trends .. . Top British officials think Anglo-American relations have never been more cozy ? at least not in peacetime . London and Washington agree in general terms on many things  --  Vietnam , India-Pakistan , the UN , arms control . Opposite numbers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two nations do n't agree on everything , of course . Britain favors letting Communist China in the UN . The United States does n't . Britain even trades with Communist Cuba . But basically British leaders view themselves now as very much " Atlantic-motivated. " 0 While drinking in this good feeling westward , Britain is at the same time looking optimistically eastward . British Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart has just been in Poland . Before the summer holidays he touched down in Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia . In December he intends to go to Moscow for all-around talks with high Soviet officials . Minister of State George Thompson will soon journey to Romania and Bulgaria . These arc all low-keyed overtures to better British relations with the nations of Eastern Europe . Talk so far has centered mostly on trade , cultural relations , tourism , and setting up of new consulates . But discussion has also lapped over to world affairs  --  Vietnam , India , China , and disarmament . Such contacts were unthinkable in Stalin 's day . Britons view them as a foot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ... The British Government 's latest effort to cope with its land problems is n't the first and wo n't be the last . This time the government wants to levy a heavy tax on land profits . It also proposes a national land commission endowed with powers of compulsory purchase . The scheme is already under heavy fire from several sides . Socialists want complete nationalization of land  --  But the proposals fall short of that . Conservatives do n't want nationalization  --  but they see the land commission as the start of a slow creep in that direction . And the Liberals do n't think the commission can do anything but muddy the picture . The big rubs are high land prices and profits . Land is limited , but growth is n't and prices keep soaring . Then speculators get in on the profits bonanza . They snatch up wasteland at low prices and sit on it until it is rezoned , then sell it for a neat profit .                  @ @ @
