As astronomers probe outward in space , they are looking backward in time , because the light that they see from very distant objects started its journey millions of years ago . They see the light from stars that no longer exist , and chart strange , starlike objects that could hold the secret of how the universe began . Quasars ( for quasi-stellar radio sources ) are the most intriguing of these objects , the oldest and most brilliant things in the observable universe , and the sources of powerful and mysterious radio waves . Now astronomers have identified a new class of quasi-stellar objects shining out of the past . <P> These are quasi-stellar blue galaxies - sort of quasi-quasars . Caltech 's Dr. Allan Sandage described them in the Astrophysical Journal last week , adding that he suspected them of being " very distant , superbright galaxies reaching more than halfway to the horizon of the universe . " Like quasars , they resemble stars , are up to 100 times as bright as an ordinary galaxy , and are receding from earth at tremendous speeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Spectral Patterns . For years , astronomers observed objects known as " blue stars " - stars that are so hot that a large part of the light they give is blue . While studying quasars with the Palomar telescope , Sandage got interested in the blue stars , and he found that a number of them seemed to be " interlopers " among the quasars . Those closest to earth , he discovered , are the familiar blue stars . But some of those fainter than 14.5 magnitude are remarkably similar to quasars . When photographed with blue filters , they show an excess of ultraviolet energy , which is a characteristic of quasars . <P> The speed at which the blue objects travel is the most convincing proof of their great distance from earth : under the expanding-universe theory , the faster an object recedes from the earth , the farther away it is . Using spectroscopic techniques perfected by Dr. Maarten Schmidt , a Caltech colleague , Sandage and Schmidt analyzed three of these objects , and found that they were moving away from the earth at tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object ) seems to be speeding at the rate of 125,000 miles a second , making it second only to quasar 3C-9 ( 149,000 miles a second ) as the most distant known object . The spectral patterns also showed a presence of ionized carbon atoms that have been detected previously only in the most distant quasars . The blue objects probably outnumber quasars 500 to 1 and are scattered throughout the universe-the nearest one being " 20 million light-years from earth . <P> Measuring Rods . Like quasars , Sandage 's objects create more questions than answers . Do they represent the next evolutionary step after quasars ? Will they give clues to some violent cosmic explosions of eons ago ? Sandage suspects that they are galaxies in their early phases of life . " We have no idea yet what the two kinds of quasi-stellars may lead to , " he concedes . " We do know that they provide us with the long-sought keys to determine the size and shape of the universe .
