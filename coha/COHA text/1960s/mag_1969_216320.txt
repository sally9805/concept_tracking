Because a foreman dared to turn on an oil valve , 22 toolsetters from a rival union recently stalked out of Britain 's Girling company , a large manufacturer of brakes . That started a disastrous chain reaction . For lack of brakes , automobile companies had to close several plants and lay off thousands of workers . Ford Motor Co. , Ltd. , alone lost an esti mated $50 million in sales during the four weeks that the walkout lasted . <P> Such piddling labor disputes badly disrupt Britain 's fragile economy and damage its drive to strengthen the pound by raising exports . Last week strikes crippled several key exporters , including a shipbuilder and two automakers , Rootes and Jaguar . Worse still , a squabble over union representation threatened to cripple the country 's steel industry . Amid all that acrimony , public debate raged over a new government White Paper on labor policy , fittingly titled " In Place of Strife . " Issued by Barbara Castle , the fiery Minister of Employment and Productivity , the paper committed Harold Wilson 's Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more power to intervene in the nation 's labor relations . <P> No Alcohol . Mrs. Castle , 57 , a lifelong Socialist and welfare-state evangelist , seems well suited to talk tough to trade unionists . The petite wife of Ted Castle , political editor of the Sun , a national daily , she can be a rugged infighter . In her former position as Minister of Transport , she pushed through legislation empowering police to give " Breathalyser " tests to drunken-driving suspects . That enraged British pub owners , who introduced " the bloody Barbara , " a drink consisting of tomato juice and tonic-but no alcohol . <P> In campaigning for the first basic labor reform in 60 years , Mrs. Castle is up against harder foes than pub owners or irate drivers . The problem of overlapping unions-there are 35 in the British auto industry , 16 in steel-leads to endless jurisdictional disputes . It also forces employers to bargain with many competing unions simultaneously and makes industry-wide negotiations almost impossible . Remarkably , unions are not bound by the agreements that they sign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court injunctions to forestall even the most outrageous strikes . As a result , more than 90% of Britain 's strikes are called not by union leaders but by disgruntled workers . <P> Secret Vote . To bring some sense out of this anarchy , the White Paper would empower the government to 1 ) order a union to hold a secret vote when a major strike is threatened , 2 ) delay walkouts by ordering a 28-day " conciliation pause " and 3 ) impose settlements in jurisdictional disputes that union leaders are unable to resolve among themselves . Trade unionists who defy a government order would be subject to fines . On the other hand , the paper turned down the plea of management groups that all labor contracts should be made legally binding . <P> Mrs. Castle 's recipe will probably be enacted by Parliament with little change early next year . Politicians realize that most Britons are heartily tired of industrial strife . A poll by the Sunday Times showed that two-thirds of the country 's union members also strongly favor basic labor reforms .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
