Nearly 300 college presidencies in the U.S. are vacant this year-which suggests that the nation desperately needs a pool of skilled academic administrators . In the past , the grooming of college chief executives has often owed as much to chance as choice-a reluctant professor unexpectedly does well when his department 's revolving chairmanship is thrust upon him , a dean displays a special talent for public relations or fund raising , a learned Government official wants an academic post . <P> One promising way of taking the guesswork out of presidential promotions is the internship program sponsored by the American Council on Education . Seeking out aspiring administrators on practically every U.S. campus , the A.C.E. every year sends up to 45 of them to another school as assistants to a top college administrator . There , the interns spend a year shadow-boxing with the problems of their hosts , taking a detailed look at how another campus operates-and incidentally enjoying more study time than they are likely to have again in their career . <P> <P> Open Doors . Most interns spend their first weeks totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sister Mary Christopher Steele , assistant to the president of Detroit 's Mercy College and now interning at Colorado College , that means at least one lengthy committee meeting a day plus in-depth interviews with upperclassmen fighting low mid-term grades . Associate Speech Professor Thomas Fernandez of Illinois ' Monmouth College , on the run consulting with one administrator after another at Atlanta 's Emory University , says : " I have n't encountered one single door closed to me . " <P> <P> After orientation , interns spend their time trying to solve the same kind of administrative puzzles that constantly occupy their bosses . Boston University 's John Cartwright , assistant to a student affairs dean , already has persuaded students at the University of California 's Santa Cruz campus to get off " the top of this hill " and help tutor the area 's high school pupils from culturally deprived areas . Sister Mary Christopher surveyed student rights on 20 campuses as an aid to a Colorado College committee assigned to draft a student rights bill . Air Force Academy Associate Professor George H. Janczewski , assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budgeted the host school 's international programs in New Zealand . <P> <P> Most interns agree on the value of close association with experienced administrators . Billy Mac Jones , special assistant to the president of tiny Angelo State College in Texas , reviews issues at the University of Colorado with his mentor , Student Affairs Vice President Glenn Barnett , then bets him a Coca-Cola on the outcome . After ten weeks of forecasting , Jones is only two Cokes in the hole . Janczewski thinks of himself as " a working member of the provost 's department , " but echoes a majority of his fellow interns when he admits : " I can make mistakes for which I am not responsible .
