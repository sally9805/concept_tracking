txt The end of the tax-paying season in the United States may mean good news for the public : Lower interest rates on borrowing money and lower mortgage rates on buying homes . For bankers the Monday-midnight deadline marks the end of their yearly cycle of lending money to cover tax payments . And with savings now pouring into banks at a rapid rate , top Federal Reserve System officials expect bankers to start at once looking around for likely investments . Ever since the tight-money squeeze last August , banks have been supercautious in making new loans . So far this year many have been building up their liquidity again by acquiring assets that can be turned quickly into cash . But the Fed has been pumping new money into the banking system so fast that it disturbs even some economists . Its aim , of course , is to stimulate business expansion by providing the needed financing . The prime interest rate  --  the one which bankers charge their best customers  --  could soon come down again . Less cheering to the consumer is the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pay on time and savings deposits . This is a major bank expense . Keeping America beautiful has become a serious concern of the packaging and container industry . Executives are concerned that if the industry does n't do more to alleviate the growing litter problem , the government will . Trying to educate the public through antilitter advertising , they feel , is not enough . William May , chief executive officer of American Can Company , has a radical new proposal . What he has in mind are containers which , after being used , would just fade away . He suggests forming a packaging materials research council composed of the industry 's top scientific talent . It would stimulate research into materials which would serve as containers yet would deteriorate rapidly after contents were emptied . He hopes this would replace the industry 's present trend toward containers  --  such as aluminum cans and nonreturnable bottles  --  that are easily disposable but may mar the landscape for years . Great Britain 's " Texas-under-water " ( its great natural gas field in the North Sea ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flow . Householders are hoping for a fall in the price of gas . And toward the end of summer heating equipment firms expect a dramatic lift in production and sales . If the price can be kept down  --  the government is bargaining toughly with oil companies concerned to ensure a low delivered price  --  areas in need of further industrial development , such as northeast England and central Scotland , can expect an added boost from this new influx of fuel . ? How and why . . . British firms are less productive than similar American firms . Why ? If the question could be effectively answered , one of Britain 's major economic problems could be solved . The latest group to seek the answer is the British chemical industry . A working party it sent to the United States reports that Britain 's chemical industry employs three times as many men in relation to output as the American industry . It concludes that the main factor in the far higher productivity in the United States is scale : A bigger market , bigger production units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intensive management efforts to reduce costs ; greater readiness to use labor-saving equipment , particularly in materials handling ; 2.5 times greater capital investment per man ; better career prospects offered to working people ; and less class distinction ? even between office staff and other employees . ca Among its various stockpiles the United States Government counts a giant surplus of $8 billion worth of quinine . Recent disclosures that 8.7 million ounces of it were sold to a foreign cartel has forced a sharp crackdown on further sales . What stung the government most is the fact that a Dutch cartel pressured the State Department into selling the quinine at 21.5 cents an ounce when it was carried on government books at 63 cents an ounce . Then the cartel turned around and sold it on the American market at $2 an ounce . Now State Department officials concede that other foreign cartels have approached it with plans for buying and distributing surplus commodities . They have been turned down . ?                  @ @ @
