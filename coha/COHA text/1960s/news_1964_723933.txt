The threat arises ? as the president of the International Brother " - hood of Teamsters goes on trial in Chicago today on Federal charges of misusing $20 million in union pension reserves . John J. O'Rourke of New York , an international vice president , has formally asked that no more money for Hoffa 's defense be spent from the union treasury , pending a meeting of the full executive board . He acted after Edward Bennett Williams , the Teamsters ' general counsel , had informed him that it would be illegal to use union funds to pay for Hoffa 's lawyers and court expenses . Mr. O'Rourke made his depand in a telegram sent Saturiday to John F. English , the Associated Press Edward Bennett Williams union 's secretary-treasurer , at ' its headquarters in Washington . ) The union spent nearly $1 million on legal charges last year , with much of it going to defend Hoffa .

His only conviction came this year when he vas sentenced to eight years in a Federal penitentiary for jury-tampering . He has announced his determination to appeal the conviction to the Supreme Court , At the union 's 1961 convention in Miami Beach , Hoffa sponsored a change in the constitution under which the union was specifically authorized to pay all the costs for defending its officers . His salary is $75,000 annually with unlimited expenses . Broad Authorization The authorization covered an action in which a majority of the executive board decided that the charges were unfounded , politically motivated or " filed in bad faith in an attempt to embarrass or destroy the union or the union officer . " An auxiliary clause made the grant of authority even broader . It said payment could be made Whenever a majority of the board " in its sole discretion determines that the expenditures should be made . " The present conflict over whether the union should keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all 15 members of the executive board two weeks ago by 12 rank-and-file members of Philadelphia Local 107 . They noted that the membership had never received formal notice of the adoption of a board resolution permitting the spending of union funds to pay Hoffa 's legal bills . They contended that such payments violated the Landrum-Griffin Act , Curbby Congress in 1959 to t urb union racketeering . Recovery of Money i The insurgents demanded that no more union funds be pent and that the board members take immediate steps to recover all the money previously llocated . They emphasized that heir letter was intended as a Request for action under the fiduciary responsibilities imfsed on the union officers by ction 501b of the Landrumriffin Act . This section makes union officials personally liable to suit The New York Times John J. O'Rourke for damages if they fail to respond promptly to . a request that they recover money from other officials accused of abusing positions of trust in their organizations . " You are notified , " the Philadelphians told the board mem-. bers , " that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable time , we shall institute- suit to . enjoin further payments and to recover payments already made on behalf of the international union . " The effectiveness of the letter was enhanced by the board members ' knowledge that a proceeding of just this type in Local 107 had resulted in a Federal court order that . aymond Cohen , its former secretarytreasurer , and two other local officers return $24,921 in legal expenses paid out of the local 's treasury . The money had been used to defend Cohen against charges of conspiring to cheat and defraud the union . Conference Call Made The restitution order was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals , and the Supreme Court recently refused ' to review it . The letter from the Philadelphia rebels led Hoffa - to arrange a telephone meeting of the executive board , through a conference call , on Friday . According to Mr. O'Rourke , the union president said he intended to seek on opinion from a judge or some other " disinterested party " outside the union 's regular legal staff on whether there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several board members -- among them Mr.O'ROurke , - Thomas E. Flynn , president of the union 's Eastern Conference of Teamsters ; and Murray W. Miller , president of the Southern ? Confefence of Teamsters ? asked why outside guidance was needed when- Mr. Williams was available . Hoffa 's reply Was that he had already been assured by Mr. Williams and all the rest of the organization 's legal staff that there was no statutory barrier to continued payments . Shortly after the telephone meeting ended , Mr. O'Rourke got a call from Mr. Williams contradicting the Hoffa statement . He said he had told the union president that the use of union money would be illegal , whereupon Hoffa cursed and slammed down the receiver . Custodian of Treasury . On the basis of the Williams call , Mr. O'Rourke sent his telegram to Mr. English as custodian of the union 's $40 million treasury . It said : " Based on a telephonic communication on April 24 , 1964 , from General Counsel Williams advising me that use of union funds for the defense of General President Hoff a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is illegal , I request a prompt meeting of the general executive board with personal attendance of General Counsel Williams and pending such meeting I request that no union funds be used for such purpose . " The Chattanooga trial was the one in which Hoffa was convicted of jury-tampering . It stemmed from an earlier trial in Nashville , at which a jury failed to reach a verdict on charges that Hoffa , had accepted $1 million in payoffs from a trucking concern to insure labor peace . - Strained Relations Relations between the Teamster chief and Mr. Williams have become increasingly strained in recent years . Mr. Williams successfully defended Hoffa in his first major trial in 1957 , when he was- accused of bribing an ' investigator for the McClellan investigating committee of the United States Senate . Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy , then the committee 's chief : counsel , had been so confident Hoffa wouldbe convicted in thii.case , that he offered to jump off the Capitol dome if the-union head went free However , after becoming the union 's general counsel , Mr. Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his many brushes with the law . Last year Hoffa demanded that he resign , but backed away from a test when Mr. Williams insisted on a secret vote by the executive board .
