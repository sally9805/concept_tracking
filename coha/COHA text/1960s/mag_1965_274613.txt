The Ikeya-Seki comet may have seemed a dud to casual observers who were screened from its spectacular passage by assorted weather conditions . It was by no means a disappointment to astronomers . Never before has a comet undergone such detailed scientific scrutiny-from observatories around the world , from specially outfitted jet planes , from NASA 's sounding rockets . <P> Five times as luminous as a full moon , Ikeya-Seki lived up to its advance billing as one of the brightest comets of the century . Japanese astronomers boast that they snapped the clearest daylight pictures ever taken of a comet . Because of its close brush with the sun , Ikeya-Seki heated to an intensity that was easily recorded in detail by spectrographs , which gave scientists their strongest evidence so far of comet ingredients . Preliminary readings have already detected sodium , ionized calcium , iron , nickel , copper and potassium . Last week James Westfall , a young Caltech scientist , reported that his infrared observations of Ikeya-Seki were probably the first ever made of a comet . He is certain that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected sunlight . Analysis of this data should give scientists a better understanding of the structure and composition of comets . <P> Ikeya-Seki is now more than 55 mil lion miles away from the sun and gradu ally disappearing from sight . Early risers in the U.S. may still catch a glimpse at about an hour before sunrise if they look in the southeastern sky , above and to the right of where the sun rises . But it will be 500 to 1,000 years before Ikeya-Seki comes back into range and allows a check on current observations .
