txt While quietly planning his own future , which may well include a bid for the presidency in four years , Sen. Edmund S. Muskie philosophically ponders the ebb and flow of power at the national level . ? Looking at Vietnam the Maine DemocraticSenator sees a sharply rising hope for peace'with the advent of the Nixon administration : " The very fact that a new administration is coming in is bound to make a change in the prospect in Paris . " The Senator , in a Capitol interview , said that " immediately after Jan. 20 will be the maximum opportunity for the new administration to have a favorable impact toward movement in Paris . " Of the Johnson administration and Vietnam , he adds : " I do n't see any possibility of the present administration achieving anything substantial at Paris before Jan. 20 . The closer an administration gets to its last days the more swiftly does its power ebb . " ?

He said that he was getting " thousands of letters " encouraging him to make the presidential bid . And he said he was responding by embarking on a large program of speaking engagements in all of the 50 states  --  to know the people and problems better . He wants the public to hear his solutions , too , and , most important , to get to know him better . He said that at no point did he seriously weigh the possibility of running for the Senate-whip post later sought and won by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy . By a staff photographer Sen. Edmund S.
