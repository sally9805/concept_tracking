For the first time since Charles de Gaulle brusquely vetoed British membership in the Common Market two years ago , the master of the Elyse Palace and the occupant of No. 10 Downing Street sat down last weekend in Paris for two days of official talks . Things went surprisingly well , though a mismatch of menus laid canard Rouen on Guest Harold Wilson 's plate for both lunch and dinner one day , first at the Elyse and then at the Quai d'Orsay . Unruffled , Wilson declared the conversations " outspoken , robust and constructive , " and a smiling De Gaulle let it be known on his part that he had been considerably impressed with Wilson 's intellect . <P> <P> Wilson was outspoken about Britain 's determination to defend the pound , and bluntly said that anybody who thought his upcoming budget message would announce devaluation was a " nut case . " Inevitably there was robust disagreement on Viet Nam . Wilson , despite thunder on his left in Parliament for instant negotiations , is adamant about supporting Washington 's Southeast Asian policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a result , explained Wilson afterwards , " we did not waste a lot of time arguing about it . " The Common Market got even shorter shrift , since Wilson and the Labor Party want no part of British membership in the Six as things now stand . <P> <P> By far the most constructive result of the two leaders ' talks was accord on increased cooperation in advanced aircraft and electronics technology . The French and British are already committed to joint production of the Concorde supersonic airliner . The new understanding may well lead to joint work on military aircraft as well , such as a variable-wing attack jet similar to the U.S. 's F-111.
