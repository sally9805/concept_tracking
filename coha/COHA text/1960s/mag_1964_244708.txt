Last week the civil rights filibuster became the longest in Senate history , * and Minnesota Democrat Hubert Humphrey , the bill 's floor manager , was mad . " The whole procedure is disgusting , " he cried . " All that is being accomplished here is a display of adult delinquency . Any intransigent minority can run the Senate if a majority stands around with jelly for a spine . " <P> Humphrey put the blame not on bill-stalling Southerners , whose " obstructionist tactics were to be expected , " but on Senators who profess to support civil rights but are opposed to shutting off the Southerners by cloture . Humphrey demanded that " the Senate start to act like a Senate , and that Senators start to earn their wages , and that Senators abide by the Constitution , which says that a majority shall constitute a quorum to do business . " <P> Even mild Mike Mansfield , the Senate majority leader , was running out of patience . " We are witnessing a travesty on the legislative process , " he snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can not do . " The anger stemmed from what the bill 's supporters considered a broken pledge by the Southern leader , Georgia Democrat Richard Russell . They claimed he had promised to permit votes on more amendments this week . But after a Southern caucus , Russell declared there would be none . In retaliation , Senate leaders announced that the Senate 's working hours would be stretched to midnight . " That does n't scare us , " scoffed Russell . " We 're ready for it . " <P> An Agreement . And all this while , Republican leader Everett Dirksen was calmly and even quietly tidying up a carefully wrapped package of some 40 amendments . He presented them in conferences with Attorney General Robert Kennedy , Justice Department lawyers and Humphrey . Dirksen emerged from one all-day session in his office to announce : " We have a good agreement . " Said Kennedy : " This bill is perfectly satisfactory to me . " Added Humphrey : " We have done nothing to injure the objectives of this bill . " <P> Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloppy wording in the House-passed bill . But some are substantive , aimed at limiting the speed and frequency with which the Attorney General could move into local cases of discrimination . For example , in states that have agencies for handling bias complaints under public accommodations laws , the Federal Government would have to give the state agency at least 30 days to act before initiating federal action . In both public accommodations and fair employment , the Government would have to show that a pattern of discrimination existed before it could move in , but in no case could the Attorney General institute suit on behalf of an individual . To prosecute an employer , the Federal Government would have to prove that his refusal to hire a Negro was " willful " - often a tough matter to pin down in court . 25 Votes . Dirksen plans to discuss his package with Republican Senators this week . Mansfield and Humphrey , also , will present it at a meeting of Democrats . In practical terms , all that really matters is the Republican reaction , since some 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Dirksen can persuade them to go along , there will be a new civil rights law-and it will to a significant degree be Ev Dirksen 's law . <P>
