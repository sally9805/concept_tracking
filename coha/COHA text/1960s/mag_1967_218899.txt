Anticlerical Novelist Roger Peyrefitte scandalized postwar France in 1945 with Les Amitis Particulires , the story of a homosexual love affair between two boys in a Roman Catholic boarding school . As filmed by French Director Jean Delannoy , This Special Friendship turns out to be both poignant and disturbing . Its impact depends not on lubricity-the schoolboy crush at the center of the story is idealistic and unconsummated . It is based on Delannoy 's deft projection of the human agony behind the cry of St. Paul : " For the good that I would I do not : but the evil which I would not , that I do .

Finally the two boys are discovered in a clandestine meeting by a humane priest whose wisdom has been too cramped by his spiritual discipline to foresee the tragedy he triggers . <P> Author Peyrefitte himself attended such a school , but that was half a century ago , and the climate of the church and its education has certainly changed . Even so , there are still forces of righteous striving , self-ignorance and guilt in the world that are capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
