In five uproarious years of nation hood , the Congo has had four Premiers , four civil wars and two constitutions . Its politicians have denounced , arrested and exiled one another , and its government has swung wildly from left to right . All the while , President Joseph Kasavubu has neatly managed to hold onto the nation 's highest office - primarily by nudging aside everyone who could have taken it away from him . Rather than lead the country , charge his critics , Kasavubu just sits on the terrace of the presidential mansion " watching the bodies of his enemies float past in the Congo River below . " Last week who should go floating past but his fourth Premier , Moise Kapenda Tshombe . <P> The reason was simple . Kasavubumust run for the presidency again in February , and Tshombe , the Congo 's most popular politician and the big winner of this spring 's parliamentary elections , was after his job . Despite his unquestioned success as Premier , therefore , Tshombe had to go . " The mission I conferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to a joint session of the new Parliament . " Therefore , out of respect for the habitual rules of democracy and since his government has not resigned on its own initiative , I have today put an end to its functions . " <P> Shocking as it was to many Congolese and Westerners alike , Tshombe 's ouster seemed unlikely to set off another rampage in the Congo . To take his place , Kasavubu named 39-year-old Evariste Kimba , a onetime railroad worker who was Tshombe 's Foreign Minister during the Katanga rebellion and accompanied him into exile in Europe . Kimba 's first steps as Premier were encouraging . " To the Congolese people and to the foreigners in our country , " he announced , " we guarantee peace and security . " Then he invited Tshombe , who still commands the biggest voting bloc in Parliament , to take a leading part in his new coalition Cabinet . <P> Despite his past friendship , Tshombe refused , announced that he would take his Conaco Party into the parliamentary opposition . As opposition leader , calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning Kasavubu 's job in February . Perhaps so , but precedent and the realities of African democracy are against him . Not once has the President of any black African country been defeated at the polls .
