The swollen , scandalous thing sits there , an affront to political morality , economic logic and plain common sense . Truman and Eisenhower each had his turn at " the farm problem , " and each left it worse than he found it . Last week the Kennedy Administration announced its farm plan . <P> For the past eight years , the cost of Government agricultural programs has run between $4 billion and $7 billion , ranking only behind national defense and interest on the national debt as the biggest item in the budget . Kennedy claimed that his program would cut Government costs by many millions . He proposed the most rigorous system of production controls in the history of U.S. farming . And he threatened farmers-and their Congressmen-with what has long been a political unmentionable : greatly reduced price supports , or none at all , in the inconceivable event that they refuse controls . <P> Offensive Burden . The Kennedy program was the product of several minds ( though it is not certain that there will ever be any fight to claim the authorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator , had never been noted for lively interest in agriculture ; in 1956 he voted against high farm subsidies , switched his position only after Farm Belt resentment threatened his national political ambitions . In 1962 , while trying to balance the nation 's budget , he can only view the huge farm burden as offensive . Agriculture Secretary Orville Freeman , a former Governor of Minnesota , had little exposure to farms and farmers , says : " When I became Secretary of Agriculture , I did not pose as a farm expert . I expressed a sincere desire to learn . " A chief author of the Kennedy Administration program was in fact ex-Professor Willard Cochrane , Freeman 's director of agricultural economics , former member of the University of Minnesota faculty , and a farm brain-truster under the Roosevelt and Truman Administrations . <P> " The drift toward a chaotic , inefficient , surplus-ridden farm economy , " said Kennedy in his message to Congress , " will resume unless prompt action is taken . " The Administration claims to have halted that drift last year with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer of subsidies to farmers for cutting their normal acreage of corn or sorghum was intended to cut feed grain production heavily at a cost of about $500 million . Secretary Freeman maintains that the cut amounted to 800 million bushels as planned , but the program 's cost-$768 million-suggests that efficient farmers were able , with the help of unusually good weather , to grow far more than the Government expected . The feed grain carryover dropped for the first time in a decade , but many farm experts claim that the Government paid more for that milestone than it would have paid by buying the surplus grain .
