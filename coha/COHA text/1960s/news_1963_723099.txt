txt Washington President Kennedy has warned the United States that an " economy " cut in the budget of $5 billion would cause a million fewer jobs and might start a downward cycle that would eventually cause " a recession . " The President used his speech before the American Society of Newspaper Editors here to combat the idea that a tax cut should be accompanied by an offsetting cut in federal expenditures . The proposal has been one of the most difficult for the administration to counter . Before the question and answer period , Mr. Kennedy directed the prepared portion of his address to defending federal spending as a balance wheel to the economy . ' Threat Recalled Last year , Mr. Kennedy declared that when private inventory accumulation " suddenly dropped from nearly $7 billion in the first quarter ? . . to $1 billion in the thlid quarter " the American economy " wavered " under the shock , but did not fall . Primary source of " steady strength " in the economy at that time , he argued , was the increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Without referring to New York 's Gov . Nelson A. Rockefeller by name , Mr. Kennedy recalled that " some " this year have advocated keeping federal purchases on a " plateau " to compensate partially for the tax cut . ' ' Typical ' Cases Had this been done , Mr. Kennedy charged , " A recession could not have been avoided . " He said that federal expenditures had been kept on a plateau in 1958 under President Eisenhower , and attributed the recession of that year to the fact , which resulted in a subsequent deficit of $12.5 billion . The Kennedy speech tried to humanize federal spending so that the average man could understand it . The President translated the whole affair into the terms of a statistical abstraction which he called " random village " or a cross-section of 100 typical American citizens . Typical family income in Random Village , he said , would be $5,700 a year , and his proposed tax cut would reduce federal taxes " by about 20 percent . " Local Problems Mr. Kennedy told of the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment of the United States , and of how federal spending permeates the needs . Primarily he pleaded for new programs to improve transportation , schools , parks , and health . For example , he said 24 of the 100 in the " village " are school-age children , but under present averages , only 16 will graduate from high school , only 9 will enter college , and only 4 will graduate . The high school dropouts will find it twice as hard as other citizens to get jobs . Reduction Noted In the " village . " five of those employed will be unemployed at some time during the year , he added . Mr. Kennedy emphasized that much as he approved of such federal aid , the domestic budget actually has been reduced in items other than defense , space , and debt-servicing . Yet " somehow , " he acknowledged , " ' federal spending ' has become a frightening term . " For the most part , Mr. Ken nedy avoided economic abstractions . He did argue , however , that " to cut a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to remove with one hand the stimu lus that we give with the other . " ISteel Unmentioned In the prepared ? text Mr. Kennedy did not refer to the steel or Cuban situation directly . He made the most emphatic and comprehensive answer yet given to the contention of congressional economizers that the tax cuts he wants to stimulate the economy should be offset by at least sizable cuts in federal expenditures . While his speech dealt primarily with domestic programs , the President made one reference to Cuba . He said United States handling of the Soviet missile crisis last October means that " there is today more widespread assurance that both peace and freedom can prevail . "
