Angels have beautiful clothes made of pink and lavender nylon , even the latest rockets can not penetrate Heaven , and the Devil is full of uranium . These are some of the up-to-the-minute theories of small-fry theology turned up in a survey of sixto ten-year-olds conducted by Professor Theophil Thun , 59 , of the Padogogische Akademie ( Teachers College ) in Paderborn , Germany . Professor Thun was less interested in theology than in charting the juvenile sense of sin , and his findings indicate that at six as well as at 60 , sin often seems whatever is most fun-such as " scuffling and kicking and throwing stones " and " sticking out my tongue at people . " <P> Grave sins cited by German second-graders most often included throwing away food or money or " making fun of God . " But one moppet , asked to describe a small sin , disconcertingly replied , " Playing cowboy and taking Father 's rifle and saying there 's no bullet in it but there is and you shoot somebody dead . " <P> Nine-and ten-year-olds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin , but several sophisticates cited " committing adultery . " In this age-group , serious sinning took in a wide range of behavior , from " throwing snowballs at Granny " to " pushing children in front of cars " ; from " trampling flowers " to " setting fire to a hospital or a big old folks ' home . " <P> Summing up his survey , Professor Thun rates aggressive and destructive tendencies as first in the child 's garden of evil , followed by thievery , sex ( " pulling down your pants in front of other children " ) , sacrilege ( " calling God a dope " ) , disobedience and , lastly , that mysterious entity known as Grown-Up Sins .
