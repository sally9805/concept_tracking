Frank Bergin , 26 , of Pelham , N.Y. , unloaded his rucksack and propped his .30/06 rifle against a tree . He had driven half the night , hiked five miles through the wilderness from the highway . Now for a snooze , and then on with the great bear hunt . A year before , in the same remote Adirondack clearing , he had come across black bear tracks , marked the spot carefully on a map . Came the dawn . Bergin yawned , stretched , looked around-to see twelve equally expectant faces peering curiously at him from behind the trees . Without a word , he rolled up his sleeping bag , hiked the five miles to the highway , drove half the day back to Pelham . " Where 's the bear ? " asked his wife . Bergin just growled . " What got into you ? " she said . <P> The same thing that gets into most U.S. hunters . There is no shortage of game-just a superabundance of hunters ( 15 million this year ) and a paucity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; creeping asphalt and urban sprawl gobble up more land each year . What open land remains is often overcrowded . Last week in northern Michigan 's Ogemaw County , the deer hunter population was 100 per sq . mi . In the East , it is worth a man 's life to venture into the woods . " I do n't know which is safer , " says one hunter . " Wearing a Day-Glo coat or hanging a pair of antlers on my head . " So what does today 's hunter do if he wants to bag his game and live to eat it ? He heads for a private shooting preserve . <P> Boars on Horseback . Preserves are nothing new . New Hampshire 's 25,000-acre Blue Mountain Forest Inc. was stocked in 1890 with deer , antelope , moose , elk , caribou , and Himalayan mountain goats . Railroad Magnate Austin Corbin chased boars there on horse back with javelins . Today , there are nearly 2,000 preserves in the U.S.-most of them open to anybody with a box of shells and a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms , stocked with a few pheasants and partridges . Others cater to the whims of an affluent society . <P> At Michigan 's Metamora Shoot ( members : Henry Ford II , American Motors ' Roy Chapin ) , the " in " uniform is a pair of torn khaki trousers patched with adhesive tape , and the " in " gun is a $1,000 Winchester 21 double shotgun . A few preserves even have their own aircraft landing strips ( " Taxi Right Up to the Clubhouse , " boasts California 's Hidden Valley Club , favorite retreat of Lawrence Welk and Oilman Earl Gilmore ) . Wisconsin 's Rainbow Springs stocks pheasant , quail , partridge and ducks , offers a 41-room clubhouse , skeet and trap ranges , a swimming pool , ice-skating , and an 18-hole golf course .
