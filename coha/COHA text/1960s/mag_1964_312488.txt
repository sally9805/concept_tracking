Satellite pictures of all the world 's weather were made available to all the world last week-and at bargain rates . With about $32,000 worth of standard components , any country that is interested can put together a station capable of querying Tiros VIII , the newest weather watcher that the U.S. has fired into orbit . <P> Slow Reading . Earlier Tiros satellites stored their pictures on magnetic tape , then transmitted a large batch while passing over expensive installations at Fairbanks , Alaska , Point Mugu , Calif. , and Wallops Island , Va . By the time the views from space were forwarded to the world 's meteorologists by radio facsimile , they were often too late to help in the forecasts of local weather . But Tiros VIII carries a new type TV camera ; its shutter opens for three-thousandths of a second , forming a photoelectric picture of about 1,000,000 square miles of earth . Instead of fading almost instantly like an ordinary TV picture , the shot lasts for 200 seconds while a scanning device " reads " it slowly , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes over the horizon , a ground station operator tracks it with a spiral antenna . Down from the satellite comes a picture of the cloud pattern it has just passed over . <P> If the station is remote from other sources of weather information , the picture may bring the first news of the approach of a dangerous storm . About 40 such stations will be set up around the world by the U.S. ; other countries - even Russia or Red China-are free to use Tiros if they want to . <P> Gleams in the Wind . Tiros VIII also carries the standard TV camera with which earlier weather satellites have scanned the earth 's clouds . And starting back with Tiros I , launched in ' 1960 , pictures made by that camera have worked on a major revolution in meteorology . Covering vast areas from 400 miles up . the eyes-in-space have reported varieties of cloud behavior that had never been observed before . They have detected unsuspected relations between the cloud patterns and the weather on the surface . They have spotted infant hurricanes when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Such triumphs are only the beginning , say satellite meteorologists . Future satellites will do even better . They will measure temperatures of the ground and the atmosphere . They will tell how dense the clouds are , and how high . They will show clouds on the dark side of the earth and measure changes of water vapor in the air . When all this new information is analyzed continuously by quick-thinking computers , meteorologists will at last be able to watch all the world 's weather all the time .
