For all of Edward Kennedy 's legal efforts to avoid what he fears would be a circus-style inquest into the death of Mary Jo Kopechne , a sort of rehearsal for an inquest was held last week in Pennsylvania 's Luzerne County courthouse . Nearly 200 newsmen and spectators jammed into Judge Bernard Brominski 's courtroom in Wilkes-Barre to hear arguments on whether Mary Jo 's body should be exhumed from a nearby Larksville cemetery for an autopsy . While the proceeding showed that Kennedy 's apprehension was well founded , it also indicated that the lack of a postmortem has contributed to keeping the case alive and controversial . <P> Edmund Dinis , the Massachusetts district attorney in whose jurisdiction the death occurred last July , seemed determined to compensate-or even over-compensate-for his initial timidity in investigating the biggest case of his life . He allowed his assistant , Armand Fernandes , to hint in the course of cross-examination that Mary Jo might have died from a skull fracture or " manual strangulation " rather than drowning . Summoning such witnesses as Edgartown Police Chief Dominick Arena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue if a formal inquest is held in Massachusetts . <P> Mary Jo 's parents , Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Kopechne , are fighting an autopsy , arguing that Dinis should prove that there is legitimate suspicion of foul play before exhuming their daughter 's body . Dinis maintains that the suspicion already exists , raised by the delay before the death was reported and the apparent contradictions in Kennedy 's public accounting of the episode . To underscore discrepancies regarding the exact time of the accident , Dinis played a tape recording of Kennedy 's televised explanation of the event . Kennedy himself was in Europe last week for a meeting of the North Atlantic Assembly . Dinis summoned none of the others present at the Chappaquiddick party . <P> A central question was whether an autopsy would be of any medical value three months or more after the body was embalmed and buried . The Kopechnes ' lawyers called Dr. Werner Spitz , deputy chief medical examiner for Maryland and an expert on drowning cases , who said that anatomical evidence of drowning would already have disappeared. * Spitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A pinkish froth around the nose , he said , indicated that she " remained alive for a certain time " while the car was under water in Poucha Pond . " She breathed , that girl , " Spitz said . " She was n't dead instantaneously . " Three other pathologists testified that even now an autopsy might yield explicit evidence on the cause of death . <P> Personal Defense . The original finding that drowning was the cause is vulnerable because of the examination 's cursory nature . Dr. Donald R. Mills , the associate county medical examiner who signed Mary Jo 's death certificate , admitted he inspected the body for only ten minutes . Fernandes argued that , regardless of whether an autopsy could prove drowning , Mills ' examination did not determine if Mary Jo could have died of some other cause .
