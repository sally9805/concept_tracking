txt WASHINGTON , June ** Federal Reserve System , taking note of diminished inflationary psychology in the economy , let up on one of its main instruments of restraint today . The Board of Gov. ernors authorized two of the twelve Federal Reserve banks to reduce their discount rates from 4 per cent to 31/2 per cent . If past patterns hold true , the ten others will soon follow the examples of the Philadelphia and San Francisco banks . The discount rate is what reserve banks charge on the loans they make to commercial banks . Rate increases and decreases tend to be reflected in correspondingly higher or lower rates on the loans that commercial banks make to businesses  --  thus influencing business ' borrowing and business activity . From a law of 1% per . cent two years ago , at the bottom of the 1957-58 recession , the rate has been increased five times , most recently last September . Pressure Was Eased Today 's reduction , however , was not the first sign that the Federal Reserve ? was shifting away from its policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system 's reduction of pressure on bank reserves since the start of the year ? the reduced pressure making it easier for the banks to lend money . Thus it would appear that the Federal Reserve has been thinking in the direction of less restraint for some time , but itself has been reluctant to take today 's positive public action because of uncertainties in the economic situation . First , there were the new year 's predictions of booming activity that has not materialized . Then came a downpour of generally negative statistical // reports in ' Ruth , but recovery id.:Apri/ : . And most recently , the ' summit meeting collapsed and the- world- tensed . Observing no ' , post-summit race by business men or consumers to stock . up in expectation of : shortages , the Board of Governors gave its approval today to discount ' rate reduction by the Philadelphia and San Francisco banks effective tomorrow . On the basis of past practice , this action might be interpreted as a sign that the board sees recession around the corner . The last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fall of 1957 , the recession was not even around the corner . It was on . That is not the case today , and the consensus of economists ' expectations is that there will be no recession for some time ? perhaps even a year or more . Still , there is slack in the economy . Industrial production , at last report , was no higher than it was at the end of last year . New sales orders have not been rising . Unemployment has remained at a rate of 5 per cent or higher . On the plus side , retail sales ? helped by automobile ? rose strongly in April . So did consumer installment debt . Homebuilding activity has shown signs that its slump is ending . Business borrowing has kept pace with the normal seasonal pattern . The popular indicator of inflation  --  the Consumer Price Index  --  has been virtually stable since last autumn , with the exception of an upward spurt in April . A spokesman for the board summarized conditions as follows : " The economy is on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things work out the way the money authorities would like them to , economic activity will continue to advance gradually  --  not so spectacularly as in the 1955 and 1957 booms , but not interrupted by recession ? either . No Immediate Effect Seen The easing of Federal Reserve credit policy was expected to have little immediate effect on bank-lending rates . Bankers pointed out that the demand for loans had remained high , and that loan to deposit ratios Would have to fall significantly before a reduction in the prime rate , now 5 per cent , would be considered . The prime rate isthe banks ' lending rate to their biggest customers with the best credit ratings . It has held at its present level since last Sept. 1 .
