When Lebanon tried to hold a presidential election in 1958 , the tiny country exploded in civil war . More than a thousand Lebanese were slain , the Soviet Union rattled its rockets , and 14,000 U.S. marines landed to ward off a threatened Communist or Nasserite takeover . Yet last week , when the Lebanese tried another election , the event was as quiet and disciplined as a New England town meeting . After a vote in parliament , President Fuad Chehab peacefully surrendered his office to President-elect Charles Helou . Since Helou means " sweet " in Arabic , newspapers headlined that his inauguration would begin " a sweet era " for Lebanon . <P> The recent past has been remarkably sweet too . During Chehab 's six-year term , Lebanon became one of the few nations untroubled by the continuous turmoil of the Middle East . <P> Contradictory Glories . The 1958 civil war began when Moslems staged an uprising against the unconstitutional attempt of the then President , Camille Chamoun , a Christian , to serve a second term . At the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead it against the rebels , because he was convinced that if he did , the Moslem members of the armed forces would mutiny . This decision won him great popularity with the Moslems . The Christians , who make up half of Lebanon 's 1,700,000 population , were at first outraged , but gradually recognized the wisdom of the Christian commander . As a result , Chamoun stepped down , Chehab was named President by parliament , and when he reluctantly accepted , the U.S. marines withdrew . <P> Chehab ruled by doing nothing , at home or abroad . Despising politicians , whom he calls fromagistes ( cheese eaters ) , Chehab would rather let Lebanon boom or bust than go in for planning . In this , he again proved how well he understood his countrymen , for the typical Lebanese is both capitalist and anarchist , and glories in contradiction . <P> The Lebanese way of life is reflected in Beirut , which is the noisiest , dirtiest , liveliest and loveliest capital in the Middle East . Surging traffic bewilders a stranger , with tramcars plunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaywalking heedlessly . Garbage lies uncollected around stunning glass-walled apartment buildings , and any car parked below is certain to be littered by melon rinds and pistachio shells tossed from the balconies and windows . As fast as the police write out traffic tickets , motorists throw them away , and cars are double-and triple-parked all over town . <P> Needs Understood . The noise begins at dawn with the loudspeaker chants of muezzins from minarets , followed by the clangor of bells from Christian churches . Auto horns , the plaintive cries of peddlers , and the bray of donkeys blend with the screech of jet planes . With evening comes the sound of 64 nightclubs , the throb of motorboats carrying gamblers up the coast to the Casino de Liban , and the shrill cries of prostitutes in the block-long Bourg Central Square in the heart of town .
