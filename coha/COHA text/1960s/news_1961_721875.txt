BY GEORGE TAGGE ( Chicago Tribune Press Servicel Springfield , Ill. , June 14 ? The Illinois Supreme court today handed down a decision which has the effect of upholding the key portion of Gov . Kerner 's pending legislation to broaden the base of the sales tax . The vital court ruling , contrary to a 1953 decision , is that materials sold to contractors for building construction are subject to the sales tax , Willard Ice , veteran tax expert for the state revenue department , said the same ground is covered in one of the many broadening bills before the legislature , but that none of them will be dropped . They apply to service occupations and most custom-made goods . Goes Farther Than Asked " I 'm glad we won , " Ice told a reporter . " The court went even farther than we asked them to go because we had n't contended that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature said the decision may foreshadow favorable court action on all portions of the broadening program . The program is certain to be challenged on legal grounds . There were reports that the Democrat controled House may rebel against Gov . Kerner 's bill to increase the state sales tax . from 3 to 31/2 cents on the dollar . Reportedly members have been hit by a tidal wave of protests since a G. 0 . P. filibuster and allnight session last week gave major publicity to the sales tax boosts . Democratic leaders are said to have pledges of support from some Republisupport from some Republicans but are being deserted by about as many Democratic members . Expect Daley Wednesday Mayor Daley of Chicago will come here next Wednesday to make a personal appeal for his bill to double the half-cent city sales tax , which is collected for more than 1,000 municipalities. by the state . His measure now appears to be doomed by the Republican-controled Senate , altho it has passed the House . The House committee on constitutional amendments today , voted 9 to 7 in recommending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to about 31/2 billion dollars a biennium . Rep. Warren Wood R. , Plainfield , former House speaker , gained some needed Democratic votes by amending it upward . As introduced , it had a limit of $250 per capita  --  about 21/2 billion dollars for a two year fiscal period . He changed the figure to $350 per capita . The limit could be exceeded only -- if voters approved an increase in a referendum . Continue 5% Trims Wood 's resolution requires two-thirds majorities in both House and Senate in order to be placed on the 1962 ballot . G. 0 . P. senators today continued their 5 per cent " across the board " cuts in Kerner appropriation bills . They cut $2,095,000 from the department of public health bill for $42 , - 500,215 . There was a slash of $404,257 from the department of registration and education appropriation bill for $8,085,149 . The largest cut was $45,091 , - 701 from the public works department budget of $901,834 , - 018 but it does n't pertain to Gov . Kerner 's serious financial problems . All of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline tax fund , or federal funds . It is the general revenue fund which is in trouble . Reverses Circuit Judge Justice Ray Klingbiel wrote the Supreme court opinion . It holds that the sales tax must be paid not only on materials sold to speculative builders , but also on sales to builders who contract ahead of time to sell the homes for which materials have ' been bought . The state revenue department sought to assess G. S. Lyons and Sons Lumber and Manufacturing company of Decatur for sales of lumber to builders . Circuit Judge Harry L. Hannah of Macon county ruled with Lyons that the firm could n't be taxed because the lumber was sold for use in resale . Justice Klingbiel wrote that " it is reasonable to assume the legislature intended the term ' use ' in the sales and use tax law to include any employment of a thing which took it off the retail market so that it was no longer the object of a tax on the privilege of selling it at retail . " Last Transfer Taxable " The process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the identity of the material as personal property and converting it into real estate , " the opinion said . " The sale to the builder is the last transfer of the materials as personal property and Is a sale for use or consumption within the meaning of the sales and use tax act . " This reasoning applies , said the court , whether the builder is a speculative real estate developer intending to sell the improved real estate at a profit , or whether he is a contractor having undertaken to improve another person 's property . The contrary 1953 opinion , involving Material Service corporation , " is not supported by sound reasons and can no longer be followed , " Klingbiel wrote .
