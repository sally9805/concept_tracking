Opera singers , as everyone knows , are exotic creatures . Nowhere have they been more clearly categorized as-such than in Cincinnati , where for the past 49 years Verdi and Bizet have been performed outdoors in the city zoo-joined , and sometimes drowned , by more basic animal noises from lions , seals , bears , elephants , peacocks and other prima donnas of the animal kingdom . <P> Last week the Zoo Opera dropped the curtains on its colorful , uncomfortable past . Next summer the Zoo Opera will be gone from the zoo and installed downtown . The stage will be full-sized , air-conditioning will cool the audience , and the opera company will be able to mount big works that could not be squeezed onto the old stage . <P> The Zoo Opera grew into one of the most interesting companies in America . It never had chic like Salzburg or Bay-reuth-but then , the European festivals do not offer beer , hot dogs and wild animals to patrons bored with La Traviata and Rigoletto . Besides , where else could one hear Gladys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeanette MacDonald in Faust , catch James Melton in his first Madama Butterfly , or stroll into a Rigoletto and hear Jan Peerce and Robert Weede making their professional debuts ? <P> Fun Palace . The audience tolerated the worst kind of summer weather , and so did the singers . Beverly Sills stood encased in a fabric column as the doll in The Tales of Hoffmann , while the stage temperature registered 160 degrees-later she threw up and nearly collapsed . Elisabeth Schwarzkopf had to be carried to the wings after singing Der Rosenkavalier in a heavy hoop skirt . Cincinnati Zoo history is replete with disputes between singers and kamikaze bats , suicidal moths , unhousebroken monkeys and pigeons that expressed their opinion of performances in the only way available to pigeons . <P> Withal , the Zoo Opera generated a rapport between artists and audience that made for something special . " It was a fun palace , " says Peerce . " An alfresco thing , where you asked a soprano to hold your Coke bottle while you went out and did your death scene . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only coloratura sopranos they hated . "
