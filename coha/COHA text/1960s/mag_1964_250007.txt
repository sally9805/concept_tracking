" We 're alone , dear , " says Lady Bird Johnson , seated at the breakfast table with her husband . " You can refer to him by name instead of ' my opponent . ' " Gushes the sweet young thing to her studious male escort : " I guess I am to you what Cuba is to Russia-friendly , but expensive ! " To the police sergeant , the patrolman explains a fact of modern life : " You can tell the delinquents who come from affluent families-instead of razors they use electric carving knives ! " These needle-sharp political gibes are the work of James O. Berry , 32 , whose cartoon feature , Berry 's World , is syndicated by the Newspaper Enterprise Association , a New York affiliate of Scripps-Howard newspapers .

He considers himself a " middle-of-the-roader " and prefers to keep his political preferences a secret for the ballot box . " I 'm not really mad at anybody , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to take potshots at anybody and anything . "
