Mr. Esperdy said action against the Gertners was being considered . Rabbi Gertner said last night that he knew the boy as Yankel Frankel . He said a woman who had identified herself as the boy 's mother had brought him for a " temporary " stay ? three months ago and had told him the boy came from Argentina . The rabbi added that the boy had denied to the Immigration Service agents that Mrs. Schuhmacher ? wai his mother when the agents showed him photographs last Friday .

When the boy was led in , clad in a checked sports shirt , gray slacks and a blue skull cap , embroidered in gold , his mother ran up to him and hugged him .

Later , the Yiddish-speaking matron and two immigration agents who had been caring for the boy chatted with his mother about him . Rabbi Describes Boy Rabbi Gertner , in a telephone interview , described the youngster as a " mixed-up boy " and said he had tried to see him since he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration agents . He said the child was " a fine boy , a religious boy " and he felt he should be at the boy 's silo . The rabbi explained that he had taken the boy into his house because " in my house I 'm accustomed to doing this kind of favor . " He said he did n't care how old or how young a person was when help was needed . " Sometimes there is an elderly man here , sometimes a sick man , or a sick lady , and when I was asked to put up a small boy , 9 years old . or 10 , I said it was a pleasure . " this woman is his mother and He said that the woman who had accompanied the youngster had told him she would take him away again some time later . For that reason , Rabbi Gertner said , he did not enroll the boy in a school , but taught him himself . " He learned very much here , a lot more than in schools , " Rabbi Gertner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had visited every few days and usually brought a gift to the boy . When the agents arrived at his house , the rabbi said , they asked him if he had any papers for Yankel . He said he had none . The boy , according to the rabbi , denied " firmly , 100 per cent , again and again " that he had come from Israel . He denied he had been abducted by his grandfather and insisted he was not the boy in pictures the agents showed him , the rabbi said . " I surely want to see him tomorrow , " the rabbi added . Why should n't I see him ? , If this woman is his mother and he is so hurt that he denied the story before I want to be near him . " The boy has been the center of a dispute between his parents and maternal grandparents for three years . The parents entrusted Yosef and Zina to the grandparents in Jerusalem when they arrived from the Soviet Union in 1957 . They said thay would take the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . The grandfather , Nalunan Shtarkes , put Yosef in a cheder , a school where classes tare taught in Yiddish because Hebrew is considered too sacred a language to be used except for ritual . Early in 1959 the parents established their own home and tried to get their children back . The grandfather refused to surrender Yosef , feeling the boy would receive an insufficiently Orthodox upbringing . The grandparents hid the child after hearing his parents planned to return with him to the Soviet Union . The late chief rabbi of Jerusalem , Rabbi Zvi Pessah Frank , told the grandparents that religious duty required they do everything to keep the boy from being taken back to the Soviet Union , where he would be alienated from , his religion . The . parents have denied they intended to return to the Soviet Union . The parents took court action to recover the boy , and the struggle sharpened religious divisions within Israel . Neither the Israeli consulate nor Mr. Boukstein offered any theories as to how the boy might have been brought into the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Government . A spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service said that an investigation was already in progress .
