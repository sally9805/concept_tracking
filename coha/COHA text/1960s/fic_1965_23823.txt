I 'm Not Going to Ask You Again A story by Anne Tyler Her bedroom was spotless . Every piece of furniture was freshly dusted and gleaming in the morning sunlight , and the vase of asters and the Baby Ben alarm clock on the bureau were in their exactly right positions . Even her tufted bedspread , rising over the mound of her body , was almost as smooth and taut as it had been before she went to bed . She blinked her eyes to clear the mist of sleep from them and stared at everything a second time , enjoying all this neatness . Anything could happen now , any number of ambulance drivers or excited policemen or stamping firemen could come barging in and she would be ready for them , calm in a well-ordered world with nothing to hide or apologize for . The corners of her mouth stretched farther apart for a minute , not in a smile but in a full-cheeked expression of satisfaction , and she folded her arms behind her head and gazed up at the white plaster ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , something far in the back of her mind that she had n't thought of yet , that was making her feel so happy . She frowned at the ceiling and flipped through the days of the week . Not Thursday . Not Friday . Saturday , then . The word Saturday was important , for some reason . With the palm of her hand she gently smoothed her forehead , and then her hand dropped back sharply on the bed and she sat up . Of course : Saturday was the day for Paul Harberg 's lesson . He would come at eleven , promptly , lugging the cello in its big canvas case behind him , and where would he find his teacher ? Still in bed , if she did n't hurry . She threw back her covers and slung her feet over the side of the bed , pulling down her bunched nightgown at the same time . She had less than half an hour now ; she would have to move fast . In the bathroom , swishing the peppermint-tasting toothpaste water around in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last month Paul 's mother , red-haired and brassy-eyed , had come in person to say that Paul would only be taking on alternate weeks now  --  cello on one Saturday , Mr. Ham King 's new Boys ' Club on the next . " Maybe we could change the time of the lesson , " Noona said . " Afternoons , maybe , instead of mornings . so he could do the lesson and the Boys ' Club both , all right ? " But Mrs. Harberg said the Boys ' Club lasted all day , with bird-watching and knot-tying and all ; and yes , she knew that once-a-week lessons were a good thing but not for Paul , who never seemed to go around with other children enough . Nor would she consider changing his lessons to a weekday . She had poked her hands into her gloves again and taken her leave , smiling brightly at a spot on the wall beside the front door but never meeting Noona 's eyes , and Noona was left now with two weeks to wade through instead of one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny painted fingernails and stand-out skirts , and violin to cross little boys whose mothers wanted them to play the fiddle when company came . It was a wonder she had forgotten even for a minute , even in the blurry daze of first waking up , that this was the Saturday for Paul Harberg . She dried her face with a rough towel , replaced it neatly on the rack again , and then she looked into the medicine-cahinet mirror for the first time that day in order to see how to comb her hair . She rarely looked in mirrors . She had been fat from birth almost , once so fat that people had gaped at her unbelievingly and she had not dared to try to enter the narrow folding doors of city buses . Now most of the weight was gone , starved away a few years ago when the doctors had insisted , but her skin had lost its elasticity by then and had never tightened up again . The skin hanging from her upper arms could be wrapped around her arms like sleeves ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the piano , causing her students to stare round-eyed . But as her father had often said , it was music she was born for , not the movies . She smiled briefly and then frowned , concentrating on finding a part in the stubby gray haystack of her hair . Because she was in a hurry she plugged in the coffeepot as soon as she had finished washing . Then she went back to her room to dress and to smooth the covers of her bed . Inwardly she was naturally messy , but she forced herself to be neat because it somehow kept her mind in order too . She hung her nightgown on a hook in the closet and closed the closet door , and then she stood for a minute looking everything over before she left the room again . In the kitchen the coffee was bubbling , making her feel cheerful and brisk . She poured herself a cup and took a Ry Krisp out of the cupboard , but she did n't sit down for her breakfast . Instead she headed for the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cracker . There were some things that had to be done here . The straight-backed chair had to he moved closer to the grand piano  --  she set her breakfast on an end table and dragged it over . Then she placed the music stand in front of the chair and took some sheet music out of the piano bench . Sheswung the crane-necked floor lamp over at just the right angle and pulled the little tasseled chain that switched it on , and after that she went back to the kitchen and took a box of vanilla wafers from the top shelf . None of her other pupils were served vanilla wafers ; those were just for Paul . Partly because he played the cello at all  --  it was her favorite instrument , and one that she had never been able to truly master because all her fat got in the way of it . But mainly because he was good on it , he was wonderful on it , and had made every note sound beautiful even when he was on " Ding Dong Bell , Pussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she arranged vanilla wafers on a cut-glass plate , as she was doing now , and stretched his hour to an hour-and-a-half and talked about plans for his future . There was nothing she would rather talk about than plans for Paul Harberg 's future . When everything was ready she looked at the kitchen clock and saw that it was 11:05 . He would be here any minute then ; he was n't usually late . She finished her coffee and washed the cup , and then she went back to the living room and sat down in an easy chair with her hands folded in her lap . For a while she watched the front door , waiting for the small thin shadow that would be Pau ! Harberg blurred behind the yellowed lace curtain . But when he still did n't come she looked elsewhere , to keep her mind occupied . At the radiator with its spindly claw legs denting the maroon carpet . At the faded daybed , covered by a flowered bedspread that was beginning to fade . This house had been willed to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noona was in her teens , and on summer evenings when the three of them sat out on the porch , not talking , they would always ask eventually for Noona to play the piano for them . She would rise , large and soft in her pastel dress , and find her way into the dark house and over to the piano . Once playing , she never thought about what she was playing . It drifted out from her fingers while she sat staring into the dusk , feeling dreamy and formless . And once in a while the rumble of her father 's voice would float in through the open window ( " That girl 's going to go somewhere . Go somewhere " ) . After her parents died , she found that playing for an empty silent porch Anne Tyler 's second novel , " The Tin Can Tree , " is scheduled by Knopf for October publication . She is twenty-three years old , is anarried to a psychiatrist , and lives in Montreal . She has been working for the McGill University Library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the same . Now she did her playing in the daytime , and read at night . And now the little house was hemmed in by other houses . cheaper and uglier , and Norton was a city instead of a town , and Noona Long was still playing in this dark little living room instead of in some concert hall up North . When she dared to look at the clock again , she saw that it was 11:45 . The empty cello chair and the bare music stand had stopped looking expectant and seemed merely snubbed and pathetic now , and Noona 's face when she rose to peer out the window was unbelieving . He could n't have forgotten , could he ? Yet the street was Nand and silent , with only a few children ( much too young to be Paul ) playing among the leaves left by yesterday 's wind . She turned back and looked again at the chair , as if he might have crept in to sit upon it when she was looking in the other direction . The blank seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it were any other pupil  --  Jamie Cartwright , for instance , whose dream was to he a square-dance fiddler -- -she would have dialed his number on her telephone and said , " Well , come on . What 's holding you up , did you forget ? " with one squared-off fingernail tapping irritably upon the cover of the telephone book . " I am waiting , " she would say firmly . " I 'm not going to ask you again . " Yet Paul was different . She could n't talk that way to him ; she could n't call his red-haired mother . ( " Even the doctor said it , " Mrs. Harberg told Noona , " He 's getting high-strung . At night sometimes , I find him snapping his wrist in his sleep . " " Snapping his wrist ? " Noona asked . " Yes , snapping his wrist . Like he was holding a cello bow ? bringing his arm up , flicking his wrist , and drawing his arm down again . " " Oh , my goodness . " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those brass-and-copper eyes flashing in her tight white face . ) She crossed now to the daybed , making her motions brisk , and began pulling the faded bedspread off the daybed . It was time she dyed it , instead of sitting and mulling her thoughts around . She had bought two boxes of navy-blue dye over a month ago and never used them , and now it was time . With the spread clutched to her chest she crossed the room quickly , not letting herself look at the chair and the music stand . She stopped to click off the crane-necked lamp before she went on into the kitchen . The biggest thing she owned was a laundry sink , She threw the spread into that and thenturned back to the directions . No , the spread should n't go in yet . Laboriously she pulled it out again , and then read the directions more carefully and all the way through this time . Wet the material thoroughly , they said . Fill dyeing tub or washing machine , empty packet of dye into it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water , reminded her of what octopus ink must look like . She leaned one elbow on the edge of the laundry sink and watched as the water slowly rose . In the music part of her mind , violins tuned up . She shifted her weight irritably to the other foot and tried to shut oft the music part of her mind like a radio , only the knob would n't work . The violins were tuned ; they hesitated , and then all the strings together began to play . It was something by Mozart , sifting down sadly over her like sand settling to the bottom of seawater , but she tried not to listen . Sometimes she thought that that far little part of her mind had already selected a piece of music to accompany every moment of her life , past and present . Where music made other people see memories , seeing memories made Noona Long hear music . And whenever something happened , there always seemed to be background music to go with it . She straightened up sharply and began sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget about Mozart . Stir constantly , the directions said . She pulled out a large wooden spoon and then leaned down and began stirring the spread around and around in the bleak gray metal tub . Someone stepped onto the wooden floor of her front porch . She straightened instantly , with her spoon forgotten in midair . But no , these were grown-up feet , high-heeled . She began stirring again , more violently , instead of going to the door . The bell rang . ( Paul Harberg always knocked , with his sharp little knuckles making a fragile tapping that did n't even rattle the loose screen door . ) The bell sounded once , and then twice again very rapidly . That would be Sarah Cobbett then , coming for her Saturday lunch date . She always rang that way . So without ceasing to stir the dye Noona called out , " Come on in , I hear you , " and was surprised at how her voice turned out to be  --  heavy and rough , with a little broken edge to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in the kitchen . " Sarah 's high heels crossed the living room crisply , and a minute later she was in the kitchen doorway and speaking to the flat of Noona 's back : " I guess I 'm early . " " Yes . Well , maybe not . I do n't know . " " Why do n't . . . What 're you doing ? " " Just some dyeing ! " " What a mess . Why do n't you turn around and see my new fall suit ? " Still stirValg , Noona looked around . Sarah was posed in the doorway , with her back in a C-curve and her flat stomach slouched forward like a model 's in order to show off her tweed suit . Sarah was always buying tweed suits . She was that type of person , square and bony , nearly forty but looking younger . She always said " hell " and " damn , " which was more than Noona had ever done , and she taught Marx and Engels for her high-school history course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could ramble on for hours about how scandalous Elizabeth Taylor was , or how her invalid father always turned so crotchety with the change in seasons . With her mind on the invalid father now , Noona said , " How 's your dad doing ? " " You mean you do n't like my suit . " " Oh , goodness no , Sarah  --  my mind was wandering . Turn around . " Sarah turned , still holding her pose . " I found it in Landersville , " she said . " I could n't resist it . Dad is fine , thank you . He is entering a ' Why I like such-and-such ' contest ; got all these blanks and soap wrappers scattered around him . " " That 's nice , " said Noona , not listening . " It 's the change in seasons , you know . I 'm never sure how it 's going to affect him . " " No . " Sarah pulled out a chair from the kitchen table and sat down upon it , crossing her legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Just a couch spread . " " Ah . " She pursed her lips a little and stared at Noona . " Well , " she said finally , " I 'm sure it 'll turn out pretty . " " I doubt it . " The blue water swirled around the wooden spoon . Noona reached down and pulled up one corner of the spread , pinching it between a story by Anne Tyler 91 the tips of her thumb and index finger . It was the ugliest color she had ever seen  --  like medium-blue window curtains faded and streaked by the sun . In the chair at her right , Sarah shook her head and made a tsk-tsk sound . " Why did you have to go and dye a flowered spread ? " she asked . " Look , they 're turning purple . " " They 'll go away . " " No , they wo n't . " " Well , " Noona said . " What 're you giving me for lunch ? " " I had n't thought . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Harberg never showed up today , " said Noona . She stopped stirring and just let her hands droop over the sink edge . " I waited all this time for him . " Sarah was busy getting out a Pall Mall now . She flicked the little wheel on her lighter several times , impatiently , and then when it caught flame she took a long time to put the cigarette in her 92 I 'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU AGAIN mouth and light it , frowning all the while to show that she wanted to say something when she was through with this . ' Well , " she said finally , " that 's what happens with boys , Noona . I honestly do n't think it 's fair  --  all through life it 's the girls who study ( boys sit in the back of the class and throw spit-wads ) but who is it that ends up famous ? The boys . " She looked at her lighter blankly for a minute and then clicked it shut and popped it back in her purse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " But Paul 's not like ? " " Oh shoot , Noona , Paul 's the same as any . Why do n't you call his mother ? " " I ca n't . " " Sure you can . " " Well , I do n't want to talk about it , " Noona said . She plunged the wooden spoon back into the water with a small splash . " Still do n't know what to feed me for lunch ? " Sarah asked . " No . " Sarah stood up and began moving around the kitchen , circling Noona . When she reached the doorway she kept on going , into the living room , trailed by a long thin curl of smoke . Noona switched the spoon to her other hand and turned around to look after her . " I thought maybe a salad plate , " she called . " That all right ? " " Sounds fine . " The doorbell rang again . And there went Sarah 's high heels , hurrying to the door with little businesslike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more and leaned upon the sink with both elbows , frowning at the faucets as she tried to hear who this was . She heard Sarah saying something , her words blurring into one long ripple . At the end of the ripple a man laughed gently , and Noona sighed and sank the spoon into the water again . If it was one of those life-insurance salesmen , she hoped Sarah would get rid of him . She 'd had enough of those lately . Noona , " Sarah said . She was riot yet within sight , but she was hurrying toward the kitchen with that man , whoever he was , close behind her . " You 've got company , Noona . " They had reached the door now , but Noona kept on stirring and did n't turn around . " Who is it ? " she asked . Her voice had that broken edge in it again . " Turn around and see , will you ? Noona , I do n't know if you met Mr. Harberg ever , I taught his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She knew him by sight , but no one had ever actually introduced him to her . So she swung around immediately , looking startled , and found him standing beside Sarah with his hand on the shoulder of Paul himself . Paul was looking at his own belt buckle . But Mr. Harberg was looking straight at Noona , with his mouth a little open , and Noona suddenly remembered that after all , he had probably never seen her before . He was finding her peculiar-looking ? such a large droopy lady , huddling over her cauldron like a witch with a wooden spoon . She set down the spoon and turned full-face toward him , smiling . " I 'm dyeing , " she explained . He frowned . " Dyeing material . " He relaxed , and even smiled a little . The hand on Paul 's shoulder moved slightly , pushing Paul forward and closer to Noona , and Mr. Harberg said , " Miss , urn , Miss Long , I reckon Paul 's got something to say to you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belt buckle . There was that one threadlike line of worry across his forehead , and his face was pale and tense . But he was always pale . He was a black-and-white boy  --  black hair , black eyes , and stark white skin . His hands were bony and his fingers long and thin , with knotty joints in them . He was cracking his knuckles , the way he did when he was nervous . " That 's all right , " Noona told him . " You do n't have to explain . Tell you what : I 'll just give you your lesson right now . You wo n't mind , will you , Sarah ? We 'll just have our lunch another day . " " I ca n't , " Paul said . " I 'm playing ball on the playground . I already told Mama about it ; she said ? " " I saw him playing there , " Mr. Harberg said . He was black-and-white too , only his sleeves had been rolled back to show a red Madras wristwatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd forgotten his lesson and he said yes , he had ; so here we are to make our apologies to you . I told him he could n't go on with the game without he 'd done it . " " I 'm the shortstop , " Paul said . Behind him , Sarah Cobbett gave a sudden sharp sigh and began absently drumming her fingers against the doorframe . " What I figured , " said Mr. Harberg , " you could maybe give him his new assignment anyway , Miss Long . " " Well ? " She turned back and began stirring again , very fast . Stir constantly , the directions had said . Do n't just let the material mope around . " It was real inconsiderate of him , I know , " Mr. Harberg was saying . " Well pay for the lesson anyway , of course . It 's only fair to ? " " Oh , no . " " I 'm serious , Miss Long . " " No , thank you . " " What the hell , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still drumming her fingers against the doorframe , never the same rhythm twice in a row . " See , Miss Cobbett 's sensible , " said Paul 's father . " But I did n't do anything to earn that money , Mr. Harberg . " " Please . I ? " " I do n't want it ! " Everyone was silent . A piece of couch spread surfaced and showed itself deep blue now , with the flowers barely visible . Noona reached down and pulled the plug out . " Son , " Mr. Harberg said , " I have n't heard you tell Miss Long you 're sorry . " Noona wrung the spread out , handful by handful , squeezing so hard her fingers ached . Blue water ran under the tips of her nails and around the rims . " I 'm sorry , Miss Long . " " Why , that 's all right , Paul . I guess maybe we needed a vacation anyway , did n't we ? " " I guess so , " There was no rack long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the wet twisted mass in her arms and the blue water dripping all over the floor , and then she thought of hanging it on the open door of the kitchen and edged over towards it . The others moved away . " You got to rinse it out first , " Sarah said . " Oh , well . " " Got to rinse it till the water stops running blue , Noona . Ca n't you read directions ? " Noona slung one end of the spread over the top of the door . The material slapped against the wood , and Mr. Harberg wiped a blue drop from his shirt sleeve . " Oh , I 'm so sorry , " Noona said . " Here , let me get you a ? " " No harm , no harm . Can I help ? " Without waiting for an answer , he reached up and began pulling the cloth over the top of the door . Paul stood to one side , still not looking at anyone . " There we are , " Mr. Harberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Glad to help . Paul , I guess we better go now . You tell Miss Long you 'll see her in two weeks , okay ? " a story by Anne Tyler 93 " I 'll see you in two weeks . " said Paul . " Well , do n't feel you have to hurry off . Paul , would you like some vanilla wafers ? " " No , thank you . " " I 'll tell you what , " Noona said . " I 'll just walk back with you two . I and Sarah will . We always have our Saturday lunch together and this time , why , I just feel like eating out for a change . So we 'll walk with you . " " I thought you were going to serve me up a salad plate , " Sarah said . " The S and W has better salad plates than any I could make . We 'll walk on up to where the bus stop is , and get us a ? " " That 's an awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush , " Noona said . " Be happy to have you , " said Mr. Harberg . So Sarah shrugged and gave in . " Better wash your hands first , though , " she told Noona . " Look at them . " Noona looked . Her hands seemed to be encased in transparent blue gloves , darker around the nails . She crossed her arms above her stomach so that her hands were partly hidden . " We just need a walk , " she said . " Right this minute , " If only she had Paul 's hands , and his long bony fingers to play cellos with . The air outside was cool and fresh and smelled of fall . Across the street three college boys were moving from one house to another , just two doors down . Their wastebasket , covered with college pennants , and their sway-backed couch sat on the sidewalk , and the three boys had stopped work to have a cigarette . " Need any help ? " Mr. Harberg called politely . The boys said no , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s ' , eps to the sidewalk , Paul stopped for a minute . o button the collar of his shirt . Everyone stood around in a circle watching him , awkwardly silent . Sarah had her hands in the pockets of her new suit , with her thumbs hanging out , and she was gazing at Paul and yet through him as if he were some china do-dad from the dime store that she knew too well but that reminded her of something else important . Mr. Harberg was smiling a little . Paul stuck his bottom lip out fiercely and frowned down at the button that he was jamming into a too-small buttonhole , and it was that buttonhole and those twisting fingers that Noona watched . She wished now that she could go back to her little house again . That , or 94 I 'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU AGAIN have the others go on ahead and leave her to tell Paul what she wanted to tell him . Why could n't they let her straighten things out right away so that she could leave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Harberg told her . " Yes . " They began walking . Paul led the way , going stiff-legged and with his head down . Sarah followed , and then behind her came Noona and Mr. Harberg . As they walked , Mr , Harberg kept looking at Noona sideways and then looking away , and then looking back again . " I look like this on account of losing weight , " Noona told him . " I was once very stout . " " Oh , well , I ? " " Music is what I was really born for . " Mr. Harberg cleared his throat . " You never gave Paul his new assignment , " he said after a minute . " Well , I had to hear him play the old one , first . " " I see . " They stopped at the corner to wait for a red light , the four of them all standing abreast now , and he said , " I can see how it upsets things , him not showing up this way . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I hope nat . " " He does practice . Really . All the time he practices . His mother says ? " " Oh , I 'm sure of that . I can tell it in his lessons . Mr. Harberg , I 've got great hopes for Paul ? " She bent forward a little , peering around Mr. Harberg to aim a smile at Paul 's averted face . Paul hunched his shoulders up and then , with no more warning than that , dashed across the empty street while the light was still red . He kept on running even after he had reached the other side . His too-large feet clopped noisily on the cement , and even when he rounded the next curve and disappeared , that clopping sound rang back to them through the bright air . " Well , " said Mr. Harberg . Sarah kept on watching the traffic light but Noona and Mr. Harberg stared down the street where Paul had vanished , their eyes narrowed with the effort trying to see what was n't there any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because there were no cars coming , and they had only waited for the light in order to set a good example for Paul , it seemed pointless now to keep on waiting . They crossed on red and then divided up again  --  Sarah in front , Noona and Mr. Harberg one step behind . " It 's only just growing pains , " said Mr. Harberg . " Of course it is . " " Nights , we have to leave his bedroom door cracked . ' Paul , ' his mother says ? " " Someone 's burning leaves , " said Sarah . " ' Paul , ' she says , ' you ought to get out of the house more . All work and no ? ' Still , I wonder . " They had rounded the curve and now they could see Paul again  --  a tiny black-and-white figure a long way away , still running , his feet shooting out at awkward angles behind him . He must be abreast of the Harbergs ' house already , but instead of turning in there he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the playground , probably ; it was only one block over . Noona made herself stop watching him and looked up at Mr. Harberg . " I wanted to be a musician myself once , " he was saying . " Though about as far as I got was the right-hand part of ' Carolina , Carolina ' on the piano . But Paul now , if he could get somewheres serious with that ? " " This S and W place , " Sarah called . " How long does lunch last there ? " " If he gets good , why , I 'd find the money if I had to dig for it . I 'd send home to New York so some really good cello teacher ? " " Teacher ? " " Why , yes , and not begrudge a cent of it . You agree with me , Miss Long ? " " Of course , " she said . He seemed to be waiting for her to say more , but Noona just walked on blank-faced and watched the stiff straight seam at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Mr. Harberg 's small neat house , the three of them stopped . Somewhere in there , Noona thought , was Mrs. Harherg , maybe watching them even now and creasing her white plaster forehead . Noona turned away and looked up the street . " Miss Cobbett , Miss Long , " Paul 's father said . Sarah turned , on the point of one high heel , and Mr. Harberg bowed formally . " It was good of you ladies to walk along with me , " he said . " I hope you have a pleasant salad plate . " " Thank you , Mr. Harberg . " Noona and Sarah smiled at him , and they watched as he turned in through his white picket gate . " You really want to go to the S and W ? " Sarah asked . " Well , of course . " They walked side by side now . Ahead of them stood the white post that was the street marker , where the bus stop was . Noona kept her eyes fixed on that post and plodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this walking . " Person would think I was a smoker , " she said , " as short of breath as I get . " " It 's your own damn fault , " said Sarah . " Sarah , I have a low metabolism . If I just eat a soda cracker a day , just a half a soda cracker even , it would still all go to ? " " I 'm not talking about your build . I 'm talking about taking this walk . " " Oh . " By the time they reached the bus stop Noona felt she could n't take another step . She leaned against the street marker , breathing heavily , while Sarah stood calmly to one side and narrowed her eyes at her . " I hate to tell you this , " Sarah said , " but you did n't bring any money with you . " " What ? " Noona looked down at her hands , hanging empty at her sides , and then up at Sarah . " Oh , my goodness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can borrow from me. if you want . " " Well , I know , but ? " For some reason , forgetting her money suddenly seemed like something terrible . It was all she could do just to find the strength to keep standing . " Why am I so silly ? " she asked , and although she said it aloud it was to herself that the question was directed . She was n't even looking Sarah 's way ; her eyes were fixed unseeingly upon the street marker . " You 're not silly , " Sarah said . " Look here . Noona , I have plenty of money for the both of us . We 'll just ? " " No . I 'm not going , Sarah . " " What on earth ? " " All I wanted was to tell Paul Harberg something , and now I do n't even know what it was . I did n't want to go to the S and W ; I hate all that chrome ? " " Look , " Sarah said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the same thing in history classes . Some one pupil comes along and might not even know a date in the world . or a name , but feels it and hangs on to every word of the New Deal like the plot of next week 's Perry Mason show , sort of ? " " Oh , well , " Noona said . " What 'd you say ? " " Well . You are thirty-nine years old , Sarah ? " " Thirty-eight , " Sarah snapped . " Thirty-eight , " said Noona . " Excuse me . That 's a story by Anne Tyler 95 more than ten years ' difference there . More than a decade . " " What 's that matter ? " " Matters a lot . " She had straightened up from her position against the street marker now , in order to think more clearly . " No matter how old you get to be . Why , when I was ten I was going to be Queen of the Western Hemisphere , and thin , and married to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I had composed me my own Coronation Processional and could sing it for you this minute . if I wanted ? " " Why , Noona ? " " What 's more , " she said , " when I was twenty , I had made up my mind to be the world 's greatest violinist instead . Which I guess is one step down but still something , after all . And now here it is three decades after that and three more steps down , and I only want to turn out one good pupil . That 's all , Here I have gone from year to year like a tenant growing poorer , like moving from a castle to a house to a smaller house than that , and barely admitting to myself the change from one house to another ? " " Now , Noona , " Sarah said . But Noona said , " Which house do you guess I 'll end up in ? I declare , it 's like musical chairs . Which house will I be stopped in ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Noona were giggling or cutting up . " You 're talking crazy , Noona . " " No . " From the top of the cross-street came a wheezing sound , and the two of them turned in that direction . The city bus had just stopped at its last stop before it reached them . The sun flashed on its large windshield , nearly blinding them , and then moved off again as the bus began roll-ing down the hill toward them . " There 's the bus , " Sarah said needlessly . " Well , I 'm not going . " " Why not ? " " I just do n't want to . Besides , that little Frankel girl 's coming early today . I almost forgot . " " We could just get a bite somewhere . " " No . " When the bus had come to a stop , filling the air with the smell of rubber and gasoline and sun-heated metal , and its door had folded creakily back . Sarah hesitated a minute and then climbed onto the first step . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in the sunshine because she was trying to see into her coin purse . 96 I 'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU AGAIN " Hurry it up , " the driver said . " Urn , " said Noona , " even if I did , Sarah  --  are you listening ? ? even if I did turn one good pupil out , just by chance ? " " Come on , " said the driver . " ? how could I know ? " Sarah looked up at her , with her body turned halfway to the driver now to let him know she was coming . " I mean , what part of him could I know  --  for sure , I 'm saying  --  was really my own doing ? " " I beg your pardon ? " said Sarah . " I did n't ? " " Lady ! " " Oh , " Sarah said , just then figuring it out without Noona 's having to repeat it . " Oh . None , I guess . You have no right . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bus , her heels ringing tinnily against the metal steps , and the door folded shut behind her and the driver wheezed off again . " I sort of know , " Noona said . She held both hands up , palms down , in front of her . At the tips of her dye-stained fingers were callouses , from fingering strings , and her nails were cut short so as not to click against the piano keys when she played . Sometimes , she thought , taking care to say this silently , sometimes I think my hands are the only part of me that ever learned anything . And with that she folded her arms to hide her hands again and began walking back . It was true that she was walking toward her house , but not the direct way that she had come . Instead she cut over a block , which meant that sooner or later she would have to turn a block in the other direction in order to reach home . But this way she passed the playground , which was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . Ordinarily she never planned ahead about what to say to someone . It seemed like cheating . to do that . But now was different , and all the way down that long sunlit block she thought out every act and word . She would come with dignity ; that was first . With dignity she would approach the playground , walking slowly , holding her head high and looking straight before her . When she reached the playground  --  but that part was hard . She was n't sure what to do . Anything but what the others did  --  the children dawdling their way to the grocery store , the old men stopping to remember things  --  their faces pressed to the fence , all ten fingers poked through the little interlaced diamonds of wire and clutching on air . No , she would simply stop on the sidewalk about a foot away from the fence , with her hands to herself . She would wait quietly and with dignity for Paul Harberg to see her . A little girl on roller skates shot past , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Noona moved over absently . She had reached the question of what to say now , and that was the most important . " There is something I would like to discuss with you , Paul . " Or : " I feel we should have a little talk , if you can spare a minute . " Both in that dry , crisp , almost English tone that she had learned to use with other pupils . ( I am waiting . Is it expecting too much ... ) Yet she did n't want to frighten Paul ; only to talk to him . Maybe just draw him aside and say , " While I was by chance passing by , I thought of something I wanted to tell you . I wanted to say ? " But after that , no more words came . What she really wanted to say was just something orderly , something that would make things straight and simple again . She wanted to say something like : I am your teacher , and you are taking cello from me . Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more than it occurs to you to give of your own free will , and you in turn will please stop looking at me scary-eyed like I an going to ask you , now that I 've said I 'm not . There should be something more , but she could n't think what it was . When she reached the playground fence , she paused and took stock of what was going on . First she looked at the fence itself , that fence made up of little wavery wire diamonds , and she focused solely upon it so that the faraway running children behind it were blurred . Then she focused on the children , and it was the fence that was blurred . They were playing at the far end of the field , so far that their faces were only dots against the wide green field , She could n't tell one from another , and even knowing that Paul would be black-and-white , among boys who were all colors. she could not pick him from the rest She must either pass through the gate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she was doing now : just stand there , pressed against the fence , fingers looped through the wire , straining her eyes for him and hoping he might see her . She looked down at her hands and then pulled them away sharply . For a minute her fingers seemed caught in the wire , making her panic . She wrenched them loose . Then she turned and ran , with her fists balled up at her sides . She had never thought she could run so hard . She knew she did it badly  --  her face was tense and beaded with effort , her feet shuffled , the loose skin pounded down at each jolt . Yet she kept on , and ignored how winded she was . She only wanted to go home now ; she wanted to be there , instantly , without this terrible wait between two places . A little girl , sitting straddle-legged on a red tin wagon , said , " Ooh , will you look ! " and pointed with perfect aim at Noona Long who was bearing down upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . When she had passed them , shuffling and puffing and clutching one hand to her ribs , she heard them laugh . It had taken them that long to decide : should they laugh , or cry ? Now that they had made up their minds they laughed endlessly , and wisps of their laughter floated after her  --  high uncertain sounds that deliberately went ha-ha . Noona listened for a while and then stopped running . Her heart was beating right through her dress . By the time she had reached her own street her breath came evenly , though small drops of sweat ran down her temples , She had folded her arms again so that no one would see she had blue hands , and she looked about her calmly , with her head high , as if she had just returned from a walk . Across the street , where the college boys were moving still , she saw two of the boys pushing a baby-blue upright piano on large wheels . As they scuttled it along , a little girl ran sideways beside it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerkily . She and the boys seemed not to notice each other ; she seemed unaware that the piano was even moving , and her feet in their white Mary Janes kept perfect pace with the rolling of the piano . When they turned at right angles to enter the house she turned too , still playing , her curls still bouncing . " Betty Jo Frankel , come here ! " Noona " Chopsticks " faltered , and then trickled off into silence . Betty Jo watched regretfully as the piano left her behind , but after a minute she turned and came across the street , dragging her feet . " You were n't here , Miss Long , " she said accusingly . " I 'm here now . " " You were n't when I came . " " Well , now I am . Come along inside , Betty Jo . Why are your knees so dirty ? " " Game of jacks . You hear me play ' Chopsticks , ' Miss Long ? " " Oh my , yes , " said Noona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am always afflicted with background music , Betty Jo . Even if it 's only on a traveling piano . " " Ma'am ? " " Come on . " She pulled the screen door open and let Betty Jo in ahead of her . After the brightness outside the living room seemed dark and a little dank-smelling , and the straight-backed cello chair in its forgotten place near the piano made everything look stiff and old-fashioned . Noona crossed to the piano and snapped open the exercise book , which 98 I 'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU AGAIN Betty Jo had left there before she went out to play , and turned to a finger-smudged " Country Gardens . " " All right , " she said . " All right . Start with this . " That Betty Jo : she thought half the art of piano-playing lay in knowing how to sit down . Which was probably why she always came wearing organdy  --  she could bush it out , and then smooth it down , and sit on the edge of the piano bench prinking each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noona said , " You may begin , Betty Jo . " " Yes 'm . " Then the squirming about , working herself into the wood of the piano bench like someone testing out a new mattress . And the delicate stretching of toes toward the pedals , measuring distance , trying each pedal in turn ( she was n't even allowed to use them yet ) and finally the tentative fluffing of her curls which was the last step and had , as far as Noona could see , nothing to do with piano-playing . " Now ? " Noona asked . But she had spoken out of turn ; Betty Jo had already pounced upon the first note without warning . She stopped playing and twisted around in her seat to glare . " Sorry , " said Noona . " Country Gardens " began again , as deliberate as a military march . One thing Betty Jo did n't need was someone to count for her ( she moved her lips , saying numbers , as she played , and even her notes sounded like numbers ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things up and put them down again , She even went as far as the kitchen door , to see how her couch spread had turned out . It was half-dry , a splotched and stained peacock blue purpled with hideous flowers . She dropped the corner of the spread that she had been holding and leaned against the door , tilting her head back . Out in the living room the music pounded on , very determined . Well , there was a good strong rhythm there , even if it was misplaced . And precision . Who knew , maybe Betty Jo would be a good musician someday . At that moment one note slurred into another , and the next note was missed altogether , and then Betty Jo found the tune again and bore it away triumphantly , but Noona 's expression never changed . She was n't listening , anyway . In her mind she was hearing the beginning of a Processional she had composed once , tinkling far away in the music part of her mind .
