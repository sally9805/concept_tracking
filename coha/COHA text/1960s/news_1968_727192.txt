txt Now a Verdict From the Voters on de Gaulle PARIS  --  Anut the only thing that can bel , safely predicted ? about today , ' s , : firat round in the French national ' , eleCtiCn is that there will mass turnout . There alwayi is in France , as voting is coOldered.a civic duty ' that not many citizens fail to fulfill . It has been , a strange darn-paign , dominated ' by , events over ' which the ' politicians had no control Vr Preaidende Gaulle had had : his heart set a referendum in which the nation would have been askeCtO give him a personal vote of confidence by saying  --  yes ' to 4 , vague program , of social reform .. But the student and worker revolt , which the . President had hoped to still with his announcement of the referendum , merely grew louder and more violent , and the aging national hero , after a night of reflection in his country home and an afternoon of emotional dialogue with his army generals , decided reluctantly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call new ' elections . The campaign has never ceased to reflect the bitterness of those days . The ' words " civil war " have been used ? freely by many . The President set the keynote by accusing Communist totalitarianism of trying to take power by force . That was the first election ? speech . Last Friday night Premier Pompidou wound up the Gaullist campaign by charging that the opposition had started clandestine preparations for postelection violence . The Communist answer has been : " We love our country as much as anybody ; the Tricolor flag is nobody 's monopoly . " Independent observers agree that the Communists did not instigate the rebellion either of the students or ... the workers . Through the General Confederation of Labor , which they control , they managed to take charge of the strike movement , and today they claim that it was they who got the workers their large bread-and-butter gains . ' Civil War ? The left and , to some extent the center , suspect the President , and even more so Premier Pompidou , of wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support on the officers ' corps and on the far right , whom ' the Gaullists have been wooing since the beginning of the campaign . Jacques Duhamel , the centrist leader who is an anti-Communist without being a pro-Gaullist , opened his campaign by asking : " Will France avoid civil war ? " He asked for a " surge of good sense and reason " that would make the center strong enough to keep the country from " being rent by two hostile blocs . " Friday night Mr. Duhamel concluded his campaign on the same note when he said that unless the election strengthened the center and thus gave it a chance to change Government policies peacefully " we will within six months have an upheaval through anger and violence . " The fears of violence thus are expressed from right to left . The Gaullists went into the campaign with high hopes . General de Gaulle 's angry , commanding call to order , combined with his announcement of a new election , had been followed by a surge of pro-Gaullist feeling throughout the country . Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republic would win 300 seats , compared to the 199 it has now . No such predictions were made at the end of the week . The prevailing feeling now is that the Gaullist ? lan has nearly , if not wholly , spent itself . Two public opinion polls , conducted at the beginning of the week , indicated that Mr .. Pompidou 's group and Mr. Valery Giscard , d'Estaing 's Independent Republicans would gain between 1.7 and 2.7 per cent more votes than in the last election 15 months ago . The Communists , the two polls said , would incur a minor loss of half a per cent . Even if the polls are right , there is no way of . assessing their meaning in terms of seats . A small shift in the popular vote could conceivably bring major changes in the composition of the Assembly because 32 seats last year were won or lost with margins of fewer than 1,000 votes . Half of these seats belonged to Gaullists and their allies , half to the opposition . But other ' factors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electoral alliances , under which candidates in the run-off inherit the votes of less fortunate rivals . Agreements The Communists and the nonCommunist Federation of the Left go into the first ballot as rivals . But for the run-off they have an agreement that each of them , in each constituency , will throw its support to the leftist candidate who has the best chance of winning . Pompidou 's U.D.R . and Giscard d'Estaing 's Independent Republicans have a similar agreement , despite the bitter personal rivalry between the two men . The first round thus is a ? test mostly of the mood of the calmtry . The division of the electorate will become known . But few candidates will be elected , as more than half the number of votes cast are required for victory and four and more , candidates are present in virtually all constituencies . The real test will come a week later . By , then the complicated game of withdrawals will have been played out by the parties and the man with the largest number of votes will win in each constituency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
