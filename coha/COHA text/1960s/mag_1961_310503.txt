For all the public interest in fallout shelters , the U.S. Government has been slow to organize and guide the nation 's civil defense efforts . Last week came some encouraging signs of progress . On a post-Thanksgiving visit to the President in Hyannisport , Mass. , Defense Secretary Robert McNamara reported that a $207 million program to locate , identify and stock shelter areas in public buildings ( maximum capacity : 50 million people ) will be completed by next June-six months ahead of schedule . <P> The Administration is also moving slowly toward resolving other civil defense problems . A long-delayed booklet on fallout protection is still under discussion , but should be approved and released by year 's end . The President has also decided that civil defense should emphasize community fallout shelters ( for which some federal aid may be made available ) , although the Government will not in the least discourage individual homeowners who want to build their own .
