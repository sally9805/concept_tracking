Louise Day Hicks is a bulky grandmother who would not stand out in a supermarket crowd . Yet she stood out so far from nine male candidates in Boston 's nonpartisan primary last week that she may well become the city 's next mayor . With the general-election contest narrowed to herself and a bland fellow Democrat , Massachusetts Secretary of State Kevin White , it would take a rash bookie to rate the lady an underdog . <P> That , nonetheless , is the rating that she covets , and with good reason . Mrs. Hicks collected 28.1% of last week 's vote ( compared with White 's 19.8% ) , principally from the large blue-collar and lower-middle-class groups who feel bypassed by federal and city welfare programs and who support her unsuccessful attempts to block measures promoting public-school integration. * <P> They got the message when she repeatedly piped : " You know where I stand . " Another motto was " Boston for Bostonians . " Excluded by this definition are civil rights activists , Harvard intellectuals , suburbanites , Yankees , urban-renewal advocates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bipartisan coalition including Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy and Republican Governor John Volpe would support White meshed well with Mrs. Hicks ' strategy . " A powerful structure is coming into Boston to defeat the people , " she warned darkly . " I 'll take them all on . " <P> Sociological Theories . Her disguise as Lone Ranger pitted against the Beacon Hill and Cambridge Establishment is reminiscent of James Michael Curley 's durable appeal to Bostonians of another generation . And the notion that Kennedy men can not lose in cod country is illusory : Mayor John Collins , who is retiring after two terms , originally beat a Kennedy endorsee . Both Lawyer Hicks , 48 , and Lawyer White , 37 , are Irish Catholics , but Mrs. Hicks is the daughter of Judge William Day , whose memorial is a boulevard in the Irish quarter of South Boston , and her address allows her to warble Southie 's My Home Town with fidelity . White lives in the Beacon Hill section , suffers in the eyes of Southies from guilt by association with Brahmins . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prominence . Since being elected to the school committee six years ago , she has vigorously fought all attempts to break down Boston 's de facto school segregation . She opposes the bussing of pupils out of their neighborhoods on the ground that bussing destroys " freedom of choice , " and has opposed the open-enrollment system that permits Negro parents to register their children in predominantly white schools . Though a 1965 state law to promote racial balance now makes some student bussing unavoidable in Boston , Mrs. Hicks promises to fight the measure , condemns its goal as deriving from " arbitrary decisions based upon unproved sociological theories . " At the same time , she insists that she is an " ardent believer in civil rights for all , " noting that her best friend in law school was colored.
