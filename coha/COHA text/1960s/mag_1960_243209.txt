Grotesquely mixing buffoonery with terror , Nikita Khrushchev waddled on last week through the lovely little country that is Austria . At his side , wherever he went , was Austria 's embarrassed Chancellor Julius Raab . The favorite story in Vienna 's cafs : one of Khrushchev 's bodyguards asked an Austrian why Raab looked so gloomy . Replied the Austrian : " Too much friendship can be sickening . " <P> Just Like Hitler . Khrushchev 's portable platform was a scraggly , 15-bus convoy that wound through the peaceful Austrian countryside . For a starter , at the old Mauthausen concentration camp where 123,000 prisoners died , Khrushchev denounced German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer for " Hitler " policies and later elaborated on the theme : " Hitler opened his mouth and wanted to swallow everybody . Adenauer licks his lips , he gets angry , but he can not move from the spot . Should he attempt to touch the Socialist countries , he will be smashed immediately on the spot . Immediately ! " <P> At the mammoth VOeEST steel works ( formerly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been rebuilt with Marshall Plan dollars . " Who will help you ? " he cried . " The United States ? No ! Britain ? No ! West Germany ? No ! The capitalistic countries think of Austria as a competitor . We of the Soviet Union cooperate . " <P> Stiff-lipped but studiously correct , Chancellor Raab got the final shocker at a hotel banquet in Klagenfurt . " Neutrality is no mountain fastness , " Khrushchev warned . " The fight for peace concerns all people . The presence of rocket bases in northern Italy-and if they are used against the Socialist countries-would presuppose a violation of Austrian neutrality . " For its own sake , he said , Austria should warn Italy against " playing with fire . " The clear threat : if war should start , Russian troops would cross the Austrian border without compunction . <P> A Hand at the Tie . As always , Khrushchev could switch with bewildering speed from bully to ham . " Communism is my elixir of life , " he bragged . " All I want is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the world . " At one point , riding through the Alps by cable car , he burst into the Volga Boatmen 's song , insisted that Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko join in . While his wife Nina stayed humbly to the rear , he flirted with his attractive blonde Minister of Culture , Ekaterina Furtseva , 50 . They joined in frequent private giggles , and occasionally she straightened his tie . But the pace began to tell . Khrushchev was pale and fatigued by evening , and Wife Nina worried to a friend : " He 's trying to do too much . " <P> Though Raab remained diplomatically silent through Nikita 's tirades , the Austrian people made their feelings plain . Most boycotted Khrushchev 's public appearances ; special Masses were held for the " silent Church " behind the Iron Curtain . " A demagogue is using Austria as a base for propaganda rockets , " cried the Vienna daily Express .
