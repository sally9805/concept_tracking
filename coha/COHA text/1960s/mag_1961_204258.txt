A barber with stiff fingers is a barber without a job ; so Barber William D. was desperate when his hands-particularly his overworked right hand-became crippled by arthritis . Last week William D. , 52 , could again hold his scissors , and was working on a light schedule in an Iowa city . In place of the diseased bone in the middle joints of his right fingers were stainless steel hinges . <P> The barber 's case was one of the most successful among 25 patients in whom Orthopedic Surgeon Adrian E. Flatt has installed a total of 92 steel joints at Iowa City 's University Hospitals . Some have been working well for 3 years . British-born Dr. Flatt got the idea from Colonel Earl W. Brannon , who devised a similar steel hinge for U.S. Air Force accident victims . But Dr. Flatt has modified the hinge and adapted the technique to the knuckle and middle joints , which are most often frozen by arthritis . <P> To put in hinges , Dr. Flatt cuts back the ends of both bones that form the defective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the synovial membrane , which encloses the natural joint , because this is an important site of arthritic disease . He inserts the double-prong ends of the two hinge parts into the squishy centers ( marrow canals ) of the cut-off bones . Muscles and tendons must then be slipped into their proper places with exquisite care . <P> At first , Dr. Flatt used a hinge with a single prong at each end , but found that a finger might rotate around this . So he switched to double prongs which can not twist . Though originally designed for middle joints , the hinges are proving most useful as replacements for knuckles . <P> There have been a few failures in what Dr. Flatt cautiously insists is still an experimental operation . It is , he estimates , suitable for only about one in eight of the arthritic patients who would have some kind of joint surgery anyway . But other surgeons are trying it hopefully . For patients so crippled that they could not even tie shoes , moderate relief is a boon . A few , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the operation .
