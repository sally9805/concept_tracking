When it comes to antismoking campaigns , the British government 's has been no more successful than the U.S. 's . Though it has not imposed U.S.-style health warnings on cigarette packs , the Labor government took the drastic step of outlawing all cigarette commercials on television , last year persuaded cigarette manufacturers to limit other advertising as well . Nonetheless , half of all British adults remain on cigarettes , and the past two years have seen a steady increase in consumption among young people . Confronted with a tax-heavy price of 75 a pack , Britons seem largely indifferent to the health scare , economically they continue to smoke their cigarettes down to the final finger-burning puff . <P> Dart Boards &; Holidays . Last week the tobacco industry came in for fresh trouble . The government took disturbed note of the fact that manufacturers have more than matched the decrease in their advertising budgets with major expenditures-$84 million in 1966-on gift-coupon promotions . With coupon-bearing cigarettes now accounting for 55% of all sales , British smokers use the premiums to get everything from dart boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Commons , Minister of Health Kenneth Robinson announced that the government would introduce legislation to abolish cigarette coupons , take additional steps " to control or ban " certain other promotional and advertising practices . <P> Two cigarette makers , Gallaher ( leading brands : Senior Service and Kensitas ) and Carreras ( Guards and Rothmans ) , had already expressed their willingness to accept a coupon ban , even without legislation .

For its part , Imperial insisted that the coupon promotions , while successful in brand competition among those who already smoke , do little to lure nonsmokers to the fold . Chairman John Partridge warned that Imperial would cut its prices if the coupon ban goes through , added that cheaper smokes could " have the effect of increasing total cigarette consumption " far more than gift premiums were ever able to do . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cashing in their coupons for gifts , many of them failing to realize that the contemplated legislation will probably take a year to go into effect . London newspapers were edgy about the possibility that the crackdown might include a ban on all cigarette advertising . Editorially , some papers began to inveigh against abuse of government control . Said the Daily Telegraph : " Freedom must include the right to take calculated risks even to life itself . " <P> More to the point , so far as the government was concerned , was the likelihood that the latest measures would do little to curb smoking . And since tobacco brings in $2.8 billion in annual tax revenues , there were suspicions that the government preferred it that way .
