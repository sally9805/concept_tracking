txt The cost of business credit rose across the country yesterday as major banks increased their minimum rate on short-term business loans to 51/2 per cent from 5 per cent . The rise in the prime rate , initiated by the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York , 1Itriggered a sharp decline in prices on the New York Stock Exchange in heavy trading . The selloff wiped out a 6.90-point rise in the Dow-Jones industrial average , which closed with a 0.61-point loss . Bankers cited technical money-market factors as the immediate impetus for the rate rise . More broadly , however , surging demand for credit has been pushing interest rates upward for several months , and the Morgan Guaranty action was the latest evidence of this trend . Uptrend Persists The consequence of the trend to higher money costs , bankers said yesterday , is likely to be pervasive ? for consumers as well as for business . Interest costs will be higher , lenders are likely to be more selective in granting loans , and rates paid to savers will probably continue Ito climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last Dec. 6 , the banks increased the rates to 5 per cent from . 4% per cent . This followed an ind ' crease by the Federal Reserve in the discount rate ? at which member banks borrow from ' Reserve banks  --  to 4% per cent from 4 per cent . But in sharp contrast to last 1December , when there was loud debate over the prime-rate increase , this time neither the Administration nor the quasiindependent Federal Reserve had any immediate comment on the increase . This led many bankers to the conclusion that President Johnson , at least tacitly , might " accept " the rate increase as a necessary step to cool off the booming American economy . Morgan Guaranty 's action brought the prime rate to the highest level ever attained by fee , which was established by the banks in the mid-nineteenthirties . It was then set at 11/% per cent , a rate below which banks considered lending to be " totally unprofitable . " The last time that top-quality , short-term business loans cost as much as 5 ; 4 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1928 until early 1930 , when rates moved briefly to a peak of over 6 per cent . In fact , the banks took their action in raisingcthe prime rate against the backdrop drop of an increasingly tight-money policy on the part of the Federal Reserve . The Reserve authorities , in effect , have moved to enforce their Dec. 6 increase in the discount rate by reducing the availability of funds for expansion of credit . Rate to Brokers Raised ' As part of yesterday 's rate increase some  --  but not all  --  of the banks increased tke rate they charge on loans te'stocIFbrokers to 51,4 per cent from 514 , per cent This increase , too , was expected to become general within a short period of time . The brokers ' loan rate was increased from 5 per cent in January , also with Morgan Guaranty leading the way . The rise in the brokers ' loan rate , bankers said , is likely to be largely passed along to customers , which will make it more expensive to speculate in stocks and bonds on ? credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour by ? the Bankers Trust Company of New York and then adopted by nearly all the other large banks in the country , is part of an upward spiral in interest rates that has swept the nation since Dec. 6 . Upsurge Widespread The upsurge is gradually reaching into almost every nook and cranny in the economy ' , and last night it was impossible to find an economist who was willing to say that he felt that the rise had now run its course . The trend has brought this situation in key areas of credit : ' Business loan rates are up sharply . ' ates paid on individual savings accounts have risen in many areas of the country . Some banks in New York are now paying ' 5 per cent for time deposits as small as $2,500 and for periods as short as a year . eThe cost of unsecured personal loans has been increased at banks in the New York area , and could well be increased again in the ' wake - of the most recent ' increase in the prime rate . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb arid probably will ' continue to do so . The statutory rate - on loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration has been increased to 5% per cent , and there have been loud complaints ' from professional mortgage ' men that the increase wa , not adeeuate . ' The cost of financing a new car has been increased by many of the nation 's major sales finance ? in quiet and largely unannounced actions ? and further increases are likely following yesterday 's increase in the prime rate . The rate increase Is especially important , to the finance companies since they are essentially " jobbers of money  --  buying it wholesale from the banks and in the money and capital market and then selling it retail to consumers . Indeed , one of the few areas in the economy where the latest increase in the prime rate is not likely to be felt is among those who borrow from smallloan , or consumer-finance companies , where rates can range as high as 36 per cent a year . These companies are for the most part already charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Others The prime rate is a minimum lending rate that is accorded only to major borrowers of the best credit standing . Other borrowers have to pay more . Thus , in a state with a maximum interest rate or 6 per cent ? Minnesota , Georgia , North Carolina , and Washington were mentioned by bankers yesterday  --  the usury laws , as one banker put it , " definitely cramp our style . " In New York State , there is no maximum rate on a bank loan to a corporation . On loans to individuals , there is a maximum of 6 per cent , but banks are allowed to deduct the ' interest charge in advance . Surging ? credit demands and an exuberant national economy that is showing signs of overheating are the basic reasons for the prime-rate increase . But at the same time , there were a variety of technical factors that made the case for an increase ? compelling from the banker 's point of view . Technical Factors The most important of these was the fact that interest rates in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 5 per cent . Thomas S. Gates , chairman of Morgan , Guaranty and the last Secretary of Defense in the Eisenhower Administration , put it this way in explaining his bank 's move : " We hope that this change in our rate structure , along with our continued application Of selectivity as to the purpose of bank credit and appropriate restraints as to its amount , will help to defer certain types . of borrowing and will encourage corporations to make-more use of the long-term bond and equity markets ' as sources of funds for their capital purposes . " A spokesman for ' Morgan Guaranty elaborated on " Mr. Gates ' remarks : ' Bank money has been the cheapest around . There was a disincentive ' for corporations to satisfy their rong-term money needs in the capital market. , : If this adjustment had not been made , there were sign 's ' that ' a build-up in loan demand of nuts . sive proportions could have developed.7                   @ @
