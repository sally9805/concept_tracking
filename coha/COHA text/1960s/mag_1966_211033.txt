It was a most unlikely confrontation . In a clear-cut civil rights dispute , both protagonists were white . One was a judge , the upholder of law and order , the other a clergyman , ordinarily the advocate of peace and patience . Yet the test of wills between Milwaukee Circuit Judge Robert Cannon and the Rev. James Edward Groppi ( rhymes with puppy ) , a Roman Catholic priest , kept the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa in constant turmoil for two weeks , and last week brought out the Wisconsin National Guard to keep peace for the first time in 32 years . <P> Politics &; Eagles . The trouble began when Father Groppi , 35 , led the N.A.A.C.P. Youth Council in picketing Judge Cannon 's house in Wauwatosa to protest his membership in the Fraternal Order of Eagles , a men 's organization that , like such similar groups as the Elks , Moose and Odd Fellows , specifically excludes non-Caucasians ( one prominent Eagle : David Lawrence , chairman of the President 's Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunity in Housing ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , figured that he would therefore be the most likely to give in and leave the white-only nest . <P> In this it was mistaken . A vocal opponent of the discriminatory clause within the Milwaukee aerie , Judge Cannon , 49 , argued that he could best change Eagle policy by remaining within the organization-and that he would not , in any event , yield to pressure . Said he : " I 've got my Irish up now . " Actually , a majority of judges in Milwaukee-17 out of 26-are members of the Eagles , which generally helps informally in their elections , and most look upon membership as a positive political advantage despite the obvious strains between a judge 's duty to be impartial and the clear partiality of the Eagles . <P> More a Messiah . Up against Judge Cannon 's immovability came Father Groppi , who is the assistant pastor of St. Boniface 's , a church with an almost all-Negro congregation in the heart of the city 's " Inner Core , " or black ghetto . The priest has made the Negro 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous Selma march and made frequent trips to Mississippi to carry food , books and clothing to civil rights workers . Before the picketing of Judge Cannon 's home , he had become well known in Milwaukee-and earned a reprimand from his ecclesiastical superiors-for organizing a four-day boycott of public schools to protest de facto segregation . <P> To Negro youths around St. Boniface 's , Groppi is more a messiah than a leader . To be even closer to them , the priest moved last July from his rectory to Freedom House , a residence and office he set up for the youth council . So " totally immersed " in the Negro 's problems is he , says his superior , St. Boniface 's Pastor Eugene Bleidorn , that Father Groppi is " a Negro with white skin . " Adds Groppi himself : " I will picket with the Negro , I will go South with him , I will go to jail with him , and I will hang with him if it need be . " <P>          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
