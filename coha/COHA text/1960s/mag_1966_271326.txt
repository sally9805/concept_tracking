<P> Orin O'Brien , 31 , the newest member of the New York Philharmonic , scurried into Philharmonic Hall one rainy night last week and , ignoring the musicians ' locker room , got dressed in a washroom . It was not a hazing rite . Indeed , no rookie has ever been so warmly accepted by the orchestra ; to a man they say , " Orin is one of the boys . " Only Orin is one of the girls-the only girl , in fact , in the 104-member orchestra , a situation unique at the Philharmonic , so there is yet no place for her to dress . <P> Miss O'Brien , who is as curvy as the double bass she plays , does not mind . On tour , the men make up for it by falling all over themselves to carry her bags , and save her a seat on the bus . More than that , she is justifiably proud of breaking the sex barrier at the Philharmonic , which , apart from female harpists , has never in its 125-year history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orin struggled through ten years and several auditions before she finally won the job this year over 33 men bass players . <P> Rare Birds . Elsewhere in the U.S. , lady musicians are having a heyday . The Cleveland Orchestra now has 11 , the San Francisco 17 , the Houston 25 and the American Symphony 44 . Trombonist Betty Glover , 43 , adds class to the brass of the Cincinnati Symphony ; Helen Taylor , 24 , plays a mean English horn for the Houston Symphony . The rare bird in the Los Angeles aviary is Barbara Winters , 28 , who , to produce the needed penetrating sounds from her oboe , must pit her trim 120 lbs . against male fellow oboists who average a burly-chested 200 Ibs . To maintain the exceptional breath control necessary to control her contrary instrument , Winters swims and works out daily at a gym . " It leaves me almost no time for social life , " she says . " I 'd hate to think what I would do if I were married . " <P> Peggy Lucchesi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timpani and beats the big bass drum for the San Francisco Symphony . While most married symphony women practice the " offbeat rhythm method " - that is , plan their babies for delivery during the off-season-Peggy merrily pounds away on her drum practically right into the labor room . Before her last delivery , the boys in the band room were betting that the baby would be born with its hands clapped over its ears . <P> Telltale Clicking . Despite the undeniable excellence of the ladies , some men musicians and conductors still view them with a wary eye . They subscribe to Sir Thomas Beecham 's dictum : " If she is attractive , I ca n't perform with her ; if she is not , then I wo n't . " Lady-Killer Zubin Mehta , 30 , who appreciates a well-turned ankle as much as a well-played musical phrase , has different reasons . He has enforced a limit of 16 women in his Los Angeles Philharmonic , because " a woman 's life in the orchestra is not as long as a man 's ; she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 60. "
