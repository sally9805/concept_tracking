One thing about Henry David Thoreau , when he talked about civil disobedience , he was n't kidding . Because of his opposition to the Mexican War , he refused to pay a tax and was hustled off to jail . To express their own hostility to the Viet Nam war , 448 contemporary writers and journalists went along with Thoreau last week-or rather part of the way . Quoting Thoreau 's ringing challenge to the state , the signers* announced in full-page ads in the New York Post and the New York Review of Books that " 1 ) None of us voluntarily will pay the proposed 10% income tax surcharge or any war-designated tax increase . 2 ) Many of us will not pay that 23% of our current income tax which is being used to finance the war in Viet Nam . " <P> That is not exactly the stuff of which martyrs are made . Chances of the tax surcharge being enacted are still doubtful . Even the one-third of the signers who refuse to pay present taxes are not likely to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years on grounds of pacifism . Since they have reported their income and paid part of their tax , the Internal Revenue Service does not take them to court . It attaches their bank accounts or other assets to recover the rest of the tax , plus a penalty of 6% a year . With this in mind , some pacifists keep enough cash in their checking accounts to save themselves and the IRS a lot of trouble . <P> Eight newspapers felt that the ad advocated violation of U.S. law and refused to carry it . One of the papers to turn it down was the New York Times - much to the chagrin of the ten signers who work for the paper . <P> <P> * Among the quasi-Thoreaus : Nelson Algren , James Baldwin , Eric Bentley , Allen Ginsburg , Paul Goodman , Betty Friedan , Dwight Macdonald , Henry Miller , Terry Southern , Benjamin Spock , William Styron.
