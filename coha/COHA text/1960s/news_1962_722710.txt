txt Instead of nabbing scads of untenable travelers , the much-heralded penalty plan lot " no-show " ' airline passengers is demonstrating that 90 ' , of the industry 's problem has been its own doing Starting last Max ' , major airlines imposed fines of 50 , : - of the ticket price , with a $5 minimum and a $40 maximum , on passengers failing to honor their reservations .. The plan 's operation has revealed . The ail lines ' good-sized lists of absentees have included many names of passengers who actually canceled out but were n't checked off by reset vation clerks . The records include numerous instances where one airline has simply failed to connect passengers to another line 's plane on time ; these , , no , have been counted as no-shows . The results show real absentees have been equal to less than l " , ; - of all passengers who have boarded planes That 's a far cry from the 10% rite often mentioned in the past . Some Lines Hall " Success " Airline and Government officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , of course . Quite the contrary . With some carriers citing the plan 's " success . " 11 major airlines recently voted to continue the program beyond the Oct 31 expiration date of the original trial . The Civil Aeronautics Board , which backs the plan to boost ailing airline finances , blessed its results as " beneficial . " The hoard claims it has cut no-shows from a number equal to 9 8% of all passengers boarded in April to 6 9 ' 4 in July , no later figures have been compiled . The board is expected to approve extension of the experiment . Behind the hurrahs. however , lies disenchantment One CAB official says " the passenger-created no-show problem was a myth " A board member is reconsidering his original vote in favor of the plan . And at the same meeting where the carriers voted to continue the scheme , few industry spokesmen exhibited exuberance at results so far . One airline official dubs it a " phony . " All this casts doubt on the plan 's permanence . Since absentees who cancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to pay penalties , experts got a good idea of the true extent of the noshow problem by totaling the fines actually levied . Last July , the number of assessments was less than 26,000 , equal to only 0.69% of the nearly 4 million passengers *ho actually flew then . This was roughly one-tenth of the 6.9% no-show rate quoted by the CAB for that month . The remaining nine-tenths were probably traceable to airline errors , experts say . Many Erroneous Bills Airline errors also have raised a question of whether the real assessment rate may not be lower yet . For example , airlines mailed out no-show penalty bills totaling $957,176 in the first three months of the experiment , but collected only $26,660 . Checking , the CAB discovered that many mailed bills were " erroneous " - probably mole than 50 ' , , say ai ? - line and CAB officials . If most absentees are truly innocent , as first figures suggest , there 's a distinct possibility the board will eventually junk or severely alter the penalty plan Public complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in light of new disclosures , forcing the CAB to change course . Equally important is the possibility that penalties might drive away airline passengers at a time when the CAR is straining to put the industry in better shape . More than a year ago , a CAB staff report warned that penalties are palatable only if passengers are at fault , adding " there is a strong incentive from a sales standpoint to keep the demands upon a customer at an absolute minimum . " Further , said the staff : " If the no-show is predominately the result of record error , improvement in record-keeping , rather than passenger penalty would be in order . " Even the plan 's opponents , however , favor further trial . They say experience indicates there 's been a general tightening of airline procedures to keep track of passengers . Even some big carriers that were prepared to pull out of the pact have been impressed a little by this result . Says a spokesman for one of these carriers : " We maintained originally that airlines , not passengers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is that first reports show airlines cause 90% of no-shows ; we estimated 80% . But the plan is at least showing some effect in improving reservation systems . "
