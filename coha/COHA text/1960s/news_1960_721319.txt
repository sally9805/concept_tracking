txt WASHINGTON , Sunday , July 3 ? A Congressional drive to recess for the national conventions was prolonged into the early hours today by a House and Senate quarrel over some fine points in the Cuban sugar quota . After the Senate had passed compromise , stop-gap sugar legislation Shortly after 2 A. M. , the House disputed some of the language and called for a conference . Just before 4 A .. M. the conference was still in progress . It was generally believed , however , that the dispute would be resolved and allow Congress to start its planned recess later today . The Senate was planning to return Aug. 8 , the House on Aug. 15 . Passed by Voice Vote The Senate passed the compromise plan by a voice vote . Earlier , on a key test , the measure was upheld , 30 to 29 , with forty-one absentees . The closeness of the vote did not reflect any reluctance to grant the President an economic weapon against Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba . Rather it reflected a deep political quarrel over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar supplies caused by a Cuban cutoff . Many Senators complained because there had been no Senate committee hearing and protested that few members had any clear idea of what the bill would do . In broad outline , it amends the present Sugar Quota Act 's ( provisions for the rest of 1960 , and requires Congress to deal with extension of the sugarquota system when it returns in August after the recess . Can Cut Quota at Once The President is given authority to reduce the Cuban quota immediately . Any deficit in American supplies would be made up in increased purchases from Panama , Haiti , the Netherlands , Philippines , Costa Rica and Taiwan . Domestic producers would also benefit , though not so liberally as many had hoped . Their opposition to the percentage increase in their share of the market accounted for much of the Senate opposition .

Two of the four major bills still pending face hard battles on the Senate floor . These are the minimum-wage bill and the bill to provide medical care for the aged . As passed by the House , the minimum wage bill is designed to raise the present minimum from $1 to 4.15 an hour and bring about 1,400,000 more eemployesoyes under the Jaw , though granting them only about $1 in unanimous shouting vote , it sent the Senates resolutio the the refor CONGRESS RECESS SNARLED BY FIGHT Continued From rage 1 , Col. 8 day if it recessed without passing the sugar bill .

Also involved , however , were an intricate cross-current of internal political pressure and an outburst of jurisdictional antagonism . A House-passed bill sent to the Senate on Friday would have extended the present Sugar Act through 1961 while giving the President authority to curtail Cuba 's share . Broadly , domestic beet-sugar producers were dissatisfied with the House bill , which they felt did not give them an adequate share of allocation . On the other hand , Democratic sponsors of the House bill were reluctant to grant too high a percentage to domestic producers for fear that the Administration might make allocations during the campaign in the beet-sugar states that could amount to political vote priming . The House bill was sent to the Senate with a warning from the House leadership that it was not to be tampered with if the Senate hoped to get a Finally about 10 P.

The Administration 's eagerness to get quick action stems from a fear that a six-week delay during the Congressional recess would give the Castro Government time to deliver all of its 1960 quota in the United States . So far this year it has shipped about .2,200,000 tons of its quota of 3,119,655 tons . The dispute over sugar was the climax of an otherwise long and listless , session in which both houses passed a group of fairly minor bills . Both houses were seeking to clear the way guarantees and excluding them for a long holiday , spiced with from time-and-one-half proviconvention politics before tackling major domestic bills critical to the election campaign .

It reported to the Senate floor a resolution that , in effect , - temporized on the issue by giving the President immediate authority to cut Cuban quotas ? between now and Jan. 1 , 1961 , The required extension of the Sugar Act after that time would have been worked out when Congress returned here in August . The Senate adopted the resolution by a vote of 84 to 0 and sent it to the House . There it met a furious reception . It was argued that the resolution was unconstitutional , on the ground that the House alone could originate revenue Measures and that the Senate 's action amounted to a usurpation of the House 's Constitutional prerogative .

Both houses have already passed differing bills providing funds for school construction , but the Rules Committee threatens to kill them by refusing to permit a conference .

A drafting mistake in the House bill , however , would actually strip protection from about 14,00J,000 workers .
