( See Cover ) <P> There are people in the pews , dollars in the collection plates , and 65 million Americans who claim to be Protestants . But the outwardly prosperous Christian churches are beset with inner anxiety . Ministers fear that their congregations are no more committed to the church than to the country club . Denominational leaders despair at the widespread lay unwillingness to recognize the race question as a moral issue . In the current national controversy over school prayer , and in the rising challenges to church tax exemptions , theologians detect a trend toward secularism that will soon call for a revolution in church attitudes and institutions . Changes in manners and morals summon Protestantism to find a new mode of relevance in a " post-Christian " world . <P> It is a crisis that faces every faith - but none more so than the Methodist Church , which last week opened its quadrennial General Conference in Pittsburgh 's Civic Arena . With 10,234,986 members , Methodism is the second largest Protestant communion in the U.S.*After the Roman Catholic Church , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its history and geographical distribution , has the best claim to be the only truly national Protestant denomination . This year many of the 858 Methodist delegates arrived at their conference with the deep conviction that their church had reached a turning point in history-and with a scarcely concealed fear that the vitality that once burned in Methodism was lost when fiery evangelism gave way to today 's organized , institutional church . <P> The Better Way . Fear there may be , but not to the exclusion of hope . Methodism would not be itself without a large measure of Christian optimism , and the conference 's sense of expectation was expressed by Bishop Gerald Kennedy of Los Angeles in the episcopal address that opened the meeting . The Christian task , he told the delegates and more than 8,000 visitors from Methodist churches around the world , is " to pursue our ancient course of attacking our own imperfections , keeping our life open to God , and perfecting our society . We are not trying to sell a system , but to demonstrate a Way which is incomparably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a more abundant life for all men . " <P> Kennedy 's episcopal address was a kind of spiritual state-of-the-union message , and he had been selected by his church 's 81 bishops to write and present it in their name . The right man , in this case , was in the right pulpit , for the Bishop of Los Angeles has assumed the mantle worn by the late G. Bromley Ox-nam as unofficial spokesman for Methodism to the rest of the U.S. Nobody gave Kennedy the job , and nobody could . Democratic Methodism has neither Pope nor primate ; the presidency of the Council of Bishops-an office held by Kennedy in 1960 and currently by New York 's Lloyd Wicke-passes yearly from man to man , and involves only the function of chairing the semiannual meetings of the Methodist hierarchy . The church speaks with a united voice only once every four years , at the General Conference . Between times , Methodists everywhere in search of guidance listen with special care whenever Gerald Kennedy takes a stand .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
