63 There 's a Camel in My Cocktail A story by William Eastlake " Give me the meaning of life in five words , " Martha said . We sat outside the Sidi el Aide in Marrakech , February 25 , 1965 , waiting for the king to show up . The king was Hassan the Second and the king was late . The dark Berbers and the bright Bedouins and the small chanting Arabs from the Rif were waiting too , all down the Avenue Moulay el Hassan and the Mohammed Cinque . At the Djemba el Fna the Arabs from the country were excited about the carnival , the circus of dancing lmris , snake charmers , loud , jeweled , gesturing tellers of stories of the feats of Abd el Krim , and the dancing pigeons and the camel that stood on one leg and the Americans with beards . King Hassan the Second was visiting his winter palace in Marrakech , a splendid fairy jeweled pal-ace surrounded by parks of palms . Bedecked , bejeweled and bewhiskered and betasseled , the coal-black Zouave attendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank , under ribbons of red and bright gold and flags of red and green stars and coronets of wild , gay-blowing flowers , the flag and the heraldry of Morocco . The king was late . " It looks like the king wo n't show , " Mike said . " He 'll be along in a hit , " Ian said . " You American chaps are paying the bill . " Mike gazed into his drink , his crystal ball . " There 's a camel in my cocktail , " Mike said . We had met Mike on the boat , on the Italian liner Leonardo da Vinci , when we were coming over from the States a long time ago , two months . And we had picked up Ian Decker for the first time here at the Caf ? Sidi el Aide . He was in the Caf ? Sidi el Aide like everyone else waiting for the king . Everyone else included tw Canadian girls of eighteen and Martha , my wife . The two Canadian girls had hitchhiked from Vancouver , British Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots , and bulky knit sweaters , which made them look like shedding camels . " They 're not going to get the king here on time , " Mike said . " Why do n't we visit the storks ? " " The storks " is what we called the three American boys from Antioch who wore Levi 's and smoked hashish and lived on the line between the Marrakech Medina and Kasbah . They lived on the upper floor of a house built before Christ and reached by a very small outer stairwell . The floor had two apartments . The Berbers and the Riffs and the Bedouins and all the other Arab tourists slept on the floor in one apartment , cocooned in their djeabas , waiting for the king as they had done for eons , their ancestors , for three thousand years in this identical place . It was like going into a burning house . The hashish smoke billowed out as we opened the door . It was a heavy deep blue layer upon layer of palpable cloud on cloud so that as you moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you became enveloped and disappeared . I could see a light somewhere ahead and now I came upon one of the young American gentlemen in Levi 's under a hooded robe . He wore a blue turtleneck sweater with a large A on it and was reading a magazine called Defeat . Next to this gentleman from Antioch College I could make out the two others in the receding , coiling-toward-the-door smoke . They were holding their hashish pipes , clutching them as though we were a threat . They wore the uniform too , the beard , the sweat shirt , and the Levi 's , and they wore the same identical anxious-64 THERE 'S A CAMEL IN MY COCKTAIL to-please , retreating , and sorry-to-have-been-born expressions as though the act of smoking hashish bestowed upon them some absolutely blank and inferior status . " Mike here , " I said , " thought you might help him with a camel . " " I dare say , " the boy from Antioch said . We have been waiting a long time for the king , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " Ian said . " And rather than do something foolish we decided to ride a camel . " " No , " I said . " Mike is going to ride the camel . Mike saw a camel in his crystal hall . He 's the one that 's got to prove something . He 's the cowboy from Colorado . He 's the one who ca n't or wo n't smoke hashish and is worried about it . " " I dare say , " the boy from Antioch said . " Stop saying that , " I said , " and tell me , you 've been here a long time , tell me if you have a friend with a camel , know anyone who would rent one . " " Oh , I dare say , " the boy from Antioch said . And then I realized he must be some kind of mechanical gadget who could say this and nothing more , something a magi had produced and was still surrounded in smoke , something that would disappear when the smoke left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some pot ? " they said . " No , " I said . " T do n't smoke it . It does n't bother any of us that we do n't smoke it except Mike . That 's why he 's looking for a camel . " " That makes sense , " the beards said . " You 've probably come to the only place in the world where that statement would make sense . " " That 's why I came here , " I said . " Let me introduce these two Canadian girls who are shedding ; Ian here , wearing a British accent . The easel Martha is carrying is a Double-Crostic . " " The meaning of life in five words ? " Martha said . " And as I said , " I said , " Mike here is looking for a camel . What 's wrong with this man who keeps saying I dare say ? " I said . The gentleman I referred to said in a very low slow rusty voice , " I dare say . " Now one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pretended to crank him with a quick circular William Eastlake 's war experience in the Battle of the Bulge went into his most recent novel , " Castle Keep , " and his cow-punching days in New Mexico were background for " The Bronc People . " His stories about the Navahos first appeared in " Harper 's " in 1955 . As is evident in " There 's a Camel in My Cocktail , " Mr. Eastlake has recently visited another continent . movement . He cranked him fast for about one minute then touched the man 's ear as you would touch a button and the man cranked began to say repetitively in a high voice , " I dare say I dare say I dare say I dare say . " After two minutes of this there was one final long rundown " Oh  --  I dare  --  say , " before he quit . " Do you want to buy him ? " one of the other beards said , the man who had cranked him . " We 've sold him many times . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " " I had a horse like that too , " Mike said . put a few dirhams on the low table . " No , " I said , " this is how you make a living . It 's a pretty good act . As good as the snake charmers , better than the fakirs and the dancing pigeons . " " Oh I dare say , " the rusty voice said quietly . The two Canadian girls stood in the doorway as the smoke fled out and up so that our high stork house on the edge of the Medina at the city wall must have looked like an embattled Kasbah sending signals in smoke to the Rif Mountains of Abd el Krim . The smoke was too much for the real stork and soon we could hear him flap away making a cracking noise like a broken helicopter . The stork should have been used to the smoke now , perhaps selected this spot to enjoy it , probably had a reputation among storks for delinquency , but enough was enough . I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-circular shape . There was a flimsy straight wall of thick bamboo that separated the boys from Antioch from the Arabs , the Bedouins , and the people from the Rif come to the market and sleeping here for the night . The Arabs must have thought their roommates strange , weird , and exotic creatures , sly and terrible , and from a distant dark country . " We were at the Sidi el Aide Caf ? , " I said , " near the souks waiting for the king . " " The king , " one of the boys from Antioch said , and they all began to pull on their djellabas . Their djellabas had fallen down to their hips so that I thought they were swathed in sheets or blankets , but now they pulled them up and I could see that all the boys from Antioch had on hooded djellabas just like the other Arabs in back of the bamboo wall . " This is not nonsense on my part , " I said . " I 'm here to write about this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Morocco unless you 've seen a camel close and I do n't even feel I 've seen Morocco . My closest camel so far was about two hundred yards away , so when Mike saw this camel in his cocktail I thought this would be a good opportunity for me to see one close up . I mean he 's got the idea he wants to ride one , so I figured this would be my chance . " " Oh I dare say . " " I guess you can shut up , " I said . " I 've had enough of that . " " Oh I dare say . " Now I pressed his other ear , the opposite of the one the man had pressed to start him . Both his eyes turned slowly in their sockets and his pupils moved like BBs , then he was absolutely quiet . " Well , " one of the other Antioch boys said , knocking out his pipe , " I have got a Bedouin friend down here in the market who travels in camels but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shrove Tuesdays . " " Wo n't he be in to greet the king ? " " Bedouins are against all kings , all authorities . But I have another friend , an Arab who sleeps here on the other side of the screen , a very nice All American Boy Arab who does n't smoke , who buys camels here at auction and turns them over for a few dirhants at his home in Oukaimedem . If you want to ride one and can go a little way with him in the direction of Oukaimedem I think he 'd appreciate your breaking it for him . He generally buys wild ones at discounts . " " What do you say , Mike ? " " All right , " Mike said . " Just because I want to write about a camel , " I said , " I do n't want to push you into anything . " " No , that 's all right , " Mike said . When we were all down on the Place Djemba el Fna the boys from Antioch introduced us to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild camels . He must have spoken five or six languages . I say this because he spoke some English and you do n't often sell a camel to an Englishman . For a time in his youth he said he worked for a black-market concession in a souk in Tangiers when it was an international part . Maybe he had learned his English there instead of from some camel-buying Lawrence in Oukaimedem . The clean-cut Arab said his name was Mohammed and he also said you 'd go a long way in the Arab countries before you 'd find a man who was n't called Mohammed . " Now which among you is going to help me with the camel ? " Mohammed said . " I am , " Mike said , raising his hand . " I 've been dickering for a racing camel at the airport for three days now . He 's a real dog but he can move , " Mohammed said . " At the airport ? " I said . " Yes , " Mohammed said . " They have phased out all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by William Eastlake 65 when the Americans were given permission to build them we saw they had excellent possibilities . " " A place to trade camels ? " " And race them , " Mohammed said . We moved through the Medina ; Mohammed knew a shortcut across the Kasbah that brought us out in front of the souks at el Mouket . We caught the bus close by at the Harat that took us past the great Souk el Khemis . A souk is any marketplace . This one went on and on until we got to the edge of Marrakech ; then we started through the palm groves that got us out into the flat country , ideal for airfields , bomber bases , and , when the bombers become obsolete , there are always camels . Mohammed had obviously learned his English from the American soldiers at the base . " I want you to take a good look at this dog , " Mohammed said to Mike . " He says it 's a sprained tendon but I think it 's a small bone in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I can tell , " Mike said . " You know camels ? " " I know horses , " Mike said . " They got the same problems . " " Is n't it a small world , " Mohammed said philosophically . " Who 'd have thought that at my age I would learn , riding in a bus past the Sidi el Abbes , that a horse was the same as a camel . " " A horse is a camel without the hump , " I said . The three boys from Antioch said nothing . They were all dressed in hooded djellabas of different-dyed camel hair . When their hands were back they looked like young martyred Christs . With the visored hoods down-slanting over their foreheads 66 THERE 'S A CAMEL IN MY COCKTAIL they did not quite look like sly and evil Berbers and Bedouins skulking down from the hills for a holy war ; they looked like Antioch boys a long way from home . We came to a big sign about twelve feet high that read , SAC 149th BOMBER GROUP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROFESSION . The bus ran along the fence now that had been stolen . " The chain-link fence , " Mohammed said , " was stolen while the Americans were still here , while they were still guarding it . The story goes , " Mohammed said , " there was a period of three weeks when the Arabs removed a B59 jet . They carried it away like ants , piece by piece and one morning it was not there . " " Probably not true , " I said . " Yes , " Mohammed said . " The story is probably not true , but last week there was a souk established in the Medina , the first one , for airplane parts , propellers , engines , all parts . " " A B59 jet does n't have a propeller . " " That 's right , " Mohammed said . " It does n't have anything now . " Now we turned into the main gate of the air base ; that is , we turned into the place where the gate had been stolen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . The place looked as though it had been constructed for camel raising . Piles of camel dung were stacked neatly down the runway as far as you could see . Camels were not the only animals being traded . There were mules , asses , horses , goats , sheep , pigeons , sparrows , and one man had an airplane tire , but the camels dominated the runway and we made straight for them . Mohammed could not locate his Arab from Samarkand with the fast-racing camel with the had leg . " But he 's knocking off two hundred dirhams for the bad leg , " Mohammed said . " And with the bad leg he can still go like hell . He 's probably in a hangar , " Mohammed said , and he disappeared into a huge building alongside the runway which said , PEACE IS OUR MISSION . In a few minutes he came out with the man from Samarkand and the camel . They were watching us carefully as they came up and , I thought , talking about us in Arabic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three college boys , " Mohammed said . " The other deal is three hundred dirhams with the three college boys thrown in . " I smiled for Mohammed but the three boys from Antioch did n't think it was funny and Martha said , " Do n't let him say that even as a joke . " Martha still had her Double-Crostic panel that was shaped like a drawing board or an easel , as though she were going to add up the vast sums of francs and dirhams and follow the trading with her ball-point pen . ' Do n't even say that in fun , " she said . The camel was a big evil-looking boy . He looked like an enormous ostrich that has lost even the vestiges of wings but had gained a couple more ostrich legs . One of his legs was hobbled , a rope tied to the foot and pulled up to the same foreleg so that the camel hobbled on three feet . I noticed many of the camels in the runway were bobbled in this fashion . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mohammed said . " What about two hundred dirhams ? " he said to the Samarkander , then he said it in Arabic , and then the Samarkander began to lead his camel back to the camel hangar before Mohammed stopped him by upping the offer in Arabic . The Samarkander looked at the three Antioch boys and Martha said , " Stop that . I told you to stop that . " She had the DoubleCrostic board over her head now , using it as a shade . " You 're doing it again , " Martha said . " After all , these boys have parents and they are concerned . " " Do they have parents ? " Mike said . " And why would they be concerned ? " " Do n't talk silly , " Martha said . The three boys from Antioch shuffled a little further away from the camel traders . They had on pointed Arab slippers . They were all yellow-colored and conspicuous against the white concrete of the runway . " Would you take a look at his ankle ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell what 's wrong ? " Mike touched the camel on the muzzle ever so lightly , so gently , then he moved his hand beneath the great eye of the camel , then in an arc down the neck . When his hand reached the huge shoulder he twisted his body behind the leg of the camel and running his fingers down the leg began to undo the hobble knot expertly . When the camel 's foot was free Mike had his whole body into the leg so the camel did not even attempt to move anything . Mike kneaded the tips of his fingers gently along the hock , then into the pastern of the camel . Delicately backwards and forwards Mike moved the tips of his fingers , all the time looking down blankly at the runway , never at the leg of the camel as though it must all be done by feel , that seeing would disturb the delicate sensitive body relationship that Mike had , with his body locked into the leg of the camel and the tips of his fingers probing the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell him what you like in Arabic , " Mike said . You can tell him what you like for the trade , but it 's not a bone . It 's a tendon all right , and probably caused by the hobble . The position of the hobble would stretch the tendon and elongate it . But it should come back in three or four days okay without the hobble . But tell him what you like . " " Dishonesty is the best policy is an old saying among the Arabs , " Mohammed said . But I always use honesty . It takes them by such surprise they are helpless . There 's nothing wrong with the animal . " Mohammed told the Samarkander in Arabic . " I will pay you what the animal is worth . " The shock of this statement almost sent the Samarkander down on one knee . He reeled slightly before he recovered , then he must have said , " What is it worth ? " , then by their expressions Mohammed must have said , " Half of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was recovering from that , the two Canadian girls floated into view above a mirage on the other end of the runway . I thought we had lest them on the Place Djemba el Fna , but somehow they had trailed us here . I said before that with their tight elastic pants and loose wool hot sweaters they looked Eke shedding camels in the zoos of America . I say the zoos of America because , of all the camels I have seen in Morocco and the Sahara , I never saw one shed . They all have perfect tailored camel coats as though out for a stroll on Fifth Avenue . It is only in the zoos that they shed , or it may be that I was in Morocco and the Sahara at the wrong time of year . Certainly the two Canadian girls had arrived at the end of the runway at the wrong time of day . Mohammed and the Samarkander went into a huddle when they saw the girls and began to trade and Martha said , " No , you ca n't do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was holding , " They gut parents too . " " Yes , " Martha said , waving her panel at the camel traders . " Stop them . Do n't let them . " a story by William Eastlake 67 " With the three Antioch boys and their djellabas and the two Canadian girls in their elastic pants thrown in , no money will change hands , " I said . " Even as a joke , " Martha said , " you should n't say it . " Now the Arab traders broke out of their huddle and Mohammed came up to Mike and said , " Do you want to try it 7 " " Is n't that what we came out here for ? " Mike said . To ride the camel ? " The two Canadian girls came toward us now with the shedding bulk sweaters , through the mirage and the asses and the donkeys and the horses and the used airplane tires and used oxygen masks and bombsights and king-size Coca-Cola bottles till they stood near us , silent as always . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that they ever said anything . The camel reached down serenely , not with a quick flustered gesture but with a solemn camel swoop , and took a piece out of one of the Canadian girls . He only got a piece of the hulk camel 's hair the girls were shedding . The elastic pants must have frightened the camel . Anyway he settled for a piece of the sweater . " That 's not nice , " Mike said to the camel . " We are going for a ride and you 've got to learn to behave yourself . " Mike had Mohammed hold the camel 's foot in the hobble position while he tied a hackamore around the camel 's muzzle with the lead rope , then quickly , deftly , with a lighter-than-air movement , first stepping on Mohammed 's back , Mike was on top of the camel before the camel knew he had a rider . The Samarkand camel stood stock still a long moment and then he craned his long neck around , swiveled his bird head , and looked at Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through long eyelashes . While the Samarkand camel was eyeing Mike , over the Atlas Mountains and far away , but beneath the snow line of the Atlas , you could see a long pall of dust rising like the smog of great American cities . The black dust was rising against the cobalt of the sky and still below the clear vanilla-ice-cream snow of the Atlas . The Berbers and the Riffs , " Mohammed said , shading his eyes . " They 've come to celebrate the king . To welcome the king . " I guess this is something they have been doing for one thousand , two thousand years , an adventure and a magical rite , coming down the snow-clad Atlas in red and blue and gold on white horses , 68 THERE 'S A CAMEL IN MY COCKTAIL raising this tornado of dust before you even saw them . But now you could see something . You could see something because they changed the pace , they quickened the pace . They had come in sight now of the Mosques of Marrakech . The Mosques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the king . All of the Arab horde in a pulsing wave on long following wave approached the American airfield now , PEACE IS OUR PROFESSION , and Mike 's camel , still immobile , curious now , waving his trunk of neck , his stalk of neck , at his mob of approaching kin , When the flood of Arabs from the hills hit the far end of the runway you could tell from the noise , the screams , the yells , the Holy War , you knew they were going to make a race for it . Never in all of time had Christendom made such a perfect place , an absolute challenge , a smooth and concrete apron spread between the Arabs and their kings . The streaming and screaming wind-borne Arabs came down upon us so fast and so all at once , there was no time for anyone to move . The trading Arabs and their camels , their asses and their donkeys stood transfixed and rooted , awe-full and amazed . The two Canadian girls , Ian , the dispossessed English boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own Arab , Martha and her own Double-Crostic , all went under in the cloud , all disappeared along with the last vestiges of the American Occupation of the desert . The base was now itself bombed and disappeared . The PEACE IS OUR MISSION , the last Jerry cans , the final spare ailerons , bombsights , obsolete oxygen masks , and goggles were overwhelmed and overcome by the modern barbed Arab steeds , all rushing , all flying , all rushing and mixed and lost in the great wind of the wild Berbers and Riffs going to see and going to welcome their king . This is what happened . That is what happened to the last American air base in Marrakech , in Morocco , on February 25 , 1D65 . It saved the American taxpayers all that money for the final phasing out , because phasing out is as expensive as phasing in . Some remains of it must still be there beneath the dust . Something for archaeologists to find in a thousand years and wonder what it was . A smooth and hard trading place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they traded camels for king-size Coke bottles , used bombs and diellabas , and behold ! Look here ! What is this remnant ? From what decline ? What fall ? From what delinquent and depressed civilization ? the archaeologists will ask , this piece of J. C. Penney cloth bearing the word ANTIOCH ? And whence these bulky wool sweaters ? " Well , " Mike said , back at the Sidi el Aide . " The king did show after all . " " I am looking for an expression , " Martha said , " used by the Druids to denote or connote passing of water or time , as it would be translated from Latin into modern Greek in three words . " " Try ' The King is here , ' " Mike said . " Did your friend buy the camel ? " I said . " Oh , the camel , " Mike said . " The camel joined the bunch of camels belonging to the king .

Now that I 've seen this I suppose I could go back to England . Here I am , twenty-two years old and I 've seen the king . There 's not much else , is there ? " Ian paused a moment looking out into the pale and amber-lighted square and then he said , with an interrogatory British tilt , " I suppose ? " Mike was staring into his cocktail again , his crystal ball . " Please do n't , " I said . " After what we 've been through , please not again . " " All right , " Mike said . " But I can promise you there 's no camel there now . " " Look again , " Martha said . " If I can get the answer to life in three words , then I have finished my Double-Crostic . " Mike leaned over and wound up the Antioch boy . " I dare say , " the Antioch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
