The British raj , which once controlled India 's northwest frontier province of Kashmir , exacted a token annual tribute of two Kashmiri shawls and three handkerchiefs from the maharajah . Never since has the price of peace been as small . In the years after independence in 1947 split the Indian subcontinent into the sovereign states of India and Pakistan , the two nations have paid with strife and bloodshed to establish their conflicting claims over the disputed region . Last week , after 15 years of bitter wrangling , Indian and Pakistani delegates finally met in the Pakistan capital of Rawalpindi to seek a solution to the Kashmir problem . <P> The disputed land is the size of Minnesota , lakes and all . It falls from the wind-whipped mountains of Gilgit and Ladakh in the north to the idyllic Vale of Kashmir . In the Himalayas , primitive mountain tribesmen keep herds of graceful , sure-footed Kashmir goats , whose soft fleece becomes the cashmere of Fifth Avenue and Regent Street ; the cool lakes near Kashmir 's capital city of Srinagar are dotted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the time of partition , Kashmir , like all of India 's 562 princely states , was given the choice of joining either Pakistan or India . The fact that 77% of Kashmir 's 4,200,000 people were Moslem pointed to control by Moslem Pakistan . But though he had signed preliminary trade and administrative agreements with Pakistan , Kashmir 's Hindu maharajah began to hedge . Angered by his failure to accede to Pakistan , hordes of Pakistani " volunteers " swept into Kashmir to establish Pakistan 's claim to the land . In terror , the Hindu ruler opted to join India , appealed for immediate military aid . India was happy to respond , airlifted troops into Kashmir to fortify its own claim . <P> Thus began a full-scale war in Kashmir . India went to the United Nations for relief . In 1949 the U.N . demarcated a cease-fire line that gave India the richest two-thirds of Kashmir , including most of Ladakh , the Vale , and the predominantly Hindu area of Jammu . But India 's Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had pledged that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . " Declared Nehru : " We are prepared , when peace , law and order have been established , to have a referendum under some international auspices like the U.N . " <P> Nehru soon forgot that vow , for it became obvious that Kashmir would vote either for independence or accession to Pakistan . Indian Kashmir 's Moslem ruler , Sheik Mohammed Abdullah , an old friend of Nehru 's and a fiery Kashmiri nationalist , confused things by starting to pro mote a local independence movement . India clapped Sheik Abdullah into jail in 1953 and introduced a series of repressive measures to halt other nationalist or pro-Pakistan movements . Except for three months in 1958 , Sheik Abdullah has languished in prison ever since , was last week on trial on charges of conspiracy to overthrow the government .
