txt Washington Mellifluous Sen. Everett McKinley Dirksen ( R ) of Illinois bared his plight to the Senate the other day . The man whose organ voice ranges from a poignant vox humana to crashing diapason told the chamber ? where he leads the Republican minority  --  the sad story of his thwarted committee assignments . Colleagues agreed that maybe his middle initial " M " does not stand for " McKinley " after all , but for " magnanimous . " Seniority in Congress is what gold is to the world at large  --  a store of value and mediuM of exchange  --  and new senators get committee assignments as early as possible so that they can begin amassing seniority that ultimately elevates them to committee chairmanships . Pause in Wonder In a speech on committee assignments the other day , Democratic stalwart Richard B. Russell of Georgia , in a colloquy with Senator Dirksen , paused in wonder for a minute and inquired why Senator Dirksen himself had acquired so little of the Senate 's goods , i.e. , seniority , in his prolonged legislative stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Senator Russell said wonderingly . " He never seems to want to have any seniority . He jumps from committee to committee before he gets any seniority , which is most remarkable in the Senate ! " Senator Dirksen rose and quietly surveyed the Senate . His tone was one of modest self-abnegation . He had , he explained . always followed " the Christian doctrine ? that it is more blessed to give than to receive . " Post Sacrificed Yes , it was true , he said , warming to a mood of reminiscence , he had once been on the powerful Appropriations Committee . But , he said , " We had a problem " several years ago ; another Republiban wanted the post . So Mr. Dirksen dropped out . " All that was left for the Senator from Illinois , " observed the Senator from Illinois . was a vacartry " on the Labor Committee . " Senator Dirksen took that . What happened ? ' In due course a very distinguished Rnnator was elected from Texas , " Mr. Dirksen continued , evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Texas since Reconstruction . What committee did he want ? Why , the committee on Labor and Public Welfare ! " That was easy , " said Senator Dirksen with a voice of quiet nobility , " because that was all that had been left for me . I said , ' I will be delighted to give you the seat on the committee of Labor and Public Welfare . ' And so , " concluded Senator Dirksen with a simplicity worthy of a great act , " I did . " Choice Given Even when Senator Dirksen 's famous voice is keyed to pathos , a disarming twinkle gleams in his eye , as it did at this juncture , and Senator Russell watched appreciatively . " Believe it or not , " said Senator Dirksen , evidently overcome himself with the incongruity of it , " I had taken an assignment on the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs . " This committee , explained Senator Dirksen , always reminded him of " the fellow who wrote answers to an examination for becoming a rural mail carrier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the earth ? ' The applicant had no idea , but he wrote , ' Far enough to not interfere with me in the duty of carrying mail . ' That , " observed Senator Dirksen , " was the correct answer . " In fact , he explained , the jurisdiction of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs was about as remote as the sun " from the predominant interests of the Senator from Illinois . " Position Yielded Great-hearted Senator Dirksen ultimately yielded that committee . " I went on the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy , " he explained . And what happened ? You guessed it ! Along came a Republican senator , trying to get " a facility " in his home state . Would Senator Dirksen retire from the committee , he asked , or was he " wedded to it ? " Senator Dirksen paused . Then with the voice of Charles Darnay making the great renunciation in " Tale of Two Cities , " he continued : " I said , ' I am not wedded to any committee . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to my church . 1 will be glad to give my sea ! to you . ' " And , repeated Mr. Dirksen quietly , " I gave it to him . " Senator Russell hailed Senator Dirksen for his " spirit of magnanimity . "
