Naval Architect Philip Rhodes is a methodical man who keeps a record of every telephone call that ever came into his office . One item in his notebook , dated July 18 , 1957 , reads : " Mr. H. D. Mercer of States Marine Corporation called and said that he and some of his partners are toying with the idea of building a 12-meter boat for next summer 's America 's Cup races and wanted to know if we would be available for a job of this sort . " // A week later Rhodes himself was toying with the idea in Mr. Mercer 's beige-and-green office . There he was handed as plump a plum as any racing-boat designer ever dreamed of . The only condition Henry Mercer imposed on the designer was that he , Rhodes , handle every detail of the designing and building of a cup defender right down to the selection of a skipper and crew . // No yachtsman himself , the man who offered this blank check to international sport had caught the contagion of America 's Cup racing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitor the cup has ever known . When Sir Thomas Lipton sailed into New York harbor on the luxury liner Leviathan in 1930 intent on his fifth and final try at the cup , Henry Mercer , a young shipping magnate , was with him . During the crossing Mercer had helped Sir Thomas chart a course through the perilous sea of balls and banquets facing him in Newport . // Up to that time Mercer 's only connection with sport , international or otherwise , had been as a member of a New Jersey semipro basketball team known as the Passaic Invaders . Born in New Jersey in 1893 , he was only 17 when he went to work as a clerk for the Erie Railroad . At 20 he got a job with the Great Northern Railway and , 10 years later , after a hitch as a gunner 's mate aboard a World War I destroyer , he became general agent for the firm 's entire New York district . At 30 he assumed the president 's chair at Dyson Shipping Company . // " In those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ships was a close one . I just saw my future in ships . " A year later he founded a shipping company of his own . As the years passed and the dust gathered on the cup that Lipton 's Shamrocks had failed to carry away , Mercer built his company into a multimillion-dollar enterprise and made himself a millionaire . // Millionaire or not , however , even Henry Mercer was not rich enough to get involved in America 's Cup racing on the scale of the 120-foot-plus J boats . But in 1957 , when the rules were changed to permit the use of smaller boats , the response was immediate . A syndicate from Britain issued a challenge , and Henry Mercer telephoned Phil Rhodes . The result was Weatherly , a boat that , after an ignominious passing over in 1958 , will defend the famous cup against Australia 's Gretel next week . // Rhodes admits the boat cost the Mercer syndicate ( Mercer himself , Arnold D. Frese and Cornelius Walsh ) something in excess of $175,000 , but this figure does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , by the most conservative estimate , must have doubled the price . That , however , according to Mercer , is unimportant . " The cup has to be defended , " says the man who signs the checks . " Money is n't involved . "
