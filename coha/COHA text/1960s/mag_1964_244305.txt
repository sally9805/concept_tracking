He peers dourly at the TV camera through opaque , black-rimmed glasses , moves about the studio with the air of someone mentally counting his steps , speaks in a professorial baritone surcharged with a raspy German accent . He has none of Billy Graham 's charismatic fervor , or Fulton Sheen 's high-gloss oratory ; in a tired-blood contest , he would probably run a dead heat with Ed Sullivan . <P> <P> It matters not . These days the Rev. Dr. Hagen Staack , 50 , is just about the biggest star in the field of religious broadcasting . Last year , on NBC 's Frontiers of Faith , his 13-week series of lectures on The Book of Genesis captured a regular Sunday audience of more than 3,000,000 and drew more than 15,000 letters-by far the best response to any program put on by the National Council of Churches in televi sion history . Last Sunday , Frontiers of Faith presented the first lecture of a new series by Lutheran Minister Staack . His theme this year is " living personalities of the Old Testament , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genesis did . <P> Prison &; Princeton . Staack , who is head of the department of religion at Pennsylvania 's Muhlenberg College , is the same kind of teacher on screen as off . " I deliver my TV programs much as I do my lectures in class , " he says . " I feel that if I can stir the interest of 30 college students , I can do it for a million people over television . " <P> In picking Staack for its Old Testament lecture series over 20 other candidates , the National Council chose a well-qualified scholar with some hard experience in secular life as well . Staack studied at the universities of Berlin and Hamburg , was ordained a minister of the Hitler-hating Confessing Church in 1939 . As it did with many other rebellious Lutheran pastors , the Nazi government drafted Staack for army service in 1939 ; he was wounded five times in eastern-front combat and spent ten months in Russian and British prison camps . He came to the U.S. in 1949 as a graduate fellow and lecturer at Princeton Theological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Stupid Samson . No fundamentalist , Staack constantly relates archaeological findings to Scriptural passages , he believes that the divine revelation coming to man in the Bible is expressed within the limitations of a historical frame work . Thus he violently opposes the " glorification " of Biblical figures that commonly takes place in Sunday school teaching . " Look at the use God makes of humans , " he says . " Moses was hotheaded , but God loved him and used him . Stupid Samson was found useful ; so was cruel Joshua . Throughout the Scriptures , real people are used by God - not people who have been placed on an artificially high level . " <P> Staack 's success is unquestionably due to his skill at relating Biblical themes to modern spiritual needs . He is most interested in proving to his listeners the ecumenical value of Old Testament study . " I want to remind people that the Old Testament was the only Bible Jesus himself used , " he says .
