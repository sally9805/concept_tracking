txt Gov . George C. Wallace of Alabama was the subject yesterday of police security measAires that turned the R.C.A. . . Building in Rockefeller Center into a no man 's land for New Yorkers . The occasion was the Governor 's appearance on " Meet the Press , " a National Broad2asting Company television and radio program . Barricades lined 49th Street from the Avenue of the Americas to Fifth Avenue , and closed Rockefeller Plaza between 49th and 50th Streets . They were manned by hundreds of policemen in and out of uniform , including many Negroes . On the program , under questioning by Lawrence E. Spivak , the producer , and three reporters , Mr. Wallace insisted that in defiance of the Federal Government , he would stand in the door to block the entry of two Negroes to the University of Alabama June 10 . He refused to say that the only way the two could be enrolled would be under Federal troop protection . He also insisted that all he sought was a constitutional test . He said he had promised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile pledged t ! qi.t he would permit no violence , and denied a ' sug ( roqtion that he wanted to attract a segregationist crowd . " I made a speech the other day , " he said , " in which I have asked the people to , stay away from the university campus . I do not want them there . I am going to stand for them because I represent them . " I do not want anyone present at the University of Alabama campus except authorized persons , and that will be the case . We are not going to ' have any violence at the University of Alabama on June 10 . " He said all he wanted was to see if the Supreme Court , having reversed the 1896 doctrine of " separate but equal " school facilities in 1954 , might not reverse itself again . Picketing by about 500 anti-segregationists , representing most major civil rights groups , was noisy but orderly . While the police sealed off all entrances to the skyscraper containing the N.B.C . studios , pickets paraded along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North and South , down with Jim Crow ! " the line along the southern rim of the building chanted . Many , signs carrying likenesses of Mr. Wallace compared him with Hitler . Eight children carried a long chain that was wrapped around each waist . Police Commissioner Michael Murphy and high aides made a point of not giving a figure on the number of policemen deployed . The number was described by Deputy Commissioner Walter Arm as " adequate " for what another official called " maximum security . " Network personnel were asH tonished at the number of uniformed men in the building.1 The lobby was cleared , barricades diminished the area around the studio elevators , operators were forbidden to take anyone to the third floor , the site of the telecast , and technical employes had to go to a security office on the seventh floor to get a button that would enable them to go to their jobs on the program .

Mr. Spivak said the security had been tighter than that for Anastas Mikoyan , Soviet Deputy Premier . The Governor , wearing a three-button , dark tropical suit , appeared unperturbed by the attention and the proximity of Negroes among those assigned to guard him . But as program time neared , he persistently clamped the fingers of one hand with those of the other , alternating from hand to hand . While he made no reference , during the program , to the police arrangements , he said that neither Birmingham nor New York was a Utopia . " You can not even walk in Central Park here at night without fear of being raped , mugged or shot , " he said . After the program , he agreed that he had never been in Central Park , but that he had read a lot about it . " And from what I read , it 's a lot safer in Birmingham than in New York , " he added . " For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Governor disputed this distinction . " Some of the intelligentsia do n't believe in God , " he said , " but in Alabama we do . " The Governor , who arrived by air at Newark , said on the program he did not know that " I hive received any action that I consider legal service in any court matter pending . " He was handed a summons and complaint by a Federal marshal yesterday while boarding the plane at Birmingham . The summons ordered that he be represented in Federal court today at a hearing to show cause why he should not be enjoined from interfering in the Negroes ' enrollment . The Governor left by the 50th Street side of the building at 7 P. M. , and the demonstrators dispersed soon afterward . Several hours later it was learned that the N.B.C . switchboard received an anonymous bomb threat at 6:14 P. M. , while the program was on . The caller said the bomb would go off at 6:17 . That barely gave time for an alert . The threat proved false . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delta Air Lines plane for Atlanta .
