Under those grim stone turrets at West Point , buttoned-up , close-cropped cadets still " hup , two , three , four " in precision parades . Unchanged in 30 years are the slate-grey cadet uniforms , and it is still forbidden for a cadet to hold a girl 's hand when he walks her on campus . But beneath the surface sameness , the Point within the past five years has undergone a drastic , evolutionary change to match the new ways of what its teachers like to call " the profession of arms . " Harsh hazing and pointless indignities have given way to a more mature approach to discipline based on respect for the individual student as a potential leader of men . In the same spirit , a curriculum once narrowly limited to engineering and military skills has broadened into a liberal-arts program designed to stimulate critical intelligence . <P> The theory behind the new approach is that the West Point grad is not intended to be just a platoon leader . " Those we can turn out in 90 days , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In today 's Army , the diplomacy , political savvy and staff skills of a career officer may prove as pivotal as his mastery of firepower ; needed are not rote answers but a broad background of educational experience . " The fellow who spent his whole career first as a platoon leader , then company commander , then battalion adjutant just does n't exist any more , " explains Lieut . Colonel William F. Leubbert , Ph.D. , one of the Point 's professors . " Now he 's dealing with Government contractors , diplomats and politicians as much as he deals with the Army . " <P> Cocktail Training . The Point is still no paradise , but its new concern for student comfort has led some cadets to dub the place , in jest , " Hilton on the Hudson . " In the new dorms , spring mattresses have replaced stuffed cotton bedding , and bureaus have pushed out steel lockers . Morning coffee is served between classes , and some instructors even invite cadets to their quarters for evening pizza and beer . Even plebes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seniors can sip cocktails in the officers ' club , a privilege that the Army rationalizes as " the social training of the cadets . " <P> It is true that cadets still must perform push-ups-but no longer over a bayonet ; the yearly dose of close-order drill has been slashed by 70 per cent . Gone are the interminable handson-heels " duck walks " that once sent Douglas MacArthur to a hospital . Forbidden , too , are such hazing tortures as " shower formation , " in which plebes braced at attention until perspiration soaked their bathrobes . Instead of requiring the traditional gibberish reply to the upperclassman 's question , " How is the cow ? " * a plebe may be ordered at dinner to deliver a ten-minute lecture on Viet Nam . <P> <P> Surveying &; Chinese . Academically , the Point has stimulated student initiative by allowing upperclassmen since 1960 to take some courses of their own choosing . Although all cadets still must study certain basic professional disciplines , such as surveying and mechanical drawing , they can also choose from 100 electives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Classes are ideally small , with an average of 13.
