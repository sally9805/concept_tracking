txt BY GEORGE BLISS Almost 4,000 members of the Chicago Plumbers union last night approved ' ' new ' three-year agreement with employing contractors six months in advance of the expiration date of their contract . The contract is being observed closely by trade unions thruout the country . It is the first agreement reached by a trade union for a contract expiring next year , and the first usually sets the pattern for the nation . Wages Set Aside Stephen J. Lamb , business manager of the ? union ; said it also was the first contract ever negotiated by a major union under which the union members would not get all the wage increase in their paychecks . The contract , effective next June 1 with the Cook County Association of Plumbing , Heating , and Cooling Contractors , provides for a raise of 35 cents an hour at the beginning of each year of the . agreement . Journeymeh pluinbers in ' Chicago now are paid $5.50 an hour in wages . In. the year beginning June 1 , 1968 , union members will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour wage increase . Twenty-five cents an hour . for each man . will go into a special savings fund which will bear a minimum of 4 per cent a year interest . The union and the contractors will be trustees of the account . Raise for 2d Year The individual union member can withdraw his money from the savings account between Jan. 1 and Jan. 15 and draw the interest also , or between July 1 and July 15 , when another six months interest is paid . He can , if he chooses , leave all his money in the savings account . In the year beginning June 1 , 1969 , the individual union member will receive another 10 cents an hour of the additional 35 cents an hour wage increase , and 25 cents an hour will be deposited in , the savings account . The member can leave it there or withdraw it at the specified six-month intervals . In the third year of the contract , beginning June 1 , 1970 , the union member will get 30 cents an hour added to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union 's health and welfare fund . Aid Apprentice Program The contractors agreed also to continue to pay 1 cent an hour per man into a trust fund to finance the five-year apprentice training program , and the union and contractors agreed to continue the apprentice program . Lamb said that the savings fund was set up because some members have trouble saving money for themselves , a n d sometimes encounter a need for money to pay pressing bills or to meet other urgent obligations . The contract , he said , would give them a chance to save it . 4,000 Roar Approval The union has 6,000 members . The 4,000 who packed Plumbers hall , 1340 Washington blvd. , roared approval as the terms were announced . A number of international union officers were on hand to hear the announcement of the contract , including Martin J. Ward of Washington , general secretary-treasurer of the International Union of Plumbers and Pipefitters . Francis McCartin , business manager of the Chicago Pipefitters union , a sister organization of the Plumbers union , was another observer .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
