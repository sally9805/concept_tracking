On a lonely lane winding amid stands of pecan trees and through fields of greening winter oats near Baton Rouge , a road construction gang one morning last week discovered the body of a woman : beside her 1960 Renault Dauphine lay Dr. Margaret Rosamond McMillan , 38 , bludgeoned to death . The crime shook the campuses of Louisiana State University , both in Baton Rouge and at the New Orleans branch , where " Rosie " McMillan was an assistant professor of biology . The events that followed shook L.S.U. even harder . <P> A quiet , buxom spinster who shared her New Orleans house with a pair of cats , Biologist McMillan liked to play the guitar and sing folk music , often drove to Baton Rouge , where she was doing basic research on algae . Of all those who expressed grief at her death , no one seemed more upset than Dr. George H. Mickey , 49 , topflight scientist , dean of L.S.U. 's graduate school and head of the zoology department . " All of us at L.S.U. are profoundly shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are particularly anxious that the case be cleared as soon as possible . " Four days later , George Mickey was arrested-and charged with the murder of Dr. Rosie McMillan . <P> The charge seemed incredible . Married and the father of two children , lanky , Texas-born George Mickey was formerly chief biologist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , and he is internationally known for his studies on the genetic effects of radiation . He had known Biologist McMillan for years ; as a professor at Northwestern University , he had directed the preparation of her doctor 's thesis , later helped her secure her L.S.U. appointment . Indeed , Mickey was generally recognized as Rosie McMillan 's closest friend . <P> Investigating her death , police naturally went to Rosie McMillan 's friends for information-and one of the first they sought out was George Mickey . As the investigation continued , a web of evidence drew tighter around the dean ; smears of human blood that matched her type were found on his Chevrolet , his picture was found in her purse , what an investigator described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Questioned , Mickey said that during the hours when Rosie McMillan was killed , he had been in a coffee shop with an official from the U.S. Department of Education , had later seen the man off on a plane . But in checking the alibi , police said they found that no such official existed , that there had been no airline flight from Baton Rouge at the time Mickey claimed , and that the entire story was " without foundation . " <P> Despite the evidence against him , few at L.S.U. could bring themselves to believe that popular , respected George Mickey had killed his friend Rosie McMillan . Mickey himself continued to deny the charges , and from his Baton Rouge jailers come only reports of his weeping at night .
