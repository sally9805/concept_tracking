Homosexuality is something of a tradition in backward Yemen , where Bedouin herdsmen roam the rocky hills for months on end with only each other and their animals for company . Male brothels flourish in San'a , the capital , and the late Imam Ahmad , who ruled the country for 14 years before his death in 1962 , established an international reputation for overzealous camaraderie . <P> But times are changing . Last week a Moslem religious court convicted Ahmed el Osamy , a 60-year-old government worker who ran one of San'a 's top boydellos , of being a practicing pederast , and sentenced him to death . Under an ancient Yemeni law , the execution should have been carried out by throwing him from " the highest place " - presumably the minaret of a mosque-but the judges allowed Osamy to be shot instead . " They thought of throwing him from a plane , " explained Minister of Education Mohammed el Khalidy , " but that 's expensive . "                 @ @ @ @
