History or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a rowdy town of flatboatmen , river scum , prostitutes , and mud . The advent of steamboat and railroad turned it into a boomtown , and during the next three decades prosperity produced an elite bourgeoisie of " native Americans " from the Tidewater . European immigrants came al the same time because of the demand for labor , and the Germans proved most valuable to the community , providing Memphis with its first semblance of culture . Because there was no heritage of aristocracy by the time of the Civil War , nor much perplexity over the slave question since few citizens had any slaves , the town was easily captured by Union gunboats and held for the remainder of the war . There was no great sentiment of resistance among the conquered people , so Sherman 's occupation allowed business as usual . Memphis enjoyed an almost continuous trade , much of it with the North , and thereby suffered less from the war than almost any Southern town . By 1870 the town was on its feet again , while most of the South would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Northern capital which would build the New South , none was more familiar to investors , none better located for industry and commerce . Unfortunately there were three yellow-fever epidemics during the Seventies in which eight thousand people died and thousands more left and never came back . After the middle epidemic , in 1878 , which was one of the most severe in American history , the city lost its charter and became a taxing district of Tennessee . By 1880 Memphis was notorious for disease , debt , and high taxes . The stigma remained until the 1920s , when the city 's bonds were reinstated by the East as safe for investment . Nevertheless a remarkable recovery was made by 1900 , largely due to the efforts of newcomersfrom the surrounding hinterlands , poor farm boys ambitious enough for the wealth inherent in the city 's superior commercial location to risk its insecurity . In addition to this nouveau riche that began to develop , thousands of Negroes freed by the emancipation had migrated to Memphis , and its black ratio rose after the fever decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks , " free " now , along with the transient and disorganized urban proletariat with its leftover rural values . and the self-made Bible-belt bourgeoisie , comprised new Memphis , built on top of its rowdy , somewhat heroic , and now ruined frontier , Beale Street flourished and W. C. Handy recorded it fittingly enough in the blues form . Gayoso Street became the center of a large redlight district frequented by many Boon Hogganbecks from the Yoknapatawpha counties surrounding . Memphis became a crime and murder capital , only converted at last by political boss Edward H. Crump . He imposed order and furthered the material welfare and external progress of the city , which discarded the democratic process in favor of a benevolent despotism . Crump 's machine ruled Memphis from 1910 until he died in 1954 . Excerpt and parallel ay 22 , 1917 , 1:00 A.M. ? we 'll start with the weather . A chill wind drives storm clouds across the sky . Overhead they see the dark outlines flying beneath the blank night . The branches drip and dance . Beneath their invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the thousands gathered on the levee have lanterns or candles , and there is a fire burning dully by the end of the bridge . They would go there to get warm , but that was the site of the murder and will be the place of execution , so they say . They are grouped in small crowds all along the levee . Their cars and wagons are parked along each side of Macon Road , stretching back for a mile or more . There is a tall thin countryman in overalls directing the parking . Every now and then he yells , " Keep the roadway clear , " and makes angry circles in the air with his pistol . " If you do n't keep in line I 'll shoot you in line . " In a wagon five men lounge and talk in low voices , At intervals a whiskey bottle is passed around . Sometimes they laugh out suddenly , which stirs the mule in front to snort and clop his hooves in the mud . Somebody rises up on his elbow and says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the coon burnt . " Men in suits , some of them , sit in their autos gripping the wheel and muttering oaths . Women sit square-jawed beside them and clinch their lips together . Self-appointed messengers come up to the car windows to give the latest news , and then move on to other groups . People get tired of sitting and take walks along the levee to stretch . They see friends and stop . " They say the committee 's just passed Collierville , so we ought a he gettin ' some action direckly . " The other replies , " They told me a minute ago they were waterbound outside Holly Springs and would n't get here till mornin ' . " " Hit 's just rumors , " says another . " We been double-crossed , cause that nigger 's still up there in the Nashville jail sleep and safe .

" " Yeah , " says the second . " Say them deputies snatched him off the train at Potts Camp when they heard about the mob at Holly Springs , then the men heard about it and went to Potts Camp and took him away from the city marshal . That 's what Wolfgang told somebody . " " He ai n't comin ' . " " You 're crazy . Lemme tell you . See that Chivvie down there , three , four cars thisaway . O'Donnell and Murphy are sittin ' inside , say they 're only here , they only come because they got a phone call from a cousin lives in Potts Camp . He saw the scene . He saw the takin ' . He calls up O'Donnell and Murphy and tells them to get on out here tonight . " They ai n't comin ' . " " I lay you ten to one they 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conflicting reports continue , time passes , more bets are made . People yawn and stretch and some fall asleep in their cars . By 3:00 the majority gives up , believing the waterbound story , which has had further confirmation , and leaves for home to snatch a few hours ' sleep . Less than fifty cars remain throughout the night and two hundred men keep the watch . At dawn the country people in their wagons and beat-up cars start to straggle back . The city folk , having read in the morning paper that the mob is gathered at the Wolf River Bridge , begin to assemble along the levee . There are rumors that the committee will be along any minute . The sun rises on the gathering mob of five thousand men , women , and children . Bets are still being wagered that there will be no lynching at all , or that there will be a burning instead . Just before : OD a Ford comes careening down the road . The countryman inside drives it furiously up and down the levee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he turns and heads down the steep embankment , runs through the harhwire fence . and tears through the underbrush in the bottoms . He stops under a big spruce tree out of sight from the crowd . takes a rope with block and tackle out of the hark seat , and begins to attach the rope to a branch . After it is secure he gets a shovel out of the car and starts digging a pit at the end of the rope . Back in the road another car inches along through the crowd . People begin to cheer and gather around until it comes to a halt . The driver gets out and stands on the running board . His tie hangs cockeyed down his front and his shirttails are loose . When he raises both hands over his head for silence his white stomach is visible with a triangle of black hair . " Silence , " he says and waits . Then , " I know you all been waitin ' a long time . You been waitin ' patiently and I 'm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The crowd cheers and he smiles and signals for silence again . " But first we gon na have to clear the roadway here . Everybody move your cars and wagons and let 's get a little space . We got ta have space . " The crowd groans and somebody cries , " Do n't take much room for what we plannin'l Bring him on ! " The crowd starts a chant , " Now , now , we want Persons now , now . " Another man , well-dressed with a wide-brim straw hat pulled down on his forehead , climbs out of the back seat of the car . The crowd recognizes him as a community leader and the head of the committee . The chant dies out and he says in a voice well-modulated for speeches , " It might be well to inform you people of the committee 's original intentions concernin ' this lynchin ' . and now , what our new plans are . We had planned at first to take the nigger before Mrs. Wood back at Wolf-gang 's . We thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , this has proved impossible because of the traffic congestion back there , so we 're bringin ' her here . " A ripple of comments goes through the crowd and some of the women shake their heads and put their handkerchiefs to their mouths in empathy . " So now we 're askin ' you , out of your mercy . out of your respect for the mother of the poor murdered girl , we 're askin ' you to clear the roadway so there will be more room for all . Please do that . " Scores of men break from the crowd and begin to walk silently toward their cars and wagons . For the time it takes to clear the levee there is no sound except engines cranking and the clopping of mules and horses . People stand reverently and even the children are silent . While the men are straggling hack , a new group appears suddenly on the bridge . They are armed with rifles and shotguns , to form an escort for Persons . They walk halfway across the bridge and then stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the automobile with Mrs. Wood arrives , driving slowly down the road and halting in front of the crowd . At the same time , from the opposite direction , the auto with Persons appears on the bridge . It is crowded with men and Persons is not visible . The armed men stationed on the bridge form a cordon in front of the car as it stops halfway across . They stand with legs apart and hold their shotguns over their elbows pointing at the ground in front . Beside the car with Mrs. Wood inside , the man in the straw hat raises his hands for attention . " The mother of Antoinette Rappel wishes to make a statement . " The door opens and two men lift Mrs. Wood out by the forearms . She is a large gray-haired woman dressed in black , and as she straight . ens up there is a piercing scream from the edge of the crowd and a consequent stir in that location , but she seems not to have heard and her eyes are focused dully to a spot on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have worked so hard in my behalf , " she says . " And now I ask you , I ask you to make the nigger suffer ten thousand times as much as he made my little girl suffer ! " " We 'll burn him , " they cry back eagerly . " Yes , burn him on the spot where he killed my little girl , " she says . The people cheer and the leader raises his hands again . He says , " The committee has decided , after consideration , and with all due respects to Mrs. Wood , " and he touches the brim of his hat in her direction , " that the site of execution will , instead , be placed at the opposite side of the levee in order that more people kin see . Does that meet with your approval ? " The crowd cheers and begins to shift position to gain better vantage of the spot . Mrs. Wood says something to the man and he tries to get the crowd 's attention again , but it is noisily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward that . He motions to the man with the loose shirttails , who gets up on the fender of the auto and waves his hands over his head as though trying to motion a train to halt . Mrs. Wood says , " I have one request , one more request . I ask that no shot be fired . Thank you ! ' " Yes , " says the leader . " You must heed the mother 's request for order . We can not turn into a wild mob . If any are so irresponsible as to fire even one shot , then there is no tellin ' what might happen . The committee cai n't stress this strong enough ? do not shoot . Persons will be taken care of in due time . Right now I want to announce the committee 's wish to take a collection . Hats will be passed among you for the purposes of erecting a monument at the grave of the little girl . " The crowd is stationary as hats are circulated . some passed by their owners and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought forward and the coins and bills emptied into a basket . A man has walked from the guard on the bridge , and whispers to the leader . The leader nods and the man shifts his gun over his shoulder and says . " Persons says he wants to make a statement . but I got to warn you all against violence on account of what he might say . He 's gon na burn in a minute , but he 's got a right to a dyin ' statement . " The men on the bridge move aside and the auto is pushed forward on the levee until it is nose to nose with the other car . The driver gets out and Persons sits alone , slumped in the middle of the back seat . The driver comes around between the two cars and faces the crowd with his hands on his hips . There is a pistol stuck in his trousers behind the belt buckle . His head is trembling as he yells , " Ell Persons says he knows he is about to die and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sayin'it for him , what he said to me , cause he 's too scared to say it hisself . He says Dan Armstrong planned the murder and struck the first blow . He admits he cut off the little girl 's head , and he says Dummy is implicated . " The crowd stirs and begins to close in angrily . The leader says , " What do you desire done with the other niggers , Mrs. Wood ? " She screams , " If they are guilty let them suffer death too ! " " Burn them too ! " the people call and start to surge toward the car . The leader says , " Move back , move back . There must be order . " Two men come forward out of the crowd and are restrained by members of the committee . " Order ! " he calls again and says in a lower voice to the armed men beside him . " Get him . " They open the back door of the car and two of them reach inside and pull him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though to ward off a blow . For an instant he stands in one spot and his striped prison suit hangs loosely and too large , the bottom of the pants legs crumpled over his shoes . They jerk his arms away from his head and begin to lead him down the embankment . Some of the men in the crowd begin to collect branches and someone brings a post to be driven into the ground . Persons and his escort stand a few feet away from the men trying to drive the post , but it refuses to go because no one has thought to sharpen it . As the futile blows thud against the wood , Persons moistens his lips and his eyes roll . His lips move but no one hears him . The man hammering . the post stops , thinking it has caught and the crowd looks on as it slowly keels over . He puts the head of the axe on the ground and leans on the handle and wipes his brow . The leader comes forward and a conference is held with the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other as they talk in low voices and then nod . Persons is led from this spot to another where there is a huge log lying on the ground . " Does anyone have a chain in their cars ? " the leader says . A short red-haired man with his belly hanging over his belt cuts out of the crowd and scurries up the embankment and down the levee to a wagon . He gets a chain out of the back , rings his arm through it . and scrambles down the embankment to the spot . Persons is pushed and guided to stand squarely in front of the end of the log . The man with the chain comes to Persons arid drops them on his feet . Persons flinches and two men begin to wrap his legs to the log around and around until the chain is used up . Sticks are propped against his feet and legs and the log at first , and finally thrown fast and carelessly in the general area until the pyre reaches to his knees . Oil from a barrel brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of that as the crowd cheers . A ten-year-old Negro boy is pushed out of the crowd by two men who place him at the other end of the log . " Take a good look , boy , " one of them says . " We want you to remember this the longest day you live . This is what happens to niggers who molest while women . " The boy stands petrified and shrunken in on himself with his head bowed deeply into his chest . Somebody yells , ' Look ! boy , " but he does not . The leader calls for the people to move back , and in the middle of the mob a large man raises his hands and says , " I 'm Brother Royal , a minister of the gospel . " For the last time they quieten and he says , " It has been suggested that a prayer be offered . But I am opposed to that , for he did n't give the little lady any opportunity for prayer . " This sentiment catches the fancy of everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd to move back and says , " We do n't want anybody to get hurt , so just stand back . " His voice is not heard so he has another conference with the committee and several of these hurry over to the spruce tree where the rope hangs and pull it down . It is brought to the tight circle around Persons and men use it to hold back the crowd . Within the circle are Persons and the boy , at either end of the log . Somebody strikes a match and throws it on the pyre . The first sheet of flame engulfs the shadow within and shoots high into the air . The figure goes rigid and seems to drink deep of the blaze . and then relaxes in a slump to the ground as the smoke rises in the morning sky . Most of the cheers fade as the fire lowers and begins to die . Men come out of the crowd and begin to stamp at it with their feet and throw dirt on it . When at last it is out a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off the ears , another the head , and there is a scuffle for bits of the clothing . People look on grimly and some arc sick and the women from town pale through the paint on their cheeks . The boy has disappeared and none remembers to speak of him . The spectators begin to leave and all the way back through the endless automobiles extending now two miles from the bridge , they meet others rushing to the scene . All roads leading to the bridge are crowded througliom the day and thousands visit the spot to gaze with awe on the smoking ashes . The tree under which the girl 's body was found is stripped of its bark and many branches , as almost everyone carries away a souvenir . A coroner 's jury holds an inquest at the scene late that afternoon , and renders the verdict that " Persons came to his death from unknown causes at the bands of unknown persons , he having been identified as the slayer of Miss Antoinette Rappel . " Give the people light n the newspaper the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and a report of the capture and release of Dan Armstrong and " Dummy , " is an article which reports that the sev-ered head and leg of Ell C. Persons were tossed from an automobile occupied by members of the mob at Beale and Rayburn Boulevard at 12:30 in the afternoon of the burning . " The grewsome mementos of the lynching caused a sensation almost attaining the proportions of a panic among the negroes of that section . " This was only relieved when emergency officers carried the body to the morgue . The proprietor of the barber shop at Linden Avenue and Main Street was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for allegedly exhibiting a part of Person 's body in his barber shop . He posted $25 forfeit for his appear . ance in police court . Ile denied to officers that he was guilty as charged , saying that one of his barbers was instead . Immediately the Temple Brotherhood of the congregation of the Poplar Avenue Jewish Temple adopted a resolution condemning both the crime of Persons and the consequent mob action , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " a disgrace to law and order and decency of the community . " There was an editorial in the Commercial Appeal which said , " In all the history of crime there was never any act of murder and outrage more fiendish and devilish in its contrivance than that committed by Ell Persons . The brute who committed the act deserved a hundred deaths . " " But , " it went on to say , " we are back once more to the point where the law should end and anarchy should begin . We arc face to face with the old question of whether society disorganized can better accomplish results than the organized forces of the law . " Ending with , " After a criminal is in the hands of the sworn officers of the state , and when there are juries and judges and prosecuting attorneys and electric chairs ready to act , willing to act , there can he no excuse for refus ? ing to let them act . " On May 25 the representatives of the clerical associations of Memphis  --  Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in closed session at the Chamber of Commerce issued a resolution that they had been derelict in their duty in not warning the public against mob violence . It said that whereas the preparations for the burning had been widely known to all , the clergy should have mollified the inflamed state of public opinion . It also resolved that the city leaders and the servants of the law had been derelict in making inadequate preparations to resist the anarchic designs of the mob . Ending with an appeal for " the continued extension of mental , moral , industrial and spiritual education of the negro , " rather than lynching , as the most effective del errents of crime . An editorial of the same date says , " The lynch-kg in the vicinity of Memphis , bad as it was , was not sufficiently horrible to meet the demands of some fakirs , and . therefore , they proceeded to lie about it . " The lynching was in a spot 10 miles front the city of Memphis . As lynchings go , it was orderly . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores were closed in Memphis and no papers went to press early in order that the reporters might attend . Ell Persons , who was lynched , implicated two other negroes . In the shadow of death he stated that these men helped him murder and outrage the little girl . He stated that they helped him to chop her head off . These two men were apprehended . In spite of the declaration made by the lynched negro , they were turned loose . This was done after an hour of careful investigation of the statement and the contradicting facts . On May 26 it is reported that Judge D. B. Puryear charges the grand jury to investigate and return indictments against all persons guilty of a criminal offense in connection with the affair . On May 27 the City Club calls for an investigation . A motion is made to adopt a resolution requesting the resignation of Sheriff Mike Tate or taking of proper steps to remove him from office .

He rolled the heavy books on a baggage conveyor to a hall desk and left . Being unfamiliar with how to read legal records , I scanned them as best I could and found nothing . I called the clerk back and asked him to help me , but he said he could n't read legal records either . TTe called a younger man in and I explained to him . He scanned a moment and said he could n't read such old books because they were worded differently nowadays . He said a charge to the grand jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at the Attorney General 's office downstairs . He said the receptionist there was " deaf and dumb , " so I would probably have to get somebody else to help me . Loudly I explained to the woman behind the Attorney General 's receptionist 's desk . I carefully read the newspaper article and gave the dates . She said , " You talkin ' bout that riot ? " as though no decent person would . 1 made some motion of affirmation , thinking that was close enough , and after all it was a riot I was talking about . She called to a man in the hall , " Kin you come talk to this girl bout that riot ? She wants to know something about it . I do n't know . " He came in , a big man past middle age .

They told me at the Criminal Court Clerk 's office to come here . " Then I read the article from the Commercial Appeal and explained that I wanted to know if anybody was ever indicted . The man said , " We do n't even have a Judge Puryear . " " I know . Like I said , this happened in 1917 . " " In 1917 ! " he said incredulously . " Why we do n't even have any records goin ' back that far . " " Upstairs they said you do . I saw their 1917 records , but what 1 want is not carried by their records .

" " Whut chou . I 'm just tryin ' to figure this out . " He cocked his head . " Whut chou wan na know for ? " " I 'm going to write a story about it , " I said . " Oh , " he said .

It takes five minutes to polarize , not white white and black black , but forcibly to people of some rapport and mutual trust , signified by the click-lock of one pair of eyes to another .

The room is becoming dim and soft and the sensation is not dissimilar to a fever spell of remoteness , exhilaration , and intimacy . Coffee break is called and we wander around or take coffee in the drugstore downstairs . The dreamlike ambience continues as we meet other members of the conference , still linked by kindness and the strange pride of those who are constantly offended by the vulgarity of racism .

They look like five Modiglianis : Modigliani and psychedelic-1 learn  --  by courtesy of them if you want to discuss first premises . They may never get up again so enmeshed and tangled in chairs , waiting . There is the deepest humor in the pose , down somewhere in the despairing fount of genuine humor , which is all the more constant for its refusal to be unraveled . They have run around an ellipse of ironies and now are stopped , not able to break out , rooting down motionless in the center , challenging the runners around and around to halt . The meeting starts up , procedural details are discussed by us cowards of distraction , comments and suggestions given by individuals who stand and make statements about purposes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black beret , unlike his other four , so he must be head man of anti-establishment . And he says , not rising , " Un-ruh . " The conference freezes as though slung . " We did n't come to Jackson to talk to white folk , we come to get your money . " " What for ? " " Our projects . " " What do you mean , Charlie ? " " Mr. Onion to you . " " What do you mean , Mr. Onion ? " " I 'm not going to explain it . " " Why ? " " The color of my skin is the explanation . " He holds up one long hand over his head , turning it slowly around and hack , looking up at it as if studying it for the first time , and some are envious of the final answer he sees there . He returns it to his lap , looks down at the floor . Period . There is a stillness like after a song or else a joke you did n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can really guarantee yet is that Freud just passed through : Mr. Onion is highly unboring . A primal femaleness is stirred by the challenge maybe harrowed from sister lioness filing claws , or put another way , here 's man that ca n't be sublimated , but what a battle it could be . White male counterreaction : bullyboy spoiling for a fight to preserve masculinity that has just been thumhnosed by a new skinny kid on the block . There is jealousy as they try to regain staked out territory and find it gone slimy ; lost face at the pupil 's becoming teacher : anger at a couple of female defections so immediately viable in a new sphere ; metaphors mixing and roiling . " Mr. Onion , what kind of an answer is that ? " Their popped-off questions have the effect of dud firecrackers against his shrugs and fat lips that refuse to part . They want the long hand to rise again because this time they would he more ready , but it stays collapsed , having made its point in a perfect understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference must push on despite crazymen . We are assigned to eight discussion groups for the remainder of the evening . My husband is in with Onion , so I wait up until after midnight for the messages of psychosis and futility , and tales of anguished efforts to aid him in his nameless projects by explaining the rudiments of business based on white capitalist experience . Breakfast is country ham , bacon , eggs , grits , blackberry jam , and " Charles Onion is a psycho . " First exercise : we stand in a circle , minus Black Power which is still resting , or maybe has left . We go around the circle one by one , clasping the hands of each in our own , looking into the pit of some of the lives , not able to get beyond the facade of others whose eyes are blurred , and wondering if the latter is due to some look in one 's own , and wondering what the look is , wishing to see it to know oneself , sensing it would be ruined thereby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impossibleness of affixing absolutes to life . And more than that . the despair of individual separateness and the sorrow of the waste of it . the loss in living by halves and quarters and bits and pieces , facades of pleasantries and minor irritations that consume years of all our days , when we were obviously meant for much more . I resume my place in the circle , filled with my rage . Years have passed for some between the first and second touch . The black women are crying . I wish with my soul that I were they . " Make little groups and discuss how you felt " ? an impossible directive . which proves the point of non-atonement . I can be open only on some days in some minutes and if I know my receiver will not laugh and reject , which is n't usually the case he-rause of the identical hangup in him , so my history of love is of falling useless to the ground like the unaudienced forest tree . Strange to think of all the vibrations going unheeded around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attach to , finally sifting down to earth and perhaps accounting for its undying verdancy which continues endlessly in renewal . Children up to an age seem to receive ( my child looking up from his dinner suddenly and saying I see a castle out the window that you ca n't see ) . Thinking of vibrations three Charlies come to sit with me and I figure I gave off the wrong ones . The description is this : Richard a button-down medical student , white shirt , striped tic , freckles , and a thin-lipped crescent smile that stays fixed in mask ; Carter a flabby young married who maybe spent his youth playing bassoon , who courted himself for four years as a beatnik somewhere . wanting now to be a leader in this to compensate for bassoon blowing , a true believer in psychiatry ; crew-cut Joe , on the make in business . Charles Onion enters , stands by the door surveying us . I tell Carter to get him ; he goes over with the little invite . Onion shrugs , pulls his shoulders off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazz running through his bones . I feel like snapping fingers . He coils down , crosses his legs , both feet ending up squarely on the floor . He clears his nose with three snickers and a slow head-shake . Carter , who has his own sinus , explains what has transpired while Onion was zonked and that we are supposed to talk about how it felt to touch . " Honky games , " Onion says . Sitting in a bit of a deadlock we decide there 's nothing for it but to make Onion play . All the clusters about the room are vitally engaged and heads together , so we feel like the third-grade remedial reading group as we stand and redo the exercise . Joe leads off with brisk no-nonsense hands , followed by the wet white bones of Richard , the clammy Carter fat , then mine , first to touch Onion . His are the driest I ever felt . rough and dry and like corncobs . He is looking down as I pass , and I anticipate his coil back around to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gels around , he looks over his shades , something of an acrobatic since he is a foot taller , and there is sex and mutual humor and tentativeness to the look . " Well , now , how do you feel , Charles ? " says Carter . Onion , recoiled and relaxed , looks steadily at Carter through the shades . " I mean how 'd it make you feel ? " he repeats like some queer . The only thing that moves on Onion is his nose . It moves up and down once . Something stinks . Carter gets an uncomfortable look that maybe he wo n't be King of the Blacks after all , and maybe have to blow the bassoon or get a jerky clerk job . Onion keeps looking at him in a way that could tear the yellow pages in half , those two black pieces of glass monster eyes . " What did you feel , Charles ? " " I did n't feel nothing , " Charles says . This is the remedial 's remedial group . What do we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seducing them also . " You hadda feel something , Charlie , " Richard says with his med-school lever of authority . Shifting his head in Richard 's direction he keeps it there , saying , " I did n't feel nothing ... but you and you did , " pointing two long dirty fingernails in the direction of Carter and Joe . Carter breathes again and Joe smiles . Richard says , " But what about me . Charlie ? Whadda I feel ? " " I 'll git back to you after I do them , " he says . With his second finger he presses his shades hard into the bridge of his nose . Everybody 's thrown off , and I 'm thinking he must know something about me that I do n't know because he evidently does n't think I felt anything . Did n't I ? Onion says to Carter and Joe , " You felt ... two . ways , each one felt two ways at the same time . " Glad for some area of agreement they reply together , " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter and Joe look at each other , each hoping the other has the correct answer . I say to Onion , " How did they feel ? " He looks over the shades at me and says , " You do n't know . " I retreat . We all sit and the buzz of other groups continues . Onion says to Carter and Joe , " You wanted to touch me , right ? " " Right . " " But on the other hand , you did n't want to touch me cause you do n't want to never touch nothing so ... black . " Joe smiles at Onion 's perception , " You got it . " Carter wo n't conic clean , so he says he used to be a beatnik , etcetera . When he gets through with that and some talk about paranoia , Onion responds by pointing to Richard and saving , " You the most dangerous man in this room . " " Why do you say that , Charlie ? " Richard says through his crescent smile . " Cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know me ? How can I possibly know you , you keep those sunglasses on all the time I ca n't even see ya . Why do n't ya take them off so I can see ya ? " Onion protects his shades with his finger again and says , " Man you could n't see me if I took them off . You ai n't never seen me in your life . But I been seem ' you . .. and seem ' you .. . and seem ' you . Ever since I been born . I know you . " " How ? " Richard is still smiling and his lips are n't moving when he speaks through his smile . Onion leans his head toward Richard and speaks in a hiss , " I been diggin ' you all my life . Now you dig on yourself . " " Whadda ya mean dig , Charlie ? " and a fleck of spit miraculously escapes Richard 's mask . " For heaven sake , " I say . Joe says , " Let her talk awhile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking . " So I say , " I felt very good vibrations from Mr. Onion . " He looks over the shades , " I know , you the one . knew it when you walked in last night . I ... got something from you I did n't get from them . " I bask in that while Richard , Carter , and Joe begin with the what and why . They press him and he says as I hoped , " For one thing , she 's a woman . " They nod their agreement . All in a second he has made them leap a life 's conditioning of white man protect white woman . Now I 'm laughing . I say , " Charles you 're a poet . You talk like the poets I ever knew . You need maybe a translator sometimes . " I turn to the Chortles and say , " Mr. Onion here is a poet talking us some poems . You try to understand him consecutively and that 's why you ca n't . If you sort of float we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure thing . " " I do n't think he 's saying anything , " Richard says . Onion sinks tow in the chair , puts his finger to his glasses , and begins this tale : " What 's the first thing a black baby sees when he comes out of his Momma 's womb . That big white light . " He reaches his hand up to cup it . " What happen then . The doctor picks him up , give him a lick , he start to breathing , beginning life . Now . You in your dark house . " He sits up suddenly and screams , " Here come that big white light the cops shining on you and say , Git up , gidouta there ! ' " He 's shining his hand convulsively around the circle and the terror goes ecstatically down my spine . " Beautiful . " " God damn shit to hell , " Carter says . " Charlie , " says Richard , " a baby ca n't see when it 's first born . " Old he stold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ k The other old lady lying ' ' ' ; ' ; .. . .. " ; ... ; , . ? - in bed says , " I did not steal : 70:7 ' any chicken shitty knife . I E3 have your knife . "  - -   - -  .4. -J ? for all the beans in China . " mic " Now Mama , " says the blonde middle-aged daughter of the first old lady . " She stold it , Fayrene . I was peeling a orange in some newspaper last Sunday with Elvis on the front page . That 's when she stold it . " " Come on , Mama . Let me roll you out in the hall . We 'll sit out there and talk about it . " The old lady 's roommate says , " Ai n't you even gon na pot your shoes on to go sit in the hall with your daughter ? " " It is certainly none of your business . Anyhow you stold my shoes . She 's got all my shoes hidden down at the foot of her bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the daughter says and shrugs at the other old lady . Out in the hall the daughter settles her mother against the wall and pulls a chair alongside . " Mama , you probably threw your knife out with the peelings . Do n't you remember doing that ? " " It 's too cold in this hall . They try to freeze us out . I want you to go upstairs and tell Colonel Bruce that his fiancee is being froze to death by the air conditioning . " " Colonel Bruce is busy , Mama . Let me just get your sw ea er . " " You ca n't . She stold that too . She 's the craziest woman in the world . She 's got my knife and my shoes and sweater and everything else you can imagine . Yesterday she put my song down there inside my shoe and now I ca n't sing it anymore . " Later on the daughter left and drove her Cadillac to the dime store and bought two knives . Carnival       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
