 | Brave Days and Big HorsesThe Percherons , the Clydesdales , the Shires ? big horses , bred for big work ? where are they now ? A man who drove them and loved them says farewell TODAY THE important thing about horses is their pari-mutuel payoff , but to me these rabbity runners , good for only a twomute sprint around the track , are ccadent grotesqueries . I knew draft horses , strong pullers with too much dignity to be any man 's idle hobby . ' heir world was a good world . I as not horn until it was dying , but know a few things about it that should be recorded before it is lost for-ever from memory . Let us talk horse talk one last time . We lived in small eastern Nebraska towns with unpaved streets , and even today the word " city " means the clang of iron shoes on brick streets . Horses then delivered the freight , the mail , the milk . Beer was advertised by " dress teams " of four , six or eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horseman " by trade , " and when we went to the city , he would say , " There goes a fine , well-matched team . " The team danced with the ponderous grace that only big draft horses had , curving their necks and blowing softly through their nostrils . Their trace chains jingled , the brass knobs twinkled on their hames , their /heavy fetlocks frothed , and ' from them came a clean , salty smell of new sweat . One of Dad 's favorite tales occurred when I was three . Dad was working on a wheat ranch where , in the harvest season , there were as many as 40 horses and mules , each weighing up to i600 pounds , in the @#  | barn . After supper , Dad always let them out of their stalls for a drink and a roll in the dust . ( When a big horse rolled in the dust , it was a cosmic frolic , tremendous to behold . ) One evening my baby brother got out of the house and toddled down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the barn doorway , which the horses were accustomed to jump as they galloped out . The baby sat down beside this sill , in a small depression that the horses had pounded into the ground . My mother saw him from the house and dared not make a sound , lest she startle the horses . The first old mare paused just long enough to shoot her ears and snort . Then she jumped ? over the sill , baby and all . The others did not pause . They picked up the change in rhythm from the old mare and jumped as she had jumped . The baby sat there laughing as those great hoofs flew over his head and hit the ground beside him . One misstep , and he would have been  | smashed or beheaded . " What run-away car would spare a baby ? " my father used to say . I first worked on a farm the summer I was 13 , but long before that I could handle a team . The farm was well known for its Percherons , every horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clydesdale , Shire , folk and Percheron mean ? Those were the leading breeds of draft horses ? big horses bred for work . We never had to learn how to tell a Belgian from a Perron . We always knew . On my first day I was told the names and personality traits of the 12 or 14 horses ? this one would crowd you in the barn ; that one was lazv ; this one feared shrill voices ; it one tried to run with every new driver . After breakfast the boss said , " Harness Chub and Dorothy and Buster and Dimples , and hook into the disk . There 's a rain coming , and this would be a good day to reseed the clover that went to weeds . " We walked to the field together , I driving the horses . A cool , damp wind was blowing , and black clouds were piling up on the horizon . Horses can smell a storm , and all four danced nervously . When we reached the field , the boss said , " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of rounds , I 'll start seeding . " He already knew , by the instinct horsemen had , that I could handle a team . Well ! Four horses , all stately purebreds , in one hitch ! Four heads to be kept evenly abreast ; four brute minds to be kept under control ; four heavy lines in the quivering hands of a boy of 13 ! I climbed into the seat and off we went . When the rain began , I turned my horses ' tails to it ; I have no idea when I learned that no horse can he expected to face a storm . When the rain changed to hail , I knew the boss would be there , and he was , because that 's the way horsemen were . He held the two inside horses while I wrapped my lines around the lever of the disk . Then I jumped down and took the bits of the two near horses , while he held the two off ones , until the storm ended . " Off " and " near " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will our dictionaries carry these defini-tions ? There was no feeling in the world like holding a handful of lines . Late that summer , after the harvest was in and we started fall plowing , I drove a team of six . At first they were hitched with four wheelers behind and two leaders in front . But , as everyone knew then , the wider your hitch , the more power you lose . So after a few days I timidly suggested that I hitch them in a threeand-three tandem , as it was called . " Go ahead , " the boss said . I did , and it worked better . A kw days later I asked if I could line them out two and two and two . " Go ahead , " the boss said ; so now I had not only two leaders and two wheel- ers , but between them the two horses of my " swing " team . One afternoon I had a colt by the name of Gus in my swing team when a storm came up . Ordinarily you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye on him . But I had a steady horse by the name of Dandy working beside Gus , and at first everything went fine . Gus fought only a little as I swung the six of them around , with their rumps to the storm , and then raised the double plows out of the ground . Then Gus quieted down , and all I had to do was shift his line now and then and speak to him to let him know I was still there and would not let anything happen to him . A part-Airedale named Murphy ? a good cattle dog , but gun-shy ? had come to the field with me . When the thunder started crashing , he thought somebody was firing cannon at him and ran under my horses for shelter . The colt went up on his hind legs and came down on top of Dandy . The leaders tried to bolt ahead ; the wheelers tried to back up into the plow . What does a kid of 13 do at such a time ? No one had to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the ground , shook my six lines and yelled , " Hup , hup , hup ! " Dandy felt the slack on his bit and jumped out from under Gus . All six hit their collars . The plows sucked deep into the earth as my team broke into a rhythmical run . Before I let them stop I gave them more running than they wanted . Let a horse get away with something , and you " spoil him . Gus never shied from another dog , and he never tried again run . Each horse was different , some rules applied to all horses . You never walked behind a horse without the courtesy of telling him y were there . You never walked in his stall without giving him chance to make room for you . In any emergency , you got to a horse 's head as fast as you could , because only there could you hold him . swung on the bits of rearing , frightened horses when I weighed more than 6o pounds ? yes , a held them , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvest up through the Dakotas and Canada . Most of the horses were " farm chunks , " short-coupled , sturdy , nimble horses bred from native bronco mares and purebred stallions . Once we hired out a North Dakota farmer . Where came from , a horse pasture consist of a few hundred acres , at most . B this man had ten sections , 6400 acres with he did not know how ma horses on it , and we spent 15 hours in the saddle the next day , " cutting out " eight teams and hazing the back to the barn . That night I was so tired I bare made it from my saddle pony 's st to my bed in the hay in the bar Listening to those farm chunks fighting their halters , I thought , " surely does n't expect to thresh whe with those broncs ! Or does he ? " But the next morning we harnessed those horses . They bucked and pitched and fought like rodeo horses ? but we worked them . It was one of the wildest , happiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think I made mistake , " the boss said , as we unhitched that night . " That off horse yours ai n't the one I meant to get . That horse has never had a halter on before ! But I guess you 're geyting along with him all right , ai n't you ? " My arms ached from fighting those two horses all day , and I still had raw saddle sores from the day before . But what would you have said ? " Oh , sure , I 'm getting along just fine , " I said nonchalantly . That is what we lost when the world of working horses came to an end . I love cars . I take care of a car the way I was taught to take care of a horse . But you walk into a dark garage , and nothing moves . You go in behind your car without speaking to it , and it does not move over for you . It does not kick , but neither is it glad to have you there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
