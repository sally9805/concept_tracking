The Catholic hierarchy of the U.S. issued a 25,000-word pastoral letter last week that was both a summons to continued renewal of the church and a warning against excessive zeal for reform . In the spirit of recent papal encyclicals on social affairs , it urged Catholics to be concerned with the eradication of " indignity , injustice and inhumanity " on the ground that " when one of us is denied justice , all are threatened . " At the same time , the letter upheld the primacy of the spiritual over the secular and censured a kind of religious amnesia that has blotted out respect for past traditions . <P> " With sadness , " the bishops said , " we notice that some today , using the noble word charism or employing theology almost as therapy , ridicule the church and , under the guise of being contemporary , seem hostile to everything except their own views . What begins as necessary and solid criticism seems readily to degenerate into a destructive attitude toward life unworthy of reason and inconsistent with faith . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has led to a number of errors that now threaten the church - such as the argument that the primary need in Catholicism is not " conversion to God " but a rebuilding of structures , and that the priestly ministry is not a special divine gift . In deploring the " derelict priest , " who has scandalized the faithful by leaving the church , the bishops argued that the meaning of the priesthood can not be made relevant in purely humanistic categories . " It is not the Christian vocation to canonize the human condition as such or to lament over it . It is our vocation to rise above it where it drags us down ; to ennoble it by the operation of that Spirit Who continually refreshes the church and renews the face of the earth .
