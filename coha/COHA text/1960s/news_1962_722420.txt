txt Letters to The Times MORRIS FISHBEIN , M.D. , WILLIAM L. STANDARD . Athens , April 24 , 1962 . SUZANNE P. ... Letters to The Times Control of Drugs Warning Given on Interfering With Development of Products More Litter Baskets Asked TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I am a resident of East Harlem . The Department of Sanitation has begun a laudable campaign to enforce sanitation laws against littering but has overlooked one very practical consideration . Many areas have such a paucity of litter baskets that the temptation to drop candy wrappers , sandwich wrappings , ice cream sticks is more than we can reasonably expect a citizen to resist . It is possible to walk many blocks in East Harlem in search of a litter basket , all to no avail . The problem is aggravated by the fact that residents of East Harlem live in overcrowded tenements and of necessity spend more time on the street , when possible , than do residents of the fortunate rich sections . JEREMIAH BROWN , R. N. New York , May 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Attack on Government The writer of the following letter was a United States delegate to the International Maritime Committee Conference at Athens , representing the Maritime Law Association of the United States . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : You conclude your editorial of April 23 " Riots in Athens " by saying , " That there have been election irregularities is shown by the fact that the Supreme Election Tribunal has ordered two local repeat elections . But the irregularities that have been discovered are on toe small a scale to affect the election results as a whole . " The burden of your editorial is that the opposition to the Government is , in the main , spearheaded by the Greek Communist groups in the Soviet bloc countries and therefore , in essence , constitutes an alien force . That the opposition to the Government receives support from the Greek forces in exile can not be doubted , but it seems to be an incorrect evaluation of the true basis of the present resistance to the Caramanlis election victory of last October . A deputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition ) executive committee submitted a memorandum to the Government and the Minister of the Interior outlining why the October election constituted a coup d'etat . This memorandum recites the instances in which public money , the state mechanism , the security corps , the Army and other public organizations and enterprises , illegitimately influenced the electoral body . The E. D. A. is joined in its opposition to the October election by the Center Union ( E. K. ) , the party of former Premier Popandreou . The E. K. deputies also deposited a formal protest to the election . Your editorial therefore seems incorrectly to appraise the " irregularities " of the October election hi Greece by measuring the breaches . When a government in power resorts to the employment of government institutions , particularly the army and national security battalions to garner support for itself during an election , it would seem that the democratic election process is indeed put in jeopardy . That this should happen in Greece , the very birthplace of democracy , is distressing . WILLIAM L. STANDARD . Athens , April 24 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEW YORK TIMES I was glad that The Times ran a story ( April 30 ) on . the dispute now raging over the sale of a piece of property on the Potomac River just above Washington for the construction of tower apartments . It was an accurate report ; this matter is creating a great deal of furor for all the reasons your article mentioned , especially those concerning esthetics and conservation . I hope that The Times will continue to cover this situation because it involves us all  --  not just the frantic residents of and the large and increasing number of Washingtonians who want to preserve a beautiful section of our river . It involves the rest of America , too , for a colder and more practical reason ; they as taxpayers have a stake in the outcome of this dispute . Many private , state and Federal agencies and groups , including all the communities in the Washington metropolitan area , are at work on the various aspects of purifying the Potomac River . The goal is a river pure enough to supply the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing , and even , perhaps , swimming . In a few years , when this has been achieved , about $100 million , most of it the taxpayers ' money , will have been spent to make the Potomac as clean , clear and odorless as possible . It would be an irrevocable waste of natural beauty and tax dollars if by that time the wooded gorges of the palisades area will have been replaced by huge apartment developments . SUZANNE P. ROOSEVELT . Washington , May 7 , 1962 . Rail Wage Dispute Destroying Radiation Belt TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Have the origin and purpose served , if any , by the inner Van Allen radiation belt in the scheme of things been so satisfactorily determined as to justify its being destroyed ? If not , to run the risk of doing so seems incredibly wanton , to a layman at least . JAMES F. THACHER . San Francisco , May 8 , 1962 . To EDITOR or TiraNaw YORK TIMIS Your recent editorial on the control of pharmaceuticals disturbs me . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , promotion and use of medicaments . The developments of the last fifty years represent greater progress in the relief of pain , the prolongation of life and the cure of disease than in the previous fifty centuries . In the report of the address by Dr. Helen B. Taussig , according to your excellent reporter Robert K. Plumb she said , in a news conference , that " the dangerous drug called ' Contergan ' in Germany , and tentatively called ' Kevadon ' here , did not obtain Federal approval to sell the drug here because officials were suspicious of it ; nonetheless it could have been passed . " Thus she seems to be saying that it was not approved but it could have been . Tests on Animals The scientific status of Dr. Taussig as a physiologist is unquestioned . She has not , however , qualified as an expert in drug research , development or promotion , or in the laws regulating these activities . She urges that every drug introduced into common use be tested on pregnant animals . If this were done the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wrath by Senator Estes Kefauver . Furthermore , tests of pregnant animals would have to be supplemented by study on pregnant women . The Times urges stringent tests of drug safety . It says : " People are not guinea pigs and the law should not permit them to be used as such . " Some of the greatest discoveries ever made were achieved on human volunteers who voluntarily submitted themselves as aids in the search for the causes and methods of prevention and treatment of human disease . Controlled tests of patients are now an indispensable step in determining effectiveness of medicaments after experiments on animals have been completed . I have been amazed at the emphasis placed on the kind of testimony secured by Senator Kefauver . This was a fiesta for the mavericks , the discontented , discharged employes , scientific Leftists , summoned from far and near to make the usual Kefauver holiday . I do not recall that an equal number of members of the United States Pharmacopeial Commission , the Council on Drugs , or similar groups that have been concerned for years with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laws President Kennedy has recommended legislation in this field which deserves careful consideration , although some of the recommendations are unnecessary in the light of prevailing legislation , which would be effective with sufficient funds for adequate enforcement . The Food and Drug Administration can decline approval to any drug of which the safety is doubtful . The great problem is not proving safety but proving effectiveness . However , the border between what is harmful and what is safe , between what is effective and what is not , is a wide area , not a single , sharp line . Legislation never keeps pace with progress , and where progress has been so enormous and so rapid , legis-lation has probably lagged behind . However , let us be careful not to impede progress . Let us beware of limiting the introduction of needed and useful medicines . Our great pharmaceutical laboratories have equipment and personnel for standardization and research which compare favorably with  --  which are perhaps superior to  --  any governmental or university or industrial establishment that I have seen elsewhere . Legislation passed in the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as that associated with the Kefauver hearings , may interfere with the development of products potential for saving the lives of many thousands of people and beneficially affecting the health of even more . MORRIS FISHBEIN , M. D. , Editor , Medical World News , Excerpta Medica , and formerly editor , Journal of the American Medical Association . Chicago , April 28 , 1962 . Emergency Boards ' Bole in Proposing Solutions Outlined The writer of the following was Chairman of Emergency Board No. 145 which made a report to the President on May 3 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMM : Your editorial of May 5 " Off the Track on Rail Wages " reveals an erroneous conception of the function of emergency boards under the Railway Labor Act . You state that the Presidential board , having put chief emphasis on the heavy displacement of manpower which has occurred , should have confined itself to recommendations for " increased unemployment pay , retraining allowances or other protective measures . " The act empowers the President to create a board , " If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should . . . threaten substantially to interrupt interstate commerce . . . . " The board Is charged with the duty to " .. . investigate promptly the facts as to the dispute .. ? and make a report thereon to the President . . . " " The dispute " in this case centered around the labor organizam tions ' demand for a 25-cent wage increase and the carriers ' proposal for a wage cut . It also dealt wit ' , the organizations ' demand for a six ? month notice of layoff as again the carriers ' proposal for a reduo tion of existing notice requirements to twenty-four hours . Issues Not Presented I agree that the unions would hay been well advised to concentrate o demands which would have assur displaced workers increased unemployment pay , retraining allowances or other protective measures . Bun they did not do so and the dispute the board was appointed to investigate did not present those issues . The board 's report chided the parties for their failure to treat in collective bargaining with this fundamental problem of employe protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions with the parties , the board raised this issue and sought to obtain agreement on a solution embodying the principle of employe protection . On page 8 of its report the board said , " It is unfortunate that a confluence of circumstances prevented agreement on the adoption of these principles or some variant thereof . " . The emergency board made no recommendations on the subject of employe protection , however , because this subject was not an issue in the dispute laid before it . Perhaps it should have been ; the fact is that it was not . Policy on Settlement The fundamental policy of the Railway Labor Act is to require that the parties try to settle their disputes by collective bargaining . It was the hope of the framers of the act that in direct bargaining the parties would recognize and meet the real needs of the industry and the employes . Emergency boards were provided to aid the process at the point where direct bargaining bogged down . But where direct bargaining fails to bring a problem to the fore , it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat it as a dispute and to ' propose a solution for it . That course would involve the very kind of governmental intervention that constitutes a negation of collective bargaining . An emergency board can only recommend solutions for the issues over which the parties themselves have a dispute . At the same time it may bring to the forefront , for the parties ' consideration in direct barp gaining , basic issues they have failed to raise . This is what Emergency Board No. 145 tried to do . SAUL WALLEN . Boston , May 6 , 1962 . Mr. Wallen 's letter oonfirms our observation that prolonged dependence on Government intervention by rail management and labor has made both " prisoners of a Government-dominated negotiating structure , in which they make no independent effort to solve their own problems . " What his letter adds is that the Presidential emergency board also finds itself a prisoner , powerless to make decisions that have any relevance to the real needs of either side . ?
