txt Washington , Oct. 19 ? Senate Republican Leader Dirksen Ill. summed up the work of the Democratic - controled , Johnson-dominated 89th Congress today with the observation : " The government 's house is not in order . " In a 14-page pamphlet as an official document of the ' Congress . Dirksen blamed the Johnson administration for the soaring price of cornflakes , ' . riots in the streets , foreign ? sneers and jeers , inflation , rising bankruptcies , and the third biggest war in American history . It 's " The Year When : " This has been the year , Dirksen said , when : An additional 150,000 Americans were sent abroad to fight a war which already is the longest , and the third largest , war in our history . Some 14,000 national guardsmen were sent to guard our streets at home ; when law enforcement officers were called to quell violence in our streets . People were afraid to walk the streets alone ; when police were confronted by a gigantic increase in crime . Inflation sent the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . " Conspicuously Unsolved " " These are the great dilemmas of our times , " Dirksen said . " All of them are conspicuously unsolved under the Great Society . " " Uncertainty , queasy doubts , bewilderment , have spread across the country , " he said . " Abroad , there is jeering and sneering at ' our country . Our flags are burned and spat upon . Our embassies are attacked . In Viet Nam the American death toll continues to mount . " Of the Viet Nam war , Dirksen said the administration reported there are now 320,000 troops , plus 50,000 men in our naval fleet operating off Viet Nam , plus 25,000 more troops in nearby Thailand . " And American dead and wounded have passed the 32,000 mark . " he said . " Hooray for What ? " He recalled that Ed Wynn once starred in a play called " Hooray for What ? " " Every housewife in the land can signal a ' Hooray for What ? ' toward the Democratic administration each time she goes to the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornflakes soars again . One housewife is planning to buy two packages as soon as she can find a cosigner . " Since the end of the Eisenhower administration , Dirksen said , " your grocery dollar has dropped to 84 cents . . . your rent dollar to 98 cents . yo.ir apparel dollar is now worth 91 cents . . . and your auto insurance dollar is now worth 62 cents . " " Are those the marks of a Great Society ? " he asked . " The Johnson administration has a remarkable collection of hummingbird economists who can reverse themselves without first stopping . They stand still in mid-air while making motions in an attempt to convince everyone the government can spend for vast new domestic programs while at the same time supporting a war costing 25 billion to 30 billion dollars a year , keeping prices down , and maintaining a balanced economy . " He said the administration went its " higgledy - piggledy way " with political salesmen pursuing domestic social programs " with the pop-eyed ardor of a Harpo Marx chasing blondes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society ? " Dirksen asked .
