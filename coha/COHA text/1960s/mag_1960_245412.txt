Seven autumns and scores of lawsuits after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled school segregation unconstitutional , the Southern Education Reporting Service last week issued a mixed progress report . For the first time , in fall 1960 , the South opened its public schools without a shred of violence-not a single riot or bombing disturbed the peace . But not one Negro child as yet attends class with whites in Alabama , Georgia , Mississippi , South Carolina or Louisiana. * And out of 3,095,345 Negro pupils in all Southern public schools , only 183,104 attend integrated classes in 1960 . Compared to last year , the gain is a slim 2,084 . <P> <P> * Token integration for New Orleans ' first-grade pupils is scheduled for Nov. 14 , but only 135 Negro children have applied . All " integrated " classes will be segregated by sex . Even these minimal plans may yet be killed by Louisiana 's guitar-twanging Governor Jimmie Davis , who insists that he will allow no integration at all .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
