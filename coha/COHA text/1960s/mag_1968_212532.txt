Returning to New Hampshire last week , George Romney assiduously prospected the Granite State for votes in its March 12 presidential primary . It was mechanized mining , aided by the Michigan Governor 's computerized mailing drive and highlighted by a calculated schedule of stops where support seemed most likely . <P> From Nashua to Dixville Notch , he sermonized in boys ' school and fish factory , Y.M.C.A. and insurance office , shopping center and ski resort . Mostly he campaigned in living rooms , where he tapped a veritable mother lode . <P> The women gathered , burbling babes on many laps , in a kaffeeklatsch campaign so stimulating to Romney 's cause that an undercover Nixonite grated : " We ought to get this going for Nixon now . " Sipping coffee , munching doughnuts , shaking Romney 's hand , the women heard him inveigh against godlessness , immorality , sloth , the decline of the family , even the English , whom he characterized as interested only in " two hots and a cot , " or two square meals and a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , so vague were his exhortations for the most part that even hard-liners-of whom New Hampshire has a plenitude-often wagged their heads in accord with what they thought he said . When Romney called for the U.S. to " go on the peace offensive , " one middle-aged woman chortled : " I like what he wants to do . go in there and get it over with . We 're wasting too much time . " <P> " I feel I 've made some progress , " said Romney at week 's end . Indeed , his staffers now have hopes that the overwhelming Nixon support in New Hampshire may be as shallow as it is wide . Even Nixon 's forces are skeptical of one early poll showing Romney behind 5 to 1 . Nixonites feel that this is merely a ploy to make even slight gains seem a Romney triumph . They may well be , since enthusiasm for a Ronald Reagan write-in-which would siphon off Nixon strength-is evaporating . As if this were not enough woe for Romney , six Nelson Rockefeller supporters paid the $10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary part of the ballot , and Rocky 's 1964 New Hampshire chairman continues to contemplate a Granite State write-in for the Rock .
