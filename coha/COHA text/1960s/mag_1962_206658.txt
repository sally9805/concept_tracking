The sticky , squint-eyed world of the stamp collector was rocked to its very perforations last week . It was a flurry over a flaw , and as every one of the U.S. 's more than 13 million stamp collectors knows , a flaw is worth far more than perfection . Rarity is , of course , the touchstone by which all stamps are valued ; but more often than not , a rare stamp is different from millions of its counterparts only because it has some technical disfigurement . To the **28;14221;TOOLONG set , discovery of such minor imperfections as missing watermarks or **30;14251;TOOLONG is like finding a Rembrandt painted under a Rousseau or a mint-condition 1908 Locomobile in a hay barn . <P> Sugarplums , College . It began last month when the Bureau of Engraving and Printing turned out 120 million oblong black , brown and yellow stamps to memorialize the late U.N . Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold . Jewelry Salesman Leonard Sherman , 38 , of Irvington , N.J. , bought four 50-stamp sheets of the first-day Hammarskjolds , next day took them out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his hands tremble : the yellow background was printed not only off-center but upside down , so that an inverted " 4 " mark appeared in ghostly white 50 times on the sheet in the wrong place . Sherman , who has been collecting stamps for only four years , knew the story of the 1918 airmail stamp , when a sheet of a hundred 24 stamps was printed with a quaint old Army Jenny putting along upside down like something out of a flying circus . Individual stamps from that sheet are now worth $13,000 ; a center line block of four goes for $65,000 . Visions of philatelic sugarplums began to dance through Sherman 's head . <P> Until he could find out more about their value , Sherman decided to keep quiet about his stamps . Then , last week , he saw a small newspaper item about Gerald Clark , a collector in Ohio who had bought a sheet of the faulty Hammarskjolds , had mailed 31 of them off on letters before a friend pointed out the oddity . Clark checked with local post offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured that his remaining 19 stamps were worth $200,000 . On that basis , Sherman figured that his intact sheet of 50 must be valued at more than $500,000 , started making plans for sending his five sons through college . <P> Jackpot , Scandal . Vanity overcoming discretion , Sherman phoned the Newark Evening News to boast of his own treasure trove , and the story of his bonanza burst into headlines across the country . In Washington , Postmaster General J. Edward Day reacted hastily . He directed the printing of 400,000 more Hammarskjolds with the identical imperfect backgrounds - thus knocking down the worth of the originals to little more than the 4 they had cost at the post office . Moaned Sherman 's wife : " Is n't that lousy ? " <P> Sherman did what he could . He asked the federal courts to issue a restraining order to block the sale . But it came too late . Some 320,000 of the phony collectors ' items had been snapped up in under four hours at the department 's Philatelic Sales Agency before the order arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
