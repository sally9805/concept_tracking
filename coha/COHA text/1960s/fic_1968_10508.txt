" The engagement of Miss Jessie Weiss of Grady 's Mills to Mr. Horace Simon of New York was announced today . Miss Weiss is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Herman Weiss of 103 Sixth Street . She is a graduate of Grady 's Mills High School and for the last three years has been a student at the Emerson Collegeof Oratory in Boston , Mass . Mr. Simon , the son of Mr. and Mrs. Adolph Simon of New York , is a scene designer , associated with theaters in Provincetown , Mass. , and Greenwich Village in New York . Marriage plans will be announced shortly . " I did n't compose this social item . It 's not the News-Record 's style . We lead off such announcements with the fiancee 's parents ' names and end with the date of the nuptials . This was scribbled on a lined sheet torn from a loose-leaf college notebook and handed to me in the newsroom by the bride herself . " This will clinch it , " she assured me . " It will end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument , in the way she introducedthe groom : " My husband , Horace Simon . " In reflex , I glanced at her left hand before I glanced at him . Jessie wore no ring , and what she 'd picked for herself I would n't have , for her . Delicate was the word for Horace . ( My mother cried " consumptive " the minute she laid eyes on him . ) He was slight , with freckled , milk-white skin , ginger hair , toothbrush mustache , prominent front teeth and feverish blue eyes , Goyishlookingexcept for a gallows-humor expression in which , along with , usually there is a dash of superciliousness . I said , " Congratulations . " He said , " Thanks . You 're the first who 's offered it . " They perched on my desk . He brought out cigarettes . Jessie and I took . He held a light to hers , a courtesy not often seen in 192140in Grady 's Mills , where women smoked , when and if , behind locked bathroom doors . " Papa 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Still afraid of Papa ? " I asked . " Nacherly . The right-hand man of God . " " You 're a married woman , are you not ? " I asked . " I 'm his child , am I not ? " she asked . I reread her announcement . " Betrothed or wed ? " " Both , " Jessie said . " Depending where I go to bed . " " Jingle , " Horace said . Then , alternating gravity with jest , they filled me in on what had gone before . They had arrived yesterday . Jessie 'd been expected , this being the semester 's end , but she 'd neglected to warn the family she was bringing company . Ida , hot and disheveled , was frying blintzes on a wood fire in the stove . The kitchen was hazy with charred butter smoke . Flypaper spiraled above the table where the dough discs cooled . The flies , numerous and intrepid , swooped low , ignoring it . " Who is there ? Aha , Jessie ! You came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Celia , teaching domestic science at Hartzville , twenty miles west of here , commuted on the interurban electrified trolley line . " Mama , this is Horace Simon . " Mama slued around . Her chins went slack . " Good afternoon , good evening , gentleman . " She wiped her hands on her apron and touched his outstretched fingertips . " How do you do ? From where ? . . . From New York ? You come for vacation in Grady 's Mills ? A nice place . Fresh air . Not like New York . " She was burbling , out of nervousness . " So , Jessie , why do n't you mail a postcard you are bringing company from New York ? " " We figured we 'd get here before the card , " Jessie said . " Excuse me . My blintzes . " Ida flipped the film of batter in the pan and mopped her neck with a dish towel . " You like to stay for supper , Mr. . . . Mr. Simons ? A plain family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sour cream . Hot weather , who cats more ? " " Thank you , " Horace said . " I 'll try anything . " 41Her glance was suddenly distrustful . " You a Gentile ? " " Hardly , " Horace said . Ida swung her pan over to the table , flopped a dough disc out and dipped her ladle into batter . " Horace , put the valises there . " Jessie pointed to her old bedroom . The batter spoon clanged on the floor . " In Celia 's room ! You crazy ? He 's gon na sleep in Celia 's room ? " " In my room , " Jessie said . Blood rushed to Ida 's face . Her eyes began to bug . " What are you ? A hoor ? " " We 're married , " Jessie said . " A week ago . By a Justice of the Peace . " Ida 's sharp eyes darted toward Jessie 's waist . " I 'm not pregnant , " Jessie said . ( Horace on my newsroom desk was listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , as , no doubt , he 'd listened to the kitchen dialogue . " I was fascinated , " he put in , " by the pompadour and the general type . " " Mama is no type , " Jessie retorted . " She is an original . Nothing like it anywhere . And thank God for those small kindnesses . " ) The original was turning purple ; they were afraid she 'd have a stroke . " I forbid it , " Ida sputtered . " Celia gets married first . " " She missed the boat , " Jessie said . " Boat ? What boat ? Where is the ring ? " Jessie took a gold hoop from her purse . " So ! You 're ashamed to wear it . I Ic must be a Goy . " " My parents are Jewish , German Jews , " I brace said . Ida spat . " Fui . Worse . Reformers , no ? " Horace smiled indulgently . " Justice Peace to a Reformer is no marriage . " Ida clasped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till Mr. Weiss and Celia hear this monkey business ! " " Come into the parlor , Horace , " Jessie said . " Let Mama fry and stew . " When Celia heard the news shortly after six , she blanched , said " Oh ! " and then " I 'm not hungry , it 's too hot , I 'll go down , relieve Papa , let him enjoy his supper with Jessie 's company . " 42 ( " An excuse , " Jessie told me . " To get away , be by herself , not let me see her busting out in tears because I 'd found a husband first . " ) " Jessie 's here , she can set the table , " Celia added . " And kindly do not use my drawn-work tablecloth . " Herman , they went on to tell me , took the matter with more aplomb than anyone 'd expected . He merely asked Horace , " You 're a Jew ? " Ida got the answer in before Horace had a chance . " A Reformer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents belong to Emanuel , the Temple , " Horace said . " They consider themselves good Jews . They contribute to the Federation . My father is a banker . " Ida snatched that up . " He will support you ? " " I doubt it , " Horace said . " They do n't like this any more than you . " " What 's not to like ? " Ida flared , defending her own . " A college girl . From a educated Jewish family . " She eyed Jessie . " Aha , you want my diamonds . You need my diamonds to show off for his family . " " It never crossed my mind , " Jessie said . " You do n't get . " Ida banged the table with her fist . " Did I ask you , Mama ? Keep them . Wear them in good health . " " And imagine , Sam , " Jessie interpolated for me , " my mother knowing me so little , I should care about her diamonds  --  me ! Let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My mother-in-law is crass , I fear . " " Not Papa , " Jessie said . " He was dignified , if not altogether sensible . Our child will be married by the rabbi , under the chupa , in this house . ' That was what he said . Our daughter stays here , in our house , till we decide how to arrange . The young man cannotsleep here ; it is forbidden . ' " " And so , " Jessie went on , " Horace slept at the hotel last night and I slept back to back with sister Celia ; not a word between us . To keep me chaste  --  not virginal , chaste  --  till the folks decide when to let us marry orthodox . It 's stupid ! Idiotic ! So we decided to bring things to a head by announcing it this way . When the43Hill starts asking , Nu ? ' and When ? ' they 'll have to get busy . Otherwise "  --  she shrugged  --  " we 'll pack and hop the train . I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Horace has to get to work . He has this summer job at Provincetown .... " " Provincetown ! " I 'd noticed the name in the paragraph ; I 'd been trying to associate . " Eugene O'Neill ! " " Uh huh , " Jessie said . I showed excitement . " Have you met him ? Do you know him ? " Jessie laughed . " Did you once sec Shelley plain ? ' Yes , sir , we know Gene . " She looked at Horace rather hard . " He drinks too much , " she said , whether meaning Simon or O'Neill , I could not decide . " He writes good plays , " Horace said . " The theater 's our life , " Jessie said . " I envy you , " I said . As soon as our paper hit the porches on the hill , phones began to ring  --  Should we congratulate I lerman and Ida or commiserate with them ? One call , from another part of town , to Herman 's Grocery , just before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ida took the receiver off the hook . " I lah-lo , Herman 's Grocery . " " I 'd like to speak with Mrs. Weiss . " " She is speaking . Who is calling ? " " This is Mildred Hartman . " " Mildred Hartman ? From where ? ... From Grady Avenue ! " " Mrs. Weiss , I saw the announcement of your daughter 's engagementin this evening 's paper . I called uiv friend , Mrs. Adolph Simon , at once , long distance , in New York .... " " Your friend ! Long distant ! New York ! " Ida was impressed . " Blanche Simon was shocked . She and Adolph  --  Mr. Simon  --  are frantic . Horace is their only child . They begged me to do anything , everything , to stop this insanity . " " What 's the matter ? The young man is crazy in the head ? " Ida privately had thought as much . " The young man is crazy to throw away a fortune . He will not have a penny , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . He will be a pauper if he marries your daughter . " 44 " And what is missing with my daughter ? A college girl from a educated family . " " She 's simply not their kind , " Mrs. Hartman said . Ida , when she told my mother and her other cronies afterwards , said she was certain she would plotz , then and there , standing at the wall telephone . She clung to the box and summoned her pride . " Our kind is Jewish scholars , rabbis , not big-money people . And we also are not happy our daughter wants to marry with somebody who is not our kind . But we are modren people . We understandthe world is different in America from in the old country . My own father found for me the husband , a Talmudist , a gentlemanof highest quality . And I am proud to be his wife . In America , the children are the boss . There is not respect for parents . So they decide to get married , so we do not stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , eight o'clock in the parlor from our house . Sooner we would make it , only Mr. Weiss and myself are every day and evenings in the store , earning an honest living . Saturday , our Shabbos , we are closed , we rest . So the nighttime we have strength to make the wedding . So , please , Mrs. Mildred Hartman , you will be so kind , make one more long-distant call . Tell Mr. and Mrs. Simon from Mrs. Herman Weiss , they are invited to the wedding in our house . " When I learned about the conversation , I was pleased . The genteel busybody , Mrs. Hartman , had been taken down a peg . Ida phoned me at the paper the next afternoon . " Sammy , I want to make an appointment with you . Business . " " I 'm no longer tutoring , Mrs. Weiss . " " Do n't make jokes . It is important , Sammy , please . Only your mama should n't know , Mr. Weiss should n't know . " I agreed I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , while Herman was at morning prayers . " Sammy , something you must do for me . I want you should buy a box expensive letter-writing paper  --  I will pay for it . On this you should typewrite for me a letter to Mr. and Mrs. Adolph Simon in New York , invite them in polite words Saturday to come to their son 's wedding in mine house . " " Nothing doing . Leave me out of this . " Her plump fingers squeezed my arm . " Sammy , I feel for her , his4Smother . A mother 's hearts is all the same , broken in little pieces when the children is making a terrible mistake . " She paused to change her mood and tone . " A bargain Jessie catched ! Skinny like a herring ! White like a consumptive ! Poor like a captzin ! " Anotherpause , to shift the mood again . " Her , the Mrs. Simon , me the Mrs. Weiss , the two of us could cry out our hearts together , our children is making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there 's to be inviting , Horace has to do it . Phone them , write them , bring them here , that 's up to their son , " though I suspected it would be far worse if they came . The herringbarrels , Ida 's pompadour , the brown and green plush parlor would convince them that their son had fallen among primitives . When I relayed Ida 's request , Horace smiled . " The ceremony is just to humor Jessie 's dad , " he said , adding , to enlighten me , that marriage was a personal affair , a compact between adults and no one 's business but their own ; all the rites and rituals , laws and customs , were superstitious crap . This , I gathered , was what is meant by being bohemian , which I presumed they believed they were . There was one more battle , brief and loud and nasty . Sixth Street heard it through the open windows and Sixth Street was appalled , Jessie shouting , " Let 's have no more talk . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not have those alte bobbes poking at my tits . " My mother went white . " Not go to the mikvah ! A big sin . " She shook her head ominously . " From this they have bad trouble , sure and positive . " It was a small wedding . I was there because Jessie had requested the honor of my presence ; my parents were asked because I was . The rabbi brought his wife ; she had to bring along five little ones ( like steps ) . Cantor Leiberman , sad-faced , shrunken , came with his teen-age daughter . The shamas and his son ( just past Bar Mitzvah ) were included , so that they , with my father and myself , might hold up the four sticks of the red velvet bridal canopy , a function traditionally performed by male kinsmen of the bride . The rabbi 's consent to give his blessing to a bride who had rejected the ritual bath was , undoubtedly , a deference to the respected Herman Weiss , a special kindness , not to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think back , I 'm sure there was no minyan . Under the circumstances , no one made an issue out of this . The night was too warm for Ida to wear her Yom Tov black silk , even had she felt festive . The bride , scorning convention , wore a sack of red batik , though , perversely , she 'd hung a wisp of veiling on her face . The groom wore a borrowed yarmulka , tilted rakishly on his ginger hair . Horace was the most nonchalant bridegroom I have ever seen , acting like a bemused spectator rather than a participant , repeatingthe vows and prayers after the rabbi with an intonation that was insulting mimicry . And Jessie , for once , kept her voice to a whisper and grinned wickedly when Horace put the gold hoop on her fourth finger . It was as if both of them had set out to make a farce of this . Her parents stood side by side , the Grady 's Mills Gothic , stern and more than a little sad . The rabbi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stamped and smashed a wine glass , as instructed , and raised the veil to peck Jessie 's cheek , there were bleats of " Mazel Tov " from the rabbi 's wife , my parents and the shamas . I kissed the bride 's cheek . " Thank you , " Jessie said . " I 'm glad someone did . " My mother bustled , passing squares of sponge cake and glasses of sweet Passover wine . The carpet and the green upholstery were sprinkled with yellow crumbs . One of the rabbi 's children jogged an elbow and a wine glass spilled . The son of the shamas , believing now he was a man , guzzled too much wine and threw up in the kitchen sink . The rabbi 's children became pests underfoot . Their mother shepherded them home to bed . Jessie disappeared into the bedroom to gather up her things , and the rest of us stood around , wondering how soon we ought to leave . Ida , red-eyed , red-faced , kept slicing cake and decanting wine , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty . " I saw Herman touch his son-in-law 's arm , lead him to his bedroom , shut the door . Then , for the first time in that hypocritical evening , I became aware of Celia . She crouched in a green armchair , cradling something in her lap . Tears were coursing down her cheeks . I touched her arm . She glanced up with streaming eyes . " My Good Fairy , " she sobbed . She took her hands away from what was in her lap and I saw shards of plaster , tinted bronze. 47 " My Good Fairy was smashed , " Celia wailed . " At my sister 's wedding . " Now , surely , this was none of Jessie 's doing , intentionally or otherwise  --  one of those rambunctious kids , no doubt  --  but just as surely Jessie would be blamed for it . I 'm reasonably certain , too , that Jessie never knew about the accident , nor about the debate that started on the morning after . My mother , bless her heart , was responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the One Above should give me strength , " my mother told the women on the porch of Herman 's Grocery , her fist beating her chest for emphasis . " To me Ida said the first one married gets the diamonds . " " Mrs. Rosenbaum , dolling . " Mrs. Katz confused the issue . " First one means first-borned , married or no married . " " First married , " my mother insisted . " Ask her , " Mrs. Rogoff suggested , pointing to the stairs and meaning Ida . " Who could ask ? " Mrs. Katz shrugged her hands . " To her , betternot to talk . The mother 's heart is broke . Jessie grabs from who knows where a boychick . Leaves the sister sitting , an old maid . Diamonds , yet , the mother should give ? " " I was by the wedding . " By this advantage my mother had becomethe unimpeachable authority . " A wedding ! I would be ashame such a wedding in mine house . Sponge cake . Pesach wine . Not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk dress ? No . A shmate she was wearing , like for standing in the grocery . Did Ida wear the earrings and the pin ? No . So Jessie must got . No ? " Phones rang again in all the dwellings on the I Till , which divided into factions that argued heatedly . Did Jessie get her mother 's diamonds ? Should Jessie have received the diamonds ? If Jessie did n't get the diamonds , was it fair to punish her for marrying before Celia did ? As far as I know , Jessie left with only her clothes and books when she and Horace boarded the midnight for New York . I did inquire about the gems , obliquely , in October , when I called on the newlyweds in New York . Ida 'd found their address for me , 48scrawled on a penny postcard : " Jessie Weiss and Horace Simon at home at  --  " Home was the basement of a Greenwich Village red-brick . I inhaled must , mildew , mice droppings and the leakage of bad plumbing as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front room this couple was living mainly on literature , cigarettes and love . There was a wall of book-filled shelves ( " Horace built the shelves , " Jessie informed me ) ; two day beds , right-angled to each other ( " Second-hand , " Jessie said ) ; two low tables , one bright blue , one bright red ( " Horace made them " ) , both holding crude clay ash trays , heaped with butts ; a chest of drawers , bright yellow ( " Bought from Salvation Army  --  Grand Rapids oak  --  Horacescraped and painted it " ) ; a fireplace , choked with wood ashes , paper bags and stubs of cigarettes ; bare floor ; iron bars outside the windows , cracked green shades within . As an old friend , I could be frank . " Why did n't you hock the diamonds and buy yourselves some chairs ? " " Who has diamonds ? " Jessie asked . " Let it pass , " I said . " Your love nest is , let us say , different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " I heard a gurgle , a gush , a door slammed . The bridegroom entered , buttoning his fly . " Oops ! Did n't know we had company . Hey , the wedding guest ! " He came , unsteadily , to shake my hand . I smelled wine on his breath . He plopped on a day bed , fumbling with his buttons . " What brings you ? " " John Barrymore and The Emperor Jones , " I said . " And curi-osity . " " How 're my parents ? " Jessie asked . " Do n't you hear from them ? " " Not even a shonatava . My fault , I presume . Everything is . Make like a reporter , Sam . " " I saw them in shul Yom Kippur , fasting , looking hale and hearty . " Horace made a strangled sound , a chortle or a hiccup . " My pious father-in-law , " he said . " What else is new ? " Jessie asked . " We 're about to get a Y , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said. 49 " We had a C.A. We get H.A. , Hebrew Association . Hymie Rogoff got the inspiration from a Jewish chaplain in the war . Mrs. Hartman  --  the Mrs. Hartman  --  heads the Board . I interviewed her . It 's been her lifelong ambition , she wanted me to know , to help the poor Jewish children from the Hill . " " Fascinating , " Jessie said . " I heard how she tried to help this poor Jewish child . " Horace scowled at her . " Enough of Folk You Know , " she said . " How about some vino ? Our Italian neighbors manufacture it . Safe for babes and nursing mothers . " She started toward the rear . I followed , being curious about the domestic arrangements of la vie bohenne . A big room with peeling paint , bare floor , barred windows and conspicuous pipes and heating ducts abutted on a yard that had an ailanthus tree . In a bricked recess where a coal stove had been was a rickety , greasy gas range . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dirty dishes , and a battered kitchen table , supporting a fairly new Underwood typewriter . The place had the frowsiness of poverty plus indifference to housekeeping . " The going 's not so good , " I said . " On the contrary . We 're not precisely plutocrats but we both have jobs . " Horace , Jessie went on to tell me , was working for the Provincetown Playhouse on Macl ) ougal Street , designing sets , though since the theater was not commercial his pay was sporadic and picayune . " He 's making a name ; he 'll be famous , just you wait and see . " She herself was doing piecework , reading for the eastern office of a Hollywood motion picture company . " Such garbage ! I could do better with both hands tied behind my back . " " Why do n't you ? " I asked . " I will . I 've started a play . " " Good luck ! " " You can count on it , " she said . " Get any help from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , " she said . " And at the risk of sounding repetitious , may I add we 're doing fine . " We watched a large cockroach scoot out into the sink  --  I with horror , Jessie with indifference  --  when she took a Mason jar of red ink from the drainboard . She lifted three cloudy glasses from a50dusty shelf , gave me the glasses while she carried in the jar . Horace had sprawled on the bed , his trousers not adjusted properly . " She been complaining ? " Horace asked . " She 's been bragging , " I said . " She 'd better not complain . Her papa laid down the rules . " Silent and unsmiling , Jessie poured the wine . Horace sat up to wave his glass toward both of us . " The home-town kids ! The blessed hicks ! " " Proud of it , " Jessie said . " That 's my girl , " I said . " Mine , " Horace said . " Do n't fight over me , for gosh sakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl all right , though never had I contemplated ownership . We drank . The wine was vinegary . Horace flexed his skinny arms above his head . " Got a great story for you , Sam . Saving it , hoping you 'd turn up . What Jessie 's old man told me on that weddingnight . " " Oh , Horace , no ! " By the panic in Jessie 's voice , I gathered the story had n't been saved for me , but told too frequently . " Nah , nah . " Horace wagged a bony finger . " Sam has got to hear it . He 'll appreciate it . Who else do we know knows your old man ? " He set his glass on the floor and arranged himself , pulling his shirt-sleeves down , straightening his trouser belt , getting all of him in order , as if dressing to play a part . " The whole experience was one I could n't have imagined in a million years . Coming into that smoky kitchen with that enormous woman with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so stunned was I by her proportions I missed a lot of detail . All my eye caught was the flypaper swinging from the ceiling over that dough on the table and a pair of tall brass candlesticks on a shelf . But that parlor , that wedding scene , I got every bit . It was like a setting for The Dybbuk , the red canopy , the snickering kid who helped you hold it up , the beards , the rabbi 's wife , with wig , the squalling , squabbling babies underfoot , and the reluctant bride . . . . " " Horace , quit ! " He paid no attention . " Sam , were you aware of the moment51after the mumbo jumbo beneath the velvet tent , when Herman seized the bridegroom 's arm and led him from the cakes and wine into his bedchamber ? Did you wonder what happened there ? " I shook my head . Actually , I had n't given it any thought . Celia 's mourning for her Good Fairy had distracted me .

The disgust on Jessie 's face was so painful I wanted to slap the whippersnapper 's face . Herman 's hand , to us in Grady 's Mills , hadbeen a symbol , too , though of another kind . It was an awesome mark of his integrity . Maybe , maybe , Horace did have some respectbehind his shallow glibness , for his pale , freckled face fleetinglyachieved sobriety . " That impressed me when I thought about it on the train , " he went on to say . " Lots of boys made weird excuses to get out of military service , but as for mutilating your own hand !

Possibly hearing him tell it to strangers had not hurt Jessie as much as hearing it told to me . She was puffing like a chimney , the cigarette smoke across her eyes more concealing than her bridal veil had been . I tried a light jab at Horace . " Your father does n't have an accent , I presume ? " He winked . " Oh , does n't he ! Hoch der Kaiser . " " Surprise , surprise , " Jessie murmured . " I ca n't wait to hear it .

" " I married the wrong Weiss girl , " Horace said . " This one ca n't boil an egg . " It was the first time Celia had been remembered by either one of us . They led me up a dusty staircase on Sixth Avenue , rapped on a door , said " Good evening , Luigi " to an eye at a peephole , and we were admitted to a steamy room , redolent of oregano and garlic , where we feasted on antipasto , minestrone , squab , spaghetti , fruit and cheese and emptied two water pitchers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was firm ; they did n't fight me for the check .

Jessie , wearing a blue smock , horn-rimmed spectacles and a distractedair , opened the door . " Oh , Sam ! Why did n't you tele-phone ?

" And where in the name of Jesus did you get that coat ? " I bristled at the profanity as much as at the insult to my balmacaan . " This coat , " I said , whirling to show it front and back , " was made by my father 's golden hands , out of tweed loomed in Grady 's Mills . By Leeds . " Her forehead crinkled , questioning . " You 've been long away , my child . We have a woolen mill . Set up by the family Leeds . Jacob Leeds , ne Levy , out of Lodz , Poland . Brief sojourn in the British Isles . Levy emerges Leeds , tweed manufacturer . Abe Finkel has a tract for sale , Jake Leeds buys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are employed . " " Gee whillikins ! " She ran the cloth between her inky fingers . " Good goods . But hideous . I would n't wear it to a Polish funeral . " " Son Walter , aged twenty-five , getting bald , " I said , " is marryingSylvia . " " And who is Sylvia ? " " Abe Finkel 's black-eyed Sadie . " She laughed . I laughed . We laughed together , doubling over , could n't stop . " Are n't Jews ridiculous ? " she gasped . " Chameleons . Change their names , their colorations , quick , quick , quick . " " Easy , kid , " I said . " Did Ida and Herman think up Jessie ? " " Hush your mouth . Are you a Gentile spy ? When 's the wed-ding ? " " June . Hiram Grady Hotel ballroom . Philadelphia caterer . " " Pish-pish ! Fancy-shmansy ! If she sends me an invitation I 'll ignore it . I despise the bitch . Celia 's buddy-buddy . At school , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Walter , too , " I said . " Not a chance . Sylvia had the bosom . Her old man had the moola . " " My old man has n't ? Or are they keeping secrets ? " She braced her spine against the passageway wall . " Christ ! There were other guys in town . Rogoff . Katz . And the creep Slomowitz . What are they up to ? " " Hymie 's polishing apples in Papa 's fruit market . Isie 's measur-55ing yard goods in the Bon Ton . Joey 's his father 's right hand in the junkyard and man about town , with a car . " " Well ? " Meaning , Why ca n't Celia grab one of those ? " No class , " I said . " Your sister , be so kind as to remember , is a college girl . " " Pish , " she said . " Who 's she to be choosey ? " " Also , it 's polite to wait until you 're asked . Moreover , your mama still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectacles . " You run like hell , you hear me , Sam ? " The passion made me smile . " Do n't worry , kid , " I said . " I hate Waldorf salad . And how about asking me to take off the coat , come in and sit ? " It occurred to me she had kept the conversation going out here in the hall as a hint to make my visit brief , but having come this far I had no intention of running , and so I hung my coat on a peg and walked ahead of her into the front room . It looked frowsier than before . " No wine , " Jessie said . " How about a so-called beer ? " " Anything , " I said . " And thank you politely . " When she fetched a bottle and two milky tumblers , she was without the smock and cheaters . She had thinned , which was to the good , though her cheeks looked hollow . I pried off the bottle cap and poured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , handing her her glass . " When 's Horace coming home ? " " Never , if my luck holds . Easy come , easy go . " I whistled . " Divorced ? " There was no ring on her hand . She caught my glance ; her eyes rarely missed a trick . " Ten bucks at the pawnshop , " she said . Then , unexpectedly , her naked fingers wove and writhed on her lap , before her head came up , spirited and arrogant . " I told him let his father buy us a divorce . The bastard never gave us a wedding gift ; let him pay for the divorce . But darling Horace will not let inc off the hook . My fatal charm . My intellect and what 's between my thighs . " " Refinement , please . " Like all men discomfited by a woman 's forwardness , I reached for a cigarette . " Do n't be a miser . Give me one , " she said . Holding the match for her , I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on him , Jessie . Why in hell did you marry him ? " Her eyes met mine , as always , candidly . " To get away from home . And  --  this I wo n't tell another soul  --  because I was afraid no one else would ask . Jessie , the too-smart kid who never had a date . Dragged behind the bushes , yes . Who wants that slop ? Ask her for a dance ? Ninny-on-your-tintype , Bub . Class valedictorian . Now , is n't that just great ! My luck it was wartime ; let 's cut out the senior prom . No humiliation over the no bid . " She dropped silent , puffing furiously , before , " Sam , all of life is either/or , and what was my alternative ? Finish Emerson , go back to Grady 's Mills , find an elocution teaching job in some one-horse town . And "  --  her mouth corners curled  --  " compete with Celia for Joey Slomo-witz . " " How 'd you get so smart so young ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  a trace of coyness  --  " there was you . But I never took that prospect seriously . Older brother . Bachelor uncle . It 's practically incestuous . " " Have another cigarette , " I said . " Your fingers are burning . " " And your face , " she said . " Yes , thank you , sir , I will have another cigarette ; I happen to have just run out . " She lit it from the stub . " You wo n't believe this , " she went on . " Actually , I felt flatteredwhen Horace announced he 'd like to marry me . Said he , too , could n't live with his goddammed family , those Fifth Avenue Philistines . So there we were , orphans of the storm , waifs , rejects , and of a single mind , we thought . " She shook ash from the cigarettewith excessive vehemence . " You live and learn . " " Cliche , " I said . " Solid truth , " she said . " And New York is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth her weight in groceries . " She paused , eyeing me , wondering whether I 'd grasped what she was saying . I thought I had . I decided on no comment . " Sam , truly , I 'm delighted you barged in . I was sitting , typing , famished , wondering where my dinner would come from . " I was readying an apology , since I had a date with Mabel Armbruster , the nurse I 'd met in France , and on the phone Mabel had mentioned what a grand meal they served you for a dollar at Lorber 's on Broadway : the olives were so crisp and fat , they alone57Were worth the price , and it was just across the street from the Metropolitan Opera , a hint that gave me the wild idea that maybe my News-Record credentials could get us in on passes . Mabel said that would be absolutely heavenly ; she adored singing . However , something about Jessie made me hesitate . The girl did look hungry . " It 'll be my pleasure , " I replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better place than Luigi 's . They have Scotch . " " I 'll have to use your phone , " I said . She caught on . " Postpone , do n't call off your date . " Then sighed , a long , deep sigh . " Restful . No gymnastics on the day bed after . Exercise , you know damn well , is dangerous on full stom-achs . " We did n't talk much during dinner , she being occupied with gobbling and I with the upsetting thought that it was a shame that Herman Weiss 's daughter had to hustle for her grub . As we left the speakeasy , I pressed a folded bill into her hand . " What 's that for ? " " Groceries , " I said . By the street lamp 's foamy light , I could see her jawline hardening . She raised her arm as if to fling the bill away . I caught her fist and held it closed . " Idiot ! Go on , be dramatic ! Throw it in the gutter . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , to hunt for it . I ca n't afford to throw away ten bucks . Sure as hell , you ca n't . So behave , be sensible . Say thank you , Sammy-buddy-pal , when I have I 'll pay you hack . " She handbag and dropped the money in . No " thankyou , Sammy-buddy-pal . " While we walked to the basement flat , I talked to her Dutch Uncle . " Get a job , any kind of job : salesgirl , washing dishes , typing , minding kids . Quit writing plays till you have a knippel saved . " " How you run on , honey chile , " she jeered . " And listen to me , stupid . " I pushed her chin up with my thumb . " When you 're short , do n't be proud . Or promiscuous . Prostitution is against the law . Cops haul you in for it . And if you do it for a dinner , just , the whore 's union will get after you . Five bucks is58the going rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear ? Or call me up collect  --  " She muttered , " You should live so long . " "  --  and I 'll send enough to keep you fed . " I got the sentence finished . " Good night , Mr. Rosenbaum , " she said . " Preserve that coat . It 's a museum piece . " Well , maybe she would turn out to be a playwright . She was a whiz at dialogue . She did n't write or phone collect , and I told myself , Hell with the slut , if that 's how she wants it , that 's how she can have it , with my compliments . You make your bed , you lie in it , with the SeventhRegiment . I came to New York again , went to Lorber 's and to shows with Mabel , who was blonde and cuddlesome though on the dullish side . I did n't ring Jessie 's doorbell or call her on the phone , and a year went by before I wrote a certain " Folk You Know " : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Broadway 's newest hit , The Awakening ' by Jessica White , were Mr. and Mrs. Herman Weiss , parents of the playwright , and her sister , Miss Celia Weiss . The metropolitan critics were unanimous in their praise of the opus by this local girl and have predicted a long run for it . " Our paper ran it with a single-column halftone of the valedictorian 's photograph . Herman 's Grocery was closed while the kinfolk were in New York . I stopped by to ask Ida how she had enjoyed the play . " What can I tell you , Sammy ? Mr. Weiss and me , most of it we did n't understand . A poor Jewish family , living in a poor New York neighborhood . What do we know from such a life ? We are country people , living in the mountains with fresh air . And such a family ! Everybody mean to everybody , not a real Jewish family , loving one anudder , sacrificing . . . . " " I know what you mean , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happened with them , Sammy ? Maybe she told you ? No ? So I 'll tell you what I think . Those kind of people , theater people , do n't understand from family life . I read in the Yiddish paper cases just like this . " " What did the Yiddish paper say about the play ? " 59She shrugged . " They licked the fingers , I ca n't understand . So maybe she 'll make a lots of money . So maybe she 'll buy herself a decent dress . Like a slob she looked , the hair not even combed . Celia was so neat , so up to date . We went after in a kosher restaurantto have a glass tea and cake . A fine young man in the place , he could n't take his eyes off her . " " Bye-bye , " I said . " I have to run to work . " Celia Weiss 's spinsterhood had become my cross . More than one of our mutual acquaintances had pointed out , at Ida 's prompting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two years of college , I 'd had two . We were educated , Americanized Litvaks , our families were friends , and mine as anxious as Celia 's to see me wed . I being an only son on whom my father counted to perpetuate the unique name of Rosenbaum . My mother fretted I 'd be snared by a shiksa . She suspected , though she was n't sure since 1 elected not to tell , a Mabel Armbruster in my life . Sylvia Leeds , nee Sadie Finkel , arranged intimate little evenings in her elaborately furnished house two doors from her mother 's up on Eighth Street , where she tried out recipes from the Settlement Cook Book , with Celia functioning as critic , Walter and me as tasters . The purpose of the supper parties was so obvious I begged my mother to start a whispering campaign that overseas I had contracted an unmentionable , incurable disease . She declined to cooperate . " So what is so terrible with Celia ? " she asked and chortled wickedly . " A diamond with golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's old address in the Village . Western Union notified me they could not deliver it . 1 readdressed it to the theater . After a fortnight , a typed penny postcard came . " Thanks for the congrats . Well deserved .

" The show had been running a good half year before I scooped up **27;10184;TOOLONG at the box office and on the phone arranged to meet the playwright after the performance . Mabel assured me she loved the play , lying gamely since she 'd used Act Three for catching up on sleep . I liked the play moderately . It had vitality , dramatic drive and crackling dialogue . Not Shakespeare , nor Eugene O'Neill , remotely ; even several steps60down from Elmer Rice . ( By what right was I a critic ? Every right . I came in on a pass , did n't I ? ) The Awakening was clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its sibling rivals boys , sons of immigrants : the younger a sensitive adolescent , shrinking from dogmatic parents , humiliated by their crudities , escaping through poetry into a fantasy world ; the older complacent , conforming , preferred , and raising hell with the poet 's sensibilities . The elders were grotesque , to my mind unfairly so . The basic theme  --  the clash between the generations  --  and the proletarianrealism of the background was in the geist of the period . The acting was adequate . The cast took five curtain calls . Jessie was waiting at the head of the aisle , wearing a ruby velvet suit , her bobbed hair shining , kempt . " Well ? " She held out her hand . " Beyond my hopes and expectations . Mabel Armbruster , Jessica White . " " Miss White ! I am so thrilled to meet the author . " Mabel 's soprano quavered . " I was so moved by your lovely play , I almost cried . It was so true , so  --  so . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come home and have a cup of coffee . " " I 'd be thrilled , just thrilled . You 're sure it is n't too much trouble ! " " Let 's hop a cab , " Jessie said . She had moved ; that was why my telegram had n't been delivered . She was living , as befitted a successful playwright , in a brownstone in the East Forties . The parlor ceiling was lofty , the parquet floor dotted with Oriental rugs . There was a white marble fireplace whose polished tools were bright as Ida 's candlesticks , tasteful furniture and shelves of books . Jessie pressed two fingers to her lips , pointing to closed white folding doors . " Quiet . Horace may be sleeping . " My eyebrows twitched . " He 's back ? " I glanced at her hand . Still no wedding ring . " Fetched him from the hospital , " she said . Mabel said , " I 'm a nurse . Can I do anything ? " " Nothing . His mother 's with him , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mentioned coffee . In a public place it61does n't pay to advertise , but there 's Scotch and wine on the premises . " Mabel said she 'd settle for the coffee . To impress her with my character , I said I did n't wish to flout the prohibition law . " But do you know how to make coffee ? " I asked the playwright . " Show me how , " she said . Mabel decided to be tactful . " I 'm sure Sam will be all the help you 'll need . Let me relax in this charming room . " The Underwood stood on a porcelain-topped table in a spicand-spankitchen . Jessie caught my querying glance . " I 've always written in a kitchen . Has success changed Jessie Weiss ? Not so you could notice it . " " Horace ? " I replied . " You patched it up ? " " Think I 'm nuts ? He flopped on a sidewalk , drunk , and split his skull . Wonder  --  yes , a pity  --  that he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am no hypocrite . They carted him to Bellevue . Only name and address on his person was yours truly . A cop rang my bell . And what was I to say ? Do n't know the bum , do n't want him , go away , do n't bother me ? So off I went to Bellevue . And there he lay , the poor slob , coming back from hell and yonder , clutching both my hands . Jessie , you are all I 've got . ' Which is crap . Mother , father , uncles , aunts , cousins whom he reckons by the dozens  --  " Tears glazed her eyes , canceling out the flippancy . " Yes , I brought him here . Yes , I telephoned his parents . They had a right to know and a goddamned duty to look after him . And in that stinking ward they met the screwball from the sticks who 'd stolen their dear darling . And , Sam , what happened ? Come on , guess ! They bowed down low . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , I 'm going to vomit . " " Not on the clean linoleum , " I said . " And watch out for the dress . " She did n't vomit . The gorge dropped faster than it had risen . " Tell me , smart guy , tell me , what else was 1 to do ? He 's a human being . I 'm a human being , and legally I 'm still his wife ; I had to bring him home , did n't I ? Damned good thing there were twin beds . Someone has to be right there , on call , at night , when he needs the pan . . . . Oh , dear mother helps . She does the seven P.M.62to midnight shift and two matinees . And a maid comes in every day . I trust you noticed that this kitchen is immaculate . " She took a jar of coffee from a cupboard , set it on the range preliminary to coffee-making , though not yet ready to put the percolator on . " It was nauseating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kid from the Hill becomes a queen . " She leaned against the kitchen wall , simmering down . " Shtunks , " she muttered . " All the world 's a shtunk . All but thee and me . And sometimes I think . . . . " She paused , looking mischievous . " I dare , I double-dare , " I said . " You are my rock , my fundament . " Her tone was sassy , mocking . " My true and honorable knight , Sir Shmulke Galahad .... " " Continue , " I said . " And in the lonely hours between two and four A.M. , I think of you with awe and disbelief . . . . " She broke off . " Excuse , pliz . Make the coffee ; I have to get something . " She whisked from the kitchen . I measured coffee and water into the percolator , lit the gas . She returned to press a bit of paper into my hand . " Do n't do this to me again , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Any time . " " There will not be an any time . " She sat down before the typewriterand beat a tattoo on its keys . " Never poor no more . Jessie 's done her tour of duty with the proletariat . She knows the stink of poverty . She will have none of it . " She bit her lower lip , waiting , then looked up at me with a kind of somber anger . " Sam , for once and all , let 's quit kidding ; I have something important to say to you . " Her eyes met mine , implacable and slightly menacing . " Nothing , nothing in all this world , is more despicable , more degrading , than a small handout to a friend in need . Particularly when a lecture comes along with it . " She sucked her breath in sharply , the way she used to as a kid when she was readying to explode . " Those shtunks who bought me dinner and took it out in trade were better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And may I add , in modesty  --  which is n't quite the word  --  they got value received . But you , Sir Shmulke Galahad , you offered only charity . And charity , in my book , is an extremely dirty word . It degrades him who receives and also him who gives . Because , in his heart , he knows he is a lousy hypocrite . He 's giving money , only money , 63to grab something for himself . The feeling-good , the feeling-big . You 're a nothing . I 'm a king . Giving money is a greed , my friend , not a generosity . Now "  --  briefly , a pause for breath  --  " if you had said , Tough going , kid , but I have faith in you .

Ten lousy dollars gave you the boon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ears , unaware that in this kitchen where the percolator burped I was receiving wisdom . Of all the words Herman 's daughter Jessie , a high , wide and handsome talker , was to say to me through all our years , none would be more pertinent to my own existence , none closer to the bull 's eye of truth . However , now I could n't let her get away with it . I needed to hit back . All I could think of was , " How 'd you get so smart so young ? " She sneered , " Buy a new line . May I recommend the Bayonne Cliche Company , " and banged the typewriter keys with her open palm . We stayed silent , seething , both of us , while she untangled the keys . Then , she rose and smiled  --  " Forgive me , Sam . I had to get that off my chest . It 's been heavy there "  --  and wound her arms around my neck , cooing into my ear , " I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slapped my face , not hard enough to tingle , just hard enough to let me know exactly where I stood , after which she went to a clipboard and took cups and saucers from a shelf , talking while she did . " All that is academic , now . Fini . I am going to he rich . You watch , Sam , look out for my dust . " I found my voice . " With Horace hanging on ? " " No siree-bob . The very second he is on his feet , out the poor slob goes . Out . Out . Out . And I give up this place . It 's a sublet ; nothing here is mine except the Underwood . Then off I go to Paris , to sit on Montparnasse , to write . And to get me a divorce . . . . That coffee smells done . " She lined up four willowpatternedcups and saucers on a lacquered tray .

" She let me carry in the tray , marching grandly , head up , in front of me . A petite , nervous-seeming woman with corrugated iron-gray hair was chatting with Mabel in the living room . " Jessica , darling ! " The woman rose , politely deferential . " He 's really better . Why , tonight he asked me to play the radio . " " This is Sam Rosenbaum from Grady 's Mills , " Jessie answered her . " A Yid from up the Hill . He was at our wedding . Far and away , the best man . " Mrs. Simon gulped , said " Oh ! " and flushed and twittered . " Would n't you like to go in , say hello ? " I glanced at Jessie , not trusting to my judgment , murmuring , " It 's late . " " It 's later than you think , " she said . After the oratory in the kitchen , I could take a petty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran low on original dialogue , she shopped at the Bayonne Cliche Company , too. 65ThreeSteve Durgin , a cop I 'd met in the practice of my trade , dropped into the newsroom one afternoon in the fall of 1926 . He tapped me on the arm . " Talk to you , Bub . " I took a quick look around . Mallory , the city editor , was away from his desk , probably in the stereo room knocking off a pennyantegame between press runs . My colleagues were lolling at their desks , ostentatiously pretending not to be inquisitive . " Here or privately ? " I asked . " Private , " Durgin said . I led him to the toilet , where I latched the door . Let any bastard in a hurry bang , not barge in on us . " You live up the Hill ? " Durgin began . " You know all them folks ? " " Man , woman , child . " " A family named . . . Shlumpowitch ? " " Slomowitz ? Max ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not Max . Joe , Joe Shlumpowitch . " " The son , " I said . " He been stealing brass ? " " Not stealing , " Durgin said . Mine not to probe , his to enlighten . I waited . He obliged . " This morning Ed McCarthy come in the station house . You know Ed ? Works in Babcock 's Mill . Handyman . Boozer . Hauled him in a couple a Sattidy nights ago . Disturbin ' the peace . Beatin ' his old woman . . . . Nah , you did n't read it on the blotter . Did n't book ' im . What 's the point in it ? Let him sleep it off in a cell . Turned him out to early Mass . So he figures I 'm his friend . Well , today Ed comes in with Dolores , his kid .

That what you Hebes call a prick ? " I did n't smile . " An auto . Reo make . Since the old man made apile , Joey 's been joyriding . All the mill girls in the county . . . . " Durgin 's jaw jutted . " Sex maniac . Maybe we better run him in . You know how us Irish feel about the chastity . " I 'd heard the line . I also knew the ethnic backgrounds of bastardyin our county ; hence , all I said was , " Joe 's folks are decent people , good citizens . Remember the Liberty Bonds the old man bought ? The Mayor gave him a certificate . You would n't want to shame them , would you ? " " That 's why I come to talk to you , " he said . I rattled coins in my pants pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eppes , the old Jewish instinct , fifty per cent reliable , prompted me . " How much ? " I asked . His glance pretended to rebuke me ; how could one equate virtuewith cash ? " Ed trusts me , " he said . " There 's the expenses  --  " He dropped his mask . " Sam , what 's it worth to get them off the hook ? " I shrugged . " Have n't any notion what the traffic 's going to bear . " " They got dough . All you Hebes .... " " Take it easy , Steve . In my family , five bucks is big dough . " " Exceptin ' present company , " he conceded . " And my apologies . " He stepped up to the urinal , opened his fly , not to waste an opportunity . " Sam , I come to you knowing you 're acquainted with the other party , " he continued over the hiss of his stream . " I come to ask you talk to them , tell them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed and he 'll settle how I say . Just me asking where Dolores got the shiner . A peach . That Ed 's wild when he 's boozin ' .

" The gleam in his eyes , no words required , told me he 'd be in on the take . " You talk to old Shlumpowitch , then you call me on the67telephone first thing tomorrer mornin ' . You say somethin ' like , Durgin , I just seen the organ grinder 's monkey walkin ' up the street . ' I ask you Where ? ' You gim me the time , the address where we meet . " The knob was rattled . There was peremptory pounding on the door . I raised the latch . Mallory strode in . He is an old soldier  --  Spanish-American War . He exudes military discipline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said to Durgin . " The News-Record is not inhospitable , though I have not heard your station house is lacking these facilities . Get the hell out , both of you . " We slunk . He 'd be asking questions . My answers needed to be good . Mallory despised corruption . It was his business to . Slomowitz went ashen when I told him . He snarled , " The bummer ! The outcast ! " He moaned . " My wife is a sick woman . She will take convulsions . " He pounded his desk . " The girl is a nogood , a tramp . What can she prove ? I betcha she 's been laying around with every shikker in the Flats . She finds out Joey 's family has a couple dollars , so it 's a blackmail , a holdup .

" Max rocked his head between his palms . " All my life I slaved , I struggled , I worked like a dog . So I made a couple dollars . Now that bummer , Joey .... " " Get him out of town , " I said . " And married fast . To a nice Jewish girl . " Then , a brainwave struck me . I was dazzled by a vision of freedom from pursuit and 1 was mean enough to seize the opportunity . " I know just the girl : Herman Weiss 's daughter , Celia . She could make a man of Joe . " Next morning I phoned the station house and told Durgin the organ grinder 's pet could be nabbed at eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You be there , too , " he said . " I do n't trust those monkeys . " 68Tough luck . Being witness made me an accessory to blackmail , which , in our statute books , is criminal . I went to the junkyard early , to make sure Max was calm , prepared to negotiate , without shouting , threats or blows . The night was nippy . A pumpkin-colored moon was rising , gildingthe rusting iron pipes and corroded copper boilers out of which Max Slomowitz was coining gold . The shanty 's shades were drawn . Threads of light showed around the edges and between the cracks . The door was unlocked . Max sat hunched above a ledger at his roll-top desk , small and shrunken , old and weary-looking in the wan light of the hanging oil lamp . Above the desk , in a gilt frame , was the Liberty Bond testimonial . A fire was going in a potbellied stove , salvaged from somewhere . There was a ragged wicker rocker , a kitchen chair with busted seat  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , torn linoleum on the floor . Max closed the ledger , carried it to a mouldy safe , put it carefullyaway and twirled the knob . I took the rocking chair . He went back to his desk swivel . " Nu ? " He shrugged his hands . " Where 's the other party ? " " Where 's Joe ? " " We are opening an office in New York , " he said . Max was smarter than I 'd realized . He 'd removed the culprit . " Sammy , how much do they want ? " " Do n't offer . See what 's on their minds . " I 'd been wondering , too , having had no previous experience in this area . " A man like Ed McCarthy , " I ventured , " might think a couple hundred is a fortune . The cop is the one to keep in mind . He 'll take from McCarthy . But also he 'll expect from you . So you will put one hundred dollars in a plain envelope and I will deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School of Journalism in New York . Eppes had dictated Durgin 's price . Max looked shocked . Apparently , his business operations had been honest ; he 'd had no experience bribing cops . Any bootlegger in our county could have put him wise . Before he had a chance to voice his shock , we heard the adversary 's footsteps . I got up . Max , watching me , did likewise , backing against his desk . Ed McCarthy , a hulk , entered first , shouldering the open door69as if he meant to shatter it , after him a wisp of girl , shivering in a sleazy coat , bunched across the middle where it emphasized a bulge , and , trailing them , Steve Durgin , in mufti . Max threw a furtiveglance toward the girl . " Mr. Slomowitz , meet Mr. Durgin , " I said . Durgin grunted . Max nodded . No hand was extended . I did n't present McCarthy and Dolores . They were strangers to me , too . " Give the girl a chair . She 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the rocker . Dolores sank into it and fixed her attention on the cracked linoleum . Her father took his stance beside the chair , towering over it . Sniffing belligerently , he inspected the shanty . His roving gaze halted at the iron safe . Durgin straddled the kitchen chair . I leaned against the door , in neutral ground , between belligerents . Max sat on his swivel , the castors rasping as he wheeled to face the cop , his eyes avoiding McCarthy and Dolores . We stayed silent , looking grim and hostile , all of us except Dolores , who looked pitiful . Her snub nose was blue with cold ; her pallid cheek had a purple bruise beneath the right eye . Her dull blonde hair was frizzed unbecomingly ; coarse cotton stockings drooped on her pipcstem legs . Perhaps she had had sweetness , charm . In the shanty in the junkyard all I saw was misery , shame and advanced pregnancy . Durgin commenced . " You sec the girl 's condition , Shlumpo-witch ? " Dolores caressed her middle , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who is responsible ? " Durgin asked . Max found his voice . " I do n't believe . " " Tell him . " McCarthy 's hani hand crushed his daughter 's shoulder . " Joe forced me , " the girl faltered , not looking up . " Did he promise to many you ? " Durgin asked . Her mouth opened to speak but it was her father 's voice we heard , loud and harsh and venomous . " We would n't have the sheeny for a gift . " Crimson flooded Max 's face . His fingers closed and opened spasmodically . Hitherto , I 'd never thought of Max as prototype , yet thus I saw him now . With hooked nose and black70pointed beard , he was the cringing Jew of every libelous caricature . Now , both men were fathers whose offspring had sinned , and fornication is impossible except by two , yet only Joey 's father trembled , as if his child , and his alone , was guilty , and Joey 's father , only he , merited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another thing , the inherited hostilities , profound and permanent : in one , hatred of a people blamed for Calvary , in the other , tribal memories of the Inquisition and pogroms . " Seventeen , " Durgin said ominously . Dolores raised her head , again to speak . Her father pushed it down . " Rape , " McCarthy said . " Ten years , " Durgin said . " Him "  --  he jerked thumb toward me  --  " he begged me hold off the warrant , not disgrace the Jewish people here . " McCarthy pursed his mouth . His spittle sizzled on the hot stove lid . I cleared my throat . " I assured Mr. Durgin you 'd do the right thing , " I told Max , " because you were an honorable man . " My hand wave , my head nod , directed their attention toward the framed certificate above the desk . No one looked at it . " How much ? " McCarthy growled . The dickering began and it was brief . My prejudgment had been accurate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement price , three hundred dollars cash , taken from Max 's iron safe , counted out upon his desk . McCarthy stuffed the wad of paper into a jacket pocket . Durgin winked at me . The unborn babe fared better . For it , by oral agreement witnessed by Durgin and myself , ten dollars would be mailed to Dolores McCarthy every month until the child reached the working-papers age of sixteen . " Thank you very much , " Dolores said . " I wish you luck , " Max mumbled through his beard and gritted teeth . The girl raised her arm as if to offer him her hand . Her father yanked her from the chair and , fist prodding her spine , pushed her toward the door . It occurred to me he might have been gentler , since her delinquency was paying off. 71 " You would n't have a shnapps , a bottle of wine , around ? " Durginasked . Max did not reply . I saw them to the door . " Four o'clock in the men 's room , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He seemed extremely pleased with how the meeting had gone , only one insult and a minimum of dickering . Max handed me an envelope with ten ten-dollar bills . He locked the safe and shanty . We walked together up the Hill . The harvest moon was full overhead , the temperature dropping . We were chilled and not feeling talkative . At my corner , leaving him , I said , " Stop worrying , there wo n't be more trouble . " " God willing , " he told his beard . " The girl 's not mean , " I said . " Her old man put her up to it . " " The bastard ! " He caught the double edge of the word . " It 's hard to be a father in America . " He sighed . " Too much money , no respect . " " Get Joe married , " I said . " That 'll settle him . " Mallory gave me a hard time . Why in hell was that cop hanging around with me in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if we were conniving on some crooked deal , he 'd run both of us out of town . " Durgin 's having trouble with his wife , " I said . " Wants a shoulder to cry on . " " And what advice could you give him ? Send him to his priest . " I never told Mallory or anyone else about the transaction in Slomowitz 's shack . As far as I know , neither Durgin nor Max Slomowitz , each for obvious reasons , ever mentioned it , Max not even to his wife . It was one secret sedulously kept from the gossips on the Hill . Maybe Ed McCarthy , flashing greenbacks in speakeasiesin the Flats , blabbed a bit- about squeezing an old Jew , though I doubt he went further than the obscene cursing of all Jews which was standard practice in his set . And Dolores was n't a troublemaker , close-mouthed even in childbirth . She died after a delivery which was prolonged and agonizing , she being narrow-hipped , rachitic , malnourished . Caesarian section might have saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest rather than an obstetrician . She did have a glimpse of her blackhairedboy and managed to whisper " Jody , " an acronym of Joe72and D that became his name . She made a good Contrition , Durgin came to tell me , though what she told the priest remained between him and her and God . The News-Record listed her in its obituary column , stating cause of death as " complications , " which was true enough and customary , since the local undertakers , who notified the paper whenever they were summoned to a corpse , ascribed to " complications " most deaths without visible abrasions or shattered bones . Some of Max 's down payment provided a silk-lined casket and a Mass , and Dolores 's mother undertook to raise the child . Max mailed the ten a month conscientiously to Ed McCarthy , though I began to hear mutterings in saloons in the Flats about rotten , stingy Jews . Grady 's Mills never had had overt anti-Semitism . However , in the months after Dolores 's death , a miasma was perceptible . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safe moved to the middle of the room , though not broken open . Max complained to the police . Steve Durgin was assigned to investigate . He did a Sherlock Holmes imitation , pretended to look for fingerandfootprints , and assured Max it was just a bunch of kids , showingoff they were strong , they could shove around a heavy safe , nothing pinched , no harm done . To me , Steve said he had given Ed McCarthy what for ; another stunt like that , he 'd lock him up for breaking and entering . Ed must have been cockeyed to try it . Now and then , when a fire or an arrest took me to the Flats , I 'd catch a glimpse of the grandson of Ed McCarthy and Max Slomowitz , a pretty child , black-haired like his father , blue-eyed like his mother  --  Irish and Jewish genes combine agreeably  --  but usually filthy dirty and with a running nose , sitting by himself on the doorstep of his grandparents ' shanty , playing with a stick or empty can , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grady 's Mills , the factories shut down and McCarthy was out of work . With time on his hands , he drank rotgut and beat his wife . One night she fell  --  or was pushed  --  down the steps within the house . Her neck was broken . There was a loose board , the police found ; it could have been an accident . The next-door neighbors had heard only Jody screaming . Before the wake , McCarthy vanished . Since there was no money in the house , the county buried Jody 's grandmother . Neighbors looked73after the boy for a week , then dispatched him to St. Michael 's orphanage . I doubt St. Michael 's was informed that little Jody might bring them ten dollars every month to pay for his porridge . Two of those who knew were dead , one a fugitive from justice . And my surmise is that Max , informed of the accident and its aftermath , decided to let discretion take the place of generosity , for by that time Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Sloan were personages of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for promotion . If the Fathers at St. Michael 's , tipped off , had chosen to investigate , the revelation of the facts behind the financing might have proved embarrassing to Steve as well as to the Sloans . Joe had changed his name informally to Sloan before Jody was born to Dolores and , legally , before Ilene was born to him and his wife , Celia . Max Slomowitz had acted on my second suggestion with alacrity , just as he 'd responded to the first . Since tell-a-woman was how news spread on the Hill , most people knew the details of the courting of Celia Weiss . The marriage was arranged , old-country style , with the groom invisible and the bride uninformed during the preliminaries . The rabbi called on Herman and Ida to sound them out . Herman remained silent while the rabbi hemmed and hawed , trying to praise Joey Slomowitz , but Ida , hard put to suppress her glee , cried , " So let the parents come and talk . Who needs shadchens on the Hill ? " Max and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ida , at night , after the grocery was closed . Celia , who 'd been given hints of what was in the wind , had tactfully taken herself off to Sylvia 's . The Slomowitzes were offered tea , homemade cherry preserves and sponge cake , after which the men sat , milking beards , while Ida delivered an oration about her family tree . Did they know  --  she was never one to boast -- that she was blood cousin to the celebrated Vilna Gaon , of blessed memory ? Yiches of the highest order . Whoever climbed a branch of that tree became attached to nobility . Joe 's father kept his head down , aware that Joe , that bummer , that outcast , was damaged goods , snatched by timely , secret intervention from ten years in the penitentiary . Herman , being of two minds about the shidduch , said nothing . Ida , basking in her yiches and sensing , though she did n't know74the specifics , that there was urgency behind this matchmaking , took an upper hand and drove a hard bargain : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch for Celia ; the Slomowitz family was to pay half the wedding costs , buy a set of Rogers ' silverware , and furnish the couple 's home with up-to-date furniture , no junk ( a slur at Max 's occupation ) , everything as high class as Sylvia Leeds 's . " And what do you give ? " Lena Slomowitz , also not knowing the specifics , demanded . Ida 's two chins rose . " A college girl , a teacher , a balaboosta , first class . " " Tachles , " cried Mrs. Slomowitz , meaning , Come down to earth . " You should ask ? A girl , a diamond , with golden hands . Come , I show you , napkins , tablecloths , hemstitch , embroidered , cutwork , drawn work . Like for a queen . Everything the best . " Max made his own requests and rationalized them adroitly . The marriage must take place right away ; Joe is lonesome in New York , no home , he has to eat in restaurants , and busy , busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head that boy has ; his wife will never need to put her hands in cold water . The nuptials must be celebrated in New York , he added , explaining that his relations and his wife 's , none of whom had ever made a trip to Grady 's Mills , lived in Manhattan , Brooklyn and the Bronx . An only son gets married , the family should be invited , so if everybody had to travel out to Grady 's Mills , where would they sleep ? Moreover , in New York , the best hotels arranged kosher catered affairs and  --  he asked no favors  --  he would personally pay whatever it might cost . The Weisses and whichever local friends they chose to ask could ride to New York on the train at his expense , only not too many , please . Ida , who 'd had visions of a wedding at the Hiram Grady as elegant as the Finkel-Leeds nuptials , capitulated to the glamour of a catered affair in New York . She began to enumerate kinfolk , hers and Herman 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who positively must be asked , and to anticipate the presents they would give . Not cupidity , understand , just exuberance . When Celia was officially informed , she threw herself into the situation with what can best be described as an air of excessive75triumph . What her down-deep emotions were at learning she 'd be yoked to Joe in perpetuity , I would not dare to guess . For sure , he 'd never been this college girl 's ideal . But Aaron Leiberman was dead , Isie Katz as good as engaged ( all but the ring ) to the younger Rogoff girl , Nettie ; Hymic Rogoff indifferent , Sam Rosenbaumrecalcitrant , and only Slomowitz available . A professional marriage broker might , in time , have produced a candidate , provided a sufficient dowry was posted . A groom in hand is worth ten in remote possibility . She had been sought , bribed with regal gifts , and a sumptuous New York wedding suited her just fine . Of her local acquaintances , the only ones she was eager to invite were Sylvia and Walter Leeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted on , and me , no doubt to torture me with envy of the lucky groom . Sensing she had an upper hand , she added two requests : for a honeymoon in Paris , " Where my sister Jessie is , " and that Joe change his name to something more American . Her future fatherin-lawagreed but balanced it with new stipulations of his own : there must be no write-up in the paper until after the wedding , no publicity on the betrothal or the wedding arrangements . When a shadow of disappointment crossed Cclia 's face , Max stammered till he came up with a valid explanation : once the engagement was announced , the entire Hill would expect invitations ; you could spend a fortune transporting everybody to New York , and even if they paid their railroad fares , a catered wedding dinner at so much a couple  --  Celia was a practical young lady , would she not rather have the money for a Paris honeymoon ? After they were hitched Sam could make a nice write-up . That she was Joe 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have guessed , since those who knew were n't of a mind to blab . Yet had she known 1 do n't believe it would have changed her mind , she having no alternative save arid spinsterhood . And to my knowledge , the fact Joe 's parents had done the courting did not trouble her too much . She 'd known Joe all her life . Between them there had never been the remotest prospect of romantic love . It 's hard to explain the male indifference to Celia Weiss . She was not repulsive . Her figure was trim , though her bosom was flat . She could sing and she could dance ; she could bake a cherry pie76and sew a pretty seam . Yet she could n't rouse the beast in men . During Christmas week when her school was closed , she and Ida traveled to New York for a rendezvous with the prospective groom . I ca n't record a rush into each other 's arms , since I was n't there and Ida and Celia were mum about it after they returned , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in platinum , and a platinum wrist watch . The ring and watch had set Max back far more than the virtue of Dolores . Celia rang me on the phone to tell me what I already knew , in intimate detail , that she was engaged to Joe . Was I surprised ? Not entirely , I forced myself to say , and in my opinion Joe was a lucky man . " It is kind of you to say so . You 're such a good sport , Samuel , to take it so nicely . I shall never forget how sweet you 've been to me . And I trust we shall remain good friends . " She asked me not to write the engagement up for " Folk You Know . " Father Slomowitz did n't want the entire Hill clamoring for invitations . " Of course , Samuel , you are an exception . We want you . " She added Joe wished me to be his best man  --  he 'd have written to ask me but he was busy as a beaver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will I need a tux ? " " Certainly . Rent it . Charge it to Father Slomowitz . He 's paying for everything . " Washington 's Birthday was the date . She would be teaching to the end of the semester ; you ca n't resign in the middle of a term , it 's not fair to them . Up to then she 'd be too , too busy , running to New York to select furniture and have fittings ; her bridal gown , her trousseau were being made by a New York modiste . Doubtless , on those weekend trips she also said hello to the exiled lover . My mother was miffed that she 'd not been invited . " So Celia catched a feller . A rnatzeah . Prost . Ida is ashamed , must be , she do n't ask nobody from her friends . She sends the daughter two years in the college , so they make a shidduch with the junkman 's son . From high school , not even he did n't grajiate . " With Slomowitz relations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astor ballroom . Celia was an eyes-swollen bride , though svelte in white satin with a long veil and train . Joe , 77in tails and silk hat , was a nervous groom , who kept glancing over his shoulder , as if expecting to see cops at the ballroom door . Sylvia Leeds , in turquoise velvet , attended the bride . Sylvia 's fouryear-oldCarol Frances and Lena Slomowitz 's five-year-old Bessie , in white organdy , scattered rose petals before Celia 's satin-slipperedtoes . I , in rented tuxedo , walked beside the groom , prepared , on cue , to hand him the diamond-encrusted platinum wedding band . Ida , in gray taffeta , was obese but dignified ; Lena Slomowitz , tiny , bird-beaked , was in navy blue . Both mothers wore mammoth purple orchids on their left shoulders . Neither one wore gold or diamonds , a decision tactfully arrived at , I concluded , to assure parity . Max and Herman looked absurd in rented silk hats and tuxedos . Minnie and Goldie , the older Slomowitz daughters , were sulking because they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male cousins of the bride to support the velvet canopy . A New York rabbi and a cantor with a smooth-as-syrup tenor officiated . Walter Leeds , standing behind me during the long ceremony , snickered into my car , " Nobody has to teach Joe about the birds and bees , heh , heh . " Waiters heaped our plates with chopped liver , stuffed derma , sour pickles , sour tomatoes , olives , celery , salted almonds , chicken noodle soup with mandelen , roast chicken , potatoes , carrots and green peas , and melting water ices . After we were stuffed like the derma , and while the waiters were circulating , offering toothpicks to cadge gratuities , Walter , flushed and tipsy , rose to read the telegrams . Although the wedding date and location had not been published , everyone on the Hill knew when and where . Most of them had spent two bits on ten-word telegrams . Walter struck his water goblet with a fork , noise to beget silence . " I have a very important telegram to read . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow paper in his hand , pretending to read . " Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Slomowitz , Hotel Astor , New York , New York . Health , wealth , happiness and joy . And in a year a baby boy . " A few young girls tittered ; a few older people clapped . Walter harrumphed again and raised his voice dramatically . " This is signed , Calvin Coolidge . From the White House , Washington , D. C. " The applause was wild . Celia covered her face with white-78gloved hands . Slomowitz cousins , below the head table , nudged each other . " You hear ! The President knows Maxie 's boy . " I began to laugh ; it was the funniest thing I 'd heard in years . I laughed until I choked . Walter whacked my spine before he hit his goblet , grinning inanely . " Folks , that 's only the beginning . This important wedding has been taken notice of not only in Washington , D. C. , but also in foreign parts . I hold in my hand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the French language , which is not mamaloschen to you or me , so if I make a mistake , you 'll excuse me , please . Mr. and Mrs. Joe Slomowitz , Astor Hotel , New York . Regards to all , ' " he read . " Meet you at Le Havre . Bum chance . ' It is signed Jessie . " There was a general gasp . Celia flushed purple . I snatched the cable out of Walter 's hand and stumbled to my feet . I was n't going to let Walter 's bibulous wit chalk a black mark against Jessie . " Bon chance , " I half shouted . " Bon ! That means good in French . Good luck . Jessie wishes them good luck . " With all the excited buzzing , the scraping of shoes and chairs , I doubt that anybody heard me . In any case , a cabled insult is far more titivating than conventional good wishes . I sat down and drank morosely . The orchestra struck up a waltz . The groom led his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual , danced gracefully . Little kids slid and chased each other between the dancing couples . Around midnight , the older folks joined hands and stomped in a kasatzke . Weighted down with food and bootleg whisky , I sat watching , wondering where Ida Weiss had found the energy to dance . From joy , I guess . Celia was off her hands . Rice was thrown , the bride and groom departed , both mothers wept . On the train , Sylvia Leeds gave me accurate descriptions of the bridal party 's gowns and suggested Celia would be pleased if I spelled her name Cecilia and changed Joe 's surname to Sloan . Hence , in my write-up of these nuptials , the name of Joseph Sloan first appeared in print . I mention this for the benefit of future historians . The newlyweds were on the rough high seas when Jody McCarthywas born and Dolores died . No one cabled them that news . And they were in Paris when Ida Weiss died suddenly . This cable I sent personally , aware that the girls could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of them might , however , I pipe-dreamed , arrange for a kaddish to be said for Ida in the synagogueon the Rue de la Victoire . On a Friday morning , at nine o'clock , a busy hour in Herman 's Grocery , Ida had a heart attack and , just about as fast as I can write these words , was dead . She had been weighing sugar and regaling a group of customers with an enumeration of the presents Celia had received . In the middle of a sentence , she began to heave and pant and her eyes opened wide as if astonished by what was taking place in her . She managed to gasp " Do n't feel good " before her eyes rolled back to sightless whites . She swayed toward the counter , her breasts striking the scales , spilling sugar , before she crumpled and slid to the floor . The pompadour broke from the bone pins ; the long hair streamed . She lay wedged between the counter and the shelves while the women scattered , frightened hens , cackling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call a doctor ! " Herman , who had been at the ice chest cutting a pound of butter for Mrs. Katz , took one long look at his stricken wife , went gray as ashes and began to shake . Tears sprang to his eyes and rolled down his cheeks , dampening his vest . Someone  --  I 'm not sure who since each bystander claimed the credit  --  took the phone receiver off the hook , cranked the box , and screamed at the operator to send a doctor , quick , to Herman 's Grocery . A doctor came . There was nothing he could do except write out a death certificate . The butter melted on a strip of paper on the dairy scale while congregation members , summoned by the shamas , panting , puffing , carried Ida up the stairs and stretched her on the bedroom floor . Two pour , pious crones who , between ministrations to the infrequent ( lead , sorted for a ragpicker , sponged Ida 's abundant flesh , closed her eyes and swathed her in a linen shroud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orthodox must be consignedto the grave within twenty-four hours after death but never on the Sabbath . And so , at half past three , before Friday 's pale March sun was gone , we were burying Ida Weiss . Herman stumbledafter the pine box , numbed with shock , all but sightless in his grief . We who had been Ida 's friends and neighbors clustered at the80open grave , the men summoned from their businesses , the women from their cooking pots . We tamped the last of winter 's snow to slush and shivered in the knife-sharp wind . We listened , tears unrestrainedand unabashed , while Cantor Leiberman sang the " El Mole Rachamim , " the deeply moving prayer-chant which is no dirge but an affirmation of the wisdom of God . With aching hearts , we marked that Cantor Leiberman looked beyond Ida 's yawning grave toward a snow-covered mound with a granite slab that bore the name and life-span dates of Aaron Leiberman , a small mound , a small stone , for a life too brief to have attained significance . The heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ropes . A few of us stepped forward to drop clods of frozen earth upon the lid , the dust to dust . My mother gripped my arm so tightly that I sensed her fear : Will I be next ? Hold me fast , keep me , do not let me die . Then Herman disengaged himself from arms that supported him , fearing he would fall , and standing alone , straight-spined , commenced his own prayer for the repose of his departed wife . His voice , quavering at first , swelled , resonant and rich . Few of us understood the Hebrew words , yet all of us were awed and touched , feeling that the man communed with worlds far beyond Grady 's Mills . When the prayer was done , he began to speak rapidly and earnestly , in Yiddish , to the box in the ground . " Ida , my dear and faithful wife , if God gives me strength , what you wished , I will do . I give my word before witnesses . " His coat lapel was slashed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trooped back to break bread in the flat above Herman 's Grocery . Mrs. Slomowitz and her eldest daughter , Minnie , had set out the traditional foods , the hard-boiled eggs and bagel which are the symbols of eternal life , the herring , kiichel and sponge cake that generations in the Eastern European ghettos have supped on after burials , and the shnapps and wine with which to sanctify the Sabbath and bless the Lord of Hosts . Lena Slomowitz had lighted candles in Ida 's brass candlesticks and had sheeted all the mirrors . Ten of us males stood together , praying , then washed our hands at the kitchen sink . Mrs. Slomowitz held a pitcher , pouring , and handed us the towels , embroidered by Celia 's golden hands , before81we drew chairs to the round kitchen table . I could n't help remembering  --  myhead was full of memories  --  the other evenings when I 'd sat at this table , with one or both of Herman 's daughters , Ida bustling in and out and Herman a pervasive presence , though invisible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted strangers , true , yet none of his flesh . We spoke about the girls that night , as we would speak of them on subsequent evenings . How soon would they return ? Would either of them , could either of them , remain here with Herman ? Would either of them insist that he leave Grady 's Mills and live with her ? Meanwhile , who would stay behind the counter while he went for prayers ? This was more essential than before , since he had a duty toward his dead , to say the daily kaddish for twelve months . And who  --  this was a problem to be solved immediately  --  would look after Herman during the shiva week ? My mother , bless her , solved the last problem . She proposed , and Herman was too numb or too courteous to object , that she and my father move over to his flat and sleep in the girls ' double bed , she to cook his food , receive his visitors , and provide unobtrusivecompanionship while he sat , shoeless , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much as I hesitate to questionthe motives of a parent , my mother 's , I suspect , were not entirely altruistic . In that week she visibly enjoyed herself , not only with the sense of being important and considered noble but with the pleasure of rummaging through Ida 's bureau drawers , examining the wedding finery , folding the gray taffeta dress into tissue paper , washing , ironing , stacking Ida 's nightgowns , petticoats , bloomers , corset covers , aprons , and calculating which poor woman on the Hill could make use of what . The store stayed closed all week . A few housewives were unhappybecause they had to shop in the trefc market . Then , after the shiva , Herman unlocked his store , carried in the cake of ice , dumped the coins into their grooves , and waited on the customers . The second son of the shamas , a quiet , honest lad , too young to get working papers but in desperate need of pocket money , relieved Herman when he went to shul for mincha and maariv . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flat and wash and iron Herman 's shirts . Neighbors took turns bringing him cooked food. 82Looking after a mourning widower is a mitzvah . A celestial bookkeeperadds up mitzvahs . The score determines the disposition of your case when Judgment Day arrives . So I have been told . We wondered when the girls would come . Mrs. Slomowitz let it be known she had heard from Celia , who was so overwhelmed with grief she lacked the strength to cross the stormy seas . As soon as she was able , she would fly on wings . No one heard from Jessie . Crab grass had sprouted on Ida 's grave before the girls returned . While I was walking home from work , I saw the depot taxicab pull up before Herman 's Grocery and Miss Jessica White and Mrs. Joseph Sloan emerge from it . Jessie saw me , Jessie waved , a casual , come-hither gesture as if she 'd seen me only yesterday . Celia did n't notice , being busy paying off the cab . I crossed the road while the driver was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny-on-the-spot ! " Jessie pinched my arm and gave me a smile , broad and friendly , quite as if she 'd never slapped my face . Celia extended a black-kid-gloved hand . " How do you do , Samuel . " I caught a strong whiff of French perfume . " We expected to be met at the station , " Celia said . I stooped for the valises . " I 'll carry them upstairs . " " We 'll stop in the store and see Papa first , " Jessie said . " He wo n't be there , " I said . " Shul . Maariv . Kaddish . " " Mama 's kaddish . " Celia 's eyes began to fill . " My poor , darling mama . " She whipped out a fresh black-bordered handkerchief and shook it open to receive her tears . " Let 's get the hell upstairs , " Jessie said . " Weeping in the street is vulgar . " Celia dabbed her eyes and managed a wintry smile . " Samuel , will you be an angel and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be staying there . Tell her I 've arrived . Joseph was supposedto telegraph we 'd be on the five o'clock . " I trailed them up the staircase , carrying the valises , which were light  --  evidently neither girl had packed for a long visit . They came into the kitchen , Ida 's kitchen , reeking of her years of cooking chicken soup , stuffed cabbage and gefullte fish , Ida 's kitchen with83her candlesticks on the shelf , her copper kettle on the stove , her dish towels alongside the sink , her worn , stained oilcloth cover on the round table , all as though she 'd just left to step down to the grocery . For an instant the girls stood staring . Then Jessie stuffed her fist into her mouth , a plug damming tears , and Celia sobbed aloud . At that moment I believed it was Ida whom they mourned . Thinking about it later , I was not as sure . More than likely it was loss of childhood they grieved for . Neither one , as I knew well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the disappointmentsand the pains of adulthood pile up , those early years become the time of idyllic happiness . Weeping uglies women . I wished Celia would stop . She gulped , " Have to go lie down , " and bolted from the kitchen . I watched her entering her parents ' room . Celia has graduated again , I thought , no more brass double bed . " Celia 's pregnant , " Jessie informed me . She yanked off the felt coal scuttle that covered her bobbed hair and flung it on the table , atop the crumbs of Herman 's breakfast roll . " Sit down , Sam , sit . Talk to me . " She tossed her coat across a chair . Beneath it she was wearing the velvet suit I 'd seen on her in New York , and the elbows were bald . Jessica White , the playwright , apparently , had not got rich enough to purchase Paris clothes . I took a chair beside her , picked up the hat , began to spin it on my fist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray eyes were lively as before , the old cockiness was in the way she held her head , chin up . " We confer in kitchens , you and I , " she began . " Shall we adjourn to the parlor ? " " God forbid ! " She shuddered . " How 's Papa ? " " Bowing to the will of God . " " What will we do with him ? " " We ? He 's no infant . He is managing . " She stayed quiet , absorbing that , and  --  it struck me  --  with relief . " I suppose the Hill is calling me a louse , not rushing back . " " There has been talk , " I said . " I wanted to , believe me , Sam . I wanted to grab the next boat . She would n't let me . Celia . It was most peculiar . She was pregnant , staying in bed at the Lutetia  --  " Her expression changed , a flicker84of impudent humor . " It was a riot , Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd suspected it , she 'd been so picky with her food , in the best restaurants in Paris , I can tell you . Her sniffing , her sending back to the kitchen , offended more chefs and maitre d 's ! That morning , we were having coffee at the Dome . All at once she stood up and shrieked , Do n't you two realize I 'm pregnant ! ' Then a whoops , a geyser , before she passed out cold , knocked the table over , smashed crockery , on her way down to the floor . Oh the French , they are extraordinaire , so sympa-thetique  --  " " I know , " I murmured . " I know the French . " Her swift glance held a hint of sneer , of how-would-you-know ? before , " Ah , yes , the A.E.F. How time does fly ! The proprietor , the waiters , " she went on , " they pounded Joey black and blue , congratulating him . A gendarme kissed him on both cheeks after he 'd flagged a taxicab for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enceinte , crawled to the Lutetia , honking all the way . I tell you it was magnifique . " She paused . " Can I burn a ciga-rette ? " " Not in Papa 's house , " I said , though I laid my pack on the table . She did n't reach for it . " If I stay , I 'll have to sneak smokes in the bathroom , " she said . " Staying ? " I inquired . A shadow of unsureness crossed her face . " I do n't know . Believe me , my heart goes out to Papa , I love my old man . " She snatched the felt helmet from my hand , twirled it on her fist , dropped it , spread her hands . " Sam , what shall I do ? Could I stand my father ? Could he bear with me ? Why , I 'd bruise him every time I turned around . I smoke , I drink , I swear , I like to screw , as you were long ago informed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " She reached to my cigarettes , drew her hand back , snapped " The hell with it " and took a cigarette . I held a match for her and rose to find a saucer she could drop the ashes in . Her voice came at me , after me . " This . This miserable , unimportant cigarette . This is precisely what I mean . Here , I 'm scared to be myself . Papa would disapprove , people would gossip . Away from here , any place but here , in Paris , in New York , I 'm free and independent , I 'm myself . Here I 'm only Herman Weiss 's daughter . Sure , sure , 85they know about my play . They pretend they 're proud of me . " She shook her head . " Tai n't so . They deplore me . She got married , did n't she ? So why do n't she wear a ring ? " She laid the smoulderingcigarette on the cracked saucer and stared at her naked hands . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France ? " " To New York . There 's where Broadway is . " She took a short puff before she stubbed out the cigarette and pushed the saucer over in front of me . " You have your divorce ? " She shook her head . " Who needs it ? If I were planning to marry again , which I am not . Never , positively not . " The heel of her hand scraped together crumbs of Herman 's roll . She picked the crumbs up , one by one , and jounced them on her palm . She was nervous as a witch . " Marriage ! " She grimaced . " You should talk . Why have n't you got hitched ? " " Because you 're not available . " It was a wisecrack , nothing more . Her eyebrows arched . " Are you sure ? Have you tried ? " " Do n't raise false hopes , " I said , kidding still . " You could have had me for ten bucks , you know , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He who got slapped . " " Oh , that ! " she said . " A grudge-bearer . " " I like clear-cut relationships , " I said . " Yes or no . Not maybe , now and then . " " Mon ami , you are most unreasonable , " she said . " You ditched the blonde Miss What's-her-name ? " " Vice versa , " I said . " For an M.D. Same age , same religion . Perfectmatch . " She spilled the crumbs on the oilcloth ; her stubby forefinger traced a circle with them . " Doctors are nice , " she said , thoughtfully . " The father image . " " Do n't fool with that . It 's loaded , " I snapped . I got the look again , the withering how-would-you-know ? and at that moment I detested Jessie Weiss . Sam 's a dope , Jessie 's smart . Only Jessie 's smart . She seemed to read my mind , for she changed the subject instantly . " I have a new play in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get copy paper to make a note for " Folk You Know . " She held my arm . " Not yet . Give you details in due course . " And as if no chitchat had intervened , she was again discussing family . " No , Sam , if they had n't written me to meet them at Le Havre  --  and by the by , Celia mentioned the faux pas at the wedding banquet ; no Freudian slip , believe me , that was malice pure and simple  --  I 'd have been here before Mama died . And we might have gotten a few things squared away , she and I. " Her fingers fluttered , a gesture of dismissal or impatience . " We have unfinished business , Mama and me , to settle in the other world . Ca n't you see us at God 's footstool , yelling , arguing about why Celia was the darling and I the cross she had to bear ? " Her gaze veered toward the sink , as if expecting to see Ida 's backside there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A know-it-all . Only one allowed per family . Maybe she felt Celia needed her protection , Celia was so weak . Jessie ? She was iron . She could manage . Sink or swim . And good riddance to bad rubbish if she sank . " The stopper fist pounded her mouth . " Celia weak ! My ass ! That one makes a strength of weakness . You ca n't leave me here with strangers , I am sick . You ca n't go before I can . You have to wait for me . ' Was she afraid I 'd rush to Grady 's Mills and Papa 'd think I loved him more than she ? " " You are naive , " I said , pleased that , for once , I was smarter than she was , for all at once I 'd realized why Celia had dashed into her mother 's room : to rummage in Ida 's bureau drawers . There was no chance to say it . We heard Herman 's tread upon the stairs . Jessie pushed back her chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of her , before she flew to him , crying " Papa , Papa , Papa ! " hugging him around the middle so exactly like the twelve-year-old I 'd seen do that in this very room that I wondered would his watch chain mark her cheek . This time he did n't thrust her from him . Eyes brimming , he bent and kissed the crown of her head , murmuring , " Mamenu . " I rapped on the bedroom door . " Celia , your father 's home . " " Oh ! In a minute . " I heard the shutting of a drawer . I said , " I 'll bring the valise to the Slomowitzes " and departed , leaving Herman 's daughters with their father . What went on that evening , I know only secondhand . Joe 's family went over , 87taking pots of food , after I 'd dropped off the suitcase and told them Celia was in town . Sylvia and Walter Leeds stopped by . My mother , naturally , had to see the girls and what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Of what was spoken when Herman and the girls were alone , I have just one detail , and this my mother , who in the shiva week had become Herman 's confidante as much as anyone could be , passed on to me . It seems Celia made a proposition to her father . " I 'll take Mama 's pin , Jessie can have the earrings ; I do n't wish to pierce my ears . " Herman said he did n't answer Celia , he could n't , his heart at that moment was too full . My mother wished he had . She was burning with curiosity about Ida 's diamonds , since she , too , had scoured the bureau drawers and had n't found the gems . She was certain Jessie had them , squirreled away in New York . My mother disliked Jessie ; she made that plain in the relish with which she passed on a bit of gossip contributed by Celia 's motherin-law . It was Jessie 's fault and only Jessie 's that the girls had not come sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on wings but Jessie  --  " Semmy , you know how that one hollers  --  day and night she hollered to Celia , So suppose you hurry up , could you help poor Mama ? You 're here in Perris , France . Who knows when you could come again ? So see Perris . ' What 's to see , Semmy ? Styles ? Naked hoors ? Enjoy Perris . ' Who was enjoying ? Who could enjoy ? Joey , that Joey , I betcha a hundred dollars he was enjoying naked hoors while Celia with her broken heart was laying sick in bed . You hear she is pregnant , Semmy ? Just beginning . Lena Slomowitztold me . Do n't put it in the paper , do n't advertise the news , people is afraid you tell too soon you give a kenenhorah . That Jessie , married how many years ? Not even a miscarriage . What kind of wife ? This is a girl without a heart , I tell you , Semmy . An intrigante . Always she would cheat Celia . Even from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her producers , dropped into the newsroom to give me a go-ahead , and I wrote for " Folk You Know " : " Mrs. Joseph Sloan and Mrs. Horace Simon are visiting their bereaved father , Herman Weiss of this city . Both ladies were in Paris , France , at the time of their mother 's sudden death and have just returned to the United States . Mrs. Simon , under the88pen name of Jessica White , was the author of The Awakening , ' a Broadway success of several seasons back . Her latest brain child , written abroad , is The Fatal Innocence , ' a drama presently in rehearsaland due to open shortly on Broadway . " To give the girls equivalent publicity , I might have added that Mrs. Sloan also was with child , but tell-a-woman had taken care of that . Jessie left town the day the item appeared , saying her presence was demanded by the director , not saying when or whether she 'd return . " Should you chance to visit the big city , " she told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not always bestiale . Sometimes I enjoy a cup of tea . " Celia stayed the week . The Slomowitzes pampered her , letting her sleep late , took rolls and coffee to her bedside , waited on her hand and foot . Sylvia Leeds entertained for her , a quiet afternoon tea , since Mrs. Sloan was in mourning . She , too , departed without a commitment to return . The girls , it was apparent , had concluded Herman Weiss could manage by himself in Grady 's Mills . In the first week of September , " Folk You Know " announced , " Word was received here today of the birth of a daughter to Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Sloan , formerly of this city and now of New York . The baby girl was born last night at Lenox Hill Hospital , New York , weighing eight pounds , two ounces . The infant will be named Ilene in memory of her maternal grandmother , the late Mrs. Ida Weiss . " Mrs. Sloan is the daughter of Mr. Herman Weiss and the late Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Max Slomowitz , all of Grady 's Mills . Mr. Weiss and the Slomowitz family plan to spend the Labor Day weekend in New York getting acquainted with the new member of the family . " The gossips on the Hill counted on their fingers and badgered Lena Slomowitz . " A seven month , " Lena told them firmly . " A seven month , eight pounds ! " they clucked . " That Joe ! That Celia ! Such a love , they could n't wait . That 's why Ida did n't invite to the wedding . Ashamed . The kalah was pregnant . " Goldie Slomowitz ran into me on the street and told me , with nose-crinkled disgust , that Herman had hung Celia 's room at Lenox Hill with strips of paper bearing Hebrew prayers , to keep evil spirits from the mother and the babe . " We were ashamed for89the nurses . Someone should tell Herman Weiss this is not year one , it 's nineteen twenty-seven . " She told me , too , that Celia had had a hard time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A darling baby . Like a doll . My mama says she resembles our family . " She also had inspected the Sloan apartment on West End Avenue . " A palace ! I 'll say this for Celia , she has wonderful taste . Of course , they can afford the best . My brother 's making a fortune . Celia will have two in help , a nurse for Ilene and a full-time servant girl . She 'll never have to stick her hands in cold water . " As before , Jessie was distant when the clan was gathering . She was in Hollywood . The Fatal Innocence had received fair notices , though it had n't lasted long enough for me to see it . I was sorry about that since this dealt with a Weiss-Simon-type modern marriage , and one critic had highly praised a scene in a hospital ward as " so realistic it is hard to believe the playwright had not spent long , harrowing hours in Bellevue . " A famous motion picture star decided the play 's heroine was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had given Jessie a contract to work on the screen treatment . That female lead , I gathered from reviews , was a bitchy , proud , misunderstood woman with inordinate zest and a heart of gold . Miss White , it was evident , continued to find inspiration in the life and self-love of Jessie Weiss. 90FourA box on page one of our paper said the first three days of July , 1937 , had set an all-time heat record . The Fourth dawned , no exception , eighty-eight at 6 A.M. , no relief in sight . I 'd expected to spend this Fourth at Grady 's Lake , a restricted Eden on the mountainside . Sylvia and Walter Leeds invited me . They owned a cottage there , the first Jewish family permitted to buy lake-front property , a circumstance which can lead to strain as well as self-congratulations . Jews let in where other Jews are barred are on the spot in more ways than one . They have to prove their presence wo n't devaluate the neighbors ' property . I 'd seen the Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Columbus picnic , an outing of the Epworth League . It was pretty , though not spectacular : grayish water ringed with silver birch , pines and gingerbready cottages , a muddy shoreline littered with discarded beer bottles and condoms . The frontage at Walter and Sylvia 's place  --  I could give you written guarantees  --  would n't have as much as a waterlogged Crackerjack box . They 'd win the neatness prize . I 'd never cottoned to Sylvia . She had a gift for sniffing out and flaunting the fashions , phrases and postures destined for vulgarity . But for Walter I 'd acquired respect . He lost his hair and gained a paunch while he ripened into a leading citizen , vice-chairman of our Red Feather drive , a big man in Kiwanis and the Masons , and a macher in the Jewish community . Right after the war , he swung the deal that acquired the old Elks Club building at the corner of Grady and East Market for a Y.M.H.A. and currently he heads the committee that 's raising funds to build the Brookfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbi hired , a cleanshaventype who 's undecided , like his congregation , whether to be91reform-traditional or liberal-orthodox . On this year 's Holy Days the congregation will pray in the former Elks Club building , in the Aaron Leiberman Memorial Auditorium , the men and women side by side , men without hats , women with , and Kol Nidre will be sung by a choir that 's mainly Welsh Presbyterian . My mother 's scandalized , but Walter 's pleased and proud . It 's been my impression that he 's trying to lead his people from the wilderness , gently , with refinement , to confound the anti-Semites by showing them that Jews are merely members of a house of worship that convenes on Saturday . " Sam , dear , " Sylvia told me on the phone , " Walter just called to my attention you have off on the Fourth , so how 's about spendingit with us up at the Lake ? Swimming . Rowing . Fishing . Roastingwienies . How 's it appeal to you ? " I smelled ulterior motives , she 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat wave I 'd have been crazy to refuse . " Good ! I 'm delighted ! " Sylvia said . " No crowd . They 're funnypeculiarat the Lake , look cross-eyed if we bring a mob on holidays . Just Walter , me , our kids  --  my folks are at the shore  --  and my cousin , Ruthie Posner , she 's spending her vacation here with us . You 'll meet her at the Lake . " Aha ! That 's where the dog lies buried . Why must married women keep baiting traps for bachelors ? " You 'll like Ruthie , " Sylvia promised . " She 's your type . Vivacious . Intellectual . " " My type is any blonde who spreads her legs . " " Try not to be crude , Sam . It 's later than you think . " " Now , seriously , Sylvia , why should intellectual , vivacious girls want me ? What 's the big matzeah ? Rosenbaum , the reporter , foureyes , receding hairline , small biceps , salary fifty-two fifty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incentive . Just come on up to the Lake . . . . Walter , I have Sam on the wire ... . Hold it , Walter wants a word with you . " Walter got on the extension ; Sylvia clicked off . " Listen , shmo , nobody means you harm . Is it poison if you meet a nice Jewish girl ? Say Hello , how are you ? Please pass me the mustard . ' Then what 'll be will be ; let nature take its course . Moreover , I have something to discuss with you and it is not a shidduch . You and92me , we 'll take a couple of rods , we 'll row out in the middle of the Lake and talk .... " He said they 'd pick me up at ten the morning of the Fourth . At quarter of , Walter phoned to say he 'd just gone to the garage to get his Buick and found both the rear tires flat . Nails . Could n't imagine where he picked them up . He 'd phone around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and get the tires . He had just a single spare . At eleven he rang back . The only open service station was on the highway , ten miles out ; the one attendant on duty could n't leave his pumps to drive in for the tires . And none of the neighborswas around , not a soul to help him out . " Looks like we 're stuck , " he said . Sylvia picked up the extension . " Sam , dear , I can imagine how you 're disappointed . But what can we do ? Walter has been going crazy on the phone trying to get help . So look , Sam , you planned to be with us , so come anyway . This house is comfortable . Thank God Papa made us insulate . I have a couple of big fans . The back porch is screened , and I 'll turn on the sprinkler in the yard , so bring your bathing suit . 1 have plenty ice cubes  --  thank God for Frigidaires  --  beer , soft drinks , anything your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bought for the Lake , make our picnic here .... Come on , be a sport . Have you anything  --  " " Better to do ? " I finished her sentence . " No . " Whatever , Sylvia 's porch was sure to be cooler than the Rosenbaum 's front stoop . It was brutal walking over to Brookfield Heights . " Heights " exaggeratesthe slight rise and roll of the terrain beyond the brook that Abe Finkel had acquired at sheriff 's sale during the depression . Abe had let the acreage lie fallow until his son , Myron , finished a college course in business administration and came back with a scheme for creating an upper-middle-class housing development , hopefully nonsectarian . The Goyim did n't bite . Partly , blame Barry Neale , the NewsRecord'scurrent city editor . Barry dubbed the project " Abie'sAcres " and spread his wisecrack with a smirk and snicker untilBrookfield Heights became our second ghetto  --  gilded , to be sure . The dwellings , American Colonial , were spacious , the landscap-93ing admirable , shrubs and flowers according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , April ; rhododendrons , May ; roses and gladioli , June and July ; petunias , August ; cannas , September ; mums and salvia until the killing frosts . The street lights were replicas of the lantern Paul Revere carried on that ride ; the winding shaded macadam roads were named for deceased presidents . Sylvia and Walter lived on McKinley Road ; Myron Finkel and Evelyn , his bride , on Theodore Roosevelt Boulevard ; Irwin Katz , who grew up as Isie , on Cleveland Road around the bend from Garfield Drive where Sol Katz , Isie 's father , owner of the Bon Ton DepartmentStore , had added Grecian columns to his red-brick Colonial . No one lived on Harding Place . It was a short connecting lane , dead end . Sylvia had ignored the prospectus . She 'd built a split-level modem . Her house held a mammoth Frigidaire , an oil burner , a console radio , a grand piano , Persian rugs , sterling silver tableware and a brace of etchings . Walter had been ( this is no mean distinction ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own initiative and following his own taste , original works of art . A by-the-hour Italian gardener kept their lawns emerald and smooth , their weeping willows , dwarf cypresses and Japanese maples manicured . A sleep-in maid , local Slovak , and a part-time laundress , Irish , did the housework . Sylvia did the cooking , American-Jewish , which meant she bought her chickens from the kosher butcher and broiled them with butter . She lighted candles Friday nights and Walter donned a yarmulka to say a Hebrew brocha over shrimp cocktails . The candles , yarmulka and prayer were so the children would remember they were Jews . The children were two , Carol Frances and Harold , both plump and rosy-cheeked and with braces on their teeth . There also was Rags , a wire-haired terrier . Our Jews with money had left the Hill , all but the Rogoff family , who were planning to as soon as they found a buyer for their house . The Slomowitzes had been the first to go . The year after Joe 's marriage , Max began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the doctor called it , not dangerous in itself , a warning ; take it easy , keep this vial of pills in your vest pocket , take one when you feel a twinge ; you can live with this for94twenty years . Max had acquired beach-front property in Miami during Florida 's bust following its boom . With a heart condition , an ailing wife , three daughters afflicted with delusions of social grandeur by a catered affair at the Hotel Astor , Joe running the scrap-metal business from an office in New York , and the winters harsh in Grady 's Mills , why remain on the Hill ? The business  --  Victory Steel , M. Sloan , President ; J. Sloan , Chairmanof the Board  --  had been phenomenally successful . A scavenger'strade , it had soared during the depression , ready cash in the iron safe handy for snatching bargains , a bankrupt rail line , a moribund iron foundry . Joey  --  what 's true is not to be denied  --  was a business genius . He 'd flunked in geometry , but at multiply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled widely , making deals , though he had n't set foot in our region for close on to eleven years . Max retired to Miami , built a mansion on his beach-front lots , lolled on the sand , dipped into the surf and bought a bag of golf clubs . Then , Lena Slomowitz died of the cancer that had been gnawing her for years . After Max had planted a hundred trees in Palestine in memory of his wife , he shaved his beard and went prospecting among the divorcees and widows who came down to the sea with bankbooks pinned to their brassieres and selected Mitzi , a henna-haired divorcee twenty years younger than himself . Some people questioned Max 's sanity . Others said , so crazy I should get the chance to be ! He should live and be well and enjoy to a hundred years ! Those who 'd remained on the Hill were the unambitious , the unsuccessful , the set-in-their-ways and the strict Orthodox who had to be in walking distance to a shul , like the Rosenbaums , unambitious , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herman 's building had become ramshackle : the porch floor boards were loose and dangerous , the side shingles flapped , paint peeled from the window frames . His stock was meager , his customersdwindling . A poor piece of bread , Ida would have said . Yet , morning after morning Herman carried in the cake of ice , dropped it into the old-fashioned chest , locked the door and , stooping slightly , plodded off to shuI , came back , tied on his canvas95apron , weighed sweet butter and granulated sugar on the iron scales , wrapped herrings in the News-Record , and made change for his customers . He was aging , though so gradually that when you saw him every day the change was not perceptible . I realized how he had aged when , during a long Yom Kippur afternoon , I chanced to look in his direction and was startled by the grayness of his beard and mustache , the purple , wrinkled hollows underneath his eyes . The women worried about him . They knew he barely made a living , having competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business district and the Hill , carried most of the special culinary items Herman 's Grocery did , and the Brookfield Heights crowd , understandably , shopped there , across spic-and-span counters and from a sparkling Frigidaire . Herman did n't seem to mind . How much does an old man need ? For whom must he provide ? As a matter of fact , he himself , now and then , dropped in at Perizweig 's for cold borsht or blintzes and Mrs. Perizwcig clucked over him affectionately , like the women on the Full . Everybody fretted about his solitary state and , with diligence and cunning , the women schemed to get him married off . Mrs. Rogoff brought a spinster sister from New Jersey for a long visit , during which the sister did the family marketing at Herman 's Grocery ; the Litvak rabbi produced a childless widowed cousin , a younger woman , good-looking and religious ; a New York marriage broker , alerted by Mrs. Katz , turned up , deplored the rundown condition of the grocery , said the widow he had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life insurance ) that she was prepared to invest in a business , maybe she did n't mean exactly a grocery , but if this one could be brought up to dateMy mother had him to our house for Yom Tov meals and talked to him from the heart . " You could live yet , Mr. Weiss , like a mensch . Ida , she should rest in peace , she would be the first one to say , Mr. ' Weiss , I want you should get married , a partner to help you in the store , a wife to cook for you tasty meals and wash and press the shirts , a friend for you in the house . ' Mr. Weiss , you are a person , not a stone . So if you get sick , who will96come , take the fever , bring the aspirins , make the hot tea , chicken soup ? God forbid you should need to on-come to the children . A mother , a father , for ten children they have room . Ten children , for one father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two children . As far as we could see , neither one had offered him a place . Solitary he remained and  --  the evidence was visible  --  tormented by loneliness . A single light bulb burned upstairs all hours , and occasionally Herman fell asleep in shul . Obviouslyhe was n't sleeping soundly , alone in his double bed . We missed Ida , too . Something vivid and exciting had left the Hill . " Our kochleffel is gone , " my mother cried . True , Ida had been the mixing spoon , the fomenter , the arguer , the voice of authority . No one could replace her . No one tried . The new people who had moved into Katz 's house , Slomowitz 's , and Finkel 's , were Jews , yet alien to us . They were out of Germany , offensively ingratiating but arrogant and enjoying luxuries of which most of us had never dreamed . A former Berlin manufacturerfor whom Abe Finkel had signed the affidavit that delivered him from Hitler 's Germany had moved a Bechstein piano into a dwelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see but not to touch the instrument . A pallid , black-bearded scholar from Frankfurt , where his family had lived four hundred years , was trying to support himself by teaching Hebrew to our kids . He constantly complained of their manners and ignorance . A physician from Munich had a Cherman-only-speaking wife who wore a Persian lamb coat and dined off Rosenthal china . The doctor planned to practice here after he passed our State Boards . Meanwhile , he antagonized the staff at St. Luke 's by lecturing them on the superiority of German medicine and downgrading ours . I 'd interviewed each refugee after he moved in but learned very little , since all of them had kinfolk still in Germany and they feared reprisals . " We did not believe it could happen to us , " the doctor told me . " We were Cherman . " He had an Iron Cross from World War One . " The Ostjuden , ya , the Polish Chews . Not us . " Nevertheless , they lived  --  welcomed , sheltered , shielded by Ostjuden : Litvaks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck out like sore thumbs and by their very foreignness threatened the pre-97carious balance of tolerance in the rest of Grady 's Mills . The GermanJews on Grady Avenue , ironically , ignored them . Not a leaf was stirring when I plodded up McKinley Road , not a bird chirping . One fat sparrow , one alone , alighted on a telephonewire , seared its toes , winged off to the shade of a maple tree . Stars and Stripes hung limp on all the flagpoles on the lawns . Behind Walter 's house I heard a sprinkler hissing and children whooping discreetly . I started around back . Sylvia , opening the front door , interceptedme . " Welcome , welcome , stranger ! Long , long time no see . " Time and motherhood had padded Sylvia with more of what she 'd started with . The halter she was wearing showed me what I had n't seen since I was weaned . I backed up and bumped the cousin . She 'd sneaked in , behind . I was trapped between . Cousin Ruthie was a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive buttocks  --  and she was wearing shorts , a frank obscenity . " Ruthie , this is my dear , dear friend , Samuel Rosenbaum , " Sylvia said . " I know you two are going to get along just great . " Ruthie offered me a paw . " My pleasure . " Add to her liabilities , adenoids that needed shrinking . " I just know you two will have so much in common , " Sylvia said . She led me through the house , Ruthie trailing , breathing on my neck . Walter , in bathing trunks , more hair on his chest than scalp , was sprawled on a chaise on the screened hack porch , a tall glass , rattling ice cubes , in his hand . " Aim ! The chinless wonder ! " he greeted me . " Bring your bathing suit ? " Sylvia asked , though she could have seen my hands were empty and my pockets flat . Lawn sprinklers do n't entice me . " Somebody will be disappointed . Somebody who was waiting till you came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her show it to the kids , " Walter growled . " Sam and I have things .... " The kids , soaking wet and faintly bluish at the gills , dashed98across the lawn to eye me through the screen . " Awl " young Haroldgrowled . " Eek ! " Carol Frances squealed . Scorn ! Had they been promised Tarzan , or Adonis ? Cousin Ruthie shifted from foot to foot , making up her mind . " Awright , kiddies , I will be a sport . I 'll come out and play with you , " she bleated through the screen . My hostess clutched my sweaty hand . " Sam , dear , we have missed you , honest , true we have . We used to be such friends . You remember "  --  her hip nudged my thigh  --  " those darling little supper parties we used to have when I was just a bride ? You and Walter were so brave , eating my experiments . " " I 've been on milk toast ever since , " I said . Her elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect louse . I was so sure you and Ceil  --  little did I dream she was stringing you along till Joe got ready to propose . " Walter hoisted himself from the chaise . " Come out to the garage . Want to show you what some bastard did . " The nailheads in his tires were approximately half an inch across . It was hard to imagine ' Walter , a careful driver , not seeing such spikes in the road . " Tires were okay when I drove in last night . Matter of fact , I had air put in when I stopped for gas and oil to be ready for today . " He kicked one flat , disgusted . " The way I figure is somebody wanted that lake Judenrcin today . " He scowled . " But who could have done it ? My gardener ? My neighbor'shandyman ? Some lousy shikker from the Flats ? Sneaking around your garage while you 're fast asleep . Scares hell out of you , do n't it ? " He kicked the other tire . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brookfield Heights . Maybe the NewsRecordshould look into it . " " I 'll mention it to Neale . " " That momser ! " Walter said . We strolled back looking worried , both of us . Sylvia had two big fans going on the porch . They stirred a niodest breeze . I took off my tie , opened my collar and stretched out on a chaise . The dog was yipping , the kids whooping , Cousin Ruthie cackling inanely in the yard . Now and then , intentionally , 1 do believe , a thin spray from the hose filtered through the screen. 99 " Watch it , kids ! I 'll break your necks ! " Walter barked before he pushed his chaise parallel and close to mine . " What will you drink ? " Sylvia asked . " Sassparilla , cokes , cream soda , beer ? Iced tea ? Walter 's sticking to iced tea . " I said I 'd have the beer ; it hits the spot for me in hot weather . " Take off your shirt , " Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Goyim here . " I yanked off the shirt . Sylvia staggered out with a heavy tray . She 'd brought two bottles of beer , a pitcher of iced tea , sarsaparilla , and extra glasses , in case the shpritzers craved refreshment , too . I rolled a chilled bottle between my palms , held it to my wrists , cooling my pulse while Sylvia poured tea for Walter and herself . She handed Walter a glass , me a bottle opener , before she pushed my feet aside to crouch on the footrest of my chaise , ever one for intimacy . " I saw an old friend of yours , " she began between sips . " In New York . I went up to buy my Easter  --  my spring outfit . Ceil . We shopped together . She had entree to wholesale houses . Ceil is stunning , so  --  so distingee ... " " Your family was never good in French . " I lifted off a bottle cap , studied the foam rising in my glass . Walter wrinkled his elongated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aha ! I remember . Sam rushed to defend somebody 's honor . " He punched my knee . " She deserved it . That one is no mensch . " " Et tu , Walter ? Joined the knockers of Jessie Weiss ? " " That one 's nothing to me nor I to her , " Walter said . " I hardly know the bitch . Gave me a back-hand howjado when she was here with Celia , that time , to sec the father , after the mother died . " " To know her is to despise , " Sylvia said promptly and with decision . " She is conceited and as selfish as they come . How two such different girls could grow up in one family I will never understand . Ceil has the most beautiful apartment . Like a palace . Over on Park Avenue . Nobody lives on the West Side any more , she says , except German refugees . Ceil has to go over there to shop for Pesach : matzohs , horseradish , fish . The markets in her neighborhooddo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Seder every year . And guess who conducts it ? Herman Weiss ! " I 'd surmised something like this . Each Passover week Herman100locked his store and disappeared . Being uncommunicative ordinarily , he did n't tell his neighbors where he went . If to Celia , fine , a sound relationship . Yet again , as when Jessie 's name had come up , I was only mildly interested . You lose interest when old acquaintancesare long away from town . I drained my glass , waiting till Walter found a chance to speak of what he wished to speak to me about . " Ceil had a couple of Goyim last year for the Seder , " Sylvia burbled . " Business friends of Joe 's . They were so impressed with Herman . Your dad looks like an Old Testament prophet , ' Ceil said they said to her . " I mumbled , " Where 'd they ever see one ? " She rebuked me with a glance . " Must you always be a smart aleck ? Ceil wants her father to come live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kosher , four sets of dishes , even two for Passover . She hates the idea of him selling herrings on the Hill . " " He likes it . " She ignored me . " Ceil begs him to retire . She was hoping he 'd move to Miami when Joe 's folks settled there . But then Max went nuts and married that redhead . Minnie and Goldie phoned Joe long distance to come down , do something , buy the floozie off . Joe would n't stir off his backside in New York . Ceil is so humiliated . She refused to meet Mitzi . When Max and Mitzi come to New York  --  on business  --  they stay at a hotel . And run around to night clubs . Imagine ! Max Slomowitz with his weak heart . He could drop dead dancing . " " I understand Joe went to meet the bride . " Walter slipped a few words in . " Came back drooling at the mouth . " " Figures , " I muttered . Walter winked at me . We 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another bottle cap , poured more foaming brew . It was n't too bad on this porch . I was getting comfortable . Also a certain type of gossip amuses me . " Anybody hear from Jessie Weiss ? " I asked . " Do n't you ? " Sylvia asked , answering . " All I know is what I read in the papers . " Which was little enough . As far as I knew Jessie had remained in California , writing for the films , and Hollywood , as everybody knows , is a morass101into which writers sink , weighted down with gold . Infrequently , I 'd seen Horace Simon 's name among the credits in a theatrical review : " Settings by Horace Simon . " He was East and she was West , a perfect marital arrangement for two no longer of a single mind . " A disgrace . " Sylvia kept babbling while I mused . " The way she 's cut herself off . Wants nobody , needs nobody . Oh , now and then she sends Ilene some trinket , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ceil says . That Ilene is dressed like a model . A very lovely child and well-behaved . Cell brings her up just so . I wish I could make my brats  --  the language Harold uses . . . . Let 's not go into that . What was I talking about before ? Jessie . Yes . At Chanukah , Jessie mails Herman a check . Ceil got her father to tell her that much ; he 's close-mouthed , as you know . Just a check , not even  --  this is the God 's honest truth  --  a letter , a few words , a How are you ? How do you feel ? Flow is business , Papa ? Love and kisses from your daughter . " She took a sip to oil her vocal chords . " Why , Ceil and Joe had a tenth anniversary and did Jessie so much as wire flowers from the Coast ? Not even a cheap , cut-rate , night-letter telegram . " Walter 's eyes met mine . " Bum chance , " we said together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvia approved . " True and enough already . " Walter stirred and stretched . " Syl , do n't you need to peel potatoes or something ? " " You boys want to talk dirty , ell ? " She rose , taking the hint and her empty glass . " I love my wife . " Walter sighed profoundly . " But when she starts yakking about her dear friend , Cell . ... " " Me , out of sight , out of mind , for both Weiss girls , " I said . " So , now what 's your big news ? " " Hold your horses . " He sat up to find his pipe and pouch and I had , perforce , to wait while he filled the pipe bowl , tamped tobacco , worked a cleaner up and down the stem , struck match after match , drew in , retamped , recleaned . I 'd smoked half a Camel before he had the pipe drawing . " Okay . " He leaned back , his bald skull wreathed in sweat and pungent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bought WGMX ? " I whistled . WGMX was our local radio station. 102 " Knocks you over , eh ? " He chortled . " Under your hat , understand ? Not for publication , yet . But in the works , on the fire . " I rested my cigarette . " Gim me , gim me , tell . " He parked his pipe beside my Camel . " The present owners may lose the franchise . Certain textile unions have been complaining to the F.C.C. Station too one-sided , broadcasting too much anti-labor stuff . " " True , true , and not the half of it , " I said . His upraised palm silenced me . " Certain Protestant ministers have been griping , too . GMX is an outlet for Father Coughlin , that rabble-rouser priest . And ai n't it wonderful for our side "  --  he grinned  --  " when Christians get roused up ? Would anybody listen , pay attention , if only Jews complained ? " " No argument . Tell more . " " Well , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined up is putting in a bid . It 'll take a lot of cash . My dad and Sylvia 's will put up some , and Joe Sloan  --  say what you want about the guy and all of it is true : he 's prost , a loudmouth , nut , but he understands what 's happening in the world  --  he thinks he can swing a substantialloan for us in New York . " " Congratulations , great . " I offered my hand . He shook it , dropped it , hunted for a penknife , found it , began to scrape his pipe , saying , " If we get the station , I want you in with us . " Excitement flooded me . My hand trembled when I took a cigarette from my pack . " You 're an experienced journalist . " Walter spoke my thoughts . " Crapping on a lousy paper , getting no place fast . A bright boy with no future , passed over for a crummy Goy . " There are few secrets in Grady 's Mills ; most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not in " Folk You Know . " When Malloryretired last year to go tarpon fishing in Florida , I had hopes of promotion to the city desk . Other people guessed I did . Sol Katz , for one . He bumped into me on First Street one afternoon and said , " Sam , I hear Mallory is getting out . Want me to put in a word for you ? Could be they would pay attention . The Bon Ton advertising . " It was tempting but I said , " Better no , let nature take its course . " 103Nevertheless , I have reason to believe Sol tried , because just before Barry Neale got the nod , a steno in the business office told me they 'd been getting calls , mentioning how bright and competent Rosenbaum was . To be fair , Barry rated the promotion . For one thing , he was older , pushing fifty , and with city desk experience . During the depression he had drifted out our way , from Philadelphia , where newspapers , like other businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chutzpah , the ability to push guys around , which is one of several qualities I lack . And , finally  --  this I admit reluctantly  --  Grady'sMills was not yet ready to promote a Yid to so conspicuous a spot . Barry did n't like me . It was mutual . Much of this was bigotry . Barry coined the " Abie 's Acres " crack . He repeated it in every bar in town and he threatened to put it into my copy whenever I handed him a social item about a resident of Brookfield Heights  --  just kidding , understand , but such jokes I can do without . About our refugees , he 'd growled , " Come here to steal the jobs from good Americans , " and one recent day , when a couple of us were sitting around , discussing the U.P . service copy out of Europe , young Dick Adams , a good kid , asked was n't it time F.D.R. did something to put the skids under Hitler . Barry turned from him to look me in the eye . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a senior in high school . If I can help it , and by God 1 ' 11 try my best , my boy is not going to war to save the goddam lcikcs . " And this spring , after certain happenings ... . In April , a fire in the I-lungarian-Galician shul . By the time the minyan arrived for morning prayers , flames were licking the basementceiling , directly underneath the Ark . Short circuit , the fire chief concluded . Okay , accept it . I ) o you have a choice ? But , sure as shooting , no broken copper wire desecrated Aaron 's grave in the Sons of Judea Cemetery . That little mound and headstone is pretty much ignored these days . Aaron 's family has moved away ; it 's almost twenty years since he was buried there . And alive , exceptamong the girls , he 'd cut no ice , a courteous , dull , pretty boy . Nevertheless , there was considerable enthusiasm when Hymie Rogoff proposed we name the Y auditorium in memory of Aaron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stick a flag into a metal tube before the granite slab . When they arrived104on this year 's Decoration Day to place the flag , they found the headstone uprooted and a crimson swastika painted on its back . Aaron had , at last , attained significance . Shock raced through the Hill , through Brookfield Heights . We expected it would rock all of Grady 's Mills . I wrote it up , for once discarding journalistic objectivity . Barry read my piece and scowled . " Nothing doing , Bud . We blow this up , we give other hooligans ideas . " He passed my copy over to Gus Stengel , who , being of German ancestry , might also have had a nonobjective view . " Fifty words , " Barry said , though to mollify me he offered to talk to Steve Durgin , our chief of police , see if Durgin had any clues . No use my talking to Durgin . In my excited state , I 'd just antagonize the chief . He added he wanted a column on the bidding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and he had the gall to hint that if I paid stricter attention to the courthouse , my regular beat , I 'd be more valuable to the News-Record . The paper did n't print even fifty words when in June , during Shevuoth services , a stone was flung through a window of the Litvak shul , grazing the skull of Bobby , Hymie Rogoff 's little son . Some anti-Semitism Grady 's Mills has always had  --  the amount that 's considered normal in American small cities : ignorant kids yelling " sheeny " and " Christ-killer " at us in the streets ; social segregation after school , we going to our parties , they to theirs , no interracial dating openly . The Hilldale Country Club barred Jews , even as members ' guests ; Grady 's Lake restricted property ownership . However , we were welcome in the public schools and public library , in Rotary , Kiwanis and the Masons , and most of the Jewishboys had learned to swim in the Y.M.C.A. pool . When necessaryor desirable , certain Jewish citizens relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locally available . What we 'd known up to now was petty irritation . This spring we 'd begun to know fear . " With WGMX "  --  Walter 's mind , apparently , was traveling the same route as mine  --  " maybe we can help ourselves . Goddamit , I never thought would come the day when I 'd feel scared in Grady 's Mills . This was a nice town , I always thought ; we behave , they behave . Brother , it has changed . Sam , those spikes in my tires were no accident . They were a warning : Jew , stay away from the Lake ; 105do n't contaminate our water . ' Well , sir , I for one do not intend to take this lying down . No siree . Aaron 's grave . The shuls . My car . I tell you we have Nazis here in town . Maybe in the Flats . Maybe in the better neighborhoods . Maybe even in the City Hall . Maybe it was the refugees moving in that stirred it up ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the third degree they put me through before they let me buy that cottage on the Lake ? How many of you people will be coming here on Sundays ? " What languagewill they speak ? ' Even , believe me , Does your wife use garlicwhen she cooks ? ' Aaah , who needed it ? To please Sylvia , I made nice , nice . Well , all I know is , Sam , we are in trouble . And we have to take some steps . You follow me ? " I did . I would have said so had he given me a chance . " Now , mind you , Sam , with the radio station , we would have a voice , speak up , speak out , let all the people know exactly what the bastard Hitler is , what he 's out to do , yes , what Fascism is , what Father Coughlin is , a tool , a stooge for Fascism . . . . Sam , you sit there like a dummy , like a sphinx ; maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking over , running a radio station in a town like this ; how will it look to the Goyim ? Next thing they 'll try to take over City Hall , the government . Might make matters worse . " He picked up his cold pipe , sucked the stem , put it down . " Listen , Sam , a damn fool altogether I am not . We will watch our step . We 'll have Gentiles in our corporation , hire a Gentile manager , our own Christian front . " He leaned to me . " There 's another side , the cold business side . This is n't charity , by any means , I 'm no bighearted shmo . WGMX has been a nice piece of bread and these Goyim could have kept it for a million years , except they let their bias show . For my part , I 'm delighted it was the labor people and the ministers got on their tail . Now our station "  --  he was talking as though he had the franchise in his pocket "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the businessman . Say there 's a little trouble over wages in the mills , we give both sides a chance to tell their side . But on Nazism , Fascism , one side . Against . " " Communism ? " I did get in a word . " Against , " Walter said , flatly . " American . Capitalist . Democracy . Good enough for F.D.R. Good enough for me. " 106 " And me , " I said . " With you all the way . When do I start takingelocution lessons ? " He raised his hand . " Take it easy , there 's no rush . Maybe we wo n't even use you to read news . Maybe you 'll be one who makes it . For example , how would you like to do an expose of a prime son-of-a-bitch , a chief of police who would n't lift one little finger to find out who painted a swastika on a Jewish hero 's grave ? " I went hot and cold . Something ugly crawled from underneath a slimy stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told myself I had forgotten it . I managed to mumble , " That 's dangerous ground . " Walter glowered at me . " Lost your nerve , before we even start . Sam , do you realize that 's exactly how it came to pass in Germany ? " Cousin Ruthie pushed the screen door open . I could have kissed her for barging in . " Brrr , I 'm freezing . Ee-magine freezing a hot day like this ! " Rags , the terrier , slithered in behind her , shaking water off his pelt onto my white pants . " Serves you right , " Ruthie said , " for being a poor sport . " Walter rolled off his chaise . " I 'm going under the sprinkler . Too bad you did n't bring your suit . " He wagged a forefinger at me . " Come on in , the water 's fine . Take the plunge , show guts . " " When you 're all set , whistle , " I told him . We had hot dogs , hamburgers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink , with ruffles , and left her glasses off , but her case remained hopeless . While Ruthie and the youngsters were twirling sparklers on the dampened grass , Sylvia pleaded , " Take her out just once , Sammy , 1 ' 11 appreciate it . To the Bijou for a movie . How much can it cost ? For a walk , a soda . Anything . Give the kid a whirl . " " You 're not obligated to marry her , " Walter added , " unless pregnancy results . " I buttoned my shirt , tucked my tie into my pocket . " You make fine potato salad , " I told Sylvia . " I 'll tell Mama to call you for the recipe . " Walter walked me to the road . " I 'll let you know developments . And if you hear anything  --  somebody at your office might just drop a word  --  give me a buzz . " I walked home slowly , mulling . Sure , I 'd love to try radio news-107casting . Sure , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd be another middle-aged newspaper hack , worried about bright kids gunning for my job . Sam , it 's later than you think . But how real is the menace here ? Is Walter making too much out of the malicious mischief of a couple of hooligans ? Walter 's a European , out of Poland , where they have pogroms . I 'm a local boy . Anti-Semitism never has touched me , never done me harm . So why was I steamed up about Aaron 's grave ? Racial memories ? Racial solidarity ? Look , see here , you were with Walter all the way ; you thought his plan was great . Only to a point , to the point where he suggested you stick out your neck . Investigate Steve Durgin . Uncover a long , dirty trail that leads back to me . To me and to Max Slomowitz . And Joe . And that pathetic little chick , Dolores McCarthy . She 's dead ; the boy is who knows where . But I am here , I who made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without sin . . . . Who the hell is ? Walter is , I think . Walter can take risks . His hands are clean . But I ? One shady deal , one buried scandal . Must it make a coward of me for the remainder of my days ? The Hill was half abed , most of the houses darkened , though here and there through the open windows of unlighted rooms I could hear the radios . Above the dry , dusty maples , Roman candles showered stars of blue and red , green and gold . A car slitheredalong the road , spattering tarry gravel . It stopped at a curb , unloading weary picnickers . There were no nighttime strollers . The heat was like a heavy woolen blanket . Mama and Papa were on our stoop , on the swing behind the morning glory 's screen , trying to keep cool with tumblers of iced water and palm leaf fans . I squatted on the top step , panting , inhalingthe heated tar , poured yesterday to lay the dust in the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a cold drink ? We got in the icebox a bottle cream soda . " " And a bottle beer , " Papa said . " Sam likes better beer . " " We got plums in the icebox . I get for you . " The swing squeaked as Mama made to rise . " Sit , " I said . " I 'm not hungry . " " By who did you have supper ? " Mama asked . " Sylvia Leeds . " 108 " So-o-o . She made a nice supper ? What was served ? " " Hot dogs , hamburgers . " Her tongue clicked against her palate . " Rich people ! By us , plain people , would be a shame to give a guest hot dogs . For this she invited you ? " " Walter invited me . We had something to talk over . " " Temple business ? " Mama scoffed . " Temple-shmemple busi-ness ? " I lit a cigarette . " You smoke too much , " Papa said . " What did you two do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " Mama answered , asking . " A heat like Inever saw in mine whole life . Sophie Rogoff came with the car . They bought big car , a Hudson . She invited we should take a littlespin . Believe me , in the car was more hot than the house . " I pressed my cigarette out beneath a step , flung the butt away . " Take care ! " Papa cried . " Could start a fire . " " Who had appetite for supper ? " Mama said . " Cold schav we had . After , Papa walked downtown and bought a pint ice cream . Stromberry . The German doctor , he came over and we treated him . " " He was looking to talk to you , Sammy , " Papa said . " September , he takes the tests . He asked maybe you know somebody .... " " No . " I spoke sharply . " If he can pass , he 'll pass . " " Shah ! " Mama halted her swinging-fanning . " From such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole life building up a doctor practice , a beautiful house with expensive furniture . Then comes anti-Semitin , chase him out . Comes here a poor man , saves his neshoma , nothing else . " " With what did I come ? " Papa grumbled . " With two hands . " " Come to bed , Papa , " Mama said . " You talk already foolish ; you compare yourself with an educated German doctor . " I sat on the top step , smoking another cigarette . Sixth Street had finally retired ; every house was dark . Even Herman 's , up the street , had doused its upstairs bulb . A gray cat without a collar nosed my shoes . An old Ford rattled past , spraying tarry pebbles . The car was jammed with youngsters , popping cap pistols . They yelled " Ikey-Kikey . " Or maybe I imagined it . The courthouse109clock struck ten . I pulled myself up , climbed the stairs in the oven of our house , stripped and took a cold shower . Drying , I caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror , a narrow face , dark nearsighted eyes that held a trace of melancholy , a bristly jaw , not more , not less than average . " Chinless wonder " ? What gives Walter the right to insult me ? A bank account , a house in Brookfield Heights , a job to offer . Come off it , Sam , do n't start getting hypersensitive . That 's the Jew disease . I turned on my fan , crawled naked into bed , expecting , hoping I could quickly fall asleep . Seven o'clock I had to be at work . Barry would be snottier than usual if I came in late the morning after a holiday . The room was a sweatbox . Our attic was n't insulated ; all day the sun had baked the roof . My fan made a racket , needed oiling , or a screw was loose . I got up , switched it off , went back to bed . I smelled smoke . Where there 's smoke , usually there 's fire . I rolled off the mattress , opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft . I sniffed the upper hall . Nothing was burning on our premises . I crawled back to bed and tossed . I counted eleven strokes of the courthouse clock . I heard Roman candles hissing , cannon crackers sputtering , cap pistols ' rat-tat-tat . Down to the wire , Grady 's Mills was celebrating Independence Day . And enough , already , please . Any moment , any second , it will be the fifth . And any minute , any second , the temperature will drop . It must . The main thing is to stop thinking . Tell me how . You ca n't switch off a brain the way you do a fan . What Walter and I had talked about kept my brain spinning . It could change my life  --  and none too soon . It might even change the world . And in this year of 1937 , change was overdue . For the better , I mean . Walter 's plan made sense . It might lead to bigger things . A pebble tossed into a pond sends its ripples far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept smelling smoke . I got up again to sniff the hall . Must be the tar I 'm smelling . Or the firecrackers . I switched the fan on . Once more , the grinding racket bothered me , and that smell of smoke . The third time I climbed out of bed I caught an orange glow , reflected on my propped-up window pane , and when I leaned across the sill I saw flames up the street . I ran downstairs to the110phone , shouted to the operator : " Fire . Weiss 's building . One-ohthreeSixth Street , " leaped upstairs , yanked on my pajama bottoms . The alarm siren was wailing while I ran , without glasses , barefoot , tar sticking to my soles , up the street toward the grocery . At an upstairs window , I saw a white shadow , maybe Herman , maybe myopic distortion . Then gray smoke billowed past the window and all I saw was smoke and tongues of bright red flame licking the parched side walls and the porch of Herman 's Grocery . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill . At the hydrant on the corner , firemen sweated , swore , connecting the hose . The pressure was low ; just a trickle ran . " Hurry , Crissake , hurry ! " I begged . " A man 's trapped in there . " Jack Jones , the fire chief , a brave man , dashed across the burningporch and drove his axe into the staircase door , splintering it open . Dense smoke , rolling down , forced him back . But I 'd seen Herman at the head of the steps , alive and on his feet . A tongue of flame leaped from the stairwell wall , catching his beard , catching something in his left hand . " Jump , Herman , jump ! " Reckless , I stood yelling , " Roll down ! Jump ! I 'll catch you . " Smoke swirled around me , choking me , the fire crawling near . He came down , inching , blinded by the smoke , flame like a bright beard around his jaw , the nightshirt smouldering on his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jack Jones and I grabbed him , carried him to the grass and rolled him in a blanket to smother the flames . He moaned but did not cry out . The roof crashed , showering sparks and embers . Had there been any breeze at all , Sixth Street would have seen a holocaust . Herman was unconscious and stark naked  --  the nightshirt had fallen away in black shreds  --  when the ambulance arrived . I rode to St. Luke 's beside him . There , pale nuns hovered , soft-voiced , murmuring prayers for him , cool-fingered nurses brought unguents , and an intern fretted about smoke damage to his lungs . I left him in Emergency , walked home , blackened , barefoot , to pick up our phone , ask long-distance information to look up the numberand ring Joseph Sloan of Park Avenue , New York . Joe woke Celia , brought her , sounding drowsy , to the phone . I told her Hermanwas alive though in critical condition and I thought she should get here at once . She said she 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything till she arrived ; especially I was to make certain nobody removed anything whatsoever from the building . So peremptory was her tone , I neglected to tell her there was no longer any building . I pulled on shirt , pants , shoes , hooked on my spectacles , and ran back to the fire . The water flow was still inadequate and the firemen , judiciously , had chosen to spread what there was around , not on , to keep the fire from spreading . Up and down Sixth Street , families were lugging out valises , just in case , and lining the curb to watch , coughing , fanning away drifting smoke . I saw my mother in kimono , wringing her hands , weeping , and I went to her . She clutched my wrists . " Herman ! Will he live ? " She paused , sighing . " What 's he got to live for ? " " Good question , Mama . I 'll think about it when I get a chance . " Until daybreak , I stood watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then went back to St. Luke 's to check on Herman Weiss . He was still in Emergency , still in shock , but breathing . I went home , showered , scrubbed my feet , shaved , changed to clean clothing and before seven o'clock was in the newsroom , typing . The lead on my story was : " HermanWeiss , a long-time resident of Grady 's Mills , is in St. Luke 's Hospital , fighting for his life , after sustaining severe burns in a fire of mysterious origin which shortly before midnight destroyed his business building and residence . " 112FireA Cadillac pulled up before the smouldering ruin of 103 Sixth Street . A liveried chauffeur opened a rear door ; a golden-haired duchess stepped across the curb . Kids who 'd been tentatively poking rubble goggled and ran yelping , " Look ! Come ! See ! A Caddy ! " It took me several seconds to recognize Mrs. Joseph Sloan , nee Celia Weiss . She extended a white-gloved hand . " I expected to find you here , Samuel . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your father is alive , " I said . " We left at six A.M. , " she answered , " to avoid traffic . " " Come over to our house . Mama will make coffee . " " We stopped for breakfast . " She moved toward the ruin . " Why , there 's nothing left ! " she cried . We stood together in smoke-hazy sunshine , staring at the broken beams and crumpled window sashes , the blackened chimney , upright , with timbers jumbled at its base , the zinc bath tub , the toilet bowl , the web of tangled bedsprings . Our eyes were dripping , mine from acrid smoke , Celia 's , I had little doubt , from grief . " At least he was saved , " I said . " We 'll have to rake the ashes , " she replied . " Shall we go to him now ? " I asked . " Who 's guarding this ? " she answered . " He 's in St. Luke 's , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find them . We will try , " she said . I gripped her skinny shoulders . " Do n't you hear me , Celia ? " She exhaled with the kind of tired patience one uses on a stupid child . " Samuel , I know my father has been rescued . This you told me on the phone . And I came to him as quickly as I could . I113have n't slept a wink . However , I am not a doctor or a nurse . Therefore , I must take for granted St. Luke 's knows how to treat his burns . My problem  --  this , apparently , has n't occurred to you  --  is to make certain there 's no looting . There are valuables in here . " I held my temper . " That mess is still too hot to touch , " I managed to say . " Let 's get on over to the hospital . " The chauffeur drove us there . We talked little on the way . She asked , " He 's expected to recover , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She asked , " Did you phone my sister , too ? " I answered , " No , did you ? " " It was n't necessary , " Celia said . Sharp in tone and manner as in hip and collarbones , brittle , taut , straining in a vise of nervousness , and imperious , yet practical in small ways , she had the chauffeur stop at a florist 's , where she bought a dozen spicy pink and white carnations , and at Rogoff 's Market , where she purchased a basket of fruit . " The nurses will enjoy it , if he ca n't , " she said . " They expect these treats . " He was semiconscious , a mummy in reeking bandages , with slits for nostrils , mouth and eyes . She bent over , cooing , " Papa , Celia 's here . She 'll take care of everything , " walked away and crisply ordered a private room and special nurses , then , in clipped exasperation , turned on me . " Now , Samuel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arrange for guarding those premises . I am shocked that you neglected it . " " I 'll see to it , stop worrying , " I said . First , however , I had to get hack to the News-Record . Barry Neale had changed one word in my lead paragraph , substituting " undetermined " for " mysterious , " and I could not complain . A happening is not mysterious until its cause has been sought and has not been found . One of the other guys had collected the names of the fire laddies who responded and performed . I rewrote my story for our last edition , adding those names , the latest word on Herman'sphysical condition , and the fact that his daughter , Mrs. Joseph Sloan , had arrived from New York and was at her father 's bedside . Then I hiked over to Police Headquarters to ask a favor from the chief . Steve Durgin , portly and pompous , shirt-sleeves rolled high on his freckled , hairy arms , defunct cigar between his ecru teeth , waved me to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my nape . " Long time no see . Hear Barry has you on the courthouse beat . How come you 're chasm ' fire engines , Sam ? " " Good thing I did last night . " A big hand roweled his desk , groping for matches , while he frowned mildly . " How come last night ? " The tone of the question struck me as , You looking for trouble , Bud ? I pushed my paranoia back . " Dumb luck . If I had n't had insomnia , the old man might have roasted alive . " He found his cache of kitchen matches but kept me waiting while he struck one on the sole of a shoe , bit , spat out the moist end of his cigar and got the tobacco ignited . " Barry called me . Barry said you writ the fire was mysterious . Now will you kindly tell me why you writ it so . " Unquestionably , what had been discussed at Walter 's in the afternoon had made me choose that word . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I attempted to explain . " Mysterious things have been happening lately on the Hill . That fire in the synagogue .... " " Short circuit in the basement . " He rested the cigar on an ash tray 's lip . " Weiss had electricity , did n't he ? " No denying it , Weiss did . Durgin nodded , Q.E.D. " Same thing here . Yes ? No ? " He picked the cigar up for a reflective puff . " Or candles . You Hebes light candles , do you not ? " On Friday nights , Holy Days and Yahrzeits , I informed him , not on July Fourth . " Matches ? The old man could of lit a match , dropped it ? " " He did n't smoke ; he rarely cooked , " I said . Durgin shrugged . " Pokin ' around , huntin ' for somethin ' . " He cackled disagreeably . " Maybe countin ' up his miser 's gold . " No percentage in arguing with nastiness . I mentioned I 'd been sitting on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light in Herman 's building , up or down ; the old man surely was in bed , asleep . " Could of been a spark . Fireworks . Those old shanties , dry as bones . Fire hazards , every one . Ought to pull ' em down , clean the district out . " He parked his cigar and scraped his chair to the desk . Then , his gaze fixed on me , and in a tone unlike any I had , in a115long acquaintance , ever heard from him , he asked , " Sam , how much fire insurance did the old guy carry , would you know ? " I began to sweat . " Look , he damn near died . Would he have risked .... " " His business was on the skids , I hear . Now , you Hebes .... " " Speaking to me or about me ? " " Hold your piss , Sammy-boy , you and me always understood each other good . " I rose . " Chief , all I stopped by for was to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premises . Make sure there is no looting . A couple of honest men . " " That goes for the entire force , man and man , " he said . " The lady will appreciate it . " I turned to leave . " What lady ? " " The daughter , Mrs. Sloan . " He was slow on the uptake . The name stumped him for an instant . Came the dawn , possibly out of wedding and birth announcementsthat Rosenbaum had written for the News-Record 's " Folk You Know . " " Shlumpowitch ! The guy that beat the rap ! " His belly shook . " Shlumpowitch-Sloan ! " he roared . " What do you know ! " I had pulled a boner . " Shlumpowitz here , too ? " His amusement was abating ; his expressionchanging to downright ugliness . " She came alone . To look after her father . " " Awful quick . Who sent for her ? " I backed away from that one , too . " One of the old neighbors must have gotten in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where 's Shlumpowitches living nowadays ? " A sneaky shift of glance from inc to his desk inkstand made his intention clear : record a certain address for hanky-panky at some future date . " I have n't got the least idea , " I said . " In a pig 's eye , " he said . I moved toward the door . " Wonder what happened to the kid . Must be a big boy now . " His eyes narrowed , his tone became deceptively tender . " Poor little orphin kid . Be a kindness if somebody was to let him know116he had a living papa . Rich . You would n't know where the kid 's at , would you , Sam ? " Now , surely Durgin had heard about St. Michael 's taking little Jody in ; he had enough contacts in the Flats to keep him well informed . Was he trying to drag me back into that mess to do for him what he , in his position , did n't dare to do direct ? Straightfaced , I answered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the kid . Let sleeping dogs lie , I said . His wagging index finger chided me . " We let ' em off the hook too cheap . Rich kikes . Immoral . You want to know why people hate the Jewish people ? There 's your answer : Shlumpowitch . " I walked over to the courthouse , thinking , Walter knows the score : start with Durgin , s.o.b . Grade A ; thinking , Durgin would n't dare ; thinking , you bet Durgin would . Rosenbaum , keep your nose clean . If possible . The sun was no longer blazing directly overhead and the damp rubble had stopped smoking when Celia and the Cadillac again appeared on Sixth Street . The chauffeur removed his jacket , rolled his shirt-sleeves up and carried a new rake and shovel from the car . Two cops and a gaggle of urchins watched him yank away springs , iron scales , the head of the old brass bed , iron barrel hoops , dented pipes , scorched metal bins , and commence to rake ashes . Before darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid in front of Celia 's patent leather pumps  --  Herman 's upper dentures , one brass candlestick , several small tin chests of Wisotsky'stea , and a few blackened coins . The kids pressed forward , scenting treasure trove . A policeman drove them hack . Celia rubbed her swollen eyes . " We 'll start earlier tomorrow . It has to be in there . " " Celia , what 's so urgent ? " " Are you stupid ? Do n't you realize ? Mama 's diamonds . " She climbed into the car . " I tried to ask Papa . They have him all doped up . I do n't know if he heard one word I asked . " She gave the chauffeur Sylvia 's address and suggested that I join her there after supper . " Sylvia has kindly offered me her hospitality , " she said . After the car had rolled away , I wigwagged the cops , gave each117of them a five-dollar bill and said I knew they 'd guard these ruins well . " What the old Jew have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diamond joolery ? " Mama had cold borsht and canned salmon salad waiting . " You ate today , Semmy ? I betcha not . Catch a dremmel first , your eyes is red like fire . " She told me everybody had been phoning everybody , saying Herman had a fortune stashed away in the building , and she said it with such certainty 1 half believed it , too . She also said Sophie Rogoff told her Hymic said sure and positive I 'd get a Carnegie 's medal for saving Herman Weiss . I did n't feel heroic when I left for Sylvia 's . I felt beat . Necessity , however , primes the pump . I owed Celia the facts preceding the fire ; I owed Walter the follow-up to the conference he and I had had . I looked forward to a tote-a-tete on the cool back porch . I found a crowded living room . The Katzes and the Rogoffs  --  young and old  --  were there to see Celia and to offer sympathyand , in addition , the Brookfield Heights rabbi and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans were spinning , making little headway against the stultifying heat . Celia , in a blue chiffon negligee , drooped in a chintz-covered chair . Sylvia was pouring iced tea , cousin Ruthie passing cookies , Carol Frances and Harold , in pajamas , were watching from a doorway , and Walter , in the grand piano 's curve , was holding forth . He frowned at me ; my entrance had derailed his speech . Several people nodded brusquely . Only Cousin Ruthie looked enthusiastic . I leaned against the wall near the door and hugged Carol Frances to my hip . " Ugh , you smell smoky , " she muttered and jerked away from me . The refugee doctor edged toward me . " I was yesterday to your parents ' house . I wished to speak with you . " I crossed my lips with two fingers because Walter was scowling . " Please , Sam ! " He clapped his hands for silence and attention . " Now , as I was saying , we need to consider this not as an isolated incident but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hungarian shul  --  " Sol Katz , a sober citizen , broke in . " The insurance undenvriters said short circuit . " Walter raised his palm . " Okay , we accepted that verdict . What118choice did we have ? But about Aaron 's grave there could n't be . Celia 's golden head jerked up . " What about Aaron 's grave ? " " A swastika was painted on the stone , " Walter told her . The refugee doctor panted asthmatically . " Chust like Cher-many . " " Aaron was the sweetest boy , " Sylvia explained to the rabbi 's wife . " Handsome as a movie star . And waltzed like a dream . He and I , you know  --  " She sighed , nostalgically . " That was before Walter 's family moved to town . . . . " " Mama 's grave , " Celia interrupted tartly . " Is that one okay ? " And added with surprising coolness , " I 'd best make sure the plot next to it is available . " Mrs. Rogoff gaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And be well to a hundred years , " Mrs. Katz added . " American doctors , " the refugee said . " Who can expect  --  " " Who would on purpose burn up an old man ? " Mrs. Rogoff demanded . " To who did he do harm ? " Cousin Ruthie squirmed to my side . " May I have the privilege of serving you iced tea ? " Walter clapped again . " As I have been trying to explain to Celia , we have had these several incidents . The stone in the Litvak shul was certainly no accident . " " My grandson , Bobby , he should live and be well ! " Mrs. Rogoff cried . " Like Chermany ! " the doctor wheezed . " Max Slomowitz . " Mrs. Katz spoke up . " His place of business was broke in . That gave him the heart trouble . " " Father Sloan retired , " Celia said wearily . " He wished to relax in his later years . " " Do n't fool yourself . " Mrs. Katz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in peace , she herself told me Max was scared , they made him sick to get a heart attack . " " Who 's they ? " Irwin Katz put in . " There were n't any Nazis , not even in Germany , the year Max retired . " Walter cleared his throat peremptorily and spread his upraised arms , begging for silence . " You were not invited here tonight to decide why Max moved to Miami . Celia knows why , I am sure. 119She 's had enough heartaches today without us upsetting her with this . What we 're here for is to try and find an answer to our problem . What to do and how we get started . Now , I do have some plans . A couple of people in this room know what they are and I hope and trust they will keep mum because premature publicitycould spoil the proposition . And , anyway , what I had in mind is a long-range proposition . What we 're concerned with is tonight , tomorrow , the day after . Who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " His voice  --  enunciation , use of dramaticpauses  --  was excellent . Frustrated actor is as good as any reason for wanting to own a radio station . " What we 've got in Grady 's Mills is Germany in miniachoor . A nest of anti-Semite Nazi rats , and God alone knows in which sewers they are hiding , and getting bolder every day . One day they paint a swastika on a Jewish hero 's grave ; next day they throw a stone into a shul . And in the middle of the night , a night sacred to independence , to freedom and democracy , they set fire to a Jewish home and businessplace . What is next ? Who is next ? What are we waiting for ? Pogroms ? " He stopped . The murmur of fear swept the room . The rabbi cleared his throat and stepped toward the grand piano 's curve , to seize a chance to speak . Walter ignored him . His arm swung in my direction . " Sang , what steps do we take ? Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack , you 're with your own . How about , for instance , a stinging editorial in the News-Record ? " It would n't be easy for me to persuade Barry Neale to publish one , I told them . I was just a working stiff . A big advertiser like Katz or Rogoff might impress him more . Or better yet , a Goy , some prominent Rotary or Kiwanis member . Walter , Sol , would know the proper individual . In any case , the type of hoodlums who perpetrated acts of vandalism like these would n't give a hoot for editorials ; probably they could n't even read . Yet since my advice had been asked , I felt I ought to warn them that it was rash to conclude that the fire was arson . Unfounded accusations often boomerang . Then , being overtired , I let myself , for the second time that day , be indiscreet . I indicated what I meant by boomerang : Chief Durgin had hinted Herman Weiss might have set the fire himself to collect insurance. 120The room exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief ! " " The lousy anti-Semite ! " " The momser ! " " Sam ! " Walter 's voice soared above the shouts and mutters . " Get that man fired at once . " I glanced at the diamonds on Celia 's left hand . " It 's not advisable , " I said . They converged on me , they pressed me to the wall , they yanked my sleeves , my tie , they pounded on my chest . Cousin Ruthie lost her head and spilled the plate of cookies on my shoes . " Coward ! Traitor ! " Irwin Katz shook his fist at me . The doctor squeezed his suet cheeks between his palms and moaned , " Like Chermany . Our leaders said keep quiet . " What am I , folks , hero or yellow-belly ? Make up your minds . If not for me Herman might have burned up with his grocery . And , also , friends and neighbors , if not for me , Joe Slomowitz might be crawling from the penitentiary today , not living on plush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that s.o.b . at headquartersis dangerous , but not how you all think . I heard Celia 's dulcet voice . " I wish Joseph could be here . He 'd show you an example of a Jew who 's not afraid . " ( My jaw sagged . ) " Joseph is on a committee with the most important Jewish leaders in New York . They have engaged Madison Square Garden , the largest auditorium in New York , to hold a mass meeting . To demand our government do something against the antiSemitismin Germany . In September , right after Labor I ) ay , when people are back from vacation . " And how many fresh atrocities between July and when people get back from vacation ? Do n't be cynical . A Garden-ful of people , hearing speeches , might accomplish more than one Sam Rosenbaum bucking one Barry Neale and one Steve Durgin in Grady 's Mills . The room was hushed , all attention on the slender figure in chiffon who personified the valor of New York 's important Jewishleadership . There will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your hopes , Yiddin . " Though I shall be busy preparing for Yom Tov "  --  at last the rabbi had his chance to speak  --  " I should like to attend that meeting . Perhaps the Brookfield Heights congregation would send me121as its delegate . I could bring them a report on our local problems and obtain the best advice of the New York leadership . " Walter frowned . He had no intention of letting this one get away from him . " We 'll appoint a delegation , " he decided . " I 'll take my car ; we 'll drive together . Rabbi ? Okay . Sol Katz ? Okay . " He looked in my direction . " And Sam ? If he 's not afraid to ask his boss to give him one day off . It 'll do him good to meet some Jews with guts . " I wanted to protest the attack on my character but I was too exhausted and too disgusted with myself . Through force of circumstanceand an unguarded tongue , I 'd muffed a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , since I had already said too much , I nodded sure , okay , at Walter and stepped over to Celia 's chair to ask what she planned to do about Herman , assuming he 'd survive . " Why , I 'll remain with him this week . Fortunately , Ilene is at camp . Then , as soon as he is able to be moved , I 'll take him home , to me . I 'm quite certain he wo n't wish to live here after this . " Mrs. Katz and Mrs. Rogoff exchanged humpfs . " Why not ? " Mrs. Rogoff wished to know . " I ! ere is all his friends . " " What about Jessie ? " I ventured . " I presume I shall have to let her know . . . if Papa passes on . " " God forbid ! " Mrs. Katz and Mrs. Rogoff cried . The Rogoffs , living on the 1 till , offered to drive me home in the new Hudson . I was grateful for the lift . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " l-lvniic said . " We organized a committee . Next step is to start raising funds . " " What for ? " I asked . He paused . I must have made him wonder what for , too . " Why , for expenses , " he said finally . " That 's how it 's done , is n't it ? " Celia sent her car and chauffeur to New York  --  Joe had said he needed the car  --  and settled in at Sylvia 's . Walter loaned her a porter from the work force in his mill . The man , catching the sporting nature of a treasure hunt , worked uncomplainingly in the122hot sun , raking debris , and , using old screen doors , he sifted ashes painstakingly . Each evening one of Walter 's trucks carted the accumulated junk over to Walter 's garage in Brookfield Heights . Durgin 's honest cops shooed the kids away . Mornings , Celia stood beside the ruin , supervising . Afternoons , she sat near Herman 's bed , digging in another way , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins , Ida 's other candlestick , her blackened knives , forks and spoons , Herman 's watch chain and his watch. , crystal missing , but no diamond jewelry . " Papa remembers nothing , " she complained to me . " Not even where 's his fire insurance policy , his bank books and the deed for the cemetery . " " Paper , " I reminded her , " burns first and fast . " " Diamonds do n't . I keep asking Papa where he put them ; they may be in a vault somewhere while I go crazy hunting in that mess . All I get from him is a mumble . I ca n't make out one word . Of course , without his teeth . . . . We did find his upper ; the lower must be there someplace . . . . Poor Papa ! I do hope his brain is not affected . That would make things very , very difficult for us . " Abruptly , she decided to return to New York . She phoned me at home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow 's 10 A.M. express ; she had just spoken with Joseph long distance ; he 'd reminded her she did have responsibilities in New York . So sorry she would n't have another chance to see me ; tonightshe had to pack  --  she was taking Mama 's candlesticks along to get them refinished ; let Papa decide , when he was able , what to do with the stuff in Walter 's garage . She 'd spoken to Dr. McGrath , the medical superintendent , told him she felt there was no point in her sitting like a dummy next to Papa 's bed . She had the fullest confidence in his doctors and nurses , angels of mercy , every one . And the nuns ! She 'd never dreamed nuns could be so sweet ; she 'd always been afraid of them ; sort of spooky , she had felt they were . She 'd explained to McGrath that if there was any change in Papa 's condition  --  for the worse , she meant  --  he was to notify her friend Mrs. Walter Leeds , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check for the room and specialnurses for this week . And bought candy for the nurses . Did I123think Whitman 's Sampler was nice enough ? And would the nuns expect some , too ? What was the protocol ? Oh , dear , it all had been so frustrating , so heartbreaking , she could hardly think straight any more . She talked so fast , so hysterically , I had no chance to ask whether the raking-sifting-guarding was to continue . Sylvia drove her to the depot and dropped in at the newsroom afterwards . " Ceil was so upset last night she forgot to tell you she appreciated all you 've done . But she wanted me to tell you she hopes you 'll come down in September with Walter 's delegation , and if you do , she wants you for dinner at their place . Specially to meet Ilene . She knows you will adore the child ; everybody does . What a heartache Ceil 's poor mother , may she rest in peace , never knew Ilene . But , Sam , such worries Celia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this accident , will it be safe to have him live with them ? Safe for Ilene , she means . That child is her whole life . Joe , I 'm sure you realize , was never Ceil 's intellectual equal . He 's  --  well , to put it mildly , crude . You ca n't make a silk purse  --  " " Out of a horse 's ass , " I said . " Shush ! I would n't exactly call a man who 's made a million dollars a horse 's ass , " she said . Barry Neale was glaring , outraged because our conversation was too low-toned for him to eavesdrop on , so I walked Sylvia out to the hall , where she reminded me that Ruthie would be around another week and I was not to take to heart Walter 's sarcasmthe other night ; he was overwrought , carried away , he 's good as gold at heart , as by now I ought to know , he 'd give me his last shirt , and I was always more than welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I 'd been completely honest with that crowd , and modest too , admitting I was n't importantenough to get Chief Durgin fired ... . " Or free Tom Mooney , " I managed to put in . She gave me a look  --  " Do n't you worry about Goyim . Take care of your own "  --  glanced over her shoulder at the ogre behind the city desk and faked a slight shudder . I asked whether Celia had left any message about continuing the treasure hunt . " She said forget it . She realized she 'd just been making a fool of124herself ; no doubt Jessie 's had the jewelry all the time . And anyway , all she accomplished was raking up old bitterness . But it was n't the monetary value , it was the principle . It was her right and privilege to protect her inheritance . She is the oldest , is n't she ? " That evening at supper my mother asked me did I have any idea of what Police Chief Durgin had talked to Celia about yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car pull up , Durginlean out and summon Celia from the sidewalk to his running board . Naturally , Mama could n't hear what was being said , but she noticed Celia got red in the face and acted very nervous . He would n't dare , I thought . Oh , would n't he ? The bastards are in the saddle , riding high . And we 're running circles , scared . At the end of the week , Herman was wheeled into a ward and the special nurses taken off the case . The women on the Hill cooked chicken soup , took turns carrying it to St. Luke 's and trying to cheer Herman up . He still was n't talking , they reported , not even with his God . A couple of junkmen from the Flats started to scavenge in the ruins , carting away pipes and plumbing fixtures that might bring a buck or so . This , when you came to think of it , was how the Slomowitz fortune had begun . Curious how the wheel turns , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I received a phone call in the newsroom . " Sam ? This is Jessie Weiss . " " Oh , hello ! When did you arrive ? " " Just now . And a goddam shlep ! The Super-Chief was late . Missed connections in Chicago . Century would n't wait . Missed connections in New York . " She sounded hoarse and tired . " Why in hell did n't you wire me about Papa ? " " Did I have your address ? " " Call yourself a newspaperman ? You could have found out where I was . I presume that takes initiative and a little brains . " Here we go again . Have n't seen her in a decade . She re-enters swinging from the lip . " Listen , Jessie Weiss , you do have a sister .... " 125 " Who took her good-natured time sending me a telegram . Night letter , twenty-five words for two bits , fifteen bawling the kid sister out for lack of filial devotion . Had to phone transcontinental to find out what was up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Cut that out . You make me sound like a buzzard . " " Nope , she beat you to it . " " What in hell are you batting about ? " " Skip it . Where are you now ? " " The Hiram Grady . Room six-twenty-one . A slum . Listen , I 'm going to use the john , wash my face , grab a taxi to St. Luke 's . Would it be too much to ask  --  I hate to impose on an important journalist , but my local friends are few and far between  --  for you to meet me here , in the bar at nine r.M. ? " The jury in a vehicle homicide case dawdled over dinner , their last free feed at county expense . It was eight before they brought their verdict in , nine before my story was typed up , ten past when I reached the Grady . That barroom is a cavern , dim , dank and beery-smelling . It was practically deserted ; the important drinking here is done daytimes by downtown businessmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar with the waiter and the bartender , who raised his eyebrows , seeing me . News-Record reporters seldompatronized the place , it being overpriced for us . In a booth at the far end , under a whirring ceiling fan , Jessie sat , an empty shot glass , an overflowing ash tray on the table before her , dark head and horn-rimmed spectacles bowed above a scratch pad on which she was scribbling . I slid onto the leatherette seat opposite . She did not look up . Her face muscles were sagging ; her complexionwas ghastly . She looked so heat 1 almost pitied her . I reached across and laid my hand on hers that held the fountain pen . " Turned any handsprings lately ? " Her lashes fluttered . " Oh , hello ! Give me another second , will you ? I have to put down everything . " I dumped a cigarette from my pack , smoking while she scribbled , gnawing at her lower lip , until with " That is it , " she capped the fountain pen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Louse . " She removed her spectacles , folded them inside a leather case , dropped case , pen and pad into an alligator handbag and clicked it shut , decisively . " A list , " she informed me . " Things to check up on . Did Papa have fire insurance ? Life insurance ? With which companies ? Bank accounts ? Where ? How much ? Deed for the property . Is there a mortgage ? Are the taxes up to date ? Deed for the cemetery plot . When was he born ? Where ? When naturalized ? All kinds of documents need personal data . Do you realize every scrap of paper was burned up ? Even "  --  she forced a smile  --  " my magnificent report cards . " She thrust the handbag from her and braced her spine against the seat back . " What 's your beverage ? " " Beer , " I said . She tapped the shot glass  --  " Make it Scotch . Do n't be stingy with my money "  --  craned her neck and snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drummers at the bar . She ordered Scotch , double , for herself , no ice , water chaser . I still preferred the beer . " And bring me the check , " she told the waiter firmly . He gave me a funny look . Women do n't buy drinks for men in Grady 's Mills . " Do n't argue , " she told me . " I 'm too bushed to fight . " And sighed . " Such a vast United States ! Three days , three nights , on wheels . " " How 'd you find your father ? " " Groggy , weak , depressed . Cheered up , I think , when he realizeddaughter Jessie had arrived . I believe the old man likes me , Sam . And why 's he in that noisome ward ? " " He had a private room while Celia was in town . " " Why did n't she leave him there ? Christ ! My darling sister 's husband has two dollars more than God . " The waiter brought our drinks . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I reached for my wallet . Jessie gripped my wrist . " I pay for my guests . " She scrawled her name and room number on the tab , tossed a dollar from her alligator satchel on the tray . The waiter beamed . Grady 's Mills tippers were strictly ten per cent . She flung the whisky down her throat , not wincing at its bite , and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand , muttering , " Lebensmittel . " This it must have been for her ; her eyes began127to come alive . " Dr. McGrath made noises about skin grafts , " she went on to say . " I said daughter Jessie would provide . Flesh of his flesh . " " Could your father talk to you ? " She shook her head . " He tried . He mumbles so . No teeth . Bandages . And weak . He 's badly burned , you know . Lies there , silent , thinking . And who 's smart enough to fathom an old man 's thoughts . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old is he , do you know ? " I asked . She set down the tumbler . " Fifty , sixty , seventy , who knows ? " She raised her head and forced a smile . " Well , Sam , Lear 's earthly kingdom 's gone . What do we do now ? " Not my problem , not my show . " Play Cordelia , " I said . " Not this bitch . " Her headshake was sharp , final . " She has n't even got a home to bring him to . Moves from sublet to sublet ... . Okay , suppose I try to set up a home for him . What would Papa do in Hollywood ? Can you picture I Lerman Weiss in Schwab 's ? " I wanted very much to ask her how one lived , what one did out there , pick up a few crumbs of inside information , but she was galloping ahead , preoccupied with misgivings , observations . " I do n't know my father ; he does not know me . Which child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody ? " She groped for my cigarette pack . I lighted one for her . She took a long , hard pull , then held it between her fingers , waving smoke . " Sam , all the way across the continent , I kept thinking about my father : who is he , what is he ? I need to know so I can help him best . Do n't look so skeptical . I love my old utan even if I have n't sucked around the grocery . Well , we rode across New Mexico . I thought , This is Papa , stark , craggy , lonely , aged , ageless . Old tribe . Like the Indians . Scratching a bare living out of hostile soil . Well , we went through Colorado . Grandeur . By God , that is Papa , too . Then Iowa . . . . " She smiled . " Iowa is soft and lush and very , very beautiful . No kidding , Sam , it is . And Iowa reminded me of Mama 's great big bosom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa , too . The richness in the soil . So what does it produce ? Corn and hogs . Sister Celia and myself . Guess which is which . " A sassy grin alighted on her mouth . It flew away . Somberly , she said , 128 " What lonely hell it must have been for him , deserted by his womenfolk . " " Did you have to ? " I drained the lees of my beer . " Little birdies leave the nest . " Lifted eyelids , gray eyes probing , for the first time this evening seeming altogether aware of me , as me . " And why have n't you ? " " I like the nest , " I said . The impish smile brightened her tired face again . " You would n't lie to me ? Want another beer ? . . . Do I want another Scotch ? " Her voice was almost gone . A woman is not made of iron ; three days , three nights on wheels . " Nope . Enough 's enough . Just tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I half caught it from my sister 's stingy narrative , you were a sort of hero . True or false ? " " Half true , " I said . " I turned in the alarm ; the fire chief smashed the door . " Her hand stretched across the table , covering mine . " Thanks , Sir Shmulke Galahad . " The touch , the name , the recollection , made me wary . I drew my hand away . She did n't seem to notice . Her forehead wrinkled . " Tell me something else . This afternoon Papa said something I could n't quite make out . Sounded like tickets burn , ' and he tried to point to his left hand . Tickets for where , for what ? Do you figure he was trying to go away , possiblyto me ? Was there something in his hand ? " " When he came down the steps his hand was like a torch . " She turned slightly more pale , more tense . Her shoulders drew together . " No more tonight . Details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to share a drink with somebody who gives a damn . It 's horrible to feel an alien , an outlaw , in your own home town . Sam , that 's what happens to me here . " She hung the alligator satchel on her arm . " Could you meet me here same time tomorrow ? I 'll be occupied all day . " " If it 's raking ashes , you 're too late . The ghouls have cleaned the premises . " Her heavy eyebrows arched , questioning . " No , looking after Papa and my list . " Hands ' heels on the table , she pulled herself erect . So many years had gone by since I 'd last seen Jessie Weiss I had forgotten she was short . The way she talked , tough and authori-129tative , gave one the impression of tallness . She slid out from behind the table and tilted up her face . " Sam , do one thing more for me , " she said with a quiet urgency . " Put your arms around me , hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not mind too much , kiss me , will you , kid ? " I held her and I kissed her , blushing hot , and that was not because the bartender was leering but because kissing her had not occurred to me . A man takes the initiative ; a shlemiel waits to be asked . Her mouth was warm and sweet , her small , plump body inviting . " Thanks , pal , " she said huskily . " Thank you very much . " We walked out together and in the lobby stood a moment , surrounded by the cracked , black leather chairs , the dusty potted palms and brass spittoons , tongue-tied , both of us , yet keenly aware of what we wanted , each of us , and what , having known each other all our lives , we would n't get . She mumbled , " G'night . " I said , " Try to get some sleep . " ' That was it . That was all of it . I went out into the empty downtown street . We have 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sidewalks at half past . I climbed Market Street wondering why I did n't try to go to bed with Jessie Weiss . She was in the mood , not passionate but with another sort of need , for the comfort of a man 's embrace . And this was a woman who might be great in bed . She had warmth and wit as well as sensuality . Strange , I can not treat her like a woman . Wisecrack only , kid around , before she makes a nothing out of me . That 's it . She frightens me . I Icr bark and bite , her brashness , she wears it like a sandwich board . And why ? To cover up a loneliness ? To deny an ache for love so painful she 's ashamed of it ? Well , one thing is for sure , she 's selling herself short . She could be lovable if she half tried . The mouth is soft , the body yields . Be honest , Sam , could you love Jessie Weiss ? Be honest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , since she was twelve years old . But she ? She needs , she takes . Then cuts me down to size . Tomorrow is another night . What will be will be . For God sakes , Sam , do n't be afraid . Jessie Weiss is Herman 's daughter , Ida 's daughter , a kid from the Hill , she 's not Mrs. Jesus Christ. 130She was waiting for me in the barroom . Her lipstick was on , her eyes clear and bright . She greeted me with a brusque nod , no pathos , weariness , or even personal interest . We both ordered beer . While we waited for the beer , she told me she had had her father moved to a corner room where , propped , he could glimpse trees and petunia beds , and she 'd engaged private nurses , one of them a buxom , cheerful young woman who 'd been in her class at high school . Between them , they 'd coaxed Herman to sip chicken broth through a straw . " A Mrs. Rosenbaum brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brew , no ? " The waiter set the foaming schooners down . She let me pay . She drank , not speaking till the register had rung my money up . " Okay , Sam , now give me all of it . Before , during , afterwards . " She let me talk , no interruptions whatsoever , and she listened with a concentration , as though memorizing every word , while I told her about the other fire , the tombstone desecration , the stoning , the spikes in Walter 's tires , the conversation he and I had had on Independence Day , and how Durgin had acted when I came to ask him for the guards . Obviously , I had to tell her why I 'd made that request , and when she heard how Celia 'd rummaged in the ashes , she muttered , " Buzzard , get you , " and wrinkled her brow  --  " But does n't Celia have the diamonds ? Vaguely , I remember she mentioned them to Papa when we were here , after Mama died "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indignation meeting in Walter 's living room . " Seriously , Sam , not off the top of your head , do you honestly believe that fire was arson , deliberate incendiarism ? " I hedged . " Might be . Suspicion is n't proof . " " But why ? What 's to gain for whom by burning a run-down Jewish grocery store ? By trying to kill an old Jew who never harmed a living soul ? " " Jessie , anti-Semitism has no rhyme or reason , you know that . It 's a disease , in the blood stream , in the bones . A senseless hate that started way , way back . Maybe when Abraham smashed the idols . Maybe when a certain Jew was nailed to a cross . " I leaned across the table , lowering my voice . " Jessie , there are cesspools in this town , as in most small towns ; there have always been  --  you know this , too  --  kids who learned it with their Catechism , ignorant131people , snobbish people , who hated Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dig them out because they 're his people . And do not ask me how I know . " Her expression did not alter , and it occurred to me she might have stopped listening . All she said was " I think I 'll hang around " with a peculiar glitter in her eyes , and I got the queerest feeling that Jessie was no longer across a table from me in the Grady bar but had wandered off into a private world . I waited , not speaking , for her to return . I prompted , saying , " Well , I 'll say good night . " " Good night . " She did n't rise or tip her face for a kiss or indicateanything except that she had nothing more to say or hear . I plodded up the hill , alone , nonplussed . She remained in Grady 's Mills a month . What she did I got in bits and pieces from individuals she went to see and , sporadically , from her by phone and accidental meeting . We had no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each of the local banks , introduced herself to the manager , said since all her father 's papers had been consumed in a fire , she needed to discover where he had accounts and how much were the balances . I-Ic had a savings account , consisting entirelyof deposits of the Chanukah gift checks she had sent , and a business checking account with a miniscule balance from which he paid his wholesalers . She called on the insurance agencies , found one with a record of a five-thousand-dollar straight-life policy , paid up , of which she and Celia were equal beneficiaries . The policyprovided for disability payments which might cover part of his hospital expenses . She also learned he had had fire insurance until the policy lapsed a year ago because he had n't paid the premiums . She was businesslike and thorough . She obtained photostatsof everything . She carried the photostat of the cancelled fire insurance policy when she called on Fire Chief Jones and Police Chief Durgin . Jack was flattered by her visit  --  he called me up to tell me so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what he 'd done to save Herman . He protested , as was seemly , that a man expects no thanks for doing what 's his duty , but he became uneasy when she commenced to quiz him on whether he 'd smelled kerosene around132the premises , or found suspicious footprints near the building , or noticed any other circumstances that might hint at arson . " You see , " Jessie explained , " I have to do the investigator 's job , since no insurance company is involved . Unfortunately , Dad let his policy lapse . " She brought out the photostat . " Getting old , maybe absent-minded , forgot to pay the premium . " " Absent-minded , eh ? Maybe he forgot he left a candle burning . You folks light them for religion , do n't you ? " " On certain occasions . July Fourth is not one . " Then , pretendingcasualness , she added , " It is a bit mysterious , no ? Like that fire in the synagogue . " " That was short circuit , ma'am , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved your father , " was all he said after that . Durgin got a similar routine . " Chief , I 'm Jessie Weiss of Hollywood . Came all the way from California to look after my dad . Thought I should stop by and thank you for those officers who guarded my father 's property . Too bad there was nothing left to guard . A total loss . " On his desk , too , she dropped the photostat . He glanced at it and Jessie said ( I hope she told the truth ) he blushed while he scowled . The scowl may well have been because , uninvited , she 'd pre-empted the chair beside his desk . " I 'm sure you 're making a careful investigation , " she purred . " You 'd not be in your present high position if you were n't a conscientious lawand-orderman . Some people do suspect there may have been a robbery , before , and the fire set to cover it up . And others have been hinting that it might have been arson , malicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you will agree . It would be important , would n't it , to discover whether the town had a gang of dangerous criminals ? There have been other incidents , I 've been told . " " By whom ? " Durgin growled . " Why it 's an open secret , Chief . For instance , when a hero'sgrave is desecrated , just because he is a Jew .... " She had him where the hair was short . Therefore , he turned bellicose . " Miss , do n't go fishing for trouble , do n't go stirring dirty water up . You look for trouble , you find trouble , more'n you expect . " " Like what , Chief ? " 133 " Excuse me , miss , I 'm a busy man , " Durgin said . He phoned me . His call was a warning . " You tell that dame lay off , mind her own business . She goes too far , she 'll be sorry , Sam . " I got her version of these visits on the courthouse steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I going in . While we sat broiling in the noonday sun , facing the Victory monument , the bronze doughboy , lunging with his bayonet , atop a granite pedestal that bore a tablet that had the names of Aaron Leiberman , Hyman Rogoff and Samuel Rosenbaum , Jessie told me , " Both monkeys were so cagey . Hear no evil , see no evil , speak no evil , when the evil stinks to high heaven . " " What in hell are you up to ? " " Research . And believe me it is like pulling teeth . The town is run by idiots . Take a f'rinstance . I have just spent two hours and twenty minutes in this building , merely trying to get copies of the deed , mortgage and tax record of my father 's piece of property  --  Godhelp the ignorant and timid who come seeking informationhere ! Well , there 's no mortgage , the lot is free and clear , taxes up to date . Papa was a conscientious citizen . Lot might be worth a couple hundred after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life insurance , sell the lot , Papa will have something to start over with . " She paused , staring at the monument in silence , before she said , low and thoughtfully , " If he wants to , if he can . Not an easy thing . " She rose , dusting her skirt with her hands . " Aaron has a gold star , " she murmured , irrelevantly . " You just went along for the ride , did n't you ? " " Go to hell , " I said . " Not today , " she said . " I have an appointment at St. Luke 's . " She went horizontal there that afternoon . Her epidermis was flensed and strips transferred to l-lcrman 's back . I heard about the skin graft from Dick Adams of our staff , who had St. Luke 's on his beat . " No visitors " was on her door , he said . I stopped at a florist 's , before I went to crash the harrier , and had a hard time deciding what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers . We boys memorized it when we began to take girls to the high school dances : red for passion , white for purity , yellow for friendship , pink for sweet sixteen and women in childbed . Mabel Armbruster , of dim memory , had made it easy ; she adored tea roses . What do134you bring a Jessie Weiss ? Thistles or cactus ? When the clerk began to show impatience , I said , " Okay , carnations , white ones with red stripes . " " Perfect for a hospital , " the florist said . " The refreshing whiff of spice . " Through a closed door , I heard laughter and Jessie 's husky voice . Diffidently , I opened the door . The patient lay propped on her side , a covey of nuns and nurses clustered around her bed , giggling , while she parceled out tidbits about the private lives of Mary Pickford , Douglas Fairbanks , Gloria Swanson , Shirley Ternpleand Rin-Tin-Tin . I stood listening , interested , too , until a nurse spotted me and began to shoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved from the bed . " Fancy meeting you . " Reluctantly , with swishings of starched frocks , rustlings of habits , the audience fled . A nurse snatched my bouquet for watering . " How 's our heroine ? " I asked the patient . " Anyone I know ? " " It was big of you , doing this for your father . " She reached back to her upraised buttock . " Plenty more where that came from . " " What made you do it ? " " Foolish question . " " How do you feel ? " " Healthy . " Her gray eyes focused on my face , intent and disconcerting . I labored to make small talk , about Herman 's physical condition , the continuing heat wave , the surprising , charming gayety of the nuns . She answered with monosyllabic grunts and the intense stare . " Would you rather I did n't stay ? " " Up to you . " " Just stopped by for a minute , have to get back to the office . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers . " " A friendly gesture , " Jessie said . I did n't return to St. Luke 's . The rest of what she did in town I know chiefly secondhand . Dr. McGrath , the medical superintendent , was quite taken with her . He brought his wife around to meet her . They invited her to135dinner at their house , a landmark event , since no Jew , male or female , had , to my knowledge , been a guest of the McGraths . The social ice having been broken , Mrs. Roger Burton Harper , presidentof Sorosis , our ladies ' literary society , decided to give a tea for her at the Hilldale Country Club . That , truly , was a crashing of the barriers . I wanted to cover the party but Barry sent our societyreporter , and it was from " Folk You Know " I learned that Miss Jessica White , formerly of this city , now a Hollywood screenwriter , had given a delightful talk about personalities in the motion picture colony , after which cheese and olive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been served , and that " Miss White , who is petite , dark-haired and grayeyed , was becomingly gowned in a summer suit of oyster-white raw silk , with exotic garnet jewelry . " When I stopped in at the library that evening to exchange my books , Miss Ehling , our librarian , said wistfully , " I wish it was n't summer and so hot in the building . I 'd love to have a reception here for Miss White . It is n't often Grady 's Mills entertains a real celebrity . " After she read the paper , Sylvia Leeds phoned Jessie at the Grady and said she 'd like to give her a small dinner party to meet some of our prominent Jewish people . She also asked would Jessie care to spend a few days convalescing at their cottage at the Lake . Jessie said  --  rudely , I have no doubt  --  her social calendar was filled . However , she did have lunch with Walter in the Grady dining room , where they discussed Adolf I litler , the grave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas . She also asked Walter if he 'd he good enough to make inquiries , through his parents and in-laws , for a modest kosher boarding house in the Catskills where 1lcrman might recuperate . She 'd phoned to suggest the meeting . Walter was delighted to oblige , though he was annoyed when she said , no , she 'd rather he did n't bring Sylvia along . He told me he 'd found her well-informed , intelligent , though stuck on herself , talking a blue streak , so that he could n't get a word in edgewise about radio broadcasting . Havingattended the Emerson College of Oratory and worked in Hollywood , she might have had a few ideas for his radio station . She brushed him off , too , when he asked what she wanted done136with the junk piled in his garage . " I did n't put it in ; I do n't propose to take it out , " she said . My mother wanted her for supper  --  so far , she had n't visited the Hill , not even to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thank you , no . When I left the Hill , I left for good . " " What 's the matter , we ai n't stylish enough ? " Mama grumbled , adding , with a belligerence worthy of Ida Weiss , " A Jewish antiSemitt , that 's the worst . " Done with the Hill and , from her silence and indifference , done also with Samuel Rosenbaum . On a Sunday morning , near the end of August , I heard the celebrity 's imperious voice over the telephone . " Sam , I 'm checking Papa out tomorrow . Taking him to the Catskills . I 've bought him everything he needs : shirts and socks and BVDs , a suit , a sweater , shoes . False teeth . Temporaries . But where in God 's name do I go to buy a tallith and tfillim ? " She chuckled , amused in advance by what she was about to say . " It never occurred to me people shop for these . Somehow , I felt Jews acquired them , like halos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest notion either of where to buy a tallith , and come to think of it I never had been curious . The narrow satin prayer scarf I wore on Holy Days had been bought for my Bar Mitzvah ; all my years I 'd worn no other one . Yet I was sure I knew where Herman 's tallith was and so I said , " I 'm surprised Herman does n't remember . " " Poor dear , he does n't remember much , " Jessie said . " I ca n't pull words out of him . " " I 'll bring it to the Grady , " I told her . After dinner , I walked over to the Litvak shul , to the queer , cozy , tiny building of yellow brick , dingied by time and factory soot , styled after memories of Lithuania , Poland , the Ukraine , an outside stone staircase leading to the wide oak doors , round eyes of colored glass , one blue , one red , above the door , a bronze Star of David on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were locked . I went around the sides and rear , trying knobs . One yielded to my turning . It let me into the Beth Hamedrash , the study hall , the long , bare room where sponge cake crumbs from yesterday 's Shabbos Sudah dappled a wine-stained cloth on the137trestle table . Books , bindings tattered , lay helter-skelter in a dusty sectional bookcase , out of Abe Finkel 's erstwhile den . I climbed upstairs , my shoe steps echoing in emptiness . I came into the big room . The descending sun had struck the colored windows , draining shafts of red and blue from them , lightingthe yellow varnished benches , playing on the fringes of the Bema 's purple velvet cover , skipping along the wooden doors that concealed the Scrolls , red-velvet-wrapped and silver-tipped ; skirtingthe steady , small Eternal Flame . Dust motes shimmered in the shafts of light . There was a touching beauty in the silent room . Silent , yet clamorous with hoarded sounds : the cadence of the ancient prayers , the wh000 of the ram 's horn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torah night , and Herman 's hoarse voice , reading from the Scrolls . Then , suddenly , the place was peopled with my friends : Isie Katz and Hymie Rogoff , Joey Slomowitz and Aaron Leiberman , jostling me on varnished benches . I was again a boy . The boy was part of this . It was awesome to stand alone here with my childhood . The prayer shawls hung on a chromium rack just inside the door , shawls of soft , creamy cloth  --  is it linen ? is it wool ?  --  blackbanded , fringed , and narrow satin scarves striped with blue or gray and tinsel-trimmed . Herman 's  --  this I remembered well , since I had seen it often  --  was a white with black , the shroud-imitating tallith . But which ? Oho ! it 's a cinch . On the shelf above the rod from which the prayer shawls hung , were the small sacks of phylacteries , a neat straight row , each sack in its designated place , above the owner 's tallith . I saw a purple velvet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's initials , exquisitely embroidered , by Celia 's golden hands , no doubt . The tallith directly underneath would be Herman 's . I took it down , folded it , draped it over my arm and tucked the velvet sack into my pocket . I turned to leave , turned back , and took my sweat-stained , sleazy satin tallith from the rod . I knew , not knowing why I was so sure , that I , too , was finished with the Litvak shul in the ghetto on the Hill . In the dismal hotel lobby of the dusty potted palms , cracked black leather chairs and brass spittoons , I handed over Herman 's tallith and tfillim . " Curious yet most fitting , " Jessie said . " This is138all my father has got left . " Then she said , " Excuse me , Sam , no time for a farewell drink . Packing , phone calls , stuff . We 're leavingearly . I 've hired a car and driver . " " Is n't Herman going to say goodbye to his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's another screwy thing . He does n't want to see a soul . Maybe I 'm a witch , but eppes tells me he 's ashamed to face his friends . But why ? Because his beard 's burned off ? " She rose on tiptoe to brush my cheek with a kiss . " Thanks for everything , " she said . " See you in church . " As before , I did n't try to hold her , claim her , and , as previously , she neglected to leave a forwarding address. **26;10242;TOOLONG on earth there is beautiful pleasure , truth , and connection ! " My favorite track , " said the boy in Levis , " is the one where he gets into the sitar stuff . " " Man , that 's a groovy track , " said the one with the extra beads and buckskin fringe , who was a girl . Al knocked . Ellen 's footsteps down the long hall . Her face creased in smiles and she welcomed him . " Oh darling , darling ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thebanana-belt ease of Sausalito . The door came open through welcoming routines . They checked the minute alterations in each other  --  anotherday alive . Ellen was almost breathless . " Darling , you ought to telephone so I can  --  " I told Jarod I might get over here . " " That monster , he never tells me anything . " The voice of Jarod accompanied its master down the long wooden hall : " I jes ' assume she 'll know . White folks have that intuitive power  --  " He lumbered toward them in shorts , the heavier brown of his face sleek with sun , a line of suntan showing above thep101neck of his white tee shirt . " Come on out . Take off your shoes . " The children , May and Sarah , pushed and tugged like puppies . Jarod took Al 's arm , led him to the refrigerator , poured lemonade for them both , poured gin in the lemonade , and they went onto the deck . There was a wet shape on the wicker chair where Jarod had soaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tan jes ' lak a wide man , deed ah doo . " Al gave him his War Criminal or Obedient GraduateStudent smile . Then Ellen laughed and Al reluctantlyjoined in the old joke , and the children laughed because everyone was laughing . Jarod lay back and shut his eyes into the setting sun . Slap-slap of water lapping at the barge . " Daylight savings , " Jarod said . " Lazyman 's time . " Jarod had earned his lazyman 's time . This season was an interval of gathering strength in a riding career . His papers and book , and then his smiling , coiled presence before committees and in private sessions , had served good use . The majority decision in a crucialSupreme Court rendering had cited his analysis of the effect of segregation on the psycho-social structure of black neighborhoods in both small towns and large cities , beginning with an acute comparison of the Negro ghetto with the two-way segregation of traditional European Jewish ghettos . The history of Judaism , with a separate culture , language , scriptures , and philosophical justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociology  --  to support family and personal egostructures ; the Negroes  --  blacks  --  broke down in preciselythe areas where the Jews drew renewed strength . It was a difficult analysis for a Negro ( black )  |p104taking  plates one at a time , chattering and clattering . May tripped , fell ; a plate bounced . " Melmac , " Ellen said . Jarod said , " These poor children are going through the latency period without ever learning that crockerybreaks  --  come here ! " He grabbed for the child , who shrieked with joy . He handed her a chicken hone and she sucked it eagerly  --  Daddy 's chicken hone . Jarod was in a high-riding mood ; he grinned , glistened , scrubbed his fist through his mat of hair . " One of my nigger days , " he said . He took his white wife , his partly white daughters , his friend , and his half-white self on a tour of the old repertory about how he was African and a headhunter and a Southern bastard who did n't know his father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural sense of rhythm , good at jiggling , shucking , and jiving . " Down , down boy , " he said to Al , and Al sat back hard . Al was thinking : They all turn me off , Milly , Sue Cody , Jarod , even Ellen in her own nice way , all of them ; and Jarod plays nothing but games . High as he seemed , Jarod found Al 's mood . He may not have cared , but the techniques of intelligenceground up the data in its peculiar fashion . He did not say , You 're depressed and anxious ; he did not say , You 're in trouble and worried ; he did not say , Rejectedby the service got you where it hurts , eh ? He took his time . He buttoned up the bleached , navyissueofficer 's shirt . He lit a small cigar . Blandly he watched the children running about on the planks , chasing toys up to the barge railing above the blackishwater . Reinforced chicken-wire kept them safe ;  |p105they  bounced off it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed ; Jarod waited for Ellen to call them ; he said nothing . The family was set to his pitch and the note was one they knew . " Come here , " said Jarod softly . " Here , kiss Daddy goodnight . " Sarah did . Then May . She threw her arms around him as if she were saying goodbye forever , sobbing . Sarah started to cry , too . " Oh , it 's just goodnight , " said Jarod , " oh , come on now . They both clung to him . He kissed them sweetly . " Tomorrow , I 'll see you tomorrow , that 's only a little ways off , " he said . Consoled to hear the journey towardsleep , they ran inside . Ellen was waiting at the door to take them . Jarod sighed . " I make them a little nervous sometimes , " he said . " They think I 'll go away . They think I 've gone  --  they feel all alone in this happy family . " A family anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look , pal , " Jarod said , " I 'm glad you made it out . But what 's the trouble ? " Ile waited for an answer . " Tell your friend and uncle , speak now . " Al was too slow . It was spinning in his head , but it only came out cherries . Jarod said , " Okay , makes no never-mind , pal "  --  and he began to sing one of his impromptu songs : " Every time of day or nightAh feel so good , Ah feel so rightCause somewhere , somehow , someplace , Black one or white racep106Despite Ah 'm lonely , despite Ah 'm blue , Some chick is turning twenty-two " Ha ! ha ! ha ! " came his braying laughter , and he looked down his hairy legs in sawed-off blue jeans , his feet in untied tennis shoes , and said , " He he he . Spittin ' de seeds on de groun ' . " He held his gaze at AT and said , " I got to talk with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is turning twenty-two , " and then shook his head angrily . " Kid , you do the footnotes just fine . I could make a little career stealing your stuff  --  improve my big career . We might could write a couple dozen papers together , and then I 'd reward you by making you a staffer at the N Double-A , or find you a job at Michiganor NYU , or maybe get you taken on at Health , Education , and Welfare , if they do n't turn out the rascals , but shee-it , man . You know ? " Al did not know , but something was implied . Wittgenstein , the Cambridge analysts , the logical positivists , and all the money from the travel agency in Santa Barbara had taught Al Dooley not to try to answer pseudo-questions . " Smart boy , " Jarod said approvingly to Al 's silence . Al would wait for explanations . In fact , his silence was more depressed than cunning , and Jarod knew it , and Al knew it , but still it was clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was full of little grunts and noises tonight ; jampacked . He swung around and put his head in thesocket of his hands . " I 'm worried about you , " he said . The confession waited in Al 's mouth like a host ofbees in a hive . Everything led to confession  --  loneli/ness , trust , male bragging , the history of talk between them . Al was waiting for something extraordinary  --  the exceptional decision ; he was waiting to find this decision within himself , the act unfolding , the ripe and luscious unfolding . And yet he did not speak it out , and across Jarod 's face came a disappointed frown . He looked both amused and angry . " Boy , for a fellowwho wants to confess terrible crimes , you sure do n't hold up your end of the conversation . " " There 's something in that Black Muslim study , " Al said with effort . Ahmad jamal , mumble-mumble . . . Moslem , Muslim , Malcolm , mumble . . . Mumble , movement , mumble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal grant  --  " Uh , Al heard himself actually talking . " . . . like to help . " He heard himself come to the end . " Maybe . " " Thanks , " Jarod said dryly . " That 's the enthusiasm of the vital young folks we been talking about . Get this country moving again . Thanks a lot . " " I mean it . A little tired tonight is all . " " Okay , " Jarod said . " Let me talk it up a little is all . Let 's say we expand the federal problem to include a study of Muslim recruitment in the Fillmore , say  --  Oakland , Hunter 's Point . They raise the kids to be the Fruit of Islam . Those Ivy League suits and pouting faces . Knot straight on the Adam 's apple . Fruits , man , goo-od ! " This was the moment to decide whether to slip into his kidding nigger-talk or remain himself , Jarod Howe , B.A. Harvard , M.A. NYU , Ph.D . Columbia , Uncle Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berkeley to teach sociology , not because he was a Negro , as a demonstration , butp108because he was slightly erratic , more like an anthropologistthan a sociologist , more like a psychologist , more like an intuitive thinker , and the most brilliant sociologist around , and also he was definitely brown . Well , he could do social anthropology if he got too erratic . And if he settled down , he could do conventionalsociology with a touch of Charlie Mills wildness about it . But with less political boat-rocking because , after all , C. Wright Mills was a Texan and white and Jarod Howe would always remain , one could hope , a leetle hit . . . oh , not cautious , but aware . Yes , that 's the word . Responsible . Jarod was talking and Al had not followed . Jarod was saying : " The thing about San Francisco is Nobody Came First . The Jews , Japanese , the Chinese all got here almost the same time as the hairy prospectors . The Australian thugs and sailors , too the Sidney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts . Look , you walk up Fillmore and you see the traces : the Exposition of 1905 , Pacific Heights , the Japanese  --  oh , they were relocated during the war , they still grind their teeth about it , they remember , and the blacks sure , they moved up from the South , then out of the shipyards , the ghetto at McAllister , a synagogue , corned beef , the bagel factory  --  all mixed up . Nobody came first , but the black man comes last . No wonder . " " I suppose I should get into this , " Al said . " Race conflict is a good thing , eh , pal ? Want to take over the burden ? " " I do n't mean freedom-riding  --  " " Well , why not freedom-riding or sitting in ? That was four years ago , you mean ? Or lying in with a Fill/more or Hunter 's Point lady ? Man , you is too cautious , baby . " He made his play-acting chuckle. , " I think I 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you tomorrow . Is n't this the wrong day ? " " Have some coffee . " " I already had dinner in town . " " You already had dinner here , boy . " True ; he had eaten ; he had been chased by Milly and had come for dinner . It was still the wrong day . " Weltschmerz ? " Jarod asked . " Up tight and out of sight ? " " Something , Jarod . " Despite daylight saving , there was a limit to what you could save of the day . The purple glow of San Francisco through a low bank of fog , around the curve of bay , seemed to be stretching toward them in the evening air . The day 's warmth flowed in a soft river out of the low hills . Barefooted , in short nightgowns , the sulky , cuddly daughters of Ellen and Jarod Howe ran forward to say goodnight . Like Arab urchins they looked with their greenish eyes and their long hair . They put up their mouths to be kissed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time feeling an illicit pang , jealousy and desire , as he did when he contemplatedJarod with Ellen , jarod at the university , Jarod playing tennis and deciding great issues at the Cal Club with the tennis-playing Supreme Court justice with the pacemaker implanted in his heart . Al loved the girls , just as he loved Jarod and Ellen and , for all he knew , the Supreme Court justice . At the same time , he meant to find something extraordinary . Perhaps robbing the Crocker-Anglo Bank would be worthy of his desire , something to markp111No , it was n't like that , either . On this creaking barge , Howe 's Landing on Airline Stewardess Row , water lapping against the rotting timbers , Jarod was opening his heart in his peculiar fashion , just a crack , just partway , to let the trouble within be visible . There was trouble within . He had traveled through understanding all the way to misunderstanding . He would not come to Al 's aid . Pinned in the crowd and vainly trying to signal to his friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Jarod look at him before they were lost to each other . The friend laughed and remained engrossed in games . Jarod sometimes described himself as the brown C. Wright Mills , but Al knew him to be more canny , therefore more influential than poor Mills had ever been . When he played tennis with the Supreme Court justice , he made his points off the court . He did n't publish what would get him in useless trouble . Mills sold more copies in paperback , but Jarod Howe was studied in Washington . What point was this cautious person making in Sausalito and Berkeley ? The touch of bohemianism had counteracted the touch of Uncle Tomism ; the pedantry had balanced the anger ( his thesis showed how the ghetto not only degrades , it destroys , it proves the white case by making the Negroan animal , and he said it with bell graphs , tables , and surveys ) . But was Jarod proving something else now , or merely being the proof of something ? Al was being amiably propelled through the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him nothing . And though he wanted to help Jarod in his time of trouble  --  giving help is a way of receivingp112it  --  Jarod cut him short there , too . " Wait , I 'll get my sweater , Ill have a little walk , " Jarod said at the door , and disappeared . Ellen came up to Al in this instant . She darted forward as if she had been waiting for the chance . " Pregnantagain . This one was n't planned by our friend . " Jarod heard the whisper and parodied her , hissing . " I thought we were n't going to say till we were sure ? " He was furious . He stood like a boxer , his sweater tied around his neck , his eyes squeezed half shut , his knees bent , in a rage . Paralyzed by the anger in both of them , Al 's lips made the gesture Congratulations without the sound being struck . " You know what Al was telling me ? " Jarod said . " Said sometimes he feels like committing a horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had only been thinking about telling him . He knew . But it was not a horrible crime ; it was just a little expressive crime , like a burglary . " And you know what ? " Jarod asked . " Some crimes are not so much like crimes , you know ? Like sitting in if you 're a black man , and rioting , and disobeying the men 's room signs . And aborting an unwantedchild . " Ellen made a toy squeaking sound . She disappeared as if whipped . " You still looking for me to play mentor with you ? " Jarod inquired pleasantly . " No , Jarod , you still carrying that load ? " " Good touch . Nice play , Al . " " What 's going on ? " " Nothing , " he said softly , " nothing , plenty . I 'm sorry . " He untied the sweater , slipped his head intop113it , and pulled it down with a jerk . They descended the creaking wooden planks , they walked along the ditch , they stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jarod remained near the car and hunched down toward the window when Al started the motor . " Black days and nights , " he said . " I got everything I want . The bread , the name , the love of a beautiful white woman , I suppose . I got it made , and without going into medicine or the numbers . I 'm all by myself out there . Yew-neek . They even want to do a TV interview with me on the barge . And yet the black loneliness I got , Al . " " Me , too , sometimes . Right now , " Al said , feeling not sadness but relief . It was coming into the open . They could regain their friendship . " That 's what I wanted to tell you . " Jarod turned his smile upward to catch the light of the street lamp in a parody of the watermelon minstrel-showboy . " Got up in the morning , boy , you know ? And I ate me some good greens yesterday  --  lettuce , celery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crap . And stood up afterward , and you know , son , I felt young and tall . Deed Ah did , son . Young and tall and African black . " " Goodnight , " Al said . He whirled the car about on the jumping ruts of dried mud . Jarod was shouting after him , " Got my own troubles , Al ! " The car was spitting flinty lumps back at him . Through the rearview mirror Al saw him shouting and gesticulating . " Got my own troubles , goddammit ! And I 'm not free , white , and twenty-two , goddamn you ! " Al was out on the road . San Francisco lay in tatters of summer fog on its hills across the bay . Reinforce/ments of fog boiled through the Golden Gate . It suddenlygrew chilly . Was Jarod cracking up ? No , probably just life cavingin on him . Yes , and a girl , Al thought angrily , ah , that 's it  --  symptoms . Why could n't he roll all the white girls up into one big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heater . It would be cold for three minutes across the bridge , and then no more fog . He felt his mustache with his fingertips , as if he could tell what time it was by how much the beard had grown . In the dampness his face felt sticky . He had been sweating . Jarod was trying to tell him to do his own deeds , whatever they might be . Okay then , Jarod was saying that all his powers and works were not enough . Okay . Even Supreme Court justices had to go looking for adventure . Even the subjects of teevee specials . Cold will shuddered through him . The Farallon Islands lay athwart the shore , many leagues out , invisibly a menace to mariners . Sometimes , on a clear winter day , Al had seen them , low lumps of rock in hiding at the horizon . There was a Special Delivery letter in his mailbox . The box was a couple of shingles made into a birdhouseby the previous tenant . The birds had gone elsewhere and Al had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mail would n't get rained on or blown in the wind at his door . Sometimes he went for several days without looking for his mail . Stranger Strange Land 2 Aquarius 4p115Gemini 's true function is often to make lifemore beautiful for others . I did n't reallymean that about you work too hard . You dogood work . S. Cody . The postmark was Los Angeles , but there was no returnaddress , of course . And his deed would have to be good work and a hard one . and would you please pick up Pat for me ? " Being dutiful , Al put the requests of his friend before his own judgment . Al was often obedient . If he had been planning suicide , he might have waited until he finished auditing Jarod 's course , and so he agreed to come out to Sausalito for the television team which wanted to record him for a program on Negro Affluence . What ? " You heard me , " said Jarod , " a special . The Black Influential . Well , I 'm supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Thanks . " " My man , it is an experience . "  |p116Unwilling  to say No to experience , he agreed to play the role for television film which he played in real life . Jarod 's secretary would take dictation and beam in the sun and show herself , a white girl , one of that corps of women who never leave the university , part of the entourage of the distinguished sociologist and black man , Jarod Howe . " Christ . " " That means okay , Al ? " Pat Livard was drunk when he arrived . She did not know how to prepare for television , what colors to wear ; she had decided to wear drunk . She seemed to have rehearsed her life 's story to get a higher Nielsonrating . " I want to tell you , " she said , " why I like working for Dr. Howe so much . Jarod , I mean . Just love it , I mean . " She was a woman of about forty , and had been forty for much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , blue-rinsed hair , and a husband who now lived in Caracas because he wanted to learn Spanish . They were separated , but had decided not to get divorced because they were working out their problems together , he in Caracas and she in San Francisco . She had learned a great deal from her husband , but even more from Dr. Howe ; for example , that you have to really get into a book before you can enjoy it to the utmost . Most of all , right now she wanted to be a good , worthwhile person and do well for Dr. Howe on this , her first appearance on television , and she needed to oil up the gears of reminiscence . And so , bluehaired , nasal , and rather formal about it , she told Al Dooley how she had been tampered with by nine boys one memorable night long ago , and thus had lostp117her virginity , and how , passing strange it was , this had led her to Dr. Howe . " Well , it was n't nine , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about it , because it was the moment of truth , I can tell you that for openers . It 's a time when you rilly find out the metal you 're made of , the seamy side populationwise , the whole bit , gut-level and upfront . Well , these boys picked me up in their car and said , You wan na ride home ? And I thought they knew me because they used my nickname , Sunny , you know ? The whole bit . So they drove me out in the country and said they were going to gang-rape me . Actually , the word they used was fuck , ' but I do n't like to use that word myself because it does n't express any of the real spiritual communication there can be in an experience of that nature . Maybe you can say it on the non-profit channel , but that 's about all . I just looked at them and thought to myself : " Well , Sunny  --  I was called Sunny in those days cause I was always smiling  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this one ? Well , it turned out I was n't . When we got out into the country , I remember that evening so well , the stars and crickets and all like that , I said I had to answer a call of nature . That was quick thinking on my part because I thought maybe I could think of something . Well , they let me , but one of them went with me . He was the nicest . They thought quick , too . I was rilly embarrassed . I used leaves . It was an imperative call of nature . Then I thought to myself : Now keep cool , Sunny , and do n't give them the satisfaction . I rilly knew that country , hiking you know , and I could run real fast for a girl  --  you know , track , standing broad jump , hurdles , the whole bit . But thep118cattle fences . I was sure they 'd catch me on a fence and then I 'd rilly be stuck . So I just decided : This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that it did . Twice . I mean five of them , twice . The whole sex-horror trip . But I did n't say anything to get them excited . I did n't lose my head . I thought it all through . I just kept thinking : Sunny , is this happening to you ? It was like in a paperback , though that was before they had so many paperbacks . I tried to look at it philosophically , like Martin Buber and , uh , Confucius . But Sunny , this was happening to me . " Well , afterward , they were just dumb farm kids and when they got stuck in a ditch  --  that was afterward  --  Isaid I 'd go wake up a farmer and get him to pull them out with his tractor . They were too weak to do it themselves , I guess . I forgot to say we were back in their car , a big old Hudson with a weak motor . But I did n't wake up any farmer , I was n't going to be nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and as far as I know , they 're still in that ditch . That was more than twenty years ago . But you know , there 's a funny side about the human mind . You get funny ideas about people when you lose all trust . I mean , the thing that rills worried me as I hitchhiked home was I 'd get rape-fucked by the persons who picked me up hitchhiking . I mean it must have looked funny , me out on the road , a girl , at four in the morninglike that . I have n't been the same kind of humanitariansince . I mean I believe in the causes and all , but there are things in human nature you never dream of in your idealistic side . Anybody got to admit that , even if you never been gang-rape-fucked like I was by five youths . It 's sort of funny how a thing like beingp119rape-fucked by five crazy neurotic kids will change the whole way you look at things . " " I see that now , " Al said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network television ? " " What 'd your parents do ? " " I never told my parents . But I checked with a doctor and he said I was okay , no rips or pregnancy or jazz like that . He thought I was pretty lucky . He said some girls would get hurt and I was pretty smart to keep calm and not a rip . And now I got a healthy fourteen-year-old by my first husband , the social worker , and she has n't been spoiled , either . I taught her to have trust , hit a little suspicious of five farm clunks in a car . You do n't accept rides from strangers even if they know your nickname cause you smile a lot . " " But , " said Al . " And that 's how it happened , " Pat said . " I guess it 's most important to get my basic message across and so I 'll use other words . Assault . Violated . " " But how does he come into this  --  fared ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Attacked . Tampered . " " Was Jarod counseling ? " " No , but the counselor said , you know , he asked me : Were any of the boys dark-skinned ? And I said , no , no , not as I can recall . Seduced with force ? No , horribly mistreated . But then it came to me , blooey ! Then it came to me ! I wished that one of those boys could have been dark . I mean  --  it was hysterical how he knew ! I mean , I had a dream once in which it was like one of those war movies , A Walk in the Sun , you know , an Irishman , an eye-talian , a nice youngp120boy of the Jewish persuasion , a hillbilly from the mountains , a boy of the colored persuasion , an elegant Easterner  --  " " Of the Harvard persuasion ? " " Yeah ! You know , a rilly American group , instead of just those nowhere , nothing Iowa farm kids from the great American breadbasket . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know ? I started making friends with all kinds of groups . My husband , for example , you know , he loves languages ? Well , that 's because he 's part Mexican . He was a Latin American specialist in college , was how I met him . And then I met Jarod and I just got kind of like stuck . But if only all American girls could have my experience there would n't be so much prejudice abroad in the world today . Synanon helps , too . But it 's hard if you ca n't tell it like it is on the networks . " And she closed her mouth as if he could n't pry another word out of her . Amen , thought Al . They 'll put a beep through the whole segment . There was a freighter with Japanese markings visiblein the bay , plowing through choppy seas at the Golden Gate . Another load of transistors . Some of us have keys in our backs , like this lady Pat , and some have transistors , and all of us cross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you robbed a bank in San Francisco and wanted to spend the money on leather pants and jewelry in Sausalito , you 'd still need a quarter for the toll booth . The narrow dirt road leading to the houseboat was crowded . A generator throbbed on a network van ; anothertruck had disgorged coils of cables , sun-reflec/tors , ladders , scaffoldings , what looked like a marriage between an advanced fire department and a mobile radar installation . A crew was already aboard . Helpers smoked and loitered . The producer would be getting acquainted with Jarod 's family . Before they jumped out of the car , Pat Livard recalledsomething she had been taught : " Now you must tell me all about yourself , Al . Now it 's your turn . " " Thank you , later , " Al said . They climbed up the dusty path to the barge . " That 's hysterical , " she complained . " Sometimes I think I 'm just a little old blabbermouth . Do I talk too much , Al ? It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , " Al said . " Well , so long as you do n't think I talk too much . Some men do n't like your intellectual-type woman . I 've found that to be true in the Synanon game . Some men are rilly aggressive  --  I never knew that before . " On board the barge , which Marvin , the producer of the series , kept calling a houseboat , each good soldier marched in his place , following orders , in individual combat deployment . Marvin had a short dark beard and a commanding illiterate presence . He had been commissioned in the field . " I 'm Marvin . . . " he said several times , and Al kept hearing dots after his first name . He wanted to be called Marvin , but he was in command . The campaign had the working title of " The Affluent Life , " but everyone knew it was really The Influential Negro . The enlisted affluent personnel were a group , but isolated . Pat and Al looked for their places.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Al said . " Caw me Marvin , " Marvin said . " You want me to put on lipstick ? " Pat asked . " Hey , Marv , you want me to look more formal , or just Berkeleyit up a little ? " " That 'll be fine , honey , " Marvin said . " I 'll let you know when we need you . Just cool it down a beat , okay ? " Barefoot Jarod , in khaki pants and white Brooks Brothers shirt , sleeves rolled up , padded gracefully about , patting his daughters ' heads , smiling at his wife , conversing affably with Marvin , the director , and the writer . He handed his wallet to Ellen because it bulged out his hips . Jarod was well equipped in leather goods  --  blotters , leather key-holders , leather wallet and non-plastic leather bucket seats . His own hide was tough , but his billfold bent in tender pigskin over all those credit cards . He greeted AT with a warm clap on the shoulders . He introduced Pat as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He winked . A moment later he was speaking with the writer , a pipesmokingand sullen young man who seemed to be mostly a witness and a handler . If Marvin had been a boxer , the young man would have worn a sweatshirtstenciled with the word MARVIN . Jarod was telling him : " There is nothing to do about death but to contemplatethe nothing . However , the something of life is often not very much more  --  unless there is struggle . That 's why we blacks are fortunate . We have a something which is more . " He paused a moment to make sure the man was taking notes . Then he remembered the tape recorder silently spinning . The writer would edit and cut and make it fit ; that 's why he was a writer.  |p123Jarod  said , " If you knew you were to die , I suppose you 'd have to contemplate the nothing anyway . It seems like that . But we all know it , and we do n't . Not very often , anyway . We keep busy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced sideways at the tape machine with a lover 's look of reproach ( why was it not recording him ? ) , and said , " Does being a leader in the Movement touch you more as a political figure than as a scholar ? Are your children in private school ? What is your opinion of the fragmentation of the two major political parties ? " " Answer Yes or No , " said Jarod , " on a scale of one to ten . " " Pardon ? " " I was kidding . " " Oh , yes . Ha ha . Well , I just throw up these questions to get us started . Actually , we want the personal stuff first . Our commentary will get the think stuff . " " What did you say your name was ? " The writer answered . " Is , " said Jarod . " Sorry . " " You went to Harvard , the bio says . " " The bio is right . " " I went to Colgate . Harvard was my first pick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you were black or brown or red you could have gotten in ? " " I 'm only speaking from my experience , " said the boy from Colgate . " Well , " said Jarod , " I 'm a little older than you are . They did n't give so much credit for color when I went to school . And in fact , you know what ? I hadp124nothing to do with my color , except to darken it a little in this sun . Who I am though , and what I do with my color  --  that I ask some credit for . " The Colgate man flushed . " I know , sir . I respect that . " " You were well brought up , " Jarod said . " I just wanted to show I can be as sincere as the next fella if I have to be . " " You 'll find us pretty straight , too , " said Colgate . " Have to be in our business  --  the business of people . " " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the words Jarod had cast out  --  death , life , nothing , something  --  Al went to talk with Ellen . She was patiently answering questions put by an assistant producer : where she was born ; where the electrical outlets could be found on a houseboat ( barge ) ; where she first met Jarod ; how it was to be married to an , ah , celebrity  --  " he 's a black man , too , " she said to be helpful ; whether she helped him in the Struggle ; whether she did all her own cooking ; whether she had both cleaning help and baby-sitters ( " Non-Caucasians , " she said , " Japanese " ) . At Ellen 's side Al smelled something peculiar , the assistant producer 's breath , an exhalation of meat ; it was mixed with Ellen 's light perfume ; and the heavy and light smells made an impression on him ; not , he decided , very pleasant . For some reason it made him think of jealousy and desire , or perhaps in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a frazzled , skinny man with bad breath  --  older than the producer , an eternal second  --  asking questions of a stranger , a gracious and intelligent lady who somehowp125managed to answer these questions . Do people ever make trouble ? Did your family get upset or commit suicide a lot ? What about the children  --  they nice well-adjusted mongrel kids ? Al thought , He wants to ask if the organ of a Negro professor  --  well , take your average mulatto  --  is larger than that of shriveled , red-haired , bad-breathed assistantproducer of a television spectacular . Bigger , longer , heavier , stronger , or  --  " Is there a church of your choice in the neighborhood ? " " Would you excuse me , please ? A slight . " She did n't say a slight what . Al walked with Ellen toward her bedroom . His feet sensed water , a sway of water beneath a barge moored on mud flats with the tide out ; the feet and the ears knew water below . Ellenkept her head down , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know that Jarod has the right to put the children through this , but . " " But what ? " " But I married him partly for a demonstration , I suppose . I think I would have married him anyway , but I 'll never be sure . So now he is demonstrating . " " Yes , " said Al . " Also I married him because I loved him . " " Why are you making these judgments , Ellen ? " " Whatever that was , " she said . " Will you excuse me ? I 'm going to close the door and lie down and hope these creeps do n't come pushing their cameras in here . " She touched Al 's hand . " What chance do you think I have ? " She closed the door . Pat Livard had cornered May and Sarah on the back deck , her arms around them , her eyes rolling . " Nice , nice kids . Poor poor poor nice nice little kids . "  |p126May  was concentrated in furious struggle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have broken Pat 's embrace , but in their rage and innocence , they did n't pull in the same direction . Pat was in a fury of love and hope that the cameras would dolly toward her , if that was the word . She would grip these kids until the director spotted her if it killed them , she loved them so , um , urn , yummy , it was a natural . May struggled , but Sarah suddenly relaxed . She watched Pat out of round , innocent , childish eyes . Pat was busy with May . Sarah took aim . Sarah sharpened the points of her patent-leather shoes with her magic will . Nice , nice shoes . Sarah delivered a boot to the shin that made Pat forget immortalitywith mulattos on prime time . The children skidded off while Pat sobbed for unrequitedtelevision and rubbed the welt forming on her leg . Al went up to Jarod , who was smiling into the empty air , no , who was smiling at the salt flies in the empty bayside air , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My staff . " Jarod , you 're playing . " " I 'm sincere about using people , " he said . " Look "  --  and he pointed with a sweep of closed hand out to the bay , the water , the fog , the sun glinting through fog and on water , the reactivated destroyer , the redwoodark built to the greater glory of Zen and LSD , the seaside houses across the bay , Angel Island , the horizon . Why did n't he open one finger if he was pointing to something ? " Look , the flies , " he said . He was pointing to the flies spinning up an invisible chimney of air , never alighting , never buzzing , justp127silently surfing in air . They were not houseflies or barnfliesor horseflies or fleas . They were San Francisco Bay flies , air flies , subsisting on pure delight , it seemed , eating no meat . Jarod grinned . " I think I 'm very sincere about the Problem . Automation , massive expansion of the quantityand quality of education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban deterioration , disarmament , making the United Nations viable and useful , the world population explosion , distribution of goods  --  hell , I can bring everything to boil . It ai n't all color . I can use those other things , too . " Something 's gone out of it , Al thought . " Tell you what . You have n't stylized yourself yet , Al , but life is easier that way . If you 're empty and know you 're empty , then you 're not really empty , right ? " plod looked around with boyish eyes . They strolled back out onto the deck and into the sunlight , Jarod very graceful in his hare feet with the grayish , stubby toes . The airline hostesses in the barge down the way had their martini flag hoisted . From their cabin with its Howard Johnson surplus curtains came the sound of music  --  saxophone  --  no , trumpet -- the Tijuana Brass . The sadness of music over water ; the sadness of the unattainable ; the airline hostesses were entertaining a pilot who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're entering the Aquarian Age , Aquarius . Oh , beautiful . The Second House of Atreus is ascended . I du n no , beautiful . We 're all going to slide down into the San Andreas Fault anyway , I felt it this morning beautiful ! "  | " Groovy , " said a hostess . " Wow . " The hippie pilot , preaching the apocalypse , preened himself . For sure he would have her tonight . Jarod listened across the water . " I do n't like myself . Or maybe it 's the other way around . " Al tried not smiling to see what difference that would make . Jarod'shands were grayish ; his face was gray beneath the color . A jolt of amphetamine for courage today ? " I do n't think of myself as a man of feeling , " Jarod was saying . " I used to be . I was the world 's runner-up egomaniac . I had delusions of melancholia . What it really was , well  --  traveling first class and having the ear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants of little tricks with red MG 's . That 's not necessarily feeling , pal . " He looked out at the weather of the bay , salt smells and flower scents , California ease and loafing , and he grasped the storm for himself ( what storm ? ) ; he hated , he grasped hatredlike wings , he soared toward the sun on wings of hatred and scorn . Oh , an internal storm . Once he had seen a black man kicking a black dog to death in Oakland . Black dog , black dog , black dog ! A mutt with entrails sticking to shoes , and the man blown by his storm and people just moving around him becausethat dog might be related to him and he had a right . " That 's not necessarily feeling . " " Aw right , man , " said the director , " you like to chin yourself on that bar ? Keep yourself in great condition , do you ? " There was a chinning bar in a doorway . " Yes , for what comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's inside this door ? "  | " What 's inside this door , Dr. Howe , man ? " Jarod opened a door into the Fire Hazard Room of his houseboat . It was a room in which , as an experiment , he put all the paper which came into his house  --  bills , letters , coupons , newspapers , notes , requests , converted forests of city silt and drift . He explained that he had thought to see what a year 's paper would amount to . But the room filled up in less than six months , and then he spent a day destroying it , and then , like the eternal return , it filled again . " It helps me know who I am , " he said . " I 'm not Buckminster Fuller or Marshall McLuhan . I 'm not What's-'is-name . I 'm the smart brown man with lots of paper . " " Oh , that 's cute , " said the director . " Oh , we got to get that . " He made a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set that one up . " Marvin was in his reverie , his Prime Time Special Reverie . That 's how Marvin got to be a legend in the television industry of our time . Jarod turned to Al , continuing where he always left off . " All this is too much for a black nigger or an Uncle Tom or a Snick protestor or a watermelon-eater from way back . It 's not happening to me . I ca n't believe it 's happening . I 'm just an upward-striving ofay in my black skin , all by myself . No wonder I 'm tired some-times . " Al said , " Why not settle for California ? " " You mean good wine , weather , and sex , and fun , kids , cars , sports cars  --  why want the rare experience , too ? Why want the piece of strange just because we 're still alive ? " " Aw right , " said a voice behind them . " That 's greatp130stuff . But you did n't warn me , boys . How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Dr. Howe , sir ?  --  man ? " Colgate , the writer , was the hovercraft behind them with a whirring tape recorder . Marvin had one hand on his forehead  --  reverie plus Athena plus the muse of public service . He was struggling to get it all into the can . " I 'll do a voice over scene , maybe at the beginning like that , you two looking out over the horizon , see , you 're thinking the white man and the black man , looking out over the horizon , see , you 're thinking , the white man and the black man , looking out there . Okay , Doctor , now you begin with a piece of strange . ' Just see if you can find those good semanticsagain . " " Because we 're still alive , " Jarod said in the resonantbaritone which was one of his voices . " Hey , just a sec , " said the producer . " Listen , before we go on  --  and by the way , that 's a good bit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that whole scene . We 'll want to pick that up . Listen , you always comb your hair like that ? " Al was thinking of Ellen behind her closed door and unwell . " If you want to ask , " Jarod said , " do I wear a hair net , the answer is No , I do n't wear a hair net . Nor do I conk the hair  --  that 's lye and soap and potatoes and it straightens the hair out nice and white . No , I do n't . " He scrubbed his palm across the curly scalp . " I like it nice and dry like it is , short , not too Afro . " " That 's fine , great , you tell it like it is . Sock it to us , Professor . "  | " Will there be a little group behind us on the soundtrack ? The Budapest Combo ? " " Do n't be short with me , Dr. Howe , " said Marvin , who was a small man . " I 'll answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . . . uh , under the credits . . . " He looked to the assistant director . " Bongos , " said the assistant director . " Just under the credits , you know , my name , his name . " I get it . A steel band , calypso , Marine Corps whistle , bamboo pipes  --  " " No  --  bongos . Rhythm stuff , you got it , for mood . " " Right ! Okay , you want me to take it from Tolstoy and we 're still alive ? " " Oh I love those semantics , Professor Howe . " " Because , " said Jarod , " what bars our way on life 's road only makes us want to travel along it . That is n't what I said before , I realize . That 's Camus . " " He 's got some great semantics , too . " " I 'll sock ' em to you . " " Come-ear , come-ear ! " Marvin turned to Al . He smiled ingratiatingly and nodded encouragingly and beckoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , special student friend among the young generation , the new involved committedflower-child love generation , I want to ask you one question , Al , okay ? " " What is it ? " " Do you use drugs ? " " Thank you for that question , " Al said . " And if so , do you think they are habit-forming , destructive to the germ plasm , and expand your mindp132to new perceptions of this day-to-day reality we live in ? " " You 're an asshole , " Al said . " I appreciate your frankness . We 'll catch that on tape with a beep . And one more question , sir : Would you call yourself a part of the NOW generation ? And why are n't you in Viet Nam ? " " That 's two questions , " said Al . The director bent to his clipboard-bearer , a tiny girl with a mane of fall , finely bleached Korean or Sicilian hair . " I think we might try a few bars under , you know , I Came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , put it down as a possible . " A zoom camera had moved close in on Al 's face duringthis little chat and the tape was whirling . They could use face and voice or voice without face or face without voice ; they could use whatever piece of him that fitted in ; or they might use none at all if it happened that he did n't do . Al hurried back to Ellen 's room . He believed she was very ill . Pat Livard was sleeping on a glider in a corner of the open deck . Her mouth was open and flies were hanging above , fastidiously warming themselves in the invisible column of hot air that rose and fell with her breathing . The producer was laughing at something Jarod was saying . Jarod was modulating his words to make the producer laugh respectfully . Marvin felt that the black people had made a great contribution to entertainmentin this country , but not many people know they are great scientists , too . May and Sarah were throwing television equip/ment into the bay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud were smiling and waving at the children and whispering , " Jump ! Jump ! " On shore , the sculptor Jean Varda was replacing the bidet at the base of his monument to the Divinity of Cuckoldry . Some of the network technicians were trying to break the pliafilm wrapping on their sandwiches , but blunt , nail-bitten fingers were driving the plastic through white bread into tunafish . An awl would do it fine , but May was just now clapping her hands as the awl sank into salt marsh . Police were keeping the gawkers from pushing up toward the barge . A tiki salesman who had left his tiki with Ellen Howe said , " But that 's my tiki . " A cop said , " What the hell 's a tiki and I got my orders . " The tiki salesman sought time to explain briefly ( " Polynesian driveway fixture , only religious ! Like a totem pole sort on " ) , but the cop shoved him back with a gentle urging to his Adam 's apple and went to ask Varda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the hell he expected to drive through this crowd . May and Sarah were feelingsorry for themselves because they were just childrenand the only equipment they could throw into the bay was small tools and clipboards and portable tape recorders . A union grip said , " Come on , kids , not that it 's my job , but we do n't do this to your toys , do we ? " Sarah picked up her horsy and dropped it overboard . She looked at the grip as if to say , Okay , try some more logic on me . May glanced at her boots and remembered Pat Livard 's shins with satisfaction . The grip returned to trying to penetrate another pliafilmwrapping . He had tunafish under his thumbnail . The pilot and the stewardess went indoors . They de/tided not to wait until evening , just in case the San Andreas Fault opened up this afternoon . Al understood how they felt . As for him , he was still doing things which other people made him do . That did n't make it right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself hound over tocontinue the education of Al Dooley . In flowered Berkeleyone morning his topic was a study of the socialstructure of schizophrenics . They sat in Jarod 's office  --  the campanile in view , eucalyptus and lawn , UCBissue hippies with guitars  --  and he explained thatcatatonic behavior is really a variety of communication ; passive , true ; aggressive , true ; hostile , true ; afraid , true ; but it transmits all these states of spiritp135and more  --  the desire to communicate a desire not to communicate . There is even a pecking order for pickingup cigarette butts . The most retreated psychotic is often socialized to this extent : knows when he has the right to grab a smoke off the cement floor . . . Jarod 's secretary , Pat Livard , put her small stalk of a head through the door and said , " Dr. Howe . Tele-phone . " " Take word . " " It 's long distance . Washington . " " Take the number . I 'm out . " " It 's the Peace Corps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The official caller would see on his CIA closed-circuit screen that she was telling a lie in the interests of socialscience . " Professor ? " she asked , not yet out of range . " She answers when I do n't call her . When I call her , she 's drinking coffee . Girls like that one , they drink coffee their husbands through graduate school . Later on , when he gets a job , he 's making out okay , he likes a graduate student and wants to divorce her , they whine , But I drank coffee you through school . I drank coffee my fingers to the bone . " " She 'll hear you , " Al said . " I tell her all the time . " He turned reddened eyes on Al , capillaries flooded and leaking . Someday when he was very old , if he lived that long , Jarod would have eyes that come unhung , showing the eroded banks of veins . There was a look of membrane , fatigue , forced energy making tracks on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " something on my mind . Since I only teach one lecture course , I do researchp136and public service the rest of the time . And now that the Supreme Court has acted and it 's in the hands of the lawyers again , the good hands of the FBI and the liberals down South and the rioters up North , and I 'm just a-sitting in up here in Berkeley and there ai n't too much to do , well , I want to save not just the races in general but this over-privileged kid in par-ticular . " Al felt no generosity in the declaration . " I embarrass you ? Too warm in here ? " " Jarod , we 've been through this lately . What am I supposed to make of it ? " " Think of yourself as a pilot project . An example . Or I need some personalization  --  want to think of it that way ? " Cigarette butt out . Another invitation to be his witness . His trouble required a disciple . And what more disciplish thing is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be doing . You coming with me ? " " Okay , " said Al . " I got this metabolism that likes to watch people doing . " jarod grinned . " Aw , come on , pal . Do n't you get tired of screwing and dreaming , digging for the stump and making plans ? Sometimes I think I ca n't make it with another white chick , I do n't wan na . Okay , so then I think  --  maybe I 'll kill myself tomorrow . Or get killed in a good old Oakland riot . So this is my last screw . Right away I 'm strong . I 'm Mister Up Tight and Tight Up , Right Up . . . But I never do kill myself tomorrow . " " I 've noticed . " " You 're different from me . Try to learn from anp137older chap . Panic does n't justify being disturbed . Hysteriashould n't get in the way of calm . " " Thank you for that tempered advice . " " Al , I know you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Al shook his head stubbornly . " Do n't tell me . I prefer to think my way through . Take myself , for example . Some psychopaths burn themselves out at age forty . Junkies , prick worshipers , maniacs like that . Harmless . Or good for nothing . Or maybe they become decent souls . " He added , " I know this from reading and looking in the mirror . You 're going through the crazy time . Well , it 's a crazy time outside , too . You 're thinking : All by myself , buzzing around in California , eating and fucking  --  what am I doing in this world ? " " Something like that . Not exactly . " " I did n't say exactly . You 'd like to be yourself , a special sort , not just another fun-lover in the nimble quick . Come on , fess up . Tell me . " Al shook his head . Let him guess . Jarod waited . No answer . " Okay , then you want to come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause I got this funny metabolism ? " He followed where Jarod led . They climbed into his green Morgan with the leather belly-strap over its hood and shot through Berkeley toward the Bay Bridge . Along the highway , choppy salt blue and acid smell of garbage , there was an abrupt population of sculpture on the Emery flats  --  giant bent-tin Vikings with radiator spears , war sloops with Petp138milk masts , a crusade of manic junk between the highwayand the sea . Jarod triangulated a smile at Al . He turned the rear-view mirror so Al could see the smile along the hypotenuse , Jarod to mirror to Al . He took a quarter from the ashtray ; he flipped it into the waiting hand at the toll gate ; the man smiled as if he had really caught it  --  the quarter was flipped into his hand . " Perfect coordination , " Jarod said . " Thank you , sir . " " Mine , " he said . And Al wondered what losses he was taking that he had to signify himself so constantly now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jarod squint and curse . They came off the bridge and headed out through the city . At an intersection the cyclops eye of a squad car roamed in its head ; semaphore arms , tangle of fire engines , snaking hoses , gutters awash . Jarod whirled around the blocked traffic and up Nob Hill , and then eastward and toward the ocean . " To the Moh , " he said . " What moh ? " " The Fill-moh . " The Fillmore district is San Francisco'sHarlem . " First we eat no pork , then we go to a lecture where I do no listening . " " That 's clear , " said Al . " What you mean , we 're going to a restaurant first . Then a lecture you happen to be giving . " " I thought it would be clear , " said Jarod . Confucius say , Al thought . The sign read SHABAll SEMI-DELUXE COOKING RESTAURANT , Sister Rocquefort , Prop. , in gleaming royal teardrops of hasty paint . A dark woman in white robesp139emitted an effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known a previous incarnationas a burger palace , tiled walls , tiled floor , and long mirrors bolted into the walls for lonely eaters to study their eating . Now the mirrors were covered with bamboo curtains to guard against the ancient ghosts of Fillmore pork fanatics . A complex lack of smell radiated from the kitchen  --  the smell of no pork , the smell of no frying . They took seats at a dark table covered with a weathered linoleum-like strip . Sister Rocquefort came stately toward them , wiped the table , which was alreadyvery clean , and said , " Salaam Alaikum , Professor . " Alaikum Salaam , Rocky . " He winked at Al . " Just call me Jarod X. " " Why , " she said calmly , " did you choose to bring a blue-eyed devil in these premises ? " " This blue-eyed devil has brown eyes , Rocky . " " Is he a pig , Professor ? " Jarod stood up . He patted her lightly on the shoulder . " I know you ca n't kid around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a friend of mine . " He added , " Broil the meats , Sister . " It was early for dinner . The men in their fortydollarIvy League suits and narrow ties studied Jarod and Al and spoke to each other in hushed voices , with solemn spacing between sentence and reply . Al believed it a performance for his sake . They cut their meat in a way which indicated they were thinking of him . They chewed , thinking of the white devil . " Are these the Fruit of Islam ? " Al asked Jarod . " These am the Fruits , " Jarod said . " But hush mahp140baby , you can get yourself a knife between Adam 's rib and the next one , which must be Mohammad 's , I suppose . Cause it was n't removed for no white lady . " The black mainstreet was separated only by plate glass from this meeting place . One of the young men in Ivy covert cloth was lip-reading the headline in hisnewspaper : CLEAVER RAPS HONKIE PIG SHIT . It was alanguage Al nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone pointed at Al ; they were unused to seeing a white man here . A very fat woman moved like a ship , swollen and distorted , across the ripples of glass . Jarod was saying : " Sometimesyou look so tense , my friend . If you were older , I 'd say rest , lemon juice in hot water , cut down on coffee and pork . But at your age  --  spend it ! Take action , take arms against the sea of blandness . Now considerThe Affluent Negro  --  we should have blown it up . I played their games . What profit in it ? More foolishness spilling out . " " It 's overflowed in you this season . " " The situation is overflowing , boy . " " It 's self-destructive . " " So is jewelry store bank-robbing , boy . " Al shook his head . " I 'm just having dreams . " " In that case , " Jarod said , chuckling nicely , " oh , in that case it do n't mean nothing , do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We gave up that pork and piffle , just like the Jews . We talkin ' good English now and stickin ' with our ideals , to wit : Firebomb the Man . And then we 'll see . " " The white man 'll wipe you out , Jarod . " " The blond blue-eyed devil got no guts . He just dream about soul food and bank robbing . You wantp141some semi-deluxe cooking , pal ? Sister makes whatever I need and do n't get it from Ellen . We can destroy America and they can make the smog someplace else . Burn this country down and ship Charlie back to the Union of South Africa . If I 'd have said that to the viewers of The Affluent Nee-grow  --  " " They 'd have cut you off . " " No , friend , you have n't learned . They 'd have invitedme back next week . They 'd have turned me into a series . " The broiled veal steaks came with crisscrossing welts of char . Jarod bent to it , cutting deftly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewed and considered . " Does n't know how to season , " he said , " too many ideas . She 's a born leader  --  do n't make good chefs . Some people make soup with the boiling water and others spill it on the people . If you 'll just listen , I 'll tell you what 's on my mind . Also what I 'm going to do . " " What are you going to do next ? " " Next I 'm going to take you to a meeting and I want you to promise to keep it to yourself . " Al nodded . " Cross your heart and hope to die ? Trace a slanted moon on your heart and hope for blood and terror ? " " Okay , Jarod , okay . " " I 'm kind of like speaking at a little old Black Muslimmeeting and it helps me to have somebody with his mind on finer things which is why I want you there . " He showed teeth and veal in a wide sudden grin . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have authority to spy everywhere . That limit does n't disturb me. '  |p142Al  was thinking : Why so silly , Jarod ? " What 's there to be serious about ? " Al jumped . His thoughts were being read . The clouds in his sinus were being read . " Why should I aim to be better than the other apes ? Number One Ape , sure . But why more ? Every religion , every ideal , every mystic or rational belief has led to disaster and murder . Deep feelings delude , they make misery and pain . They 're an exercise in capacity beyond human capacity . Listen , the brain is modified sinus . " He chewed his meat . " Why are you so pale , Al ? Not just ordinary pink , but pale . Oh yes , you did n't hear yourself whispering Not Very Profound . You often talk to yourself like that ? " " Thinking . " " Some men touch their balls when they think . Nice white devil ! Man talk sense to himself , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's a leader . Cot to get me in the mood for talking to other people , you dig ? Up now ! " Jarod did not pay Mrs. Shabazz ( was that her name ? ) . IIe waited for Al to stand . He nodded to the lady and marched Al out like infantry . The smoky dusk of the ghetto radiated its deepfry smells into the yellow-gray evening sky . There was a hurrying crowd down the middle of the sidewalk . On the edges of the walk , at the curbs and storefronts , those who had no jobs , the strollers , the con experts , the welfare artists , the numbers runners , the gimmickersand reliefers , stood , loafed , watched , waited . In front of the shops white owners warily surveyed the street for customers or trouble . Jarod shoved Al through , thinking about the workp143ahead . A hardware shop window displayed the Magic Hour 4-Piece Cocktail Set in Pink , and The Home Bartender ( 8 pieces ) , and a Waste Basket with Brass Eagle , $4.95 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white storefront ( " Death Is Awaited Hour of Triumph Not a Grief " ) ; Hiraki Japanese Store &; Restaurant ; Kozy Kottage Byew-Tee Salon , Mrs. Jose deBing , Prop. ; Ivory Coffee Shop  --  " White devil soul food , " Jarod said . " The pawnbrokersgo there for spareribs , rest up from their kosher wives . " Money Loaned , Money Loaned , Money Loaned . A girl in a flannel skirt down to her ankles was staring in the window of a shoe repair shop . A shoe repair , watch repair , head repair , shave or shampoo . American Market  --  " No Jews , they mean , " said Jarod . There was the girl in a long flannel gown , strolling and dawdling . " Not a Muslim , " said Jarod , " a nut . They go out of their heads . Brain damage at birth , no prenatal care , lousy interns . Brain damage all their lives . They 're not upward bound . " There were businessmenfrom the junk shops , the markets , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring out into the street or selling the liquor or wine in the Gallo Gift Wrap , a paper bag . An awning said Club Flamingo , but the sign on the door said Congo Club and an older , faded inscription in the glass said HickoryBar B Q. A poster showed a grinning rancher in Palm Beach suit , many teeth : FOLLOW THE MAN IN THE WHITE STETSON HAT THE TEXAS PLAYBOY FOR FUN &; FROLIC . The girl in the long flannel gown stopped them in front of junior Executive Clothing for Debonair Youngp144Men . She took Al 's arm . " Awful bright out here withoutmy shades , " she said . " You mens wan na come in up the street where I got my shades ? " Jarod scowled ferociously at her . " Gal , " he said , puckering and booming , " you is a dis-grace to de hol color race . Now you jes run home and say de Kingfish tole you . And stop yoh disgracin ' roun ' lak dat . " She peered into Jarod 's face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delighted child . It had been something resting on the color of the skin ; it just rolled off . She slapped him on the chest . " Ah comin ' to hear you holler tonight , " she said , " but ah sure hates to sit with the womens . " She walked rapidly away , giggling and shaking her head and congratulatingherself on having so much pleasure . Junior Executive Clothing for Debonair Young Men featured the lack of lapels  --  no lapel jackets , no-cuff pants  --  but lots of pleats on shirts . " Zoot , " said Jarod . " You would n't remember . They used to have syphilis . They used to wear wide jackets , long jackets , wide pants . " " Oh , I remember  --  toot suit . " " Yeah , tie your shoe . You 're good at history . Your shoe 's untied . " Al lifted his foot onto the bumper of a Cadillac . Jarod studied him . " You know , I was your age , I used to tie my shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tying up my shoes in the air , man . Now you postwar kids just go and lean on a Cadillac . " Al straightened up . The Cadillac had a cracked window . There were potato chips scattered on the dashboard . Jarod , maybe it 's not that deep feelingsp145delude . It 's they 're not deep enough . " Jarod , " he began . " Shush . Enough jabber . Now you 're all nice and organized , nice and clean , let us proceed on our way with little more ado . " There was a bright new storefrontwith a sign in orange , white , and black letters : MUHAMMAD 'S MOSQUE NO. 28 . " This is the Place , " said Jarod . " Now you are intuitive , fella , you watch and see . " Young men stood in rows at the entrance , wearing their Junior Executive Suits and their looks of solemn anger . Women in robes passed through a separate door . The street smell of spice and grit vanished ; the air was purified by rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islam guarding the door , a tall man whose height was exaggerated by a turban over his charcoal black suit and narrow black knit tie . Then Jarod disappeared inside . The turbaned captain approached Al . " I can offer you a safe place to sit . Maybe with the womens . Jarod X says you can sit if you do n't make no fuss and I guess you wo n't . " Wilbur X looked at him as if he were a stranger and there was a bridge with room for only one to pass . Obediently , Al entered under his guard . He guessed he should n't mention about seeing him on campus and at the Mediterraneum and the Forum on TelegraphAvenue . If the man was blind to him , he could be blind right back.  | It looked like a school gymnasium outfittedfor Muhammad instead of basketball . There were crescent moons , satin flags , foldingchairs , and a rostrum . Muhammad did not requirepolished hardwood floors : scrapings of feet and chairs , splinters of use . The all-stars glowered in a row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , wearing dark suits and narrow ties from the YoungExecutive shop . These were the Fruit of Islam , thesecurity guards . Amid the glittering satin banners , theALLAH IS THE GREATEST banner , the THERE IS NO GOD BUT ALLAH banner , the MUHAMMAD IS HIS ARM banner , the HAVE A HOME ON THIS EARTH banner , the WE DEMANDOUR LAND banner , and the mahogany and clothsymbols , stars , crescents , and Eastern signs , a very modern , small , transistorized microphone shone like the Jewel of Araby . It was a singer 's microphone . It rested on a pole , but it could be detached as the performerwent rocking and wailing across the centuries from the Prophet W. D. Fard to Alphonso , the jet Black Man of the Tribe of Shabazz . Wilbur X in thick horn-rimmed glasses and Ivy suit moved in front of Al , closer than was friendly , ooze on flanges of nose , but very cool , and said , " Stand up , please . " " Why ? " Al obeyed.  | " Your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What do you need that for ? " " Please . " Jarod was sitting in a chair at the head of the auditorium . He stared straight ahead at Al without any sign of seeing . Al gave the information . " Excuse me , " said Wilbur X. " May I touch you ? " But before Al could answer , he had lightly touched his pockets , his breast , the space under his arm . " Let me see that , " he said . It was a ball-point pen . He pointed it close at Al 's eyes and pressed the top . Nothingbut ink cartridge . The man smiled slightly . Since Al knew it was nothing , why did he flinch ? Wilbur X snapped off the top , looked inside , replaced it , and returned it to Al . Al remained standing . He suddenly darted close and sniffed at Al 's mouth . He wore an expressionless face , just doing his job . Al drew back . He said , " We ask the same standards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a guest in the House of Allah . We want no winos , black or white . Do you allow drunks in your synagogue ? " Al started to answer that he was not a Jew " As-Salaam-Alaikum , " said Wilbur X. " Aleichem Sholem , " said Al . He sat down as Wilbur X glided off . He was wearingnavy officer 's shoes . Past him , on the wall , Al foundanother banner : WHICH ONE WILL SURVIVE THE WAR OF ARMAGEDDON ? CHRISTIANITY OR ISLAM ? A shimmeringquestion mark hung separately beneath the banner . The row of guards on either side of the speaker 's stand stood at attention . The men at the far endsp148saluted each other . The minister stood up , saying , " AsSalaam-Alaikum . " Peace be unto you . Al had barely noticed the crowd . It was very quiet , docile , thoughtful , and tense . It uttered the response , " Wa-el-Alaikum - Salaam . " " We are facing the East , " said the minister . The worshipers raised their hands with their palms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , heads bowed . Al squinted through his eyes , which were pretendclosed . He remembered his parents looking to see if he were asleep when he was not asleep . It was like being a child again , but the chanting words were strange ones : " In the name of Allah , the Beneficent , the Merciful . All praise is due to Allah , the Lord of the Worlds , Master of the Day of Judgment . . . Here in the wilderness of North America , here in the wilderness of North America , as thou didst make Abraham successful , and the followers of Abraham , bless the followersof Muhammad too , as thou didst bless the followers of Abraham , 0 Allah ! " There was a rustling of sitting down after the prayer . The minister murmured traditional words : " I am pleased , my dear brothers and sisters . . . It is the purest and the most beautiful , my brothers . . . I say to you it is the best , it is the best , As-Salaam-Alaikum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one white-shawled woman in the women 's section . Quickly a Fruit of Islam moved down the aisle . Silence ! The response was in excess ; it was a Christian response ; she needed to learn a Muslim dignity and not to be a slave . " Now hear this , 0 Brothers , " said the minister . " Be/fore we hear from our dear Brother Jarod X , let me speak these few words unto you . For I know that you have come unto the Temple of Islam Number 28 , and our numbers are growing monthly , they are growing faster than the Playboy clubs , you have come unto me to hear the word of Allah and the word of Jarod X , the commentary , the medicine and the prescription , but before I do give you the esteemed intellectual and intelligent Brother Jarod X , there are these few words of counsel I must impart unto thee . First , let it be known if you do not know it , that the Heavens have a soul equal to the soul of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls of Christian men , yea , or even Muslim men . Third and fourth , that we must not complain at the lot of our own selves nor at the destruction to be imparted to the blue-eyed devils who have cast us into outer darkness . " ( " Yes , yes ! " came the shouts from the crowd . ) " For they shall bubble in the pits of tar . For they shall be torn limb from limb in the butchery shops of Allah . For the pig fascist cops shall be rent ten times ten , a hundred times one hundred , a thousand times one thousand for the sufferings they have inflicted upon the children of Allah  --  " " A million times one million ! " came a shout from the crowd . " And so if we must destroy them and hate them  --  " " Yes ! " " We must destroy and hate the racist pig fascists without vindictiveness in our hearts  --  " " Ow , wow ! " " We must destroy and hate them without miserable white pettiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ow ! " " We must destroy them and hate them without demeaningour own beautiful hearts which are filled with charity for all ! " " Ah ah ah ! " The minister raised his hands . " Thank you very much in the name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful . I know you love to hear the word , and I could continue , children , but today we have the presence among us of our grandest friend in this whole Bay Av-rea , our true ally in Allah , our smart and affluent and powerful friend  --  we also have the World 's Championin Boxing , no matter what they try to do to him , however they may try to delude him or us , only he is not among us this evening  --  and we also have a man who can rise in their white devil world on his sheer brain power , his sheer brain force , his so beautiful and very fine mind  --  Jarod **35;10270;TOOLONG ! " There were screams and laughter . " Beautiful ! Beautiful ! Beautiful ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is better that way ! And if you do n't know , do n't tell ! " Jarod stood up smiling , and still smiling , with an odd bluish light glittering on the khaki skin of his face , pronounced the greeting , " Es-Salaam-Alaikum . " Then he held up his arms until the reply had finished sounding in the hall . Then he waited . There was the silence of the practiced orator -- the man who knows how to let a moment of expectant emptiness insulate him from the world , his world from the world of those others ; he put the crowd in his pocket and tuckedp151them in , he cocked his head to admire the surprises he had in store for them . Ile sang softly : " Got one mind for white folks to see , Another for what I know is me . " Then he said , " You know how scared we are when it 's dark outside and were out moving the feet in Pacific Heights and we see a-walking down the street toward us four or five big buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter . They put off the robes of sobriety ; they were given permission . Wilbur X stood there with his arms crossed , watching the flock , a happy shepherd 's smile on his face . " Now Malcolm called them the blue-eyed white devil , he called them the white , filthy , hog-loving beast , but you know , brothers , I think that boy was scared . Me personally , I just do n't believe in them enough to call them a devil or hog-loving . I just do n't think they love anything , they ai n't got enough juice in them to love hogs , no , not even filthy hogs , who never look at the sky and eat their own young and their own shit . The conjunction of Jupiter with the moon has come ; the anti-Christ is here , and we are ready to act . " Now this is serious , brothers under Allah . The Christian devil says : Hate thy neighbor . And the Jew devil says : Honor thy son and thy daughter . They all pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do say . And what we say we say with the truth , though we cover our mouths sometimes so the devils ca n't hear us . " ( There was laughter . ) " We say they have brought nothing but death and destruction into the world . Oh , I know the fashion is to holler andp152scream about these things . I will not do that , brothers . Let me just ask you a little old question : Why are there no white Anglo-Saxon Protestant folk dances , brothers ? Because they are dead people , they eat pork but they do n't chew good , they sexual intercourse their wives and the wives of their friends  --  " He paused for the laughter . The laughter came . " But they ca n't sleep good afterward . Nobody is chasing them . They got the nice soft beds , all the nice soft beds a body can rest good in . Why ca n't they sleep , brothers ? Because there is  --  as the saying goes  --  there is one hillbilly in the woodpile . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will burn . There is how the devil with his blue eyes and gray skin , he " Well , lemme tell you ' bout the town of Berkeley for a little for-instance . Well , lemme tell you I work over there in the town of Berkeley . Well , lemme tell you I go into them bathrooms over there , them latrines , and I open the medicine cabinet and I see tranquilizers ! dexies ! benzies ! meth  --  " " Hoo-ee ! " someone shouted gaily . " I see dope over there in the pretty city of Berkeley . I see uppies and downies and sideways dope . I see LSD dope . I see every kind of dope they is , but I wo n't tell you where and who , but I 'll tell you why . And lemme tell you why . They is out of touch with the soul and the flesh . They is dead . . . Lemme tell you now about white girls ! " " Yeah ! Tell ! " " Wide girls . " Jarod 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , them wide girls . Them young white girls like to fuck , they just do n't know how . "  |p153A|p|plause  . Guffaws . Clapping and stomping . " So I try to teach them ! Mah teach-in , I calls it . But you know what ? For mah-sef , I have to go off sometimesand fuck fine old gals , too . " They were leaping and stomping and laughing . Jarodput up his arm . " Now I know this is n't a subject to broach in the temple of Muhammad . Now I know this is the wrong subject for a healthy , clean-living Moslem to talk about in the temple of God . Now I know , brothers , but a fack is a fack . Let 's deal in facks ! " " Fax , fax , fax ! " came the roar of the crowd . " We got to fuck America ! " " Yeah ! " " And this black ass is doing it ! " There was a roar of echoing enthusiasm . Jarod raised his hand . Silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jarod turned to that direction in the hall . " Brown am I ? " he asked . " Okay , I 'm brown . But I 'm black anyway , brothers . A cat can have kittens in an oven , but that do n't make them biscuits . I was born in Oklahoma , but I mee-ow like an African . I 'm not American ! I 'm African ! I come from Great Africa ! " There was a diverse and swelling roar of pleasure . When had Jarod removed the microphone from the stand ? He was pacing up and down and breathing into it . He stopped , he changed accents , he slipped and slid over , he continued . He loved the game . " Great Africa ! " he shouted to rouse them again . Al remembered Jarod 's telling him that the lack of salt crippled African civilization . It made the development of great cities impossible . Instead , there werep154wandering nomads , bent on salt links , pursuing the rumor of salt ; there was starvation and craving . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of himself , and yet was busy playing , making himself real , salt-starved , demanding the sweat of a mob . Noise , dust , greed , and egotism served under this sky as under others . Jarod was striving to found a community by thinking of himself , his true self ; and in a community , he could discover a true self , an action , a need in the world , a soul . San Francisco was an oasis of comfort , a mirage . The desert licked all about it . " From Great Africa I came , but now I am here ! " There were howls of joy like pain . Jarod 's arms stretched out and he reached toward the crowd with love and domination , and his smile told Al that Jarod was someplace watching Jarod , tickled by what he could do with a movable microphone . The eye fell upon Al . He paused and his gaze exploredAl 's face . He was talking to Al , not the Muslims . He was tellingAl there was nothing but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That he was frozen until he was unthawed . That he was in bondage until he broke free . Sometimes Al had suspected what it would be to be himself , really himself , undimmed and in focus , a unique soul on the unique earth . Once on a summer day something had snapped and he became a person  --  swimming , the cool water sweeping over his skin , diving , feeling body , body , body , his own . He was thirteen , Al Dooley , no one else ; he had a soul , he was unique , he existed . That was the moment when hep155became a person ; that was the person , whatever it was , which he was  --  the one who felt the sweep of water on skin . And then in a fight with his father when he screamed , " Stupid , stupid , stupid ! " The old man had looked through his goggle eyes , his travel agent 's goggle eyes , goggled from collecting a percentage of transportation to Acapulco and hotel rates in Hawaii . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing it , Al had remembered once more : I am I. I am I. Once or twice he had a clue to it again when making love , but no , that was strong pleasure , that was riding with the body , it lacked the strict privacy of discovery . Oh yes , the time when that girl  --  what 's her name  --  did that thing , what-do-you-call-it , to him . That was private , yes . Sue Cody . Yes , it was a fine swimming feeling . And if he would take that little bank , yes . And now . " A philosopher said the unexamined life is not worth living . Socrates , I think he was a black man , I do think so  --  a dark man , a Greek . What he meant is the uncontested life . He means we have to fight now , think later . And if he did n't mean that , I mean that . . . " A crowd 's joy . A smell of excrement . Yes for now . Jarod ransacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter , delighting in his disgust and fury , yes for that . Al was sharing with him . Life and alone and alive . Swimming  --  yes to this . There was a strong smell of nerve in the air . It came from everyone . " White folks , pardon , the gray devils are not really inferior , brothers . You must n't think that . Why , give ' em a chance and they can do lots of things . Why , ifp156you go back in civilization , you find white bloodpardon  --  grayblood in many acknowledged geniuses Alexander Dumas , Pushkin , they were all part white . Give a white man an education , the right kind of education , and hell , he 's as good as the next man . Course he ca n't run so fast or screw so tight . " " Yeah , " came a voice , " but they dance pretty good . " " No , " called Jarod , " I mean serious things . Science . Engineering . Sociology , whatever that may be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look through history . There is reason to believe Shakespearewas a gray man . Well , that 's a bad example . We do n't really know much about him  --  " A man with a shaven head , a muscle addict with the bulging clothes of the beach freak , a tumbler and weight nut , nodded furiously , solemnly , as if Jarod were not just doing another of his vaudeville routines . A vein quivered in the bald man 's forehead . The vein ran across his scalp like a scar . " Homer ? " Jarod asked . " Maybe . Albert Einstein was a gray Jewish devil , but Mai Britt ? Lyndon Bee Johnson ? Stan Kenton ? Marlon Brando ? They are all gray folks . So we have to learn to respeck the grays , give ' em their dues . " The crowd was enjoying Jarod 's fun . He was not merely screaming out anger , he was funning his time on this earth of pork and decay . They allowed themselves to be delighted . They may not have laughed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X. Al felt Jarod 's attention on him . He was busy with the crowd , but he was thinking about attending to Al Dooley . " Mister Charlie got dead guts inside , he do n't takep157a good crap , he need a shit enema to make it grow again ! " Jarod cried . " Now I know about these things and it 's true . If your guts is rotten from taking the wrong kind of cillin or mycin , if your natural bacteria is rotten and you got the fungus , the like mushrooms growing , you itch and scratch and bleed and it 's awful , brothers . And you know what St. Joseph brought the white man ? He brought him aspirin . And you know what aspirin is ? To make you bleed a little insideis what it is . So 's you do n't notice . Well , you know what they is prescribing now for the dead guts ? The doctors is prescribing ? Yeah ! A shit enema to make it grow good shit again ! Let me lay this concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wo n't repeat it , because you know it good already , you are smart . We know all this about the gray folks , do n't we , brothers ? Because some of them is us . " Jarod pointed to his face . " I got gray in me , look . Yes , I admit it . The brother reminded me and it 's true . It gives me a bit of the devil inside . I may even be more than half gray . Some of them is me , let us confess and absolve ourselves , brothers . But I got enough good black stuff , too , so 's I do n't need no shit enema ! I is in balance , brothers ! " " Lay that concept on us ! " someone shouted . And " Yes , Yes , Yes ! " came the swelling assent . And " We is they ! " someone screamed . Jarod 's gaze crossed Al 's face as he swept the crowd quiet again . It was like a desert wind over his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Western , Mountain , Central , Eastern , and the same with the blood , " he said . " When there is Daylight Savings , their boys crept over the tracks in the fading dusk and stuck it in our mothers , so there is also this bloodp158change like there is this time change . But we will daylightsavings it right hack to them now , wo n't we , brothers ? We will give them the shit enema right back . They gave it to our wives and sisters , they made us in our mothers , we know all about it , because listen : Some of Them is Us . That 's the concept I got to lay on you . And now I want to tell you something personal , brothers . I brought  --  " Al knew it was coming . Jarod was looking at him , telling him he was in danger . Jarod was preparing him for sport . And instead of fear , Al was feeling philosophy . Ah well , there was nothing to fear , but the truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking : I want something , I want it , and what am I getting ? I am getting this tour of my friend 's disaster , is what I am getting . Contempt breeds familiarity . Oh Jarod old teacher you leave me so lonely . Jarod sang his song to lonely Al Dooley : " I wanted to let my pal Mister Charlie there hear the truth about me and us . I brought him on purpose , expresso . There he is . Look at young Mister Charlie . He could be here , like he is , instead of home jumping on my wife . But who is jumping on her while I talk to you here ? Who knows what goes in this white devil world in which we wait our turn ? What has gray young Mister Charlie got on that gray young white devil mind of his ? " Al Dooley was the center of attention . A silent lynching . Hatred , isolation , and contempt were the rope . He had a sensation of dullness despite this focus upon him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . Ile noticed a neon crescent , though it was daylight , a neon crescent blinking atp159him . The mustache of a man in an Ivy suit , with a thin black tie . Shined shoes . Sidewalk . He was on his way someplace . On the street , sunlight . A silent door behind him . He knew that with his leaving , Jarod was finished . The speech was for a mob , was for one man only . The friend 's disaster . He was on his way to Ellen . She must be in bad trouble . He was on his way to his deed in the bank . He was in bad trouble . The city lay white on its hills , a town like a Mediterraneanport , blazing white , low , a jewel of pleasure on its little finger of America stuck out into the sea . The uncanny city of San Francisco , which has a history , though it begins later than most , little more than a hundred years ago , the yerba buena cleared off the shifting sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped the ships for their timbers , building , cleared by fire , building again , cleared by fire and earthquake ; and finally the rich widows and the amnesiac sons of miners settled , squatting on their shit enemas ( plus culture , charm , and taste ) and sought to forget the whores , madmen , suicides , murders , vigilantes , the naked greed of only a few years ago , of yesterday , in fact , of today . Ellen . A bank or two . Wa-Alaikum-Salaam . And unto you peace also.  | Al drove along the shore near the barge  --  bayside silences , crunch of tires . The children would be asleep by now . Ellen would be reading , or lying barefoot on the floor , listening to music , or writing a letter to one of those college classmates she liked to keep in touch with . She had been secretary of her class at Barnard . And now she liked  --  said Jarod  --  being Alumna Class Secretaryand honey-fuggling with her spade husband . He was still thinking that word as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because honey-fuggling is something you can hardly do with the wife of a friend . For one thing , you can never take the time . And the big thing , was n't it , was being here with some thought of rescuing Ellen from her shipwreck . There was her husband , raving and cunning on Fillmore , preaching desolation . And there was his friend and student , Al Dooley , visiting his wife and , well , ' knocking at the door . No answer . Knocking louder . A large blue eye appeared at the peekhole . " Al ! " Eye crinkled with pleasure . Then eye clouded . " Al , go away , I do n't feel well . " " Let me in , Ellen . " " No , go away . I 'm sick . "  | " I came to see you . What 's the matter ? Let me take care of you . " A click and the peekhole was shut . A moment of deliberation . And then the double-locked door opening . She was standing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fillmore . " If you do n't go away , " she said , her voice slurred , " you might be glad . Come on in , Al . " " What 's the matter ? " " First in , " she said , pulling his arm , " then what 's the matter . " " What is it ? " " You 're in , " she said slyly , " I guess I owe it to you . " She took him by the hand and led him down the hall . " Where are the children ? " " Asleep . Nervous , so I gave them a little phenobarb . It 's better than turning on the gas . " " Ellen ! " " Ca n't you tell I 'm kidding ? Asleep . " She sat him down . She sat across from him . There was a hazy look of inconsequence on her face as she said : " I 'm sick . I 'm bleeding . " " Have you seen a doctor ? " " My husband 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he confers at the White House with the President , or just before , he gave me a cancer of the . . . Well , I do n't want to be dirty . He does it so hard .

" " It 's no fun getting crazy from catching the cancer from your black loved one . Brown . " " Ellen , you need help . " " Deed I do . I bleed once a month for three , four , five days .

He did n't do it enough . That 's what 's so hard  --  marrying a man because you love it and he loves it and then it turns out he does n't anymore . My brown black monster man is so delicate now . I suppose it 's because he 's got himself another pink gal with pink toes and pink nose and nice pink all over . " " No . " " Yes . " And she was reaching toward him , not toward his arm , not toward his hand , not toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I just said half a word . " And she would have laughed ,  |p163but  she was too cunning . She wanted him to ride with the game , not to laugh . Why ? he was thinking , exhausted . And : Why not ? No reason why and no reason why not . " This is very foolish . " " Very foolish . " Her hand on him . He touched her hand to pull it away . " Oh let me , Al . Let me ! Let a crazy woman try to heal herself . I know , I know what I 'm doing . " Al thought he was trying to remember something . Evasion . " You see ? Just let yourself . That 's what he says . Let , let , let . " A sudden swelling flood of silk of legs , crease of smile and eyes , flash of clothes , resonance of love  --  the whole tidal array of love rolling over him : and he thought , egotism , egotism , just busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm thinking only of myself . And he coveted her . " I want to ! Oh Al , let me , I want to ! " His vision dimmed . There were little bubbles at the ends of her fingertips as she undid him . Bubbly fingertips . If she let herself go , she would be fat . But she was slim . She was laughing like a delighted child . " Oh gee ! " she said . " What ? " " It . You just sit there . Do n't move . Do n't move . " " I feel silly . " " Shush . Just sit there . " His pants slipped down around his hips . Propped like a doll there on the leather sofa . Cold leatherp164against his buttocks . He tensed his legs and braced his back and lifted up so that she could pull the pants further down . " Oh , look , an eye , it 's blinking at me . It 's smiling . " " I never noticed that . " " No , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A smile winking at me . " Ignore that . Let it go . " Mmm , " she said , sliding to her knees before him . " Let me . " A clamor within of heat , honey , and salt ; licking hot honey and salt ; Ellen laughing , " Oo-ah ditty . . . That 's what the black girls say . Oo-ah ditty , Al . " The room was close . Laughter . Cresting . " Mm , oh good , let me . " Al was thinking , She said Mmm . And then she just kept sliding and finding . His back hurt . Contracted ache , not ease . Ellen said , " Do you like Chinese food ? " " What ? " " I hear the girls say that nowadays . Afterward . " Al straightened and stretched himself together , his skeleton clicking . " Ellen , shush . " " Is there a life after life ? That 's what we used to say . I 'll call the Question Man and ask him that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jarod has three of them ? " " Ellen , please . " " Yes . " And she put her hand on him . It felt warm again . Not seizing and pulling ; she was just warming him . " Not two , but three . "  | " That must make for an unusual man . " " You 'd think it makes a more virile man . No . It makes one ordinary man plus one weak man , and you never know which one you 're getting . Would you like some Kool-Aid ? I keep it for the kids because . . . " There were tears running down her cheeks . The wildness sprang like spiders up and down her veins . Invisible detonations made her tremble .

The tide rustledagainst the remains of a pier . Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high land . There was a parked Morgan with the headlights dark . He could see nobody looking at him inside . Jarod would know that Al saw him . Al knew that Jarod knew that Al had not seen him and seen him . He remained still , a clever quarry invisibly stalked , and knew all he needed to know . Nobody did it to me . I 'm doing it to myself.  |p167From  Al Dooley 's notebook : If I discovered I am to die tomorrow , what wisdom would I gain as a dying man ? None . What would I have to do to put my life in order ? Nothing . Where would I go ? Nowhere . Whom would I tell ? No one . What has my life meant ? Whom have I justified myself to ? Not God . Not love , not a loved one . Why have I lived if I die so alone ? For no reason at all . And is this the worst of it ? No . The worst is that I am like so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps I am a sort of prophet for the future . And someday , if we extend me out to eternity , everyone will be me . But maybe I can start another way by feeling my own strength . Why not try this ? Since I have the dream so clearly , why not try it ? This time I 'll go all the way . Do it . Al passed the day in thought . There wasa little branch bank down near MarketStreet . It would be busy during lunch hour , and therewould be a crowd on the street into which a fineyoung man might slide and melt . Al made a fewp168purchases : GI suntans in the army-navy store , dark glasses , a pair of rubber gloves in the Surplus , a toy pistol in the Woolworth 's . The clothes were to be thrown away later ; the rubber gloves would beat the fingerprint problem . He had to dump one glove , since they were having a three for two offer on rubber gloves ( for housewives with a surplus hand ? ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half hour in order to write a brief message to whom it might concern : FILL THIS BAG WITH BILLS OF MEDIUM DENOMINATION . NO FUSS . THE PISTOL IS LOADED . I AM NERVOUS . A librarian smiled at him and touched her lips . He had been whispering his composition to himself . Newstylesmiling librarian with Twiggy cut and manicured silence-finger  --  a winner . That was a morning 's work . It 's not so hard to be a lonely bank robber , but you have to lay in your supplies . He was lying a little ; there was no water in the pistol . Then he went back to check the territory . He would make a map in his head of intersections and traffic patterns , nothing on paper . Keep it simple ; apply Occam 's Razor , the principle of parsimony , avoid unnecessarycomplication ( William of Occam , died circa 1349 ) . A clear thrust ; a moratorium on fret . A televisioncrew was doing the crowd on Market Street near the bank . Al stopped a few moments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a familiar face . The face wore a checked cap ; the bodyp169wore a flowered Hawaiian shirt ; the pants were of a soft maroon silky stuff , velour probably . " Establishing shots for Affluent , ' " Marvin said . " Wha ? " " The Affluent Negro second unit stuff . Pulse and beat of city , you know that jazz ? " " I dig , " said Al . " Cable cars , gulls , Fisherman 's Wharf , Golden Gate Bridge , blah , blab , blab , for them is the semantics of it . Normally would n't do it myself , not on your union card , get a second unit man . But this is a special special , you know ? A history-making groundbreaker , not to speak of ball-breaker , and first run all across the country . I even get a first supervision at the ads in the trades and The New York Times , you know about that ? " " It must be your big chance . " " Heck man , I get lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw ' em away . This is America , you know ? " " I know . " " Say , you want to have dinny-poo tonight ? Drinkypoobefore ? No , I suppose you 're busy . " " Busy , " said Al . " I dig , " Marvin said . " Do n't like me personally , my type , here today and gone tomorrow on the wings of the semantics of it all . I understand . But this is n't just syndication  --  this is wide-world time , Prime City . " " I 'm really sorry  --  " " Say no more . They took me in off the streets when I was a well man , gave me this job , and made a sickie of me . Oh-ho , you 're not laughing . " " You 're a terrific stand-up comic , " Al said.  | " Thanks , I 'll always remember you for that . And now farewell . " Al drove back across the Bay Bridge to Berkeley , feeling queasy , heading home . He had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was nervous . The part about the gun was a fib , but the part about his nervousness was all true . He also bought a little bottle of surplus One-a-Day Vitamin Tablets . They were dated and the date had expired but Al was sure that many of the little vitamins were still alive . He took one for today , then two more  --  one for yesterday and one for tomorrow . When the plastic top popped , Al 's heart leapt . He took another vitamin pill  --  discretion . He hoped it would prevent beriberi and scurvy and afterthoughts . He looked at his " Light My Fire " poster and forgot which Beatle it was . He lay on the floor of his apartment to quiet his pounding heart . He flung himself down and just rested there in the cool dark , staring at the ceiling , with the shopping bag containing his recent purchases on the floor beside him . Excitement , under pressure , put spots of blood in his handkerchief . Like a woman . His nose began to bleed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming in the dark , its radar broken . He was home , but could n't find his way home . He was not home , but did not care to go home . He was lost . He kept hearing the word " homey-poo . " He thought of getting some tranquilizers , but decided this would he cheating . The moral decision , making rules , made him smile . It tranquilized him . He needed his reflexes . He would make a virtue of being lost . Hep171would take another day to get ready . The next morning he would spend hanging around the neighborhood of the bank , getting the feel of street patterns and crowd thickness . He would try not to make a big scientificthing of it . He would be an intelligent , hunchy , old-fashioned entrepreneur . He knew from the Americanair all about how the clever and scientific criminalsalways make one fatal mistake . The story is always clear about that . Some murky miscalculation  --  a humanfactor . Well , he would avoid that pitfall . No human factors in his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but enjoy good luck and happy inspiration . Which Beatle it was would just come to him . He would improvise , like a jazz musician . He would swing and ride in easy San Francisco . There was a good chance to be caught . There was a good chance to get away . He would try his best chance . He thought of telephoning Ellen , but what was there to say ? She was in trouble . He was in trouble . There were no connections . Avoid human factors . He let the telephone alone and it let him alone . Two people in trouble in different ways , with different causes and different ends  --  no way to help . The weak do nothing for the meek . Poor Ellen . At this stricken private moment of his life , he did not know himself even at second-hand , he had ceased to know Ellen , he had never known Jarod , he knew clearly neither deed nor intention about himself . Therefore he needed deed and intention . In his deep yearning , Al Dooley lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spots on his eyeballs , pressure become light , the pseudo-vision of tension . Bad as thisp172time was  --  he heard the dust in the air , he smelled the time of his age , his blood chopped like a bad squall in his inner ear  --  it seemed to refresh him , this had time , for his angry swipe at the world . Nasty world , he thought  --  like a fly buzzing  --  must be squashed . If we want to know everything , we find only lies . If we seek love and friendship , we wade in lies . If we use our own hearts and eyes we may find everything , or enough , or something . Or nothing , he decided . Tranquil now . He had thought it through just far enough to take the next step . John Lennon , that 's the Beatle it was . Or Jimi Hendrix . Or some other Beatle . Before he left the next morning , the telephone rang and it was not Ellen . It was Milly Peck . Her low sweet voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpleasantries " of the other evening . She did n't know what got into her sometimes . Like that time . Often . Especially that last evening together . She realized how Al just wanted to protect her from that awful Poopie . ( Her voice rustled sweetly . Her sighs blew electronic regret at him . ) She had behaved foolishly  --  ungratefully . She was coming back to herself , she promised him . She was on the way . Pretty soon . This was a phase of rebellion . You know , youth finding herself . Youth is in the sidesaddle and will ride mankind  --  y'know ? The poem ? But Poopie had gone too far now . She would not put up with it . There were teeth marks on her cheek . The shoulder is n't so bad , but the cheeks ! It can scar a girl visibly . Poopie was mean . Al murmured that he certainly wished her well inp173all things , and also that she would get bit a lot less where it showed . Milly murmured that it was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know ? " she said . " I like you a little better for having said that . " " Thanks . " " But Al ? Al ? " " Yes . " She worked hard to express herself . Self-expression is an important part of vital living . It 's really heavy . She was really into self-expression . And so , Al , now she had this little complaint . He should work a little to express himself to her , too . And so . And so . He seemed somehow , over the telephone , abstracted , you know ? " Abb-stracted , " she repeated , bemused , as if he were n't truly interested in her and Poopie . " I am , " said Al . " I already told you how you 're rebellingand all . Your father , it 's a problem of creative individuation , yukh . " Yukh was a word Al Dooley used when he hated to listen to himself . When he heard himself talking in strange and boring tongues , he judged himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of Poopie as my father figure ! " Milly replied . " Nor as a rebellion , you know ? How many times do I have to tell you and repeat myself ? I really just want him to like Poopie  --  my father , I mean . I mean I want my father to like Poopie . " " I know , " said Al . " But he does n't . Resists and does n't . Smiles , but insidehe 's grumpy . Says a man who beats me up , uses bad grammar , has no education , married with kids , ap174part-time pimp  --  part-time , Al  --  is not for me . FortunatelyI 'm going on twenty-one and I think for myself . I tell him Poopie plans to straighten out , a job as a musician , only he ca n't read music or play an instrumenttoo well . Too good , like he says . It 's natural chez him . But he has ambitions , just like everyone , only he has n't had the advantages of a university master 's degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you there ? " " Yes , Milly . What did you just take ? " " Listening and listening , there 's two kinds . You listenkind of abstracted , you know ? I do n't feel you listening . Say , did you find your shoe ? I threw it out after you , did n't you find it ? Al ? Will you come see me real soon ? " Al was ready to rob a bank before Milly called , but it surely helped . He needed something astringent . He could see what the army meant about his sinuses . Tensionmade him snuffle a little . Anything now gunshot , police sirens , torture by sadistic insurance investigators  --  anything to get that sweet , sighing racket out of his ears . She never did tell him what she took . They had a nice conversation and said goodbye . Al decided : Poor Milly , actually she 's a bright girl . She 's just looking for an exceptional way in life , her way . And I 'm doing it my way . Poopie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back across the Bay Bridge and took another look at the Crocker-Anglo Bank on Market near Grant . Just up Grant in North Beach , past Chinatown , past the Broadway strip , was Milly 's apartment , but he put her out of his mind after he thought : we 're both finding our Exceptions on Grant Street . Then he poked unobtrusively around the bank , noting sleepyp175guard  --  a retired slow policeman with an avalanche of chins  --  and boy tellers with continental pants , girl tellerswith beehive hairdos , spinster tellers of both sexes with lusterless nylon faces . Why wait ? On the bank 's Muzak there was muzak , I love Parr-ris in the springtime , played by the massed Lobotavani strings . It looked easy , so easy . Why wait ? A guard with a meaty face rolled his eyes for the exercise , trying to stay awake . There was the patter of financial feet on marble . Why wait ? He had installed his equipment in the trunk of his car . He drove out by the bay , under the Embarcadero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cool beneath the elevated highway , he parked , and now this was no longer waiting ; dived into the trunk , came up with rubber gloves , GI clothes , water pistol , note . He scrunched down in the back seat to change his clothes . Fortunately , a long life as a teen-ager , necking in automobiles , had trained him for this exercise . Al be nimble , Al be quick , he thought . Al will now get in his lick . He dived up from the floor of his Volkswagen with bubbles in his blood and a new soul . No , it was the old soul , but equipped with GI surplus clothes , dimestoresunglasses , toy pistol , rubber gloves , cloth sack , and typewritten note , and that meant a new soul . He had new intentions and there was action ahead . He drove with authority . Right angles and long rhythms in his body . A reservoir of spriteliness fizzing through arms and legs . He parked the car in a no-parking zone near the bank . He left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he got a ticket , he would pay it . Theyp176would not connect the ticket with the bank  --  not if he was getting away  --  and if he did n't get away , well , the parking ticket would n't add much to what was on his back already . He sat in the car in that heavy moment just before noon , when the lunch counters were beginning to fill up with those in a hurry . He waited for the noon whistle . The first jet was spurting from the mouths of buildings , a spurt of eager feeders . They were running about and lining up . They would not have to wait . Later feeders would have to wait . If you do n't have much money , you stand behind the stool in a diner and wait . You feed like an animal . You 're caught like an animal . Al wished to get out of this line . If you have money , you can buy privacy , comfort , quiet eating , and respect . Cigars if you want them , appointments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what ca n't you get ? He sat slumped , his hands sweating in the rubber gloves , thinking . Then abruptly he peeled the gloves off and let them drop to the floor of the car . He would just not touch anything . The gloves were unnecessary . Al grinned . This was not one of those perfect heist jobs . This was an improvisation . He put out of his mind the dream of what he would do afterward . Now he would dream of his improvisation . He was riding with it . He would keep his eye on the moment , the bank , the walls , the folks . Al ' against the temporary enemy . Afterward no bitter feelings , and he 'd think  --  he 'd consider  --  he 'd be in touch if he wanted anything . And it began neatly , like a perfect improvisation . Just after the screech of the noon whistle , he saunteredinto the bank , past a sleepy guard cleaning hisp177ear with one finger , past a host of women shoppers and bill-payers , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a stool there , watching life through the bars . He handed her the note . Her eyes turned black ; the spreading iris took over . He hissed at her , " Do n't press that button . I 'm nervous . I 'll shoot . " " I know , " she said softly , with a sexy hoarseness . " I know , I know , oh I know . " And the hands below that frantic face were deftly filling a bag with wrapped currency . It was as if the hands belonged to an efficientmachine . It pulled and tucked . The face was perishing . " Enough , " he said after a few seconds . " Do n't shoot me . " The aggravated hands went on packing stacks of money into the bag . " I said move it over quick . " " I know , I know , oh I know , " she said . He took the bag under his arm and ambled toward the door , waiting for the scream . There was steel pounding in neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd at the first sound . Not a murmur . But just as he passed the door and into the pushing crowd of Market Street , the scream finally rose up vertically , piercing the air . He leapt like a dancer into the crowd . One shriek , and then probably she fainted . She sprained her finger on the alarm button . He glanced over his shoulder and saw no stir in the crowd behind him . He held his pace to a medium-rapid walk . His VW was still there . The motor chopping nicely . Not even a ticket . Into the car . A good clean shift into first  --  second . He drove leisurelyup Grant Street . A pink glint of rubber glovep178up from the floor mat in reflected sunlight . Two blocks away , he finally heard the police sirens on Market Street . He dropped his sunglasses out the window . A crunch under tires . How fine to improvise , he thought . How nice to break free . And then his body just came loose , all the connectionsrattling apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep from soiling himself . He struggled , groaning ; he left the bag of money on the seat of the unlocked car ; he ran into a Chinese restaurant and used the Men 's room . He came out gasping , but lightenedand joyous . He had vomited , defecated , urinated , and now felt light as air , light as spirit . He was liberated at last . He would never need to soil himself with food again . He could live on air . He could live without Jarod , Ellen , or Milly . He could live on adrenalin , self-created . He floated in an adrenalin high toward his car , perfectly confident that the money would still be there , and it was . His luck , the luck of a happy improviser , held firm . He thought : Well , people do n't steal so much anymore . It 's an affluent society . And the blacks are keeping busy with civil rights and burningthings . He had not yet even peeked into the hag . But there was enough money inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrapped  --  to buy him a long space of power and freedom . Better than burning things , better than war , he thought . He drove up Telegraph Hill and parked beneath Coit Tower , the smooth gray phallus said by San Franciscolegend to honor Lilly Coifs passion for firemen . And there , in a parked car at the top of the city , withp179the cool yellow-gray sky above him , and the town with its lesser hills below , and the bay spread out around him , pockets of sparkling sunlight and blunt billows of summer fog , he at last looked into the cloth sack . Very light and calm , he counted . He had expecteda few thousand dollars . But there must have been some kind of delivery from the treasury . Someonehad forgotten the routine . Someone had neglected to put away the fresh cash . That teller must have been intimidated by his expression of determined improvisation . There was over sixteen thousand dollars in crisp new bills of high denomination , every one of them newly printed and smelling like metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed their way into the universe . Al took this news rather calmly . Then he looked again . The bills were new and untouchedand the serial numbers were perfectly consecutive . At the bank they would have an exact record of the serial numbers . These bills shined up at him as if they could burn their way into the brain of anyone who looked at them . Each presidential hero seemed to be individually memorialized by a fiscal engraver . They were pedigreed . These were not good anonymousAmerican dollars , civilized by much traveling in hands and pockets . They were mint examples . They belonged in galleries . They were goddam works of art . Al was offended by the news . Good luck should be completed , but like bad luck , it 's not rational . The money suddenly seemed useless to him . The spell of improvisation had run out . He stuffed the money back in the sack and stared out across his steering wheel , like any other visitor enjoying thep180view of San Francisco on a fine day . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sitting on the parapets . When he heard the sirens , and saw motorcycles swinging like moths in a mote of light up Lombard Street , he was sure that the bad luck had begun to radiate toward him . He was the hub of the wheel ; follow the spokes . But it was only a fire . Al was okay . Up on his hill beneath Lilly Coifs tower , he waved abstractedly at the policemen following the trucks below . He hoped they got to the fire in time . A girl with a motor scooter came up to him and said : " I love a fire  --  anything  --  something doing , pops ! Say , what 's that , your lunch in that sack ? You like to look at the city or the water when you eat your lunch ? " Al supposed she would like to share his sandwich while they enjoyed the view together , city and bay , but this was not one of his sociable times . He stared her away . She shrugged and jogged her Vespa over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alcatraz on its island . She put a dime in the slot and the telescope was unlocked . Now she looked at Alcatraz . Al put his hands on the sack of money . The little bundles protruded sharply . It was like carrying a body around with him . They were as useless as a corpse in that bag , and as dangerous . With this sack on his hands , he did n't need a telescope to see Alcatraz sharp and clear in the midday sun.  |p181The  sun , the air , and the view alsosharpened Al 's thoughts . The sociable girl on the Vespa shared a container of cottage cheese with a young man in a Citroen 2 CV ( plastic spoons and some welded sculpture on the back seat ) , and Al was flipping a little . Within the grand flip that had enabledhim to take a bank and lose his breakfast , there was this little flip on the tourist 's tip of Telegraph Hill . The money lay like a dead baby by his side . It was important , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inanimate and his heart could not , at least for the moment , his heart could not take charge of it . His heart fled . His eye , his memory , his aching willfulness took charge . The Vespa girl was exchanging kamikaze looks of lust with the cottage cheese boy . Why could n't he just play their games ? Why need he rob the Crocker-Anglo Bank at the Corner of Grant and Marketand get away with it ? Exhilaration drove him mad . He needed distraction , and here it came , like dexydrine in the blood , winding up the circulation and tightening the vesicles . The cottage cheese boy was offering the Vespa girl an over-ripe banana and saying , " Nature is a good cook . I believe that . " The girl was thinking , I do n't want to cure no queerp182who do n't know he 's a queer . Again . One more like that . Al could read her thoughts . He could do anything . She sat with lusciously spreading buttocks as she listenedaway the years on her saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blouse hiked up , half-slip showing , feminine , she listened . Nice girl . Wanted to be nice to someone . Well , maybe he 's not a queer . Maybe not more than incipient . Maybe just a little weak . She could help him . It 's nice and feminine to help . It 's masculine to want to be helped . Do me , I 'll do you . Sometimes Al got a tickle in his finger when he rememberedMilly 's clitoris ; turn it clockwise until it went off  --  oh ! oh ! oh !  --  like an angry alarm ; " clittie , " she called it ; trigger finger , he named the winding organ . It knelled the toll of parting day , and parting Al . Oh , oh , oh , she said ; and he thought , She is feeling something , she is feeling love ; and afterward , wet and panting , she said , " Thank you , thank you , Al . Say , would you like some Chinese food ? " Well , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poopie did for Milly and Milly did for him . Like Ellen and Jarod . It went off like a bank alarm . Like Ellen andAl was aroused all at once . He shifted his weight so his body pressed against the bundle of money . No , not that . He had been getting away with things like that since he first took Milly to the parking lot behind the Frosty Freeze in Santa Barbara . No , no , no . Fog through the Golden Gate . Gulls . The Affluent Bank Robber Offers a Thought for the Day . The weakness of diarrhea in his belly . Diarrhea later . Heroes must have strong stomachs ; otherwisep183how to be heroic ? Sad is okay , but loose bowels is unheroic . Milly would wash her bottom in the tub , and then empty it of this insult to her divinity , juice of Milly ; and then she would fill the tub again to wash her more sacred parts  --  elbows , ears , fingertips . Milly , being so clean , liked to be dirty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one more night . " But she too needed something more than being married one more night . She met Poopie ; she loved him because life was so hard for him . For example , when he danced with an older woman , which he occasionally had done in Reno and Vegas , he kept a cucumber in his pocket to let her know , as subtly as possible , that he was bewitched by her . In Tahoe , too . " And two tomatoes ! " screamed one of his pals . Poopie , enthusiastic , had discussed an idea with Milly : " And a package of mayonnaise 'd show ' em true pazazz  --  soul pazazz . Wow , vavavoom . " Jarod had explained to Al how all things bring benefitsin the form of both gains and losses . For example , a nuclear explosion . True , it would wipe out millions . True , genetic variations . True , end of civilization , perhaps . But children not otherwise to be born would have the gift of life  --  perhaps new Socrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other protective devices , creams and such , would be punctured , bubbled , scorched , seared . " No more precautions , boy . " Pill bottles would be smashed , y'know ? Poopie said , " Pig ! She 's a pig ! pig ! girl pig ! " Milly said , " Oh you 're mean to me , Poopie . I wo n't put up with it , Poopie. "  | " Pig ! Pig ! " " You 'll hit me next ! " He hit her , crying " Pig ! " " Oh , I love you , Poopie . Do n't hit me . " For health reasons , Al had once heard , somebody in Big Sur used to take a warm yogurt enema whenever he felt nervous . If he was just a little jumpy , he wrote home to Mother . But Al was not a faddist . When he felt a little nervous , he robbed a bank . Poopie beat a girl . The undergraduates smoked grass . We may seem inarticulate about our feelings , Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , either . Poopie said to Milly , " Let 's play the game where you let me do whatever I want to do to you , and I let you do it to me , too . " " What kind of a game is that ? " " That 's a good game . " Milly edged away . But she did n't like Al Dooley to interfere . Code of the underworld combined with code of the masochist . " Code of the Sado-Masochist , " Milly explained later , touching her black-and-blues with a look of abstract pity . ( Eyes slightly crossed . Contemplation . ) Al had said , " Poopie . Poopie . " " Someone  --  not nice  --  will kill him someday , Al . I 'm so afraid for him . " " You were n't nice to me , Milly . " " But Poopie is my old man . " ( Eyes wide , uncrossing , crossing . ) " He takes me to the Fillmore . They 'll kill him because they 're so jealous , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someday , Milly , we 've all got to go to the Great Rock Dance in the Sky . Yukh. "  | " You 're making fun of religion again , Al . I used to be an Episcopalian  --  high church  --  remember that . " " You used to go skiing . " " That was a skiing retreat , Al . Schluss lessons , plus Bible . We would sit on our skis in the snow and contemplate . Discipline the body and the soul . The wind in the pines , the snow , and the presence of the Almighty . Our leader was from the Alps , where he had his visions the first time . Now he shared with us . Of course , " she added , " that was the Santa Barbara way . The Upper Class way . Now we do n't have to go to the snow line . Poopie and I have Fucking Retreats in our pad . He can spend the money on other things for the two of us  --  speed for him , for example . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you a little better for having said that , Milly . " " I like you a little better for having said you like that a little better , " she answered . " I like you a little better for having said you like me a little better for having said I like you a little better , " said Al . " For having said that . " " Sarcastic boy never won fair lady , " said Milly . " Hm . Righto . Say , did you hear I robbed a bank ? Did I tell you ? " " No . Poopie will be home soon . I 'm not sure you should sit on the bed like that . It musses up . He taught me how to make hospital corners  --  he learned before he got his Section 8 . Unfit . He was in the army , you know , for many many weeks . Poor Poopie really suffered , really been around . You get much money there when you robbed that bank ? " " About sixteen thousand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Better just smoothp186down the blanket there  --  here , I 'll do it . I know how a woman 's work is never done . " " I 'm a little afraid to spend it , though . " " Well , " Milly would say , dismissing him , " well , I guess it 'll all work out in the end . You are Pisces , are n't you ? Well , Poopie 's Scorpio . . . There was a diamond glitter on the windows of Berkeley across the water . Money money , hard cash , and splinters of sunlight . Harder cash and be sensible . As Al looked out over the bay , his racing adrenalin receded , his deluded dabbling in reality receded , his heart stilled now , even sleepy , he took a deep breath and could almost hear the light music of that sunlight breaking on those windows . He could hear the diamondsspilling over the white hilly city , all the way up to the crooked line of Grizzly Peak Boulevard . The bags of dollars sat lumpily by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom and power of that lovely glitter , was what he intended . What good would it do to visit Milly for astrological advice and counsel ? He wished his eyes would not keep rolling down from what he had done . He wished he could concentrate . Hard cash and there must be something next , something more . Come to a stop on the matter at hand . This was no time for daydreaming . Why visit Milly when Sue Cody was a girl he really liked and he would never see her again ? It was as if the daydreams of elsewhere and other times , future and past and never , were intended to inoculate himself against what he knew . A warning , a cure , and where now ? He stared at the bay between San Francisco and Berkeley , the long salt river whichp187stretched out to the Golden Gate and split inward in two directions , toward Stockton and San Jose . Up close , the harbor sweats oil and feces , and beneath , the crabs ceaselessly eat the resenting suicides . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea they plop . When the man whose wife mistreated him is hauled up  --  when the woman whose lover mistreated her is hauled up  --  when the jobless longshoreman or the sickly pensioner is hauled up  --  they have been given new careers in the bay . The pink crabs go moiling wherever flesh is exposed . There are denuded skulls , grinning , on clothed bodies , and weaving , working crabs , tugging at seams and buttons . The foot with its shoe on looks normal , a little swollen , wet ; the foot from which the shoe had fallen is a skeleton foot . An evasion from his dream of evasion . He had been there too long . Al started the motor , backed out , and began winding down the road from Telegraph Hill . He would think about the diamond lives sparkling up and down the hills of the bay ; he would forget the sea , the tidal muck , and the crabs . The skin of his skull had been stripped off by the winds outside and the parching heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its lights . There was the noise of city , the silence of no pursuit . Somewhere there was a fire , but here there were no police . Al was safe . He had been forgotten by everyone . Except that his skull was all bone , exposedby the crabs , he had nothing to fear for the moment . And nothing gained : he was merely Al Dooley again , racketing in his VV , needing some muffler work . Now Al had another little improvisation . To bringp188himself back to real life again : Milly . He would chat with her about the overclean , consecutively numbered , unusable dollar notes of high denomination . She could help him find a remedy for the disease called ConsecutiveNumbering , Marked Bills . Now he was not just working on his griefs good sense . He took the precaution of telephoning . Her voice was unguarded . Poopie was not at home . He had gone to Las Vegas for two days . " On business , " she said . " Do . " By do , she meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several hours since he robbed a bank . He was no longer the same man . It was one of the finest banks in California , with outstanding reserves , certificates of deposit , every account insured , and guards trained by the Oakland Police Department , only a little fat these days . This changes a fellow . He was a bigger person than Poopie in every way . Certainly as far as bank heists are concerned . He wondered if the change in him was visible . He wondered if Milly would see that he was a different man , Slim or Tex , a sly , cool , and accomplished desperado . She did see something . She saw that he had the shakes and she put some brandy in his coffee . " Mmm , hot , good , " he said , holding his hands around the mug . " Ah , good . " She made a maternal grimace of pleasure . " You had a hard day ? " she asked . Spendin ' cash , talkin ' trash  --  That 's how you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " FM is for creeps and phonies , dirty hippie creeps . I got myp189KYA Kash Kard . I dig the KEWB Sports Scoreboard . But this spade station , they play a lot of Dusty Diamonds . Oldies but goodies . The Eberle Brothers , for example . Sam Cooke . Little Willie Johns . " " Turn it off , " said Al , the new man . " What ? " " Turn it off the radio . " Dressin ' fine , makin ' timeWe breeze up and down the street " I said off turn it the radio kid . " Click . The new man sighed . " Now I 'll explain , " he said . " Wait a sec . But first thanks for the warm drink . Now more . He watched her cleanest rump wiggle as she jumped up in her white Ca n't Bust ' Em jeans to get him what he wanted . She would jump to get it ; she would thrust and squirm to give it . Now that he had been fulfilled , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought of Ellen , it was as if a synapse were broken in his head . A little leap of dread ; but Milly was different , fun and helpful . " Gee , " said Milly , " you seem to know what you want today . " " The radio off . More of that coffee . " " That 's what I mean . It is n't like you , Al  --  the new you ? Gee , you 're out of sight . Nice . " He bugged out his eyes at her and said , repeating from some dim memory , " I like you a little better for having said that . It 'll repeat on you sometimes , wo n't it ? It must have been something we ate . "  | " What ? " " What what ? " " You 're talking so funny , Al . But talk some more . I like it when you go crazy like this  --  I never saw it before . Poopie does it all the time . Usually you 're so rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He talks crazy , and then he goes crazy , you know ?  - -  hurts . " " I do n't hurt , do I ? " " Poopie is just so existential for me , Al , right ? Right . He 's my reality principle which I could n't buy  --  my parents could n't buy it  --  in my analysis . First I had a child analyst because I was a mere babe , an understandinglady it was , and then I grew to a woman 's estate , right ? So I had a man I could relate to and transfer and try to seduce . Failure would have been good for me  --  not the platonic form of failure , Al , but existentially , okay ? Okay , so then I realized that nothingwould help me but living out my conflicts and tensions in true neurotic expression of the agony and challenge of living . Which is what I 'm doing now . " " Right , " said Al " He hits you . " " Right . Poopie is all my conflicts and analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plus a connection to pills . But I 'm not a pillhead , I just chip a little , raise me up in the morning , bring me safely to port at night . " Al gave her his hardest look . He said , " You dramatizeyour life , Milly . " She sighed , she was happy . " You 're so perceptive , Al . I 'm a narcissistic show-off . But inside , I know true Heideggerean anxiety compounded with a deep sense of the lows you get when you come off methedrine . " Milly had changed since Al had known her atp191school . Poopie had changed her . In addition to pinching , punching , biting , and kicking her body , and sometimesblackening her eyes , he had also softened her soul . Perhaps the pounding had produced relaxation . They pound abalone to tenderize it . She was sorry for Poopie . She was tenderized . Poopie brought out the maternal in little Milly Peck . And the maternal which Poopie Cola had brought out in Milly Peck now appealed to Al Dooley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never felt so close to a girl before . Nor to a tenderized abalone . But he needed someone  --  not crazy Jarod , not crazy Ellen . Exhausted , frightened , bewildered , rich and poor with new dollars in exact serial order , he wanted someone to take care of him . Milly . He needed Milly . He needed Milly 's help . He also wanted her to rock him and protect him . Nice Milly should be good to bad Al . Sensing something of this , her girl 's intuition grindingin the void , Milly spoke soothing words and refilledhis mug with coffee and Mohawk brandy . " You know that shoe you lost the night you jumped Poopie ? " she asked him . " And I had to protect him because you 're so big and strong , Al ? Al ? You know ? How big and strong and brutal you are ? But nice ? Well , I returnedit to you . The shoe . I did . I knew you 'd need it , so I returned it to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street after you , but I guess you did n't notice , what with the fog and all . Gee , and I wanted to return it to you . " " I stubbed my toe later . " He cleared his throat . No whimpering . " That was a bad scene , Milly . " " Gee , well do I know how a fellow needs both his shoes , Al . So I returned it to you . "  | " Okay . It 's the intention that counts  --  " " The goodwill in a girl 's heart , cause I certainly did n't want you to go without shoes  --  bad scene , wow  --  even if you did pile into Poopie like a wild man or something , ooh , Al , I never knew you were such a wild man , so impulsively instinctual and all . " Al hunched over the coffee mug , warming his hands . Milly gazed proudly at him . This did more than the mug of coffee , more than the Mohawk brandy , to restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good woman gone wrong . She continued fondly : " So how come you did n't pick it up ? " ( She meant the shoe . ) " I saw it in the gutter the next day . Gee , Al , it looked like a person , all sad and beat-up and from the cars and the wet and all . It just made me want to cry and take care of it , Al . But I left it there because you know about Poopie , he 's so jealous , he loves me so . That poor , sad , lonely shoe . Groovy . I covered it with a newspaper . " Al lived through the experience with her . It was a little maternal thing she did . He understood . Insight . He looked away , out the window . Insight plus modesty . He let the world outside the window cover for his pride and embarrassment . Insight plus modesty plus horny . Downstairs , on slanty Grant Street , the beatnik 's Brooks Brothers was opening for an evening at selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIVES , peacetime surplus monaural bossa nova records , posters advertising various political , pharmaceutical , and Kama Sutra positions , souvenirs of the Barbary Coast . A Chinese from lower Grant , walking his butcherknife , bowed gracefully , with the age-old courtesy of his race , to an Italian from upper Grant ,  |p193walking  his switchblade . Who bowed with dignity , touching his fist to his inner elbow , with the ageolddelicacy of his people . A cafe actor on a Vespa pushed up the street , his son on the jump seat screamingwith joy . A flower child stood whispering in a doorway , " Got any spare change ? " Two cops from the elite Tactical Squad studied him , figuring out the best way to ask him for his I.D . They stood under the Coffee and Confusion sign which bore , appended by chicken wire , an additional notice : Headquarters for Ethnics . The cops were getting ready to make their run . Floaters and tourists came strolling to look at the shopwindows filled with silver , marionettes , books , leather ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the girls and boys in solitary quest ; the dogs and ocelots ; the spitters , the gawkers , those buying and selling ; all the Mediterranean street curiosity of North Beach . Down the way a bit , the display lights went on in a leather shop which specialized in disciplinary equipment , straps , spurs , and harnesses . " Hey there , " Milly cooed softly . " Say , anybody home ? " Milly was at home , having her salon . She appreciateda visitor now and again as eventide approached . She curled her toes . She went into the lotus position , which she had always used to get ready for homework or to do her hair or to really get to know a person . Once she had sat that way in front of Alan Watts and he said she did it really super . " Hey  --  penny , Al ? " The early editions were being delivered to the grocery shop down the street . For some reason it displayedslightly used paper napkins in the window , butp194sandwiches to go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's blood . The delivery man slapped the bundle of papers onto a crate and snapped the wire with his clippers . Al wondered idly if he had made the two star advance final . He knew he should want to read about himself , but he felt half melted into Milly 's floor ; he wanted to stay . If only the world could just be pushed by . If only it were all wide screen , super Zenorama , everything flowing from the center . " Say , " Milly asked , " now that Poopie 's gone for a few days , are n't they doing a revival of a Charlie Chaplinat the Surf ? Oh . Oh , Al . Oh , groovy , you had something else in mind . " She was on the right track . Insights galore . " Oh but let 's talk , " said Milly . " Getting to know you is the important thing , not technique . A girl needs security . A girl needs the sense that a man really cares . Now take your technical types , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , ooh , you know , the things I like , for instance  --  well , let me give you a for-instance  --  " It was agreeable to Al to discuss matters . Lust was not the great issue at this crossroads in his life . In time gone by there were these little problems with love  --  who a chap is , finding out by making out  --  but now he had a particular problem with bills of mint denomination . He sought advice , comfort , and contacts from Milly . He would listen for a while , his hands would stop their trembling and the heat in his forehead would go down , and then he would explain everything to her . No worry about himself . He had something to do . In the meantime , as she talked , she might talk herself into enlisting on his side.  |p195The  early afternoon had passed . The late afternoon also passed . Milly had brought her grandfather 's clock , which stood on the floor , out of her father 's house in Hillsborough . It ticked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth . The evening was passing . Milly spoke of her hopes and dreams , her need to fulfill herself , her fondness for Al . When she saw him grow listless over the cold coffee , she kept him alive with an injection of fondness . She lit up a joint and handed it over good stuff . Carried over theborder personally by a friend of Poopie 's . Private stock . She hissed like a viper at him . He hissed like a viper at her . The little twig glowed . Acapulco gold . It diminished . Or Tijuana brass . She stared at the smoldering bud with smoldering eyes . All the philosophy in the world would n't sum up the philosophy in her heart . That fume of smoke . That hot little roach . That burn on her lower lip . All things that glow must burn and pass . But Al had a place in Milly 's heart . He had a special place . She knew he was intended for great things , groovy things . Al cleared his throat and raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for monks and philosophers . The last light of sunset was streaming through the window halfway up Telegraph Hill on Grant Street in North Beach . Confused weather reportswere fine for wizards and potheads . But Al had something else going now and needed a clear throat and a little attention . Business in Vegas had called Poopie away for a few days . Al desired Milly and also needed her help . Now seemed to be his chance , and it was : his chance to talk about Poopie . " Look at my teeth marks , " she said . " Here . Here . And here . "  |p196Al  looked . He was obedient . But he began : " I want to tell you what happened to me today . " " And here , too . Ooh , it still stings when I just touch it . " " It 's not exactly what happened to me , " Al said , " it 's something I did . " " Ooh , Al , maybe ? Maybe you would ? Maybe you 'd rub oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe , with a loving , maternal , and gentle type of girl like Milly , a thoughtfulperson should take his cues from her and not try to tell her how and whether he robbed a bank until she was ready to listen . A mature man should follow a mature woman 's lead and not just inflict himself on her , like some kind of wild beast in the zoo  --  wild beast in the wilds , tame beast in the zoo . " Ooh , out of sight ! " cried Milly when Al consented to rub soothing lanolin in the bites . In an instant she had her clothes off and was lying on her belly in a fluffy cotton rug . Rays of expiring sunlight through curtains made stripes on her sleek , small , slightly bittenback . Al knelt by her side with the itch and grime of bank-robbing still clinging to his body , but a bottle of medicated lanolin lotion in his hand . " There , " she said . " Ooh , there . Around there , too . He bites me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes . " He cupped his hands and rubbed lotion even where she was not bitten . She did not mention it , but her voice grew husky and she smiled and wiggled around and wrinkled her nose at him . With a voice growing husky , she informed him that she was just looking for the courage to leave Poopie . He was nice , but mean . He was sweet , but nasty . He beatp197her and took all her money and sometimes hinted that she should go to work for him . Despite all his virtues , she was beginning to tire of him . " Yes , yes , yes , you do that so good , " she said . " More . " She also told him more . Then said , " Ooh , Al , what are you doing ? Ooh , Al , but we 're just friends anymore . Ooh , Al , but how did you know I still think of you that way ? Ooh , Al , ooh . " Afterward , when the grandfather 's clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were eased , the itches were eased , Al and Milly took a bath . " Poopie would n't like it if he knew we took a bath together in our tub  --  his , " she remarked . Al helped her clean the tub . As he bent to wipe it , she swatted him on the behind with a knotted towel . " Ouch ! " She smiled maternally . " A little trick I learned from Poopie , " she said . Then finally , relaxed , clean , eating Rice Krispies with honey , nuts , raisins , bananas , wheat germ , and fortified skim milk  --  good health promotes healing  --  Al was ready to talk . Milly was right to make him wait until he was relaxed . She understood . He told her . She listened in silence as he explained about his boredom with his studies , about the army , about his quest for meaning , about Sue Cody and the evanescenceof romance , about the sense of uselessness in his career , about his need for exceptional action . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then about the bank . And then about the problem with the bills : new , consecutive serial numbers , and he was afraid to pass them . Could Milly , without going to Poopie  --  somehowPoopie did not inspire his trust  --  make contactp198with someone to whom he might sell the money at a discount and get out clean ? Milly listened to this story in silence . She went back into the lotus position . There was a great deal of stock to be taken . Apparently there were depths in Al , though he did n't bite . Al had surprised her at last . Like a man in shock , he made no moral judgments . He was generous to himself . He did not say , I did wrong , help me . He said : I need help to get off , help me . That was nice of him . She appreciated a man with high immoralprinciples . Narrowly she studied him to make sure he was hip , not just crazy ; in , not odd . Well , he looked straight enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that did n't help too much , since she was n't sure any more what it meant . Groovy , wow , she thought , because she knew what they meant . He needed her ; the great earth mother was aroused . She could help him . He had called to her for help . Milly searched deep into his eyes , abstractedly scratching an old wound on her bare buttock . Al watched in silence as her thoughts raced about the pretty little head with its thick undone coil of reddishhair . It looked kind of red in that light . At last she spoke : " Any better at it than I am , Al ? " " What ? " " That Sue of yours  --  she any better'n li ' 1 ole Milly ? you know ? at it ? Cause you say Yes and I 'll scratch your eyes out , I will . " Al sighed . Spoken like a true-blue American girl in his time of trouble . She had rallied round him all right . He stood up to go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suddenly bone tired . " I 'll figure out some-thing . " " Ooh , Al , cause I 'm a girl , you know ? I care for you an awful lot is why I get so jealous . " She followed him to the door . " Listen , I 'm thinking , Al . Here , listen . " She forced his head to her bosom . He stumbled and she caught him . " Hear me thinking ? " He sprung his neck and rubbed it to get the circulation going . " Now I 'm just going to worry over your problem , Al . I 'm going to consider it our problem , ours together , how 's about that ? Just cause you were kind to me about Poopie and his bites and all . Rub-rub-rub , you were good to me , Al . You were . You still like me . " He explained that he would like to give her one of the new crisp bills , but he was afraid of passing them and being traced . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did what I did  --  you know , doncha ? doncha ?  --  only because you love me and you rub my bites so good and I wanted to . That bastard Poopie . Bye now . " But she did look longingly at the sack of money as he toted it out toward the car , concealed in a Macy 's shopping bag which Milly had lent him . He promised to return it soon . She stopped him halfway down the stairway by runninginto his arms . " Darling , " she cried , " I know I 'm a little ridick . I just want to tell you something  --  you trust me . " A tear trickled from her eyes and made its way down her healthy rounded cheek . " Look , I 'm crying , Al . See me cry ? Little tearsie ? It 's because you trust me . I ca n't tell you what that means to me , somebodytrusts me  --  "  |p200But  she began to sob , ran back , locked the door . He looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all at once radiant , smiling and waving and blowing kisses . She stood waving as he walked the few steps down the hill to his car . Suddenly , in the San Francisco night , with a chill fog blowing over the town , he felt a movement of dread in his chest . Someplacehe had made a mistake . He had made a wrong turn someplace . But Milly was still waving at him . It was probably fatigue . After robbing a bank and makinglove , he had a right to feel weary . Rest now . He drove home to Berkeley , shaved off his mustache , tumbled into bed , and slept the sleep of the fulfilled and of the exhausted . But Milly needed to fulfill herself , too . While Milly cast about for ways to fulfillherself , Al rested . Al could rob a bank , but Milly could not . It was n't fair . When a girl does a thing like that , for example , everybody thinks she 's kind of odd , crazy , lesbian , peculiar . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and knocking off a teller  --  as it is masculine . But people are hard on girls . Asp201Milly had decided many times before  --  not fair . But there are ways to equalize . Al , doing his part , slept for the better part of two days , just dead in sleep , occasionally waking for a few minutes , staggering on rubber legs to the kitchen to draw on a bottle of milk and a handful of raisins , and then back to bed and down again . He was tied to the bed by invisible elastic . Once , practically sleepwalking , stretching the rubber , he brushed his teeth . Duringhis few minutes awake , he hoped that Milly had figured out who might buy those numbered dollars from him at a discount . He would be a middle man . The profit would be passed on , shared . Poopie could be a middle man . Al himself was a middle man between Jarod and Ellen . Or maybe the end man . Or maybe no man . ( Have another handful of raisins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . ) Soon perhaps he would be awakend by a call from Milly . With his knuckle he cleaned a mashed raisin from between his teeth and flopped down again . Tired he was now because he had worked before . Sleep he would now , and be awake when it again became necessary . The mild Berkeley sun turned twice over his apartment . Twice the night dampness steamed off the redwoodslats . The Berkeley Gazette nestled against the Berkeley Gazette at his door . A young colored bandit had held up a bank in San Francisco . The branch manager had definitely identified him as a light-skinned hippie . He was an equal opportunity employer and he could spot them a mile off . The teller first thought he was , well , not really dark  --  a Mexican , a Puerto Rican maybe  --   |p202the  light was sort of in her eyes . The note was sort of in her eyes . He was a Negro all right . He was a black desperado who said dirty things to her while he took the money and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang ; Jarod ; he mumbled inconsequentlyand stumbled back into bed . It was as if he had fought a long battle . The power circuits to life and death were shorted . He had been in touch with reality ; now let him make touch with flight . Eons of evolution tumbled through his head . Worm , fish , bird , lizard ; he was nimble , he was slow . He was hunter and pursued . He murdered  --  but it was his own turn to be resurrected . How could he kill , and yet be the one to be rewarded ? No answer . Heaviness and swollen fluids in the body , and sleep . Light nerviness and sleep . Deep in a dream of freedom and soaring in the air  --  he was a bird , he was an eagle with a man 's head , he carried off his prey in his beak  --  a harsh electric summonsfilled his studio room . He struggled up from his dream to answer the telephone : he flapped his wings and lowered his heavy , stenchy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cruel eye . He willed a man 's body onto the eagle-man 's head . Okay , done . Okay , now attention to the phone . It was still ringing . It would be Milly , it would be Milly with news ; he blinked open his eyes and it was not Milly . It was the door . They were buzzing and pounding at his door . Before he could shake himself enough awake to answer , a shoulder splintered the door ; four cops came pounding through , with pistols drawn . Behindthem , protected by them , lounged a civilian figurein wide-wale continental corduroy pants , loafersp203without socks , and a tan Banlon shirt . This smiling , lounging person pointed his pinkie finger at the recenteagle  --  Al particularly remembered that he used the pinkie , not the index finger  --  and said , " Yeah , that 's him . That 's our boy . " " You willing to swear , Poopie ? " one of the cops asked . " Just look around . You do n't need me to swear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There , " he said , pointing to a bag which still sat on the chair before Al 's desk . It was resting on a paperback edition of Wolfgang Kohler 's study of apes and a book called The Place of Value in a World of Fact . " Them 's nice pajamas , Al baby , " he said . " Stripes look good on you . " Al felt very calm . His long sleep had revived him ; it filled the nerves with electricity . He felt unsurprised and calm , though a little disappointed in Milly . He would really have preferred to be rich and free and powerful and successful rather than under arrest for bank robbery . Well , a young graduate student ca n't hope to have everything all at once . He might as well start at the bottom with a good long prison term . It teaches humility , also sewing and license-plate making . " Do n't make trouble , son , " said one of the cops . " You be nice and we 'll let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were sweet cops . For some reason , while washing his face , Al thought of the sadness of reading obituaries  --  the childrenand the grandchildren forever living after the honored dead . Al had no child and would be slow to create one . Then the cops drove him with the siren working through the streets of Berkeley to the police station.  |p204He  was important enough to make strolling students turn and watch . He was crowded between two cops ; his shoulders felt cramped in the back seat . Another cop drove ; Poopie slouched contentedly in the front seat . Still another cop followed them on his motorcycle . I 'm the prime minister of a new African nation , Al thought . Emergent but underdeveloped . At the crossroads of history . They 're showing me the campus . They 're treating me so good . I 'll give up being one of the emergent unaligned states ; I 'll be a gallant ally with missile bases , planning for my free elections at some time in the very near future , as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al : mind wandering a bit . The cop to Al 's left considered himself a student . He tried to suck in his gut and preferred to be described as a " social worker in uniform . " He took extensioncourses in criminology at San Francisco State . As part of a paper he was writing , he questioned Al on the way to the station . " Why did you do it ? What did you hope to gain ? Did n't you realize how anti-social conduct gets you no place unless you got good connec-tions ? " While he kept the sociology in motion , he gripped the barrel of his pistol so that he could employ the butt of it on Al 's skull if the respondent tried any funny business . Since he ran a little at the mouth , he also told Al what had happened to him : " Your friend Milly made him a little jealous . Our friend Poopie there . Honey-fuggling  --  hey ? Then she told him about your problem . She made him promise to keep the secret , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " called Poopie up front , " I broke the promise . Now can I just get at him a sec ? " " He 's in the hands of the law , " the sociologist proclaimed . He then settled back and explained to Al : " Broke his promise . There 's the reward , you know ? And the jealousy . The unwritten law . That word you used for doing it  --  pure East Oakland , is n't it ? Linguisticallyspeaking ? " That made it fair . After all , reward , jealousy , and Poopie just did his duty as a citizen . Al should understand . " Oh , I do , " said Al . " The Code of the Underworld and all that jazz , " said the educated cop . Al came alert . It was like the old days , a seminar in a moving vehicle . Through narrowed eyes he asked his one true friend in that sirening police car : " But the Code ! No squealing , is n't it ? " The cop took that under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a meretricious argument . " He rubbed his nose . There was a rustle of applause  --  finger skin against flange skin . " You got a point there . " After all , he did n't have his master 's yet . He was n't a real fast thinker yet . " But you 're a non-professional , " he decided at last . " They do n't like that . Amendment to the Bylaws of the Code , buster . It 's called horning in . " The police of Berkeley , California , were not accustomed to intelligent young graduate students in sociologywho robbed banks . Therefore they treated Al with special consideration . They passed him across the bridge to San Francisco . There , instead of flinging him into a urine-stinking cell with no top for the toilet andp206a curse for company , they flung him into a urine-stinkingcell with no top for the toilet and a command not to commit suicide for company . They took away shoe laces and belt . His thoughts they left him . A man might string himself along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just meditating . They made him the precious gift of solitude . Al found that he disliked Poopie more than ever . Both in general and in particular . Poopie lacked merit in Al 's eyes . About Milly , he felt resentful . He should not have trusted her good nature . She had too much of it . Her cup ran over , but all he got was the runover . Poopie got the cup . Sue came to mind as a true friend . He longed for Sue  --  weird Sue with her impulsive feeling and her no forwarding address . Good Sue with no afterthoughts . He bawled a moment with self-pity , and then resolved to face the future . The future would be something to occupy the idle hours . He was n't really a psychopath  --  he felt sorry for himself . A true psychopath has few feelings . Of course , sympathy for the self is one of the few feelings a psychopath can have . Having been slept out , Al sat awake , staring into the blue aisle light and listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounged under the bulb and flicked his cigarette butt against the wall . Cabbage smell from someplace . Smells of meat , spit , and excrement . Hopelessness of men who were not hopeless just for the experience . No choices , no games , the destinies of disaster . Al remembered trees , woods , stars , birds , the Berkeleyhills . He had never seen them . He had drivenp207through them , pushed girls through them , passed through them . There was a redwood house he had meant to admire . He remembered thinking he must stop one day and admire it . He wished he had stopped to pity Ellen . The slight thickening and coarsening of age , and her misery thickening her . She should have enjoyed a maturing loveliness . He had neglected to pity her . He tried to laugh . The past is different from the present in the same way an elephant is different from a mouse . More of it . God must have loved the past ; he made so much of it . Al regretted the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was ridden through by time and events . He was locked away now . He was no different from the hopeless men all around him . Conjunctivitis coming , too . Just like a drunk , a nut , a larcenist . Sick at heart . What a bad time to get conjunctivitis . Gray congestion of sickness in his belly . Brain workingbadly . But I will live as a prisoner with burning eyes ! I will wear boots and wool and lie muffled at night and my eyes will glow ! In my memory I will recite poetry and compose a record of my humiliation , and they can never extinguish my eyes ! Al averted his mind . Instead he would see psychiatristsand do useful labor and his eyes would grow dull and stupid , like all prisoners , after a year of onanistic burning . At first filled with regrets and invented memories , his self-abuse , self-sweetness , would come to be quick and without fantasy . It would be a game to find sleep before the psychiatrist 's pill took effect . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . Al could hear him breathing . When things quieted down again , Al went to the corner of his cell near the Panther 's and said , " Hsst . You all right ? " There was no answer . Al listened and thought he heard a quaver in the thick , mucousy breathing . " I 'm Al Dooley . What 's your  --  " A clatter of heels down the hall and an enraged face exploding with the desire to kill : " You want trouble ? You want trouble , Mister ? You want your civil right to let us play on your kidneys a little ? " Al shut up . The man in the next cell did n't seem to hear , anyway , or had the good sense not to answer . It was better to live as if he were n't there . His neighbor was not there . His neighbor , whoever he was , was not there . It seemed to Al that he was uncovering the first facts of his life again in jail . They refused bail ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he examined psychiatrically the world  --  glimpse of sunlight , jerk of nerves , taste of lumps in cereal , passage of time and leap of days . The world made some sense ; only Al made little sense in it . Back to childhood , back to forever waiting . When he sat on his shelf in the cell and concentrated , time passed inching , reluctant . When he raced through memories and explanations , the hours fled by . And yet , when he recalled the inchinghours later , they only lasted a moment ; there was nothing he could cling to . And when he turned to the racing memories , when time had abandoned him , he remembered this and that and the other things  --  his parents shoring up mere details against oblivion in Santa Barbara  --  and there was an anchor in the world.  |p213He  needed something to do . Something to mean and be , something to do . If he learned so much in the early days of his term of pre-trial investigation , what would there be left for the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that life fell so easily into place  --  meals , visits , questions , sleep , routines , daydreams . His dad cried a bit and found him a lawyer . His mother cried a lot and agreed with his father that everything possible should be done . He tested the other possibilities , the impossibilities , and found no great virtue in them . For the moment , he was content to ride . He felt safe against the world with the world all against him . He would probably not be beaten like the Panther next door . Poopie was a dream and so was everyone else . His mother and father ran a nice travel agency . He had just slid out of the draft . He had no risks to suffer now that he had lost the impossible risk he had set up for himself . Or so he felt . Calm settled over him . Sinus did not disqualify him for prison . He was cared for here . Occasionally he wondered what would happen to him . He tried the elevator in his belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The routine seemed to suit him . He had led his life that way . He would build his arms and shoulders with push-ups ; he would build his character with meditation . The struggle was over . His mother and father would get used to the idea . Sad , but they still had each other . They had a good business , too . He would live through this day , the next day , the one after , and let the credit go . This flight to acceptance might have come after ap214long struggle , but iii fact , he was in jail less than a month when the habit was already established and then , abruptly , broken . He had a visitor , ProfessorJarod Howe . The elevator shaking and quavering in his belly . A few weeks ago they had refused him this visitor . Nausea . Jarod 's skin looked gray beneath the healthy leather tan . Pale , thought Al ; then I must be green . It was nothing special to the police to have a friend come to visit him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrogators , lawyers , doctors , parents  --  mourning at his grave  --  and the gentle civil service employee , Mr. Jones , who issued him denim pants and shirt . They might have thought this Negro with the neat suit , hat , and briefcase ( gold initials ) , was a lawyer . No . " Professor Howe to see you . " Mr. Jones almost added " Sir . " No . But Jarod was already in the cell , smiling faintly . He peeked about and then sat on the edge of a bunk , leaning forward to keep from bumping against the unoccupiedupper ledge , He studied Al with his classroomeyes , alert , amused , in control , in touch , not the crazy willfulness of the past months . With these clothes on , the suit in which he taught his large freshmanlecture section , and with this obligation to visit a student in trouble , he was ready to talk to Al as he used to . Al felt happy . If being in trouble meant that Jarod became human again , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm him . He had not been brainwashed , but he had received a good rinse in fright and strain.  | " Are you bored ? " Jarod asked . " There 's not much to do here . I think I 'm being observed . But it does n't seem like a waste of time . " " Very good . Life is too short to make every day count . Learn to loaf and stretch a little . " Here , between the wall of this cell ? Sink , bunks , concrete floor sloping toward the center . The drain was wet . It had been hosed down an hour before . A dank smell came from the wet pipe leading into the sewers . Al prowled sometimes , when he awakened in the middle of the night , and smelled this smell as if he were contemplating solitary sex . He was contemplating it in order to go back to sleep . He felt no desire to touch himself . He imagined it would leave him nervous , exhausted , and unable to sleep . That was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to touch himself . Instead , in those midnight moments , lit by a bare white bulb protected by a steel lacing in the corridor , he would throw himself to the floor and do push-ups until his shoulders and his belly cracked with fatigue and floods of heat ran through his body , opening trickles of sweat under his arms and at his belt . And then he would sleep , dreaming of large shoulder muscles and nothing more philosophicalthan that . Dreams held in his fists . Hands clenched . Jarod was smiling at Al with crinkly eyes  --  that handsome actorish look . " Listen , " he said , " I thought of a joke . I was going to get you a silver bracelet for your birthday , like they do for diabetics or heart cases , you know ? Only this would be for ordinary mortals . For bank-robbing normal just-folks . In silver . To be worn at all times : I May Die . Would you like that ? "  | " What 's up , Jarod ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . As you know about yourself  --  robbing , screwing old ladies , not getting your thesis written . " Nevada , the mute prisoner with whom Al walked in the exercise yard , was being led past his cell by a sergeant to a meeting with his court-appointed attorney . " Pay attention , lad , " Jarod said gently . " I was . " " To me . To yourself now , pal . " " What 's on your mind ? " Jarod sighed . " We understand each other , do n't we , Al ? " No . " Right , we do n't . Okay . But I hate to see you risk yourself where there 's no possibility of winning , only getting trouble for yourself . " He did not say : " fob yosef . " He was speaking in his natural academic voice . " There should be another risk to take , other than women , chicks , and banks . " " What about you ? " Jarod shrugged and pressed his lips together as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from games , it 's the American way . I got married , did n't I ? And in my case it involved more than being a good sport about the girl I got in trouble  --  a demonstration to the world it was . I 've only had two of my three lives so far . One as a smart colored kid ; one as a chaser , getting my kicks ; one as a success in whatever I try . " " That 's three already . " " The one I 'm waiting for is where I do n't get what I want . I love some quiet girl who says No . I can'tp217change the world . I want to live and die . " He looked expectantly at Al . Al did not answer . Jarod 's eyes had the color of his voice , yellow , pleading , convincing , unconvinced . " You 're right to say nothing , " Jarod said . " I 'm on my way to that life . " Al listened to him , a stranger to his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sun speckled Jarod 's clothes through the window with its distorted polish marks , his face was contorted , his tongue showed as he talked and laughed ; and Al cared about Jarod and not about himself , about Jarod 's fate and not his own . Who was this fluent animal with the pink tongue ? He won everything without taking chances . Al was paying the price for no intelligent risk at all  --  for a joke , like having a bad sinus , for a game of shoplifting in a bank . " I 'm doing you a favor , " Jarod said , " talking about myself like this . Otherwise what would you think about ? You 're having the day after a great joy  --  the unusable dead day of recovery . " Al watched the words emerge from Jarod 's nose and mouth and spread over his chin like a sweet liquid . Being in trouble changed not enough . There must be a way to change things . Jarod was saying : after all that labor to find truth and act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for you . . . He was talking about arrogance . Al was trying to listen . " Where are we , Jarod ? " " In jail . " " In jail , good . You know what sadness is , " Al said , " but you do n't know what anybody else 's sadness is . " " Do you ? Yours , yes . "  |p218Al  could not answer , not yet . But he believed that Jarod would stay with him until he knew the answers . A cockroach scampered and fell like a shooting star down a gray wet wall ; it hit the cement with a singing pop . It scurried off , flicking itself ; unhurt it seemed , uncomplaining it seemed . Jarod 's lips were the color of rain . There was the smell of a sick animal in the room  --  crime , urine , disinfectant , anxiety . There was the silent hurt man in the cell next to him . The smells kept accumulating . Jarod was boiling and steaming ; his lips were cold and gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . Al expected other smells from a sick animal . It was Jarod and the jail and his expectations , and Jarod was saying : " You 'll see in the courtroom how the women , listening , they open their thighs . I notice the same thing when I 'm doing the lecture . To let in a little cool air , otherwise they 'll come . " " You used to think about the subject . You talked very well . " " What is the subject now ? " Jarod grinned . " The subject , topic A , was what I was thinking about , boy , which is why I was a good teacher . I was black and they listened . I did them , so they listened . I 'm a warmly sympathetic , deeply selfish man , and you must get accustomed to me . The stickiest part of the Milky Way is the part I 'm standing on . What I want , I want for me . When I was young , since you are young , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and think : Someday I 'll not wake lonely . Love . But I hold girls between my elbows and hear them scream , and it 's their own pleasure they 're studying . It 's nothing they share of my darkness . So now I no longer figurep219that way . I wake up lonely and I think : Well , this will pass . I 'll eat a melon , go for a walk . I 'll make somethingof myself tomorrow . " " Dreadful , " said Al . " It 's sweet when she gets up to find us a glass of water . But that 's not opening the box . We penetrate body with body , but that does n't open it either . The nerve is separate . The soul is caught in my black prison , and no white receptacle  --  " " No black one ? " " No white , black , blue , or green body can know who I am . " He turned his palms out  --  pink . " Therefore : nor can I. When she first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you white women , so that 's all it is . I was a kid . I got started on the heavy road , pal . I could do up my discouragement . " " That 's what it is . " " Now what I can do is be reasonable and fuck a lot . Whichever one I 'm doing , the other thing looks better to me . Blowing my time , brother . I go to Washington . I yell my head off . But I really mean to do it , being reasonable or unreasonable , which is more than you 've had on your mind these last twenty-four years ? " " Yes , okay . So then you decided to do something with the Muslims losers  --  why not the Panthers ? " Jarod waited to see if he had something else on his mind . " Here we are , " he said , " and we 're still talking about me . " " Yes . And the Muslims . " " Exercise . Just trying out for size . Wrong size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . " He began to smile . He showed his teeth . " Which reminds me of another damned thing : you tried some/thing on for size , too . " He gazed into Al 's eyes and laughed . " So did you . Ellen . " " You know . " Jarod said , " I was meant to be crazy , but I did n't have the time . I was supposed to break down . I passed it on to her . " " You know ! " Al shouted . " You knew , why do n't you do something about it ? " Jarod smiled and shrugged . " You take a little fugglingtoo serious , pal . I been trying to explain . My whole life is doing something about it . You do n't understandyet , it 's you has to do something . It 's your turn . " Al stood in the steely light of confinement and moved toward him . Jarod remained in his place , eyes half shut , hands folded on each other . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " According to my wife , it seem you say . . . after you 've come , or rather , duringyour climax . . . you say : Spurt ! spurt ! spurt ! three times , like that . Spurt-spurt-spurt , more like that ? Anyway , she might not communicate it to me exactly . Just listen , Al , and do n't get all worried up . Maybe you can help me . " He raised his hand shush . In jail awaiting trial for bank-robbery , just told by his best friend that he knows  --  and Al could help Jarod ? " Yes . Wait . " Jarod turned his back on Al and walked toward the little barred window . " Hall of Justice , " he murmured . Words to clear his throat . " Others or myself , " he said . " That closeness with things seemed out of my grasp . Being black is something , you know , yet when you 're brown and smart and white like me , it is also nothing . People say I'llp221kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaccurate . People say you 're an animal , and you know you 're not . Blood ? I call myself black , but chances are there 's more your kind of blood in me than my kind . Funny , no ? I think I loved Ellen , but how could I ? Whirling like meat on an electric spit . Is everyone like that , Al ? " " I must have been  --  " " Brains in a bottle of flesh  --  we know it . " " Yes . " " What you look at in the dark , when you peek inside , or when you ca n't sleep and you look out over the bay . . . " Over the wind , sorrow , loneliness , grief. what do you see ? Brain says : This spurt is ahype . What else ? What do you do when you know the end is coming ? " " I 'm sorry , Jarod . " He wanted to be forgiven . He did n't want to ask . " I 'd like to do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more banks ? " " I 've always wanted to talk with you about that , " Al said . " What I want to do and be . What I want to find . " " Had n't you better first figure a way how to swing out of here ? " " Maybe I 'll stay awhile . Give me some time for figuring . " " Boy , " said Jarod , " while you 're figuring in San Quentin , somebody behind you will be working over your rump . It ai n't conducive , you know that ? " Jarod 's ape grimace , teeth and curling lip , meant angrily to bar the way to the questions worth answeringbetween them . But he knew this vast mood as well as Al did . The important questions were discarded byp222the superior mental operators of the time on the charge of deluding and distracting the human spirit . The artistswanted sensation , color , noise . Excitement and assaultseemed enough facts . The philosophers wanted science and the scientists wanted themselves , plus government contracts . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Al knew that he and Jarod were still alike in this , still fools . They had the state of being fools to share . Ellen was not what they shared ; neither of them possessed her . Sociology was not a thing they took together ; it was what Jarod made out well in , what Al made out not so well in . The world and jarod had agreed that he was to be a winner , but Jarod had changed his mind . Now Jarod and Al were in the same boat . They had suffered a long collaborationin trying not to be foolish , and then in being stupid . Now were they ready to pay ? Al liked to believehimself ready to proceed and live in some part of the real world . If he could enter his friend 's loneliness for a time , they might go their separate ways in peace . " Funny , " said Jarod , " if maybe you could get probationbecause of me . Would n't that be a gas ? " " How is she ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . You were n't listening . Committed . " " Oh , no . " " Here 's exactly what you did . You screwed a crazy white broad , Al . Ooh let me , she said . She dramatized the whole thing for me . Dramatics is a part of the disease  --  hysteria . Symptoms , so it 's not my business . " " Poor Ellen . " " She was acting out , too . Lean close , tell me herp223story , then tickle her throat and spill her dinner on me , the dinner and you , all mixed up . That blue devil blood of hers was like milk mixed with water  --  no nourishment in it . " The tears were flooding in Al 's eyes . They were a stranger 's tears in a stranger 's eyes . Ellen 's . " She says she 'll be good now . Now she says . No shock treatment . She thinks it 's punishment . Now she says she 'll be good , but they 'll have to do the series . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of good , they claim . " " It 's too soon for that ! She had good reasons ! " " I signed for it , boy . Generally they use drugs these days , mood-enhancers , but I got me a conservative man , he likes electricity . Another theory is you catch the psychosis fast , before it takes root , you rip it out by the rootlets . " He studied Al 's streaked face . " That 's strange . I have n't been able to do that since I was a kid . " In his trouble , sitting in jail with a visitor , awaiting his trial , Al asked Jarod : " What are you doing next ? " " I suppose I 'll try to help Ellen get well . She 'll be out on probation . She lost the child . " " I did n't know . " " You should get out on probation , too . " " It 's not much of a plan . " " It 's our plan , boy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here ? " " I 'm scared . I do n't know what I want . " " I spend too much time shucking and jiving . You 'd druther I spent my time getting you straight out of here . " " I 'm afraid of you , Jarod . I do n't trust you at all . "  |p224Jarod  showed his teeth . " That 's not why you 're here , soul brother . Do n't try to tell me that 's why you 're here . " Al felt the shame flushing his face . No , he had no right to do that . " I did n't say that 's why I 'm here . " " Okay . I 'll see Probation . I 'll write some letters  --  okay , I 'll make the calls . I have this federal judge  --  " " What 's he got to do with it ? " Jarod stood up , tapping his briefcase , creasing his face , smiling his smile . " He 'll send word on down . He owes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make them this friendly offer  --  help them with their law and order if they 'll go easy on my good buddy . " He was laughing . He was happy . Al wondered : Is he going to mess me up ? Jarod said , " Later , brother . " Messing with me ? " Listen ! " Al shouted . " I do n't want to go to the psych ward ! " Jarod started to laugh . " Trust in your friend , " he said . " By the way , they showed it last night . They changed the title from The Affluent Negro to The InfluentialBlack . " Jarod was standing . Al was still standing there alone a few moments later ; no sounds in the hall , no footsteps ; his face was still wet ; Jarod was gone.  | " You can insist on a lawyer being present , " Detective Warren Brown , badge in his pocket , said to Al , settling with deep contentmentonto the cushions of a naugahyde sofa in the George Washington Carver Felony Interrogation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me like a friend and brother meaning to extort the truth from you no matter what the cost to both of us in agony and pain . That 's a section of the code which I really love . " " So far you 've been very nice , " said Al . " This has been a lovely jail . " " Do n't interrupt me , Al , especially to disagree . " " I did n't . You 'd stopped already . And I agree , sir . " " Now you say , " said Detective Brown , " you claim and assever , hum , let me just rattle these pages a little . You pretend you committed this here crime of unlawfullyheisting a bank . " " Yes . " " You 're sure you 're not a dark-skinned man ? Both the teller and the branch manager identified you as such . Here , lemme show you the composites . " Al examined the drawings . " They look sort of like anybody , do n't they ? Only spade ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice dark gentleman from whom we can extract lots of Miranda/type-case confessions . That branch manager , that teller  --  " " Well , maybe people is n't their bag , sir . " " The color of people is a problem people have , I guess . Well , they 're not the only one . You see the imbroglioswe officers are constantly getting ourselves into  --  the composites are the wrong color , the witnessesshould give it to us in Braille . " " You can say that again . " " Please , Al . Heck  --  please ? Especially to agree do n't interrupt . " " I was just trying to help . " " You criminals are always trying to help , " DetectiveBrown said in a voice crowded with pain . " You do n't understand . You 're all old-fashioned , that 's why you 're our patients . You are looking for punishment , my boy , and you have just got to get used to the facts ; you 're sick . Treatment is what you need , not the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little electroshock series or two , say twenty-six treatmentsin all , in cases of depression or insufficient brain damage for normal survival . We try to secure you good so 's you do n't break a spine . You 're disturbed , Al . You have a superior I.Q. but low tolerance for normal frustration . But you seem to me , and I have all the course work finished for my master 's in criminology reform , you seem to me , brainwise , a prime candidate for what we like to call rehabilitation . That means we patiently , kindly , with plenty of loving concern and always listening to the client 's point of view  --  " " I know . " " Stop interrupting , stop it ! " he cried out , and then jumped nervously . He took out a notebook and wrotep227something with a red felt pen . " I just self-graded myselfa D minus for yelling and shouting , " he explained , snapping the notebook shut . " The reason I did n't give myself an F is I restrained myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do that , I flunk and have to start all over . Now where was I ? " " Patient 's point of view , " said Al . " Thank you very much . Client . I 'm a hawk , you know , not a dove , but you have to be a hawk dovewise if you want to get ahead in the correction business these days . You heard of the weeping hawk ? That 's me , buster . So I try to reserve my brutality for the littlelady t'home and put it out in the form of mortification . First for her , sometimes for me . Abuse and self-abuse , you know , and a bit of leather . I tell you this not to embarrass you or cause you any momentary discomfort , any acidosis-type eating at the stomach linings , but only to assure you that I am a human even as you and others I could name .

Now tell me in your own words how you happened to choose this particular neurotic act of defiance against parental authority as personified in the federally regulatedbanking system ? " " Actually , " said Al , " I just thought I might get away with it . I wanted to do something special . I thought I could be someone special . I realize there is nothing to substitute for hard work and merit  --  "  | " That 's the key to attainment in this world of rewardsfor achievement , " said Detective Brown . " You interrupted me . " " Sorry , sir . " The keen-tempered lawman took out his notebook and wrote something . He snapped it shut and said , " Self-grading . The little lady will mortify me tonight , Al . Continue . " It would be pretentious , " Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion against society . No , it was rather  --  " Detective Brown could not restrain himself . " I am opposed with all my heart and soul to pretensiosity , sir ! I also get grief and pain from repetitiousness and saying the same thing twice over . Oh-oh . " He opened the notebook again . He wrote : Cat-o ' - nine- tails at ten . Pick up baggies , coffee cake , witch hazel . He said : " Continue . " " After you , " said Al . " You 're the fellow we want to confess , son . So you admit everything ? " " You caught me , " said Al . " No , I mean pride , shame , latentness , overtness , common vagrancy in the worlds of the imagination ? " Al blushed . It was the word Imagination which did him in . " Well , I 'd say fancy , " he said . " I 'm too lazy to be truly one of the great imaginative minds of the age , such as S. Freud , L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the detective interrupted keenly . " I 'm speaking only of the dead . Jarod is more a  --  " Brown snapped his fingers .

"  | " It 's a well-known book in the field . " " Tell me what he 's trying to say , Al , in your own words . I 'm really interested this time . " " I very much appreciate your coming , " Al said , standing up . " He 's a brilliant man , is n't he ? Say , I bet he gets all kinds of special deals . Per diems , stuff like that . " " If there 's anything I can do , please call on me again . " " Maybe you 'd let me show you my term paper , Mr. Dooley . It 's all on the tip of my tongue . My field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are not adequate unto our feelings and on-thejobtraining . Do you want to make a deal ? " No . " Of course we do n't make deals . Let me explain it . " No . " Trying , Al . Trying to get you off this hot spot before you get in deeper . " Goodbye , " Al said . Detective Brown took the hint . " So wish you had been more cooperative , son . When you 're in trouble , you should learn to appreciate it . This is one of those times . Now if we can just identify the evil figures who twisted your fine young mind into the corrupted instrument of modern anxiety it is today , I will approach my inner conflicts a happy man . Until later , my poor dear friend . " And he clasped Al 's hands in his own two hot ones . He backed out of the barred room , bowing and distraught . Impulsively he sought to kiss Al 's fingers , but Al pulled away . " It 's not what you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian descent . My father was a prince , he came to San Francisco from Siberia , walk/ing all the way , across the Bering Straits , with only a few family icons to give him a start in the new world . He never thought his son would be a cop , Al . In the old country he was a career prince , eleventh in his promotion . On his deathbed I took a solemn vow to become a social worker . . . The door was shut by a uniformed patrolman who snapped at Brown , " Brown ! " " When ? " said Brown ne Bronofoffski . " Oh , when ? " Al put his ear to the door . He heard the low click of Brown 's notebook . Open , then shut . Mrs. Brown 's work would be cut out for her this night . That , thought Al Dooley , was a nice diversion . There was still a little St. Petersburg fog where Detective Brown had sat so quizzical and perturbed . But now , he wondered , why was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar . So many men made of real leather had sweated in that fake leather couch . He sat by choice in Detective Brown 's chair , although Detective Brown had sat by choice beside him on the couch . He gave himself a few restful momentsfor having doubts about his psychic balance . The world had tipped him one way and he had tipped himself another . Al Dooley was not in a mood to criticizePrince Brown . But why had they left him alone in this interrogationroom with no one further to interrogate him ? They were clowns , that 's why . He could just as easily escape , cat-burglar bank-robber heist-job man that he was . The door opened in response to the thought and itsp231amendment : A hank-heist man is not a cat burglar . A cat burglar is a skinny fellow who climbs on roofs after jewels , or at least a lithe fellow like the young Cary Grant . I 'm going out of the manic phase again . And the door was opening .

They give me what I ask for . I do n't mind explaining . I dropped some speed this morning , it made me lean a little to the left . So I dropped some Demerol to cool me a few degrees . Then grass to lift it into the light . Some opium to sweeten it at the edges , you know , the icing . Then I put on some Thorazine to keep it bubbling nice and low .

Al followed the specks across his eyeballs , but could not hear it . " Insanity , " Poopie temporarily concluded.  | " Crud , " said Al . Poopie sighed . " There is something close between the police and crime . Take me , for example . It 's my code , selling you , pal . They give me money and a nice handshake and Immunity One . They supplied me with confiscated Grade A drugs , but no LSD . I 've committedsome misdemeanors and felonies in my day , too . So it 's not just to your advantage to cooperate , brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? Tell me what I like to hear . " Poopie was moving in on him . Al stood up , but was sent back off-balance and down into naugahyde before his knees got straight . A nice short chopping stroke , spin left , spin right , top spin . Al tried to stand and the hand came down , pressing and hurting . He could n't move . He was gagging and his heart was free and he was choking but it did n't affect his spirit and he could not stand . He was cut down into the chair . " Tell me all , collitch crap-out . " Al was trying to get up , but could not . Poopie 's hand was on his gullet and he was pressing . Blue fires dancing behind eyes . " Talk if you can . " Pain . Darkness . " When you wake up , try to talk . And if you ca n't , tiger , I 've had some fun anyway . Call me anything you like  --  " Al was trying to call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , could not think . He thought he could still smell the sour flesh beaten into the couch . " Aw , Al , " Poopie was saying , " they promised me ap233real great trip with Owsley blues if I got you to confessin your own words what they dictate to you . Come on , Al , you owe just one more little help to Poopie . Try to listen to me now . Do n't go out on me , Al . Come on now , listen . Nice Paul . You paying attentionor you doing a stupid crash scene on me ? Al ? Nice Poopie , Al . It ai n't a bummer . " Al was n't certain just when Poopie left him . " After all , " Poopie said , " and I hope you can still hear me , we both got Milly for a mutual friend . " He heard him say that , but he woke up in his cell . He had twisted a foot . It must have been one man dragging him by the shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty that day . Stanford Mittance , Al 's lawyer , thought it best that Al understand some of the elements of his defense , Al being so smart and all . It was n't like chiropractice or anything , where the mysteryhelps the patient cure himself . Faith 'll do it every time , but faith was n't going to do it this time . Being sociable while he unfolded his tatchy case into a little beaverboard desk , he asked , " Where 'd you get those funny , uh , marks on your kind of throat , kind of blue ,  |p234and  that look in your eye ? Jeepers creepers , where'dja get those eyes , Al ? " " Paul Cola . " " Oh cripes , they had n't ought to do that . Oh heck , as your lawyer I personally wish we could prove abuse . " He got a sheaf of papers straight and tapped the edges . " Ah well , that 's just mucous under the bridge . I 'm sure glad I 'm not an incarcerated moral monster in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . " He shook his head with sorrow for the suffering of others . He had that little half smile , the sharp dimpleat the corners of mouth , which indicated that it was the suffering of others he was concerned with . It was n't his own , thank God . A lawyer has to keep in touch , but not necessarily in contact . He slipped off a paper clip and squinted at his list of questions . There was lots to cover . " I know you 're upset , " he said . " I can see that , too . " He cleared his throat . " Okay , it 's getting-to-know-you time . Just as I need to understand you inside and out , Al , your hopes and dreams and fondest wishes , so it is relevant that you have the complete picture of yours truly , the better for me to defend you with , my friend .

" Mittance was a crewcut young man of fifty , tennis , small sloop , berth in the Berkeley Yacht Club , who liked to sit with a glass of bourbon on the deck of his boat and explain how you only live once and he was content to be a poor man in California rather than a rich man in some Eastern firm . Of course , if he 'd havep235his druthers , he might could manage to be a rich man in California , too , why not ? But the essential is to remainyoung , have a small sloop , keep the backhand steady , and receive the love of two or three loyal women , not counting offspring , female . Group dynamicswas his other hobby  --  meaningful relationships . His calling in the Law was justified by the high interpersonal caliber of his clients  --  tax dodgers , insurancecheats , bribed judges , and now , at last , one fine young bank-robber with all the course work done for his M.A. in sociology . Al 's parents had found Mr. Mittance .

" But then he put on his thick black Swiss spectacles with the almost invisible line of bifocal . That line troubled him . He fixed Al with his youthful fifty-year-old gaze and really went into it . He said , " The M'Naughton Rule . The M'Naughton case ( 1850 ) established the defense by reason of insanity . You 're insane , boy , if you ca n't understand natural consequences of acts or ca n't tell the difference betweenright or wrong . I looked it up last night in my notes . Seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I 'm unfurling our mainsail  --  non comprendi naturali consequenti  --  and also our topsail , no cliff betweenp236righto and wrongo . That is , mains'l , tops'l . We 're in good shape , fair weather , sailing smooth . " " I 'm darn glad of that , " said Al . " Let me explain the grounds of our case . The M ' - Naughton rule about insanity is going on a hundred and a quarter years old . Shit , man , that 's old-fashioned . It says only a person with total mental incapacity to tell right from wrong is excused from responsibility . But such is n't your case , lad . In New York already , they say substantial ' incapacity . You get it  --  substan-tial . " " I got it . " " Important , that . They 're ahead of us in New York in the types of mind-zappings  --  socio , psycho , stupidobutI think we still got a lead on ' em pharmacologically . Anyway , substantial , it widens the language from know right from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you do n't appreciate . It 's the times we live in . I want to get up front and gut level . You 're a poor misunderstood boy of twenty-two . " " Twenty-three , " said Al . " I know and appreciate that , " said Mr. Mittance . " It 's you did n't know and appreciate the nature and consequence of your conduct . That 's the broader use of the term . It 's you 're unable to conform your conduct . It 's the army , it 's the struggles , it 's all that dope in the streets , and your glands  --  you 're overworked  --  you 're a brilliant student  --  you 're really off base  --  you had these bad friendships  --  " " I want to plead guilty , " said Al . " Huh ? Sure , you mean not guilty by reason of in-sanity . " " No , " said Al , " guilty . "  | " You 're berserk , " said Mr. Mittance . " That 's crazy not to plead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed my mind . I knew what I was doing . " The lawyer narrowed his eyes and gazed at Al . " Your mother . Your girl friend . Your other friends . Your many years behind bars . " He had forgotten something . " Your father 's travel agency in Santa Bar-bara . " " Maybe I could get probation . " " Maybe you could get a lot of prison . Buggered in the rear , lad . Mistreated in San Quentin . I must remember to show you some pictures of the handsome young prisoners injured from behind by the hardened criminals who did n't know how to plead not guilty by reason of the M'Naughton rule . I wonder , " he mused , " if they 'll let me bring in my album of photos . Probably stopped by the guards . Come on , Al , do n't come on like a mad dog ravening in the streets . " " When you think of all the people get away with things , " said Al . " That 's right . Good thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting to the nitty-gritty . Do your thing  --  feel sorry for yourself . " " When one considers how the penal system does n't resolve anything  --  " " Oh yes it does ! Do n't put it down like that ! " Mr. Mittance cried . " Do n't forget the sado-masochism ! The rampant homosexuality ! The need of guards to have something to guard , of wardens to have something to ward . " " I 'll do whatever you say , " Al said , " but  --  " " But you 'll keep your own independence on the inside . That 's right . Good boy , " Mr. Mittance said ,  |p238gentle  , crooning , and patient . " Be crazy mad character disorder psychopathic personality on the outside , but on the inside , heart-of-heartsy , be just plain you . That 's how I want it . That 's how it should be . Shoot ? " " Shoot , " said Al . " Roger and over . Now here 's how we proceed , lad  --  " He puckered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on crisply , " According to the mad dog ' rule , that 's one way they refer to it on the pejorative side , you do n't need a saliva test , however . . . Say , by the way ? You under the influence of methedrine , speed , heroin , downier , uppies , sideways , LSD , mary jane , morphine , cough syrup , the peace pill , dexies , Dexamyl , Seconal , glue  --  ? " " Glue ? " said Al . " Sorry about that . Did n't mean to put you down . " " Glue is for kids . " " I said I 'm sorry , Al , I regret , do n't you ever for-give ? " " Okay . " " Make up ? Friends ? Okay , that 's just up-tightness under the bridge . Benzedrine , opium , hashish , DietRiteCola ? " No . ' Sigh . " Well , we 'll do our best , Al , for that 's all we can really expect of ourselves , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I like to know who and what I am . That 's my quest . " He was falling into Mr. Mittance 's automated gibbering . " For that 's your quest , " Mr. Mittance murmured . " An idealist . A thinker-type of philosopher . A truly lonely freak from way back , much influenced by thep239things around him . . . Pure pathology . You voluntarilymessed in your brains with ideas , is n't that right ?  --  the worst kind of tampering . A confirmed solitary . Oh , you 're a difficult case , Al . They do n't show up on litmus paper , urinalysis , tap the knees , dilation of pupils . You 're a hard one , Al , but I really respect you to the utmost for it . I do . " It was as if he were pronouncing a marriage in and around the two of them . Al knew pure fear . He had fallen into the hands of a citizen . He was normal and they are relentless . " Look outside ! " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be struck about the head  --  not in the face as if in a fight , but about the head , as a man beaten . Mr. Mittance had something to show him . This was the lawyer and counselor talking . Forget the long wet pauses and the puckered lips . This man knew what he was long wet pausing and puckering about . " Look ! " Al went to the window of his basement cell . It gave onto a drain cut into a well beneath the street . He was lucky ; it was only the basement , not the sub-basement . By twisting he could see shadows , legs , shoes . There was sunlight . There were the bluish reflections of buildings , shadows within the damp shadows . Perhaps the really mean cases , not idea freaks like him , but bad chaps , victims , were kept in basements beneath his basement . He could still see shadows , and sometimesliving soot would drift comfortingly down between the grates at foot level . " All right ! " said the lawyer . " Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  freedom to walk the streets . Try to help me ! "  | " Those are girls , " Al said . " Help me to help you , Al . . . ! Where ? Which girls ? " " What can I do ? " Al asked . " Be M'Naughton rule for me ! Be crazy a little ! Help me , boy , I 'm just a Boalt Hall Graduate in law , not Law Review material , not Supreme Court justice clerk stuff , but I want to do you out of eight to eleven or worse . We live in a tough state . You heard about the mugger , he rolled down the hill with his victim , they got him on the state Lindbergh law  --  kidnapping ! A life sentence ! " He paused to do justice to the threat . He was an honest man . " Course , that was an inner city type , y'know what I 'm telling you  --  a public defender . I 'll do much better in your regard . " " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your parents are picking up the tab . You poor poor boy . But not in public . " The glasses had come off , the eyes were watering , the eyes were wiped , emotion receded ; Mr. Mittance was back on true course . This married sailor was emotionally stirred . By Al Dooley . It probably meant better service , but Al felt glad to be in jail , with policemen all about in case he needed help from sudden attack by tenderhearted , emotionally stirred , group-dynamic lawyer . " I shall try to explain , Al , with words of art  --  that 's the legal term for stuff we do n't like you laymen to understand . But you 're a smart lad , intelligent , cultured , handsome , charming , blue-eyed , uh , where was I ? " " Water under the bridge . " " Right ! You can understand me and I 'll explain it all to you . Refreshed myself last night , reading my notes from school and the sunset rose over the Berkeley hillsp241with pink and violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the hearing to establish present sanity . Can you understand the charges against you ? Can you participate in your own defense ? Those are important questions , Al , and I implore you . Excuse that . I 'm a bit nervous . " Al said , " I think I follow so far . " " I 'm a little nervous because this is a new type of trial for me . We 're going to get in the newspapers together , Al . You represent the youth of our time , troubled , uneasy , rootless , striving . And so do I. I hope you believe that . " " I do . " " Oh I do , too . " " I know you do . " " We both do , Al . I 'm only forty-nine , very healthy , not too old for getting in touch . Well , fifty . " " That 's really young , sir . " Mr. Mittance  --  Stan  --  gave him his burning reproachlook . That Sir really cut him to the quick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your kids under thirty . Stan was trying to be up front and gut level all the way . " I 'm into all kinds of awareness , " he said softly . " Right now , for example , I 'm a little up tight because I 'm due for a special weekend stew at Bolinas . I 'm overdue , Al . " Al was sympathetic . Once he had known a girl who was overdue . " It 's the mind-zap stew for professionals , doctors , lawyers , social workers , wizards , and of course your top Bay Area writers and artists . We really lay it on the line , Al , and there is n't an ounce of phoniness left by the time the weekend is over . Forty-eight hours ofp242utter frankness and no smoking . It 's nothing but basics  --  hostility , aggression , and love . But I had to take a raincheck this weekend , Al , in order to prepare your case . " Al bowed his head . The man had a point there . If he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be here at all . He could attend his stew . There was a long space of silence and the gathering of psychic power . Essentially Mr. Mittance saw his role as that of helper . He would have liked to put it simply  --  a kind of truth-telling interpersonal legal love-gypsy , only with profound human connections and a chance to get a fresh start . The trouble with putting things simply like that is : they are not simple . He tried to express it with the language of the eyes , as they do in South Korea , Tahiti , Acapulco , and the Haight-Ashbury . The moment might have been sweeter , were it not for a clang of doors and a thud of truncheon in the adjacent interrogation rooms . Just next door a couple of weary policemen were huffing and puffing and punching and kicking and explaining to prisoners their constitutional rights . " And now , " Al asked encouragingly . He did n't want to waste his parents ' funds . " And now , " said Mr. Mittance , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if trial there be . Becauseyou can be found not guilty simple and pure or you can be found not guilty by reason of insanity . By virtue of insanity they call it . It 's a bifurcated trial . Oh , it 's really a hearing  --  they consider all sorts of goodies . The first issue is guilt or innocence of the act , and the second has to do not with your actions but with your state of spirit . That 's your insanity . It 's an egop243trip . Sometimes I feel that way , too . Do you think you could ever learn to care about others , really care ? " " I 'm kind of involved with myself just now , " Al explained . " I know . I know , " said the lawyer . " I understand . Girls in Berkeley , girls in San Francisco , and a possible twenty-year term . It cuts a fellow off . I 'm sympathetic to the plight of the young . I 'm into that little deal , too . I like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule . But remember : only I , your attorney , stand between you and a long , unhappy sentence . Your Californiastate prisons tend to be non-creative and antilife . Just get in touch a little , Al . " " I 'm trying . " " You 're thinking . You 're working it out in your mind . You are striving to get your head straight . I realize all that . If I did n't have insight , what kind of an attorney would I be ? " " Tell me more , " Al said , " about my chances to avoid nine to fourteen years in prison . " Mr. Mittance sharpened a finger at him . " Naughty , naughty , to be so curious . Oh , shame , Al . You 've met Detective Brown . He 's on your case and he 's a pussycat . " He took a noisy sucking breath and thrust his pelvis back into the pelvic socket . Not many lawyers had this freedom about the body which he learned from Esalen , Synanon , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little structural integration in La Jolla , some sensory awareness and gestalt awakening in the classrooms of Grace Cathedral , Yoga classes from Swami Sidney Cabot at the Berkeley Yacht Club ashram , and the complete series of intermediate and advanced sexual freedom lessons.  |p244He  was no hick like this kid might think . He did n't believe in freedom to rape , for example , but everything else was okay by him if it 's done with a real religious sense of experiment and wonder . Of course , freedom to rape is carrying things pretty far libertarianwise , even if you do want to ask yourself sometimes , Why do some smart girls have the privilege of just dangling it there in front of you and then they say No ? Well , let her do it ; that 's an ego trip . Stanford Mittanceremained a moderate in the field of sexual freedom , though he had passed the course with flying colors . He made distinctions too fine for minds which were not yet polymorphous perverse , educated by encountergroups for consenting adults only in the Berkeleyhills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who happened to be a legal love-gypsy ; he was also a member of the Bar . He went on briskly ; it was his job . " In some cases the mental condition of the defendantmight negative the required mental element . That 's the general category denoting the mental part of the crime which indicates a felony . Do you understand me ? " " No , " said Al . " I thought as much . I 'd better explain it in further detail . Without conforming to the M'Naughton rule about insanity , there is also the Miranda case and other contemporary precedents . You confessed , did n't you ? But who knows what you were really confessing ? " His eyes narrowed and he nodded twice . Only he knew . It took many kinds of therapy to put together all the pieces of the puzzle . " There is n't much doubt , " Al said . " I recognize myp245plight . My mind wanders , things do n't seem real , but I know what I 'm doing . " " You say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's my opinion . Sometimes not enough , but sometimes more than I seem to be . " Mr. Mittance shrewdly shook his head . " That 's your opinion and it 's your right to have it , " he said . " What a wondrous thing is Man  --  any other questions ? " " How should I behave at the hearing ? " " If you wear a coat and tie , the sentence is usually lighter . " Al wondered what he would do without a good Berkeley lawyer . " And another thing . " Legal firmness recompressing the corners of Mr. Mittance 's eyes . " I know you 're a beatnik with principles , Al . But usually the only one in the courtroom with the long haircut is the defendant . " And he winked . " Do you want me to cut it ? " " Not that it 's greasy . It 's nice and straight . It 's clean . It 's neat . But I want you to be my cub scout , Al , a veritable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no firm values . " Al had thought he might be guilty of primitive thinking . Either he would get away or he would be caught . Evidently he had been caught . But now punishmentseemed further away than ever . " I might want to stay inside and think awhile , " he said . " Yes , think of the disgrace to your folks who sired you and hired me , " said Mr. Mittance . " Think of your work in the world . Think of how horny you 'll get in a prison full of psychopaths and pederasts made thatp246way by the condition of their lives . Oftentimes it 's not a matter of free choice in their cases , Al . They are twisted that way . " " I 'm not sure . ' " You 're stubborn . " " It 's all moving so fast . " Mr. Mittance put his hand on his arm . " Let me slow it down for you . Let me tell you first of all you ca n't trust Professor Howe . I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What do you mean ? " " I know , " said the lawyer . " And I 'd hate to see you sent up , your young life blighted , because you 're not thinking good these days . Of course your synapses are flooded by the excitement . Naturally there 's been a little breakdown here and there . You 've gotten to be arrogant , an individualist , up tight . Poopie and all that ugly , ugly abuse did n't do you too much good , either . Oh , ugly . But try to take a good option on reality , Al . It 's all we 've got this side of madness . " So many people on Al 's side . So all alone with all these friends . So few enternities in the passing days . Al wished Mr. Mittance would n't pucker his mouth that way when he made a good point , though it was true , he did make some good points . Mr. Mittance stood off and fixed Al 's face with his gaze . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his finger , not hurting him , and made a little face . He was trying to make interpersonal contact with his client and trying to make him cooperate nicely and appreciate what might be done for him . " I need your help , " he said . " Al , I ca n't carry this burden all by myp247lonesome . You might think this so-called Professor Howe will work things out for you  --  " " No , " said Al . " But this time he wo n't . And if I ca n't either , it 's assault in the shower time , Al , it 's a lot worse than that convicted felon Paul Cola , it 's you hardly get a chance to say , No , I prefer not to swing like that . Those brutes are on you like elephants . Those guards look the other way . " He got his eyes focused for gut-level contact and put his face near Al 's . Onion in the sandwich within the last two or three hours . " Those are Mister Baddies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you . They do n't ask if you 're a consenting adult . I want you to think it through and do n't blow it with me . " " I 'm trying to think , " Al said . " Listen to me . " " I 'm trying to feel . " " Do what I say , Al , and start drifting a little with the tide and let 's see if we can save you from the tormentof being a loser , a jetsam , a kid growing old with shame in his heart and a lot of hurt in the parts of his body . " Al was silent . Mr. Mittance shook his head . " Trouble with you young folks under thirty these days is when do you take things seriously ? When , Al ? " " Right now , " Al said . " I 'm trying . " Mr. Mittance said as if he had n't heard : " Try . " " Is this the right way ? I 've gotten off so many ways . My life has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , Al . I 'm happy that you 're learning to have emotions , even if it interferesp248with a modified M'Naughton Rule judgment . Just do n't let on is all I ask . And always remember , " Mr. Mittance was saying , " no matter how blue you sometimesfeel , Al , in this stinking hole not worthy of a hippie lad of your fineness and delicacy , as you rot I suppose in this Les Miserables of a sewer , no matter how many appeals fail and whatsoever torments of the damned , I 'll always be sitting on my sailboat in the springtime sun of the San Francisco Bay , trying to understand you . I 'll be there . Let me lay it on the line for you  --  fifty-two springtimes , but firm . Count on me . An appreciation for youth 's foibles which is pure , fine , and extra-judicial . " " Thank you , " said Al . He was studying desperation . He was learning fast . Life and other people slip out of reach . Clang . The nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue chest , said , " I believe your time is up , sir . " " I wish to appeal that , " said Stanford Mittance . " Caw me Stan . " " Okay , Stan , it 's dinner time for the psychologically disturbed and the criminally insane . Everybody 's got to go to chow . " " Are you hungry , kid ? " the lawyer asked . Al nodded . Tonight there was bread pudding . He had seen them crumbling the bread and fumbling the raisins . " Then I 'll depart . " He shot a look at Al which said : No manly clasping before this facetious blue-clad linear-thinkingminion . We 'll expand our fraternal awarenesssome other time.  |p249Clang  . Farewell to legal counsel for now . Oh , he was right , he was right about the ego trip . Al 's zapped mind lay curled up someplace inside . He would have asked Mr. Jones to wake him from the dream , but that would be taking a chance on the dream into which he might be awakened . Smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister or a salesman , Jarod returned . The cop who ushered him in wore respect in the sirloin grain of his face . Dr. Howe was a citizen , a person , and a non-felon . " Hello , friend , you may wonder why I 'm here , " he said . Now he 's a pitchman , Al thought . Hi , friends out there in used-car land , it 's Dodgerama time again " You may wonder why I do n't need to smile , shuffle , and carry an old oilskin shopping bag . Well , do n't need to yell either , citizen  --  " A permanent carburetor ? battery additive ? tune-up for the soul and spirit ? What 's he selling this time ? " Jarod , please , what 's the joke ? " "  --  but I mutter jes ' a little cause Ah loves it . "  |p250Down  into the watermelon patch . " I do n't mind , " Al said . " You 've got something going against me . But I wish you would n't . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just fine . " "  --  Ellen and my kids ? " Jarod smiled sweetly . " I came to talk a little . I see they put us here in a nice visiting room . Hey , you with the monitor , you hear me ? Should I speak up ? He paused , winked at the wall , pouted , waited for the non-answer from the planted transistors , and turned back to Al . " You got an A for the seminar , although normally we expect a paper to sum up the field work . However , your data will be tabulated  --  " " Shut up , " Al whispered . Silence . Jarod shrugged indifferently . He decided to make a new start . " First me , " he said , " then nobody . And then all the rest . But I really like you , Al , that 's why I talk this way . " He peered at Al and shook his head . " Heard about that gullet of yours . Al , that is one award-winningabrasion . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . " " I have something in mind . " " I know . " " What is it ? " Jarod was delighted . He grinned . " I do n't know . " " It 's up to me , is n't it ? " " I 've been waiting . " " Stop waiting , " Jarod said . " Is n't it time for you to speak up ? " " Think of all the poets who died in prison , " Al said . " If I were a poet . For politics . So maybe I can do some prison , even if it ca n't be clear-cut politics and I didn'tp251burn my draft card . It was my sinus . It 's politics , too , in a way . Jarod smiled . " Your way , boy . " " I wanted to do something for myself . " " Those poets had causes . " " So do I. " " A poor cause . Yourself . " " That 's all there is until I find a better one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a cause . He thought of losing Sue , but that was the sacrifice of a prize he had never earned . Something must be real , there must be something to be remembered in history , something must feel like loss . Jarod puzzled over him , squeezing his eyes so that red and purple and whitish lines appeared . " You 're not taking this seriously . That 's what the shrink means about lack of affect . Is it what you 're thinking ? You playing games with me ? " Al shrugged and turned his hands out . " No more'n you playing games with me , Jarod . " " Um . I see . You 're going to miss things . " He knew how to make Al listen . " Take Ellen . You 'll miss all the chances . Love , and then it 's over and nothing can be saved . She hates or you hate . Or nobody hates , and you 've got nothing at all . No feelings , it seems . So you start again  --  this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either , of course . Heartbreak , pal . I 'm forty . " " You 're young to be so tired . " " I 'm forty-two . " " When a girl puts her arms around you , how old are you ? " " It means she 'll take them away later . Cramps . She'llp252want to or you 'll want her to . And so . " Al was horrifiedby his face . There were mummy crinklings . The air would strike him in this gray tomb and he would shrivel to nothing . " Do n't feel sorry for me . Here you are and here I am . These are selfish tears . " But there were no tears . " If what I 've been going through is the crisis of turning forty , then the human race is composed of heroes , all those who survive to be forty-one . " " That 's the famous Tony Curtis comeback , due to vitamin pills , exercise , health  --  " " And the sweet breath of young girls  --  classic . You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a girl puts her arms around you . " He grinned . " I have simple needs , pal  --  to be surrounded by a few people who will soon hate me . " He pushed out his legs in the chair with comfortable fatigue after this display , yawning as if ready to doze after an afternoon'sramble along the bay with a dog at his side . Al thought : Like a comfortable animal . Al thought : He has perfect discharge of emotion . No animal is that comfortable . He 's a sieve . But why is this sieve making it all his problem ? I 'm in jail , and we 're both thinking about him . That 's what a leader does . The people get in trouble , and they worry about the leader in his palace . Jarod said , " I 'd like to be a lover  --  of white people , of these California hills and deserts , of the sea , of America , of my students and colleagues , of my work and living out my time . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Twenty-twos . Which is a part of taking care of myself , man . " " You tell me this  --  " " Because I 'm trying to take care of you . You 're ap253smart one , honky . Ah do n't like that word . You 're a smart one , pal . " Al raised his hand like a boy asking permission . " Then maybe , " he said , ignoring the new accent , " maybe you should take care of me , if you 're my guide and mentor . " " Um . Okay . I know you might not get off , so I 'll tell you a little about prison life . If you 're sent to jail , practice self-pleasure . Masturbate a lot . Refuse to be buggered if you can . It leads to future difficulties . But do n't fear jacking off . You can make it very refined and amusing . You wo n't be able to curve your back as much as you 'd like to . You 'll find new resources . But think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , thanks for coming , " Al said . " Loneliness wo n't leave you alone . " " I think you 'd better go now . " " Been nice talkin ' to you , " said Jarod . " Playtime , " said Al . " Conversation City , " said Jarod . " It 's your friendly Tupperware salesman , here for the installment . " " I have no idea what you 're up to , " Al said . " It 's all under the shit . " Jarod smiled . " Thank you . " " Well , goodbye . " Nothing done . They had spoken of important mattersand nothing had been said . There was a vision of another way , a life of truth-telling and gentleness , and they did not believe in it , and yet the vision of it troubledthem both . " Wait ! " Al said . Jarod turned to look at him . He was carrying a tat/tered manila envelope instead of his briefcase . It was like the confession of some deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm waiting . " " Do n't you have any more ? " " Well , maybe , " Jarod said . " Why do n't you tell me ? You said you wanted to help me . I need help now . I 'm desperate , I 'm in trouble , I need help . " He wanted Jarod to tell him the truth , any truth , so long as he meant it . Maybe only that we are all terminalcases . No matter what we build and consume , the end is near . Despite California living and vitamin pills and heart transplants , anyone now alive is heading in just one direction . He believed Jarod knew the truth . Something more . He wanted Jarod to speak . " Remember , " Jarod asked , " remember how I said I 'd try to get you off ? Remember about my friends , my federal judge , those owe-me and word-on-downers ? " " I remember what you said . " " Well , " Jarod grinned , " well , well , the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to do for me . So I guess maybe you 're on your own . " Al shrugged . Relief . " Almost . I got a few trickerations left , though . Hey , brother , do n't give up on me , y'hear ? " " Fine . I appreciate that . " " All right , " said Jarod at the door , ringing the buzzerthat would get him let out . The buzzer was stained like a beetle 's mottled back . " You jumped my wife , you wanted to jump me , did n't you ? Was it because I 'm a nigger , honky ? or your teacher ? or your old man ? "  |p255Al  began to laugh . It felt hilarious . He was floating on grass . Jarod was too smart to be so stupid . He had something in mind , but Al would no longer play with him . He was making Ellen a silly tool , like Al , himself , like everything . He was the enemy . No , he was nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was not laughing . A deep and impenetrable silence between them . The guard , Mr. Jones , was there . He opened the door . He stood respectfully waiting for the important black man to move . " Let me go my own way , " Al said . " No . No you do n't . Man , in this world , it 's science , not romance . " " From now on stay out of my way , " Al said . " Man , I wo n't let you , " Jarod said . The guard moved toward them , puzzled by what it seemed he might have to do  --  protect this innocent black professor from attack by a crazed probably dope fiend killer bankrobberkid . Jarod put up his hand . He could take care of it . Mr. Jones should n't worry , so he took a step back to do his worrying . Jarod said to Al : " I 'm not going to let you hide in jail , Al . Drop on out like the rest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music . You might have to face Lawrence Welk . " " I mean it . I do n't want you anymore . " " I might could not be able to do anything . " " That 's fine . That 's what I want . " " I 'm going to try . " " Jarod , if you 'll just leave me one bit of friendship for you , you 'll stay out of this . " " I do n't mind if you kill me , boy . I 'm going to shake you loose from this particular dream if I can . "  | " You ca n't . " Jarod shrugged . " The new governor does n't listen to me . " You ca n't . " " The people in Washington , they 're new , they do n't like me . They think I 'm shiftless . " " You ca n't . " Jarod was grinning and waiting for something more . Call him nigger . Call him cuckold . Call him fool . " Get out , " Al said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know you . " " You 've given me what I needed . Thank you , " Jarod said . The door clanged shut . In a moment Mr. Jones would reappear to take Al back to his cell . Al pressed the mottled beetle 's back in case he forgot . They were n't very careful about escapes in this county jail. 20 During the next few months Al wasin a kind of nervous state , sort ofjumpy . His mother pointed out to his father and hisfather pointed out to the court-appointed psychiatrist : It 's only natural that our boy Al be a little nervous , youknow , not crazy , just jumpy , just not guilty by virtue ofp257insanity , since he was betrayed by his close friend Milly and she was small comfort to him because she was engaged to this untrained musician , Mr. Cola , her fiance at the time , and those bills were so new and clean and consecutively numbered and growing up is such a problem , a true dilemma , growing up mature , anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The criminal case did not make him a criminal for others , it seemed ; it made him interesting . Because he was a college boy from Santa Barbara , the city and county toyed with his crime as he did , ambiguously tolerated him , hated to take him seriously . If he had evaded the draft or refused to go to Viet Nam , maybe they 'd have grown irritable . But robbing a bank ? Well , he 'd only done it once . In a world devoted to ideas these things matter less than they used to . A letter had come for Al at home and his lawyer handed it over . Needle Park Ur-Frisco 4 Aquarius 4You still thinking about thinking about someone else , Harry Krishna ? Me too . I caught it from you . Your sickning but friendly , Cody . Somehow , although he did not recall her using the word , he had always known she would pronounce and spell it " sickning. "  | " Who 's that from ? " Mr. Mittance asked . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a face . He rubbed the crick in his neck from reading the letter around Al 's fists . " I 'm only trying to help any way I can , " he said , " but I guess I caught you there . Some girl , I 'll bet . " " Does n't matter , " Al said . Mr. Mittance continued his face in the dimension of time , stretching the look of Okay I Wo n't Touch . " I did n't say it did . Try to think of me as just your lawyer , priest , and spiritual advisor and we 'll all be a lot happier , Al . " Al made the effort . " Nothing to tell ? " Al shook his head . Mr. Mittance swallowed , trying to overcome spiritual advisor 's chagrin . " I have some other questions , " he said . Somehow Al had to come part way through his isolation . He was using it to get an edge on things . It was making him high , like methedrine ; it helped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move someplace , think things through , and if that did n't help , act things through . But that 's what leads nice kids from good families to bank-robbing if they do n't like what drugs do to their heads . Robbing a bank was only a gesture , it seemed , like so many other bits of gesture or luck . It did n't change him all by itself . It did n't even define him anew as criminal . Well , let it work in him awhile . Jarod had said : " A chance to do some great field work in the cultural anthropology of prisons . There 's ap2559good group of Muslims and Panthers . They got an old friend of mine in here . " " They keep me pretty much in isolation . I walk in the yard . " " They 're protecting you from harm . Well , fewer clues , but pick up on the ones there are . " The clues here were : clangs , noises , shouts , smells , and sorting out his anxieties . His body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore dreams  --  sheriff 's macrobiotic . And now that he expected letters from Sue , he did n't get any more . And did n't care , either . And the loneliness that did not leave him alone . Poopie , on the other hand , carried his head high in a rare mood of contentment . " Does like I say , that girl , " he informed his friends at the Minimum Daily Requirement , proud of his lady Milly , though he did splinter her guitar and beat her up a bit after she confessedthat she had been weak in the flesh with Al . Poopie was afflicted with an outmoded moral code . He tended to forget that he had been away from Milly for a whole weekend . Also . Also there were lots of other complications . Dr. BessieFrisch , who had his own problems , fiddled with the hearing aid attached to his horn-rimmed glasses while he listened to everybody . The hearing aid led both to his ears and to a miniature transistor tape recorderbuilt into the Phi Beta Kappa key dangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bessie Frisch had been teased so much about his first name as a child  --  he was named after his mother 's favorite sister , and had worn bangs until he was four/teen  --  that he was given his choice by fate at the age of twenty : Become a psychiatrist or remain nervous , jumpy . Well , it was sensible to give a look to psychiatry . He gave it a look . He took it up . Now , handling other people 's problems in the mentalhealth field , he oftentimes became nervous , jumpy . Also he suffered from swollen glands under the arms . But he was shrewd . Shrewdly he asked Al , " Do you think you developed a criminal mentality out of protest , hm ? against the name Al ? " " Hm ? " Al asked cagily . " It 's short for Alice , I presume , hm ? " asked Dr. B. Frisch . ( He was called " Bea " by his close friends , who sought to avoid embarrassment whenever they could . ) It turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried another approach to this curious problem in psychopathy . He interviewed Milly , Poopie , the policeofficers , including the talkative one who went to extension courses , and the bony little lady who had been teller in the bank . Recently she had left that job to work at the notions counter of a Woolworth 's . She reported on Al 's behavior when he had been robbing the bank : " He looked like a fine young man , well brought up , intelligent , kind , and considerate . Only he seemed a trifle nervous , jumpy . I would say temporary insanity , Doc . " " Hm , " said Bessie , arms akimbo . " No , let me express it one more time , " said the lady . " Temporary insanity . That 's what I would say . " The bony little ex-teller wore a heavy tan . She had just returned from an all-expenses-paid trip to Acapulco . She ascribed her error in first defining the bank robber to the police as a dark-skinned colored Negrop261person , a spook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing her brown contacts . Now she only wore her green contacts and any bandits at the Woolworth'snotions counter would be juvenile delinquents from Mars . The wheels of justice ground away against the evidence . No power on earth could stop the march of American social work . With the exception of Paul Cola , most thoughtful citizens seemed to agree that it would be a shame for such a fine young man , adventurous , far-sighted , ambitious , and nervous , to be locked away among criminals , rapists , bank robbers , anti-social types tending to exert a bad influence on an innocent young psychopath . Poopie , on the other hand , argued for the gas chamber . He had always found strong punishment a deterrentto crime . He had friends in the Minutemen who advised him on sociological matters . When asked if he was a member himself , he put forth an objection . " I ai n't gon na tell you , " he said . " But we got our stash someplace  --  and it ai n't grass , which would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guns are for sport and killin ' the foreign subversives . " Most people around the San Francisco Bay came to have opinions in the case . Information was generous , passionate , analytic , and concerned . The San Francisco Chronicle did its duty by its critical readership . A reporter who specialized in hippies , drugs , topless dancers , and school riots  --  the education beat  --  did a first-person interview with Al Dooley . How did you get that way , Al ? What troubled you as a youth , Al ? Do you feel you have struck a blow for something , Al ? He had to figure out the answers to his questions him/self , since the authorities would n't actually let him in to see Al . The San Francisco Examiner went out to talk with the concerned relatives , teachers , and congressmanof the twisted mind , and then rewrote the Chronicle 's interview . The Oakland Tribune covered the story as news , but finally responded more emotionallywith an editorial urging the closing of the university if this was the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationalizations , as quoted in the Chronicle interview , indicated an overintellectualand nihilistic individual , probably involved in the conspiracy to tear down the very fabric of American civilization . The radical underground press rallied about the cause and set up a fund for The Berkeley One , as they named Al . He had struck a revolutionary blow against the money economy . Under the headline PIGS THWART THOUGHTS , they informed the public that a copy of Chairman Mao 's little red book , addressed to Al Dooley , had been stopped at the front office of the jail . A Bible , however , had been let through , and this proved once and for all that Church and State are not separated in the military-industrial complex . The hippieunderground press published anguished reports about the inhuman deprivation of drugs and sex in jail . That was how they treat martyrs in this country  --  no grass . Without grass to counteract that greasy jail food , Al was sure to get cancer . They also rewrote the Chronicle 's interview with Al the Bank Freak . Al Dooley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was pity , and there was puzzlement . A public nerve vibrated with the contemplation of this taciturn young man who must have suffered a greatp263deal . He had pale eyes , poor posture , and metaphysical angst . He gave the media something to do other than wars , sports , and disasters . The Question Man stopped six people and asked them , Would you rob a bank ? and they all said , in their various individual fashions , No , not necessarily . The Chronicle 's interview was so successful that the reporter who wrote it did another while on his vacation in Acapulco . This one was highly sympathetic to Al Dooley . The reporter composed some fine lines about the puzzle of life , early toilet training and late weaning , the Spock generation . From Acapulco he asked the Al Dooley in his head , " Would you do it again ? " And imaginary Al Dooley answered , " No , it was the wrong way to approach my problems , I know that now . " The reporter happened to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the newspaper and Al 's father said it was so well-written it made him want to cry . This made the reporter want to cry , too , because he had n't taken a girl with him to Acapulco . When the investigation was completed , it was time for a legal hearing . Mr. Jones , the non-civil-service guard who liked to talk to Al about his children and the school problem , led him into court . Judge Harlow , robes flapping , pounded for silence . Particularly his sleeves flew . All interested parties were questioned . Al explained how he had really meant to go on a freedom ride or join the Peace Corps , but he just had n't thought of it in time . He had wanted to do something exceptional . No one had invited him to be an astronaut . He would have liked to explore inner and outer space . That was what was in his heart . No one had shown him how to float a new electronics stock . He wouldp264have liked to abscond to Brazil . Later on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the kind of embezzler he would have been . Colonel Glenn had written his memoirs for Life . This kind of irritated Al . He had wanted to break out of his routine . He , too , could be an exceptional man . He had wanted to get rich quick , plus famous and distinguished . The judge interrupted : " That 's enough out of you , Accused ! " His defending lawyer , Stanford Mittance , leapt to his feet in protest : " Your Honor ! In this modern world of today ! The misunderstood youth of a troubled urbanculture ! " " Objection sustained , " said the judge . Milly Peck , wearing a black veil , lifted the lace with one finger in order to shoot Al an apologetic , heavily shadowed look . The spiritual projectile of sadnessshot all the way across the courtroom to where Al waited in the witness chair while his lawyer engaged the judge in a duel of wits . Milly was in mourning for her swollen features which were distorted by grief and being beaten up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll always care for me in the future as you did the month before yestermonth . Poopie forced me . " Objection ! " shouted Al 's lawyer in response to a fine point of jurisprudence . " I already said sustained ! " cried the judge . At last Al 's lawyer was satisfied . He could not demandan abject apology from the presiding judge . He had received simple justice and that would have to suffice for the moment . He pinched the bridge of his nose where it had been pinched by his gold pince-nez glasses . " Step down , " he said kindly to Al , and offeredp265him an arm . He whispered , " Was n't that sweet of the judge to sustain my objection ? " Milly kept on shooting look after look at Al as he walked unaided to his chair . Al 's trouble had matured Milly . She was grateful to him . Poopie had discovered the undiscovered depths in her , thanks to Al . She did n't really care so much about the guitar . When Al settled himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the looks of apology subsided . Also Poopie 's ire was being stimulated . He sure did make demands on a girl . However , Poopie remained in good humor . He enjoyedgetting on the side of law and order when the opportunity presented itself . He was still smiling , with just a little bit of ire , when Al 's lawyer called him to the witness stand . Poopie declared : " I just asked her and she tole me . Does like I say , that chick . " Then he had a surprise deposition to make . " But seems to li'l ole me like Al never intended for to make a bank heist . He was driven out of his skull , you know , he flipped . . . " He caught Al 's father 's eye . " Your Honor , I would say he was nervous and jumpy because he did n't feel so good . " Poopie also had a nice tan . Then Milly mounted the stand as a character witness . " I was mean to him , like for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honor . A man needs some resistance , some challenge to his manliness in this our culture of modern rootlessness . Did I forget anything ? I feel so nervous and jumpy up here on the courtroom stand . " And Al 's parents also were invited to speak at con/siderable length . It turned out that Al had always been foursquare behind the American Constitution and carefully selected numbers from the Top Ten Bill of Rights , in favor of firmness in Asia , tempered by mercy , and spent many a fretful hour with accompanyingsinus attacks at the thought that the Communists might someday succeed in their design to take over the Sovereign State of California and use it as a base of operations against Arizona and Nevada . His worries about the role of youth in the future of America made him kind of " I know , " said the severe but kindly judge . " All of us here in these chambers believe in tempering justice with a bit of largesse , do we not ? do n't we ? But I 'll make the decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he declared , looking about him nervously . It was a legal hearing , not a trial , but still a fellow ca n't be too careful . He toyed with a small set of copper cuff links which he had just brought back from his recentvacation in Acapulco . Dr. Bessie Frisch tamped out his pipe and summarizedhis report . " Good , good , " he said to the judge . " As it emerged in my examination , the name Al , ' for this particular patient , awakens nightmares of feminine disturbance in his childish oedipal frustrations . Now if we take the name seriously , Alice , ' say , or Alberta ' . . . Somewhat jumpy , even nervous , " he concluded . Al wished his parents had n't said that about Asia . It did not fairly represent his convictions . But the point was simple when you come to think of it . They wanted to get him off and he wanted to get on with it . They always told him to get along with people and the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherep267and what to get on with . He had sickened in the world with a little help from his friends . In prison he might have other kinds of help he did n't want . Prison is n't supposed to be the good life , either . The old boy had a point there , too . His father was winking at him across the courtroom . His mother was snuffling a little , and reaching for the Kleenex in her purse , and hoping that maybe he would come into the travel agency business in Santa Barbara when all this silly business got cleared up . You can recommend a stay in Acapulco to people without fearing they will regret it or catch intestinal infestations , the so-called Montezuma 's Revenge , contrary to what some people think . She 'd never even heard of the Aztec Two-Step . Those were filthy rumorsspread by the rival agency , which sold Royal Hawaii . Little did people know the danger they ran eating all that poi ; sometimes the trouble does n't show up for thirty years . Al would be really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the business  --  always good with people . And now it was Dr. Jarod Howe 's turn on the stand . Al 's mother could n't take her eyes off him , but Mr. Dooley studied the flags at the judge 's right and left hands , California and the U.S.A. , and then his nails , and then the flags again . Jarod testified that Al was a serious , imaginative young man who did his work carefully and tried to draw the logical consequences of his studies . He blamed himself for Al 's troubles : for urging Al to take things seriously . He was a normal man , Jarod said , in an abnormal world . ( This did not sit well with the judge . Fortunately it came from a black man and hep268could n't blame Al . ) " I misled him , " said Jarod , and that sat better with the peers . " I made him want things the way we minority peoples do , crazy things , immoral things . Mea culpa . I think it was my fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft evasion , and when they are finished and the defermentis made permanent , then what ? After the four acrid , leaf-burning seasons with the books and the girls , the smoke , the coffee , and the talk  --  then what ? No military service at all , and four more years of graduatestudy , or maybe five . " Take the Haight , " Dr. Howe said , " take Telegraph Avenue , take the East Village . They 're America 's first teen-age slums . We have to find something else for our youth to do . " Fortunately , as he spoke , there was a tiny little race riot going on across the bay . The National Guard and the police were busy . Not all the young people were hippies and beatniks . Fortunately for Al , Oakland blacks were carting television sets ( color ones ) out of the fifty-pay shops , to replace the black-and-white sets from the riots of two years ago . The new color jobs had n't been in yet . Fortunately perspectives were changing all over America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not much more of a criminal than anyone else , it seemed . After Viet Nam , another new way might have to be found. judge Harlow listened to all this with a knot of rage gathering in his heart . The courtroom was hot and stuffy and he wore nothing but shorts under his judicialrobes and kept an electric fan blowing between his legs , blowing like blind justice , first on one side and then on the other , but nevertheless he felt nervous and distracted by so many people getting away with sop269many errors ( loose talk , bombastic assertions , crimes against nature and society ) . What right had this nice boy to be such a bad boy ? What right had the irrationaland rational to triumph against the irrelevant ? And he knew the doctor was right , he had to cut down on the cholesterol , it was doing things to his thought transferences . Arteriosclerosis would be a problem for a clerk , a lawyer , or even a defendant ( the one with the long hair ) , but  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect justice . Those little globs of spongy sticky fat in his arteries made the blood do a little turnaround , a little double reverse twist , spinning dizzily into his heart , but it did n't interfere with the march of truth unto the gas chamber . Well , capital punishment is n't so bad any more , either . They give the star of the show a bit of tranquilizer to prevent his dragging his feet and scratching and screaming . They just usually went mild and philosophical down the long , long trail , and stoned out of their nuts . Judge Harlow believed in mercy , too . And progress . And revenge against the wicked . He was saying : " People like you ruin nations , epochs , the best of families ! " Oh dear , the voice of morality . That usually means no probation and lots of road repair or , in the South , the picking of the sheriff 's peaches . " People like you are no good to the world , no good to yourselves ! " A stab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remind us that it 's all there for the taking  --  fun , kicks , freedom , power  --  but lemme tell you something , boy : it is n't . It is n't ! is the answer , just in case you 're asking any questions . And yet you have idealism , it is not all quenched , you remind me of myselfp270when I was young once and human . Poor lad , if only you can be saved . Will it help to be abused by the perverts and criminals who sometimes work their way into the otherwise outstanding prison system of the state of California ? If only there could be a junior prison system , like there 's a junior college system . For unconfirmed intellectuals they got the junior college system , and what do they have for unconfirmed criminals ? Nada . Reformatories is another kettle of fish . Youth Detention , but do n't contradict me , I warn you . " On occasion Al was learning to have good sense . He neither contradicted nor interrupted . Judge Harlow continued soothingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respecthim , too . I respect the stool pigeon folks who give us law enforcement personnel in the judicial division such helpful advice . I have respect for people  --  that 's fundamental . I intend to recommend Detective Brown to higher office for Devotion to Duty . Devotion is a must in our chosen field of endeavor . Many 's the time Detective Brown has been selected for a disagreeable task . It 's not all just patriotic stuff , riding a motorcycle , escorting visiting dignitaries , putting down student riots , you know . Sometimes you go to wait quietly in the interrogation chambers , too . It do n't make no never-mind if you get varicose veins from just standing there . Your own innermost feelings do n't matter , how you feel about violence on people . You 're just doing your job . You got to treat our criminal class with the only kind of treatment they understand  --  firmness within the limits of what the law allows , nothing showingon the x-rays . Incidentally , it 's been proven youp271get just as clear an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , a kid with a good stable home . Harken to my words , boy , but do n't let your mind wander . You look all shook up . That way lies anarchy . You do n't have any call to be such . Obey ! You think you have the right to make up your own mind , but look at the ants and worms crushed by the bodies of lovers in the park ! Look at the birds made into a really sad goo by the propellers of prop-jets . " Al looked . " Not there , fella , here . " The judge was frowning and stern . " Try to pay me the attention I deserve . " Al said nothing . The judge winked and kicked a leg of his chair , narrowly missing the fan . It was a way he had of kicking it , like a habit , irritably . " Do n't interrupt , defendant , especially to disagree with me in your heart of hearts . " The court reporter was beaming and writing . He was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to catch up . But the judge was a little cross , because he could n't really kick the chair without hurting something , his toes , his fan , the feelings of the bailiff or the defendant . He proceeded with the examination . " That witness of yours stuck his nose in the air and he 's a  --  just a  --  a big , um , professor . I 'm not saying he 's not as sensitive to x-rays as your next person . Do n't misunderstand me , son . And that girl let you do those fun things to her and she dresses so nice and neat . And you look like a good old boy and you robbed a bank , did n't you ? Well , this sort of destruction of our basic values has got to cease in this country . " Some of the crowd in the courtroom came to theirp272feet ( scattered applause ) , but he shushed them with an upraised hand . He was a Mendocino circuit judge . He was a North Beach Marconi &; Columbus Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you repent ? " he cried . " What do you think , Judge ? " Al asked . " Do n't interrupt , especially to agree , Al . " Al kept his peace . Judge Harlow waited approvingly . Ten , nine , eight , seven . . . " I think you repent , " he said . " I do , I do . " " That 's so nice . Thanks to God . Oh , praises be ! Our Lord is a highly talented , emotionally unbalanced individualHimself . He makes mistakes , too ; long hair and a beard . Threw the first stone . Set that lad free , " he cried to the bailiffs , " and give him compensation . " Six , five , four , three . . . " I was only kidding , boy . No , keep that guard on him . " He leaned forward and examinedAl 's face . " I just wanted to see if you would take advantage of me . Start to run and make your getaway . You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He stopped talking . It was as if the rattle of wings had ceased . Al knew he was insane , but he knew he knew , and this made him wonder if maybe he was just overtired . Oh dear , that 's judgely thinking . He 's done it to me . " Quiet in the court ! " someone cried . The judge was that someone . " Quiet down , fellas , I asked you in a nice way . The judge said ptooey into his fingertips . Ptui ! He rubbed his hands.  |p273He  said : " Okay , kiddo , I 'll tell you what I 'm gon na do . You committed this here crime while our country needed you not to do it . So I ca n't let you off . But on the other hand , you 're not one of our average numbskullneurotic kids with those student riots , non-negotiableNegro demands  --  I 'm not implying anything against our black citizens and voters , of course , their kind of radicalism and no firm values . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , sick and pathetic . I 'll have to be good to you , because you 're crazy , see ? Ill in the head which is turned around funnyways because of God knows what self-abuse at a tender age . Psychiatric . Not necessarily an attack on our basic institutions , just a little bank snatch . Would you promise to be good henceforward , Al ? " " What ? " Al asked . " Just for supposing 's sake , supposing I let you off  --  promise ? promise to be good ? " Al saw his father and mother nodding and smiling . Mr. Mittance , his lawyer , was triumphantly but modestlyexamining his cuticle . Dr. Bessie Frisch was conductinga little in the air with his pencil . " Send me up ! " Al cried . " Oh , God , I do n't want it ! I do n't want your favors ! I do n't want your rotten time ! " He got up and ran to the swinging aperture which led from the abstract legal terrain of justice to the humane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinning and nodding as if he had done just right , he had done good . " Let me out ! " he yelled . Of course , by this time a guard had him secure  --  blue arms , a badge cutting him in sudden embrace , cutting his heart like a cookie into the shape of a silver star . Another guard with another cookie cutter gleam/ing on his chest watched to see if he had any concealedweapons , razors , suicide pills . " Let me out ! Take me back ! " Imperiously the judge lifted his arm . " Wait , " he cried . " This is very inneresting ! Do n't think I wo n't take this into consideration , accused . " " Take me back to my cell ! " Al pleaded . The judge called in a deep and commanding voice , " Listen , buster , when anybody leaves this court first , it 's me . It 's got to be that way . It 's a must . But do n't think I 'm blind to what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric fan , he picked up his robes about him and dashed into his chambers . He was wearing a detachable snap-on bow tie . It fell and lay like a small bird on the scratched , polished , rescratched , re-polished floors . Jarod was bobbing and smiling at Al . There was the blotched reflection of the flag of the state of California on his shiny forehead . He turned  --  the flag of the U.S. of A. on his forehead . Al sought to awake into the world and make good contact with his trial . Surely it had n't all happened in his macrobiotic head . He should have listened more closely . But the hearing was over and Mr. Jones led him back.  | Al returned to his cell that afternoon toawait consultations , deliberations , and verdict . It was n't like a trial . Things had to be taken into account . Justice must be blind , but nice about it ; a bandage about her eyes , giving the weights to this criminal and the scales to that . The habit of not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit into the pattern like all jail habits . Not making contact is an action which requires no action . A simple style of incarceration frees the moral imagination  --  thisseemed to be the theory  --  and stimulates the proper regrets . Alone  --  leave them alone . Now Al would have liked to change the pattern , but the other prisoner did it for him . Al was just resting after the social rigors of his hearing . It had been a busy day for a closed-in fellow accustomed to four walls and his own thoughts . He lay on his bunk with his knees drawn up and his eyes deciphering the message of the ceiling . In the next cell there was a sudden yelling at dinner time , a lot of yelling from the spade cat , normally a silentPanther , who was recovering from resisting arrest . The doctor had come in and said , " No , there wo n't be any scars . Yeah , he 'll heal over okay , " and so they had taken away his dime and were n't letting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay before hisp276actual trial . The Panther was n't a kid . He used to be Wilbur X , but now he had shifted over , religion was too slow at bringing the millennium , and he was a squad leader for self-defense of the Black Panther Party , and he had just discovered the strangest thing about himself . And so he was yelling . If it had been just himself who was hurt , he would have cooled it , kept it quiet , but it involved others  --  five children for openers . The guard , Mr. Jones , who brought him the usual greasy dinner , tasting of tray , used to tell him about those kids . " Number one boy , I really love him . . . That girl eleven of mine , she sits in my lap and I really love her . . . My baby , he was the baby for two years , he 's only nine , I really get a kick out of him but he 's sort of , well , retarded . You know , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't give birth for a whole day afterward  --  dumb does . Then there 's the second girl , she might be the smart one , make it up to college , y'know . Then there 's . . . " And then the talkative friendly guard , Mr. Jones , felt a stabbing pain in his arm , in his shoulder  --  it was killing him  --  and he fell nearly dead . And the former Wilbur X in his solitude discovered this thing about himself , that he did n't want the nice white guard with one defective white child to die , and so he yelled . The black bastard recovering from his resistingarrest yelled and yelled . Yelled . They could hear him fine out in front . Ha , it really gets to him . The solitarywas doing him some good , or the broken ribs were itching , or something normal like that . Black Panthers , shit . Muslims , shit . They heard him yelling up at Control Central or whatever they call it and theyp277drew on their cigarettes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as best they could , with the help of black cop boots , like stringy healthy Western cowboys . Only they were fat cops with thighs stretching the seams . The nice guard with the four normals , one defective , had too much cholesterol in him and too much anxiety about raising a kid on this funny non-civil-service job . He had taken the exam for a better one . Another twist to the arteries . It was the same job , but it paid , there were benefits . And he had been eating and worrying and his plumbing collected these bits of clinging creamy fluff . Arteries deep inside , running the show . The nigger was yelling and screaming . And discovering . He did n't want the guard to die with his chin in the remains of the mush  --  corn mush spilling onto gray jailtime floor . . . Yelling . Yelling . Finally they came to slam him ( no scars ) and shut him up ( no marks ) and all he wanted to say was , " MisterCharlie there got **26;10307;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn lightning down from non-civil-service heaven . They dragged Mr. Jones into the guardroom , where he could die like a man and a guard , but he was already dead . Nevertheless , the ambulancecame , and before it pulled up , they ran across the alley for the doctor who had examined the former Wilbur X. He just took one look at the guard and wagged his head , " Unh-unh . " He was no coroner . This was coroner 's work , but he should have been called sooner , why did n't they ? Well . Well now . Well , now the yelling came from the nigger back there , he remembered the one  --   |p278Oh  yeah . Well , they 're shifty , they 're untrustworthy , and sometimes they yell a lot when you least expect it . They did n't slam the former Wilbur X for this deed , but they were irked . Because if he had been a white man , say , they 'd have ambled over a little sooner , bucklingtheir belts , thumbs easy , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been saved . A veteran of World War IT , a Democrat , a Catholic , and a Cholesterol . The whole experience made the former Wilbur X nervous . Mother-fuckers  --  but , from his Muslim days , he really did n't prefer that language too much . Then , in the middle of the night ( he kept on stirring , the light always bothered him , bare bulbs and no old jockey shorts to put over the bulb ) , he found himself smiling . In that way of jails , he knew about Al Dooley , the smart ass bank-robber , next door . The blood could hear Al shuffling around , wide awake . Well , if they both stuck out their hands , his hand could see Al 's hand . Al 's hand could see his hand . Al had liked that guard , too . Talked a little , kidded , told him about his family . So , sleepless , nightmarey , spooked , Al swung over on a vine , like Tarzan , and spotted the smile on the former Wilbur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big fat smiley lips with thin , drawn activist lines of cat seeking his way in the jungle . They would soon speak the same language , would n't they ? Lord Greystoke ? Tarzan ? Cheetah ? Al Dooley ?  |p279Oh  , he had a contact prison high from seeing so clearly the truth-telling black nameless yelling liar in the next cell , picked up on a loitering and resisting . Maybe ex-Wilbur X knew more about it . Jarod sure did n't know . Maybe Wilbur was in touch . Al was n't learning fast enough . " Poor Mr. Jones , to die like that , " Al would have said if he could only have swung over on a vine through the jailtime jungle . But of course , no matter how clear he could see it , he still could n't do it . He was cut off from the yelling nigger , just as he had been in the Muslim temple when jarod had spoken and this very Wilbur X had leaned him against the wall and pinched , tugged , and patted him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite . . . Jail food had given Al a thin , sallow , Mandarin head of thinness , sallowness , Oriental depression . Of course , if he ate the bread and potatoes with gravy , he would be blown up and farty and depressed . He ate what it was in his character to eat  --  picking at the tray . He ate what this time in his life called for  --  slidingthe seventy-three cents per day menu back through the slot . And then low sugar in the blood during the night , and his liver sapping the proteins , and doubts about reality . His fantasies when he dwelled in the nice straight campus world of beat and hip and academicreality had now given way , in this impossible jail , to abstract visions . There was a drug culture going on here , in his body , too . Low sugar in the blood and peculiar adrenal spurts and cerebral manifestations . Dawn a long time off.  |p180Breakfast  further away . Vibrations of larceny in all these hearts , and sugarquakein the blood , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a point of mote in the air . Dust . The loneliness that wo n't leave me alone . The clatter of guard and tray to cement floor and that insane yelling , Save him ! help him ! Al lurked in silence because he did n't know what it was all about . Oh , who am I , hoo , hoo ? Coffee madness with no coffee , no drugs , no torture , no electroshock metaphysics . Al knew that this churningof cosmic ambition had gotten him in trouble before  --  askingtoo much of Jarod , of himself , of the world outside and the world within . Who am I ? is the boy 's question , who gets money from home , who gets a fellowship , who thinks who am I and slips a stupid note to a bank teller . I am 1 ! he thought , and then : But who is that ? And what name could he give this floodingpity for poor dead Mr. Non-Civil-Service Jones ? Madness . Cheerful absence from himself . And these midnights of horror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand of oblivion ( who were they anyway ? ) . Do guards get pensions ? Do non-civil-service guards ' widows get pensions ? Jarod and Al were both pure-blooded seekers from way back . But way forward , were they also finders ? Probably not ; the seekers , contrary to what we are told , usually are not . Seek , multitudes , and one or two of ye shall find . And if more , it 's a con , it 's a shuck . What 's the way back , way forward ? I 've been locked into myself , so I do nothing . It 's allp281been happening to me , around me , inside me : I 'm not a part of it at all . And that man died ! Everyone I know , if he lives long enough , will drool and dribble and use a potty chair again . Jarod will be dead , and Milly will turn dry and withered , and Poopie will scrunch along the street with arthritis . If I live , I 'll have an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what else ? A scrapbookabout my bank heist , but what else ? Cacklecackle , little explosions of fun . What else ? I 'll drop like Mr. Jones . What more ? What else ? If only he could swing over on a vine to Wilbur X and tell him and discuss and just talk . They could be friends ! ( Al was trying to think like Al , like former Al , but as the floating motes floated through his head , he was thinking about the guard . Why could n't it have been Al instead ? He was worthless , a college creep , a nothingnobody nowhere draft evader with a plugged sinus . And this time . . . " Wilbur ! Wilbur ! " he called . " Do you remember me ? I saw you on campus , and remember I came with Dr. Howe to your meeting ? " " Man , I wish you would n't talk to me , " came the low careful voice . " Man , I really do n't need no more trouble . " Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't . ( And this time , just now , it was getting to be a habit , Al was thinking about someone other than himself . The guard . Wilbur . Some whose names he would never know , and some he had known blindly  --  Jarod , Ellen , and that former Al Dooley for whom , once upon a time , everything had gone just his way ... )  |p282Al  awakened from a long sleep  --  arethey drugging me ?  --  to find a familiarpresence on the opposite bunk , leaning thoughtfully into his face . " Oh , ah , what ? " Al asked . He closed his eyes to give the question time to take effect , but the dream did n't go away . " In general , I should n't be here , " said Judge Harlow . " But there are many precedents for my action  --  sometimes it 's called Taking a View . Jail conditions , the state of the accused , little deals like that . I cleared with Counsel . Your lawyer is really happy about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratify my own conscience , too , by making a well-rounded study of the legality and the human significance . In Western justice there are these little bitty exceptions to the rule about having counsel present at all times , Al . They 'll never get me on turpitude again . Think of me as a probation officer , for example . Anyway , here I am , and I did much enjoy talking with you , and certainly just carryingour little chat forward another step or two wo n't prejudice me against you . Or you against me , either , I hope  --  Al ? I just wanted to ask your opinion about something very near and dear to me . " Al sat up , scrubbed his cheeks with his knuckles , and said , " I 'm morally sick , but I 'm guilty and in my rightp283mind . I hallucinate a little , but I 'm responsible . I should be sent away . " " No , no , no ! " the judge cried . " You certainly are a monomaniac about your case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else ? Is n't that a little selfish of you , Al ? " " Am I dreaming ? " " Al , " said the judge reproachfully , " Al . Is n't an experiencedadministrator like me on to those tricks ? At your age ! Shame ! " Well , true , if it was drugs , it was n't a tranquilizer . It was a psychic and a moral and a metaphysical and even a political energizer . Why would they give that to jail inmates awaiting sentence ? Judge Harlow crossed his legs in his robes and sighed and said , " I wanted to get your expert sociological opinion about a little book I 'm taping . You see , I do n't plan to spend all my life deciding guilty or less guilty , as the case may be . That 's too depressing , Al  --  human and inhuman iniquity . Bribery , perjury. and influence  --  it 's not pure , Al . What I really want , I want to make my way in first-person journalism by Judge George C. Harlow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ampex 428 with a Fuji playback . Listen , Al , here 's the scam . Most judicial memoirs are kind of dry , but I was a juvenilecourt judge those many years , had that crisis that tried my soul , so how 's about I call my book , A Girl with a Wayward Spirit ' ? " Al bowed his head in his hands . " Ketchy title , do n't you think ? Actually , I 'm putting in a lot of good strong law and order , too , but I make it the personal touch like that , my own feelings and weaknesses , moments of doubt , tribulation , and how grabbing this thing in chambers messed up my wholep284marriage and career as a juvenile judge . She was a runaway , white , fifteen , blond hair , blue eyes , maybe wearing tennis shoes and pedal pushers , unarmed , answers to the name of Cindy . ' Oh , she was armed all right . They moved me over to senior citizens court like you as a result , but the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll never make Circuit Appeals  --  " Al looked up to see if he was still there . Psychic energizer did n't erase him . " It 's not an elective office , Al . Your goodwill or the reverse is irrelevant , but I guess I have n't made myselfclear . Your opinion is valuable to me . You 're a trained sociologist and you 're under thirty and you 're in contact with the degenerate public of today . You can help me , Al . Juvenile Offenses in My Life ' ? Poor Lost Kids I Have Known ' ? I really plan to ring the bell on Dr. Spock . I wanted to ask you about that , too . Do you think they spared the rod and spoiled the child in , say , your personal case ? I 've seen many a lousy criminalkid like you come from really outstanding families . Your parents are solid people , inside and out , Al , as I hope you appreciate . All I ask is for you to come to my aid with your mentality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethical turpitudes , so this book could really be a humdinger . Turpitudes be darned , full speed ahead . How about The State Versus Wayward Spirits ' ? You think that 's kind of long for a title ? That Cindy really lacked responsibility . That 's all I can tell you right now . Wayward Spirit ' has a lot of dignity , but it just does n't tell the whole story as it happened in my life . " Al looked at his own hands and saw that he was still there . Psychic energizer kept his criminal hands at/tached to his law-abiding body , or perhaps it was the reverse . " Are n't you going to help me , defendant ? " " I wish I could . " " You can ! " Al shook his head . It just did n't seem ethical for him to give sociological advice and counsel to his judge . It did n't seem possible . If he were to try to open his mouth , he might not be able to , but he did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's all right , " Judge Harlow said , " I wo n't let it interfere with my primary duty , which is to measure you fairly and evenly for the psychopath you might be , and render a verdict in keeping with the best interestsof this republic and of the state of California . " Al saw it coming . It had been looming up since the beginning . If he did n't stop it now , he would never know what it was to enjoy consequences for acts . " I can see it coming , " Al said . " Sir , please do n't throw me out of prison . " " Of course not , " said Judge Harlow . " It 's as plain as the hairy mustache on your face you 're a menace to society . " " I have n't learned my lesson . My mind is mashing around with the facts and "  --  His fingers groped for his sandy dropout mustache . It was gone . He had shaved it off as a love-offering to society  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have any meaning , and what 's worse , meaning does n't have things . " " Sure , I get you , you do n't want to be helped by that high-yellow professor who has done you a lot ofharm , do you , hm ? " asked the judge . " He claims he 's , urn , up tight with his good buddy , but you and I know different , do n't we ? Come on , tell me , Al . What 's really been going on between you two ? " " I 've been ungrateful to him . I 'm irresponsible . I ca n't be beholden any more . " " I know all that , " said the judge . " More , more , more . I 'm not just the kind of political hack who would let you off in order to make time with the permissive liberalcommunity of Northern California . I have a higher duty in mind . Southern California . " Judge Harlow suffered from sudden excesses of anxiety , bird-wing flights of frown across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-timer . He was not senile  --  after all , he was still a judge  --  but he tended to forget pleasant and unpleasant things and remember the things in the middle . Then when he tried to recollectthe powerful moments he had forgotten , all he could find in his crowded brain was that America is going downhill fast . That was n't it , that 's not it . But it was true , too . " About this Little Chairman Book of Mao , " he asked . " Now I 'm not from Orange County like some judges I could name , really bad reactionaries , care for nothing but fundamentals . You can tell me if you 've read it , come on , tell me , Al . " Al shook his head from side to side very slowly , indicating that he had n't really read it , but he carried it around a little , like the Panthers ; he had heard a good deal about it , of course ; he might just wait forno , he would n't be funny . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Detective Brown has given me a pretty fair report on you , " Judge Harlow said . " Says here you 're not ap287revolutionary , you 're more like a "  --  he stared at his notes  --  " lyrical sociologist ? Can that be ? " " That 's okay , " Al said . " That 's right ? " Al shrugged . " Do n't even read the Red Mao Book , just keep it around ? " " Oh , I used to dip into it , " Al said , " but I 'm doubtfulabout the style . It does n't have a relevance in this country . It serves as a totem for the blacks and some of the kids on Telegraph , but  --  " He blushed . He had fallen into graduate assistant pedagogical habit . Kindly Judge Harlow had seduced him away from his depression and abstraction . " Carrying it is a hustle , " Al said , " to get a certain kind of girl . " " I wish you would n't use those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot easier for me . " Al had no idea which words he was referring to . He would n't ask . He was not only a philosopher , thinker , lyrical sociologist , and bank-robber , but also he had one of the finest under-thirty vocabularies on the West Coast , plus an outstanding ability to remain silent . He hoped he did n't seem sullen . People sometimes thought he was sullen when his head was only turned inside and far away . The judge was humming softly . He , too , had a head filled with elsewheres . His own book would cover them . That was a right-wing frown that flitted across his brow , not a bird-wing frown . Again he was giving birth to a thought . " Status quo , " he croaked . " Sir ? " Al asked . " He has an investment in the normal way of the world , which means getting along . "  | " Sir ? " " Professor Howe . He may be a colored Negro gentleman , but he has something to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of far out ? that what you kids call him ? But to me , I see right through to the heart of things  --  that 's my chosen field  --  it 's just for fun he 's like that . It 's pleasure . When you 're weird , son , really weird , wildness and abandon and all that , you give up , you have nothing to lose , you do n't care about your life . You have n't gotten used to anything . I 've been talking to him  --  I hope he does n't mind my saying this , and I know he wo n't , since he 's not here listening . You may think he 's your fine colored friend , but he 's more my kind than yours , Al . He 's no kid . He 's over thirty , too . " " I 'm not sure I understand you , judge . " Judge Harlow sighed . Even right-wingers are sad and need to be understood , especially when they explainhow and why they happened to be discussing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is n't Orange County . " He 's a part of things , " the judge said . " How can I say it better than that ? I 'm not sure you 're a part of anything , defendant . " " I 'm a student . There are a lot like me . I 'm a part of them . " The frown could quickly change to a kill look . Judge Harlow was keeping a firm grip on himself . " You 're goingto be thirty someday , too , and in forty years from then you 'll be sixty , like me , and then ninety . You 'll be a non-student . Maybe you should learn to get along with the fundamentals . Crime tight-lipped , inp289touch ; blood in his head counteracted the artery problem ; he was in a reactionary groove where he felt grim , sober , and secure . " I suppose you need a lesson , Al . This state university system has been a problem ever since the war . If we could only put all you dropout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach you a lesson . " Sounds like socialism , " Al said . " If we only do it one at a time , " the judge mused , " then it 's disciplinary training . Got you there , did n't I ? In my day non-student ' was n't a profession . We learned how to contribute to the free world  --  accounting , engineering , medicine , and law . Oh , we had our Greek scholars , too , and some boys who were a credit to their respective races . But we did n't have all this surfing and rioting and those different kinds of Communismand so much sex at the movies . Things were simpler and somehow better , son . You 'll find it all in my new work , Young Wayward Spirits , ' plus some personalized moments of fallibility . Some might call it turpitude , I call it human frailty . That Cindy was like you in many ways , a snare and a delusion . " " I agree , sir . I wish you a lot of luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al 's eyes , and then at his watch , and then back to the eyes . " You were n't much help , " he said . During the thoughtful pause which followed , both of them focused on the near future . Al found it within his power to offer something different to consider . " I was n't really a dropout or a non-student . I was more like a graduate student . That 's not the same thing , sir . I could have gone on to get a B.A. " But Al himselfp290was thinking about a new life . The chapel was a new idea . He had n't considered the chapel at San Quentin . " As Socrates said , one of the great judges  --  you remember , he condemned that fella Hemlock to death for a crime not much worse than yours  --  be what you wish to seem . Of course , if you do n't know what you wish to seem , you got a problem there , Al . " So much for classical jurisprudence , which was suitable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The judge was sad  --  right-wing sadness , but kind . " That Dr. Mao really spoiled you , " he said . " You 're a mixed-up per-son . " Al hoped that Judge Harlow might be able to straighten him around with another word or two . Some of these right-wingers were surprisingly human , and this fretful man seemed to be one of the human ones , a credit and a plus to the fundamental race . " What does working in the chapel involve ? " Al asked . " Does it have anything to do with your faith ? Should I become a believer ? " " In prison ? " Judge Harlow asked . And sure enough , he was surprisingly human . A joyful smile looped across his face , revealing teeth , gums , creviced tongue , more teeth , and perhaps a bit of gratified sadism . " In San Q ? the chapel ? religion ? " He was shaking his head incredulously . How out of touch can a kid get ? An old man forgets things , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you better seem what you wish to be , Al . " " Thank you , sir , " Al said . " If I can count on you , I 'll learn a useful craft . I really mean it this time . " " Promise ? " said the judge . Al stopped a moment and looked at his soul and tried to decide if he really wanted to say it .
