Boston University Astronomy Professor Gerald Hawkins has a bone to pick with historians who list the seven wonders of the ancient world . It is not that they have picked the wrong wonders , only that their list is too short . Britain 's Stonehenge , says the British-born scientist , is the eighth wonder-a remarkable achievement of primitive man . In a new book , Stonehenge Decoded ( Doubleday ; $5.95 ) , he explains how he turned to a modern computer to unravel the 3,500-year-old mystery of Salisbury Plain . Stonehenge 's long-kept secret , says Hawkins , is that its vast stone slabs and archways make up a sophisticated astronomical observatory . <P> Sacrifices &; Pageants . Constructed in several stages by late Stone Age and early Bronze Age men between 1900 B.C. and 1600 B.C. , Stonehenge 's most prominent features are a 97-ft. ring of 25-ton uprights and horizontal slabs ( known as the Sarsen Circle ) surrounding five huge trilithons or archways . To build them , primitive Britons had to haul stones weighing as much as 50 tons overland from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archaeologists have probed around and under the structure in a vain attempt to understand what motivated its builders . Charred bones and artifacts convinced some that it had been a mortuary , a crematorium or even a sacrificial altar . The awesome architecture and isolated setting also suggested to others that it had been the scene of religious rites and pageants . <P> To Astronomer Hawkins , one long-established fact seemed most significant : Stonehenge is oriented so that its axis passes through a 35-ton marker stone and points directly to the spot on the northeast horizon where the sun rises at the summer solstice , the longest day of the year . Stonehenge probably was built , he reasoned , to mark midsummer day . <P> Solstice &; Equinox . Standing among the giant slabs , Hawkins was struck by the way the early architects had limited his exterior view . Looking through one of the narrow trilithons and an aligned archway in the outer ring , he writes , " I felt that my field of observation was being tightly controlled , as by sighting instruments , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancients were directing his attention to , Hawkins became convinced , was the rising and setting of celestial bodies , perhaps the sun or certain stars or planets . Returning to the U.S. with accurate charts of Stonehenge , he plotted the positions of its center point and of each significant stone , archway , hole and mound , then fed the data into a computer programmed to calculate the compass directions established by 120 pairs of such positions and the points where a line drawn through them would meet the horizon .
