When he was a boy in Trenton , N.J. , Edward Munson fell out of his tree house one day and cut his arm . Apparently the scar was lasting . Now , as building inspector for the rural Long Island town of Riverhead , N.Y. , Munson , 53 , has started a controversial campaign to make tree houses safer . Recently , after a Riverhead resident complained about an unsightly tree house , Munson began to require parents to obtain tree-house building permits , and issued a detailed set of specifications governing their construction : the houses must be no more than 12 ft. off the ground ; walls must be at least 42 in. high and floor boards at least 1 in. thick ; the houses must be framed by two-by-fours and attached , with 16-penny nails , to branches no less than 5 in. in diameter for hardwood trees or 7 in. for softwood . So far , the inspector has served violation notices on eight families . <P> <P> Munson is in dead earnest-and so are Riverhead parents who have swamped him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural development of children . " Everywhere I go , people come up and call me the Big Bad Wolf or worse , " says Munson . " They say I 'm taking the fun out of childhood , when all I 'm trying to do is remove some of the danger . " <P> " It 's a boy 's right to build a tree house and do what he wants with it , " retorts a Riverhead housewife , Mrs. Robert Hulse . The Hulses have been threatened with a summons after ignoring two official complaints that their son Gregory 's tree house is too close to the street . When another parent , William Sypher , received a notice for building without a permit , his two sons tacked a sign " Bird Feeding Station " on the house and nailed on feed pans-but the ruse failed and the notices kept coming . <P> " Our children spend hours playing in it , " says Sypher 's wife Doris , who is prepared to fight the code in court , if necessary . " They build new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ever their imaginations believe it is . How can it meet building specifications when the boys continually change it ? "
