THE WILD SWAN by Monica Stirling . 383 pages . Harcourt , Brace &; World . $6.95 . <P> <P> In the Danish town of Odense , all the signposts carry an extra arm . It points the way to Andersens Hus , where in 1805 an ugly duckling named Hans Christian Andersen was born . The world today needs no introduction to this cobbler 's son whose fairy stories , published in dozens of tongues , will last as long as there are children to hear them . Andersen did not write them for children , or for money or fame , although the stories brought him both . He wrote them for himself , and Novelist Monica Stirling 's tender biography tells why . <P> Gangly Youth . The young Andersen saw life as a fairy story more magical than any he wrote . Beneath the Odense River , he knew , lay China , a fantasy kingdom that surfaces in Andersen 's The Nightingale . His father let him dream . " No matter what the boy wants to be , " he told his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , let him have his own way . " At 14 , and gangly as a stork , Hans Christian stowed his toy theater , a loaf of bread and 13 rigsdaler into his knapsack and went to Copenhagen . <P> Copenhagen was a magic town . It was said that the King , after the gates were locked at night , slept with the keys under his pillow . And Hans Christian was sure that if one knocked on the castle door , his majesty would open it himself , in slippers and crown and any old robe ! <P> He was sure , too , that people would be good to him , and so , of course , they were . Giuseppe Siboni , director of the Royal Singing Academy in Copenhagen , took him in off the street to sing at a dinner party , and gave him lessons till his voice broke . The Danish Royal Theater offered him employment as a troll .

He traveled with a child 's restless , wide-eyed curiosity . " Oh what a noble achievement ! " he said , riding his first train . " We fly like the clouds in a storm . " He met Dickens , Hugo , Dumas , Lamartine , Kierkegaard , Ibsen . " He looks like a large child , a sort of half-angel , " said the Irish poet William Allingham . He loved as a child loves : marriage and children were grown-up affairs and not for him . His fears were those of a child : of falling ill , taking the wrong medicine , putting letters in the wrong envelopes , missing trains . <P> Last Tales . All the marvelous stories - The Ugly Duckling , The Ice Maiden , Thumbelina , The Emperor 's New Clothes-burst out like dreams , unbidden , from a talent that did not appreciate itself . Even while reciting his tales on demand to charmed royal circles all over Europe , Andersen waited hopefully for the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry and plays , only a little better , would get the same acclaim . But that was not to be . And the time came when the last fairy story had been written . " How beautiful life is , " said Andersen , dying at 70 , his mind still dreaming . " It is as if I were sailing to a land far , far away , where there is no pain , no sorrow . "
