During the many months that he really needed their votes for the civil rights bill , President Johnson was downright deferential to Capitol Hill Republicans . But now that the measure has passed the Senate and seems certain of quick approval in the House , Johnson obviously figures that he no longer needs to be so nice . Last week he started pressuring the House to stay in session six days a week , at least through July 10 , to act on a big pileup of legislation , in particular his anti-poverty bill . <P> House G.O.P. Leader Charlie Halleek , for one , thought that this was less than cricket . Fourteen House Republicans are members of their party 's national convention Platform Committee , which starts work in San Francisco on July 6 . Those members quite understandably would like to be on hand to shape the platform , and Halleck had been aiming for a July 3-20 House recess . Now he ruefully recalled the help that he and his G.O.P. colleagues had given Johnson on civil rights : " Memories are real short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon than words : the civil rights bill still needed Republican votes to get it out of the House Rules Committee so that it could be whooped through on the House floor . Halleck publicly pledged that those G.O.P. votes would not be forthcoming if Johnson persisted in his stand . At week 's end it seemed highly likely that Halleck and his colleagues would get to San Francisco on time-and that the anti-poverty bill would have to wait . <P> With civil rights on the way to enactment , the year-long legislative logjam began to break . Last week the Congress also : &gt; Approved , by a 212-to-189 House vote , an Administration-backed $375 million urban-transit bill designed to aid cities in improving their municipal and suburban public-transport systems . Spread over three years , federal funds would cover up to two-thirds of the cost of transit-system renewal or expansion . &gt;Shelved , by a voice vote of the House Ways and Means Committee , the Administration 's longstanding medicare bill . Instead , the committee approved a measure that would boost Social Security cash benefits by roughly 5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month , and individual benefit would go up to $143 , the rise financed by a slightly higher tax on employers and employees . &gt;Voted , 77 to 2 , in a lively Senate session , to repeal the 10% federal excise taxes on a vast variety of consumer items ranging from cosmetics , handbags and luggage to mechanical pencils and pingpong balls . &gt; Overrode , in a House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations , the decade-old dictatorship of Chairman Otto Passman , a Louisiana Democrat whose only particular claim to fame is his effective hostility to the foreign-aid program . Always in the past Passman had been backed by Missouri Democrat Clarence Cannon , chairman of the full Appropriations Committee . But Cannon died last May and was succeeded by Texas Democrat George Mahon . At the urging of Fellow Texan Lyndon Johnson , Mahon persuaded the subcommittee to turn down Passman 's demands for meat-ax foreign-aid cuts .
