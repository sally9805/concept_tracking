" Death , " runs the old insurance man 's gag , " is nature 's way of telling you to slow down . " The joke is the cinematic principle of this catatonic , corpse-cluttered western , which comes as close as a film can to a still picture . <P> The stranger ( Tony Anthony ) is a serape-draped loner who joins up with a gang of mustachioed Mexican villains . About an hour after the audience has been sickened by the sight of them drowning priests and kicking women in the stomach , Anthony , too , gets bored by the gore , annihilates the gang and collects the reward on their broken heads . Stranger is actually no stranger at all , but a sloppy copy of such Italian oaters as A Fistful of Dollars and The Good , the Bad and the Ugly . Since the Dollar films were imitation B westerns that copied good westerns , the effect on viewers of Stranger will be like seeing a photograph of a painting of a shadow of a statue of a man .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
