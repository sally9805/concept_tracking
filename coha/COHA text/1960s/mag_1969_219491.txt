Like all too many of its forerunners in the mod-spy genre , Otley makes no sense after the second reel . Until then , it appears to be an espionage thriller about a whimsical drifter and sometime antique dealer named Otley ( Tom Courtenay ) who sacks out one night in a mate 's apartment and wakes up to find his friend dead . Everyone naturally thinks that Otley can clear up the killing , so he is frantically pursued by the Special Branch , the Other Side and a sultry-but-eniematic counterspy ( Romy Schneider ) . No one is really who he pretends to be , which makes for more confusion , but all is put right at the end , with Otley wandering once more among the antique boutiques . <P> The acting , at least , is not bad . Courtenay , as usual , is excellent , and there are a couple of sharp character performances by James Villiers as an overstuffed , treacherous fop , and Freddy Jones as a shrill and sinister faggot named Proudfoot . But their portraits are so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
