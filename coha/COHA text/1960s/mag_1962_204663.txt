For the U.S. economy it was a week when solid accomplishment was overshadowed by unsettling portents . <P> More and more of the indicators that businessmen watch for a clue to the shape of things to come were leveling off-a phenomenon that characteristically indicates that a period of recovery is coming to an end and a period of recession lies a few months ahead . The industrial production index in June barely managed to inch its way up from May 's 117.5 to 117.8 . June 's $700 million increase in total personal income was the smallest for any month since January , and factory workers ' income actually declined by $200 million . The gross national product , which had been expected to be zinging along at an annual rate of better than $565 billion by June , rose only $7 billion in the second quarter to a disappointing $552 billion . Only in Detroit did the prospects look continuingly bright : although auto sales were unseasonably low in June , Ford , Chevrolet and Rambler all reported uncommonly high sales for the first ten days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall news , the stock market-itself a leading indicator of sorts-slipped haplessly downward . Despite a feeble rally toward week 's end , it closed on Friday with the Dow-Jones industrial average at 577.18 , a loss of more than 13 points for the week . From the New York Stock Exchange came news that the number of shares borrowed by short sellers had risen by mid-July to the highest level ( 5,159,000 shares ) in nearly four years . This was a sure sign that many Wall Streeters were betting that the market is going down farther , since it indicated that they expect to pay the borrowed shares back at lower prices . <P> So engrossed were the economic pundits in these disquieting developments , that less notice was paid to the daily outpouring of second-quarter earnings reports from the nation 's corporations . These , for the most part , were overwhelmingly good . Items : <P> GENERAL MOTORS ' sales of $4 billion and earnings of $402 million ( equal to $1.41 per share ) were the highest ever reported by any U.S. manufacturing corporation for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $631 million were the highest in its history , and its earnings rose to $2.52 per share , v. $2.15 last year . Du Pont is starting a $50 million program to expand its nylon plants . <P> Sounding a sour note that is likely to be echoed by some other steel producers , YOUNGSTOWN SHEET &; TUBE reported that its second-quarter earnings were down to $1.28 per share from $1.32 per share a year ago . <P> TEXACO 'S profits rose 14.3% above last year to 82 a share , to give the oil company record first-half earnings of $1.73 a share ; STANDARD OIL OF CALIFORNIA also profited from bigger crude oil and natural gas sales to boost its first-half earnings 5% , to $2.25 a share . <P> For the 15th consecutive quarter , the MAGNAVOX Co. reported both sales and profits up . This time , Magnavox 's gross rose 50% over last year 's level , to $44.5 million , while its profits jumped a whopping 62% , to $1,850,000.                @ @ @ @ @
