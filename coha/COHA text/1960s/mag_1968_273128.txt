Charles G. Bluhdorn , chairman of merger-minded Gulf &; Western , explains the rationale behind that current corporate rage-the conglomerate company-in disarmingly simple terms . " If you have all your eggs in one basket , you 're stuck with those eggs , " says Bluhdorn . " But if you 've also got apples and bananas , that 's something else . " Following that formula , Bluhdorn , James Ling of Ling-Temco-Vought , Harold Geneen of ITT and several others have traced the tracks of such conglomerate pioneers as Litton and Textron across industry lines into movies and machinery , aircraft and auto parts , cigars , cybernetics and clothing . Along the way , the conglomerates have stirred up what the Federal Trade Commission calls the " sharpest merger activity in modern industrial history . " <P> Last week , citing a " growing concern " that too much U.S. business is going into too few big baskets , the FTC announced that it is undertaking a thoroughgoing study of the conglomerate phenomenon . Chief FTC Investigator Harrison Houghton , 56 , plans to tackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and profitability of the " multimarket companies " - as the conglomerates like to call themselves . <P> Zeroing In . The FTC is only the latest agency to zero in on the controversial conglomerates . President Johnson has appointed a group of academic antitrust experts to study and recommend policy toward the companies . The Securities and Exchange Commission is studying their financial reporting techniques . The Justice Department , criticized as being soft on antitrust , recently became acutely aware of the fact that antitrust law has lagged behind the phenomenon of conglomerates . <P> Horizontal mergers ( between competitors ) and vertical mergers ( between users and suppliers ) have long been severely limited by well-established antitrust law . The status of conglomerate mergers , between companies not in direct competition , remains uncertain . Only last May , Justice issued a 27-page merger guideline suggesting that conglomerates would be opposed if , for instance , the merger would prevent two noncompeting partners from entering each other 's fields on their own . Thus , this month a federal District Court upheld a key Justice challenge to a merger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a small maker of gymnastic equipment . The grounds : Wilson might well have entered the gymnastic field on its own . <P> The Federal Trade Commission is fretting over the number as well as the size of acquisitions . Last year there were half again as many mergers ( 1,500 ) as there were in 1966 , and 83% of them involved conglomerates . Large mergers ( involving companies with assets of $10 million or more ) doubled to 155 ; during the first two months of this year , no fewer than 40 more were pending or completed .
