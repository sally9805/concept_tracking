txt CIGARETTE RACKET IS LINKED TO MAFIA BY TAX OFFICIALS 13 States Seek Ways to Curb Smuggling From South to Evade Local Excises By MARTIN ARNOLD Soecial to The New York Times BALTIMORE , April 14 ? Organized crime syndicates are apparently taking over the bootleg cigarette business , tax authorities said here today . Indications of the organized nature of the smuggling , mostly from North Carolina , were noted in the speed with which expensive legal help is provided for arrested smugglers and an increase in the counterfeiting lof state cigarette-tax stamps . This was discussed by officials from New York , Massachusetts , New Jersey and Markland in the opening session of a two-day conference of state tobacco tax administrators called here to explore means of curbing the traffic . Most to New York North Carolina , the only , tobacco producing state that has no retail cigarette tax , is the main supply center for tens of thousands of cigarettes that are smuggled north , mostly to New York , each day , Oregon is the only other state without a cigarette tax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , New York City and the District of Columbia . John J. Purcell , assistant director of the New York State Miscellaneous Tax Bureau , told the meeting that the state police had tapped the phones of known narcotics dealers andi had recorded conversations in which they had said " they were switching to cigarettes . " He also said that state police had recently confiscated a planeload of cigarettes that had been flown from North Carolina to an airport in Linden , N. J. , and then trucked into New York . Active Gang Role Seen Capt . Louis L. Cottell , deputy inspector of the New York City Police Central Bureau of Investigation , said : " I do n't say the gangs are controlling the smuggling , but they are active in it , and if it is not curtailed soon they will run it as effectively as they ran rum in prohibition . " But Louis L. Goldstein , Maryland 's Controller , said flatly that the crime syndicate , Mafia or Cosa Nostra , had already taken over . In an interview , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up North he 'll go before a judge and plead poverty , sometimes for hours . " " But when the judge fines him , say $1,300 , he 'll pull a roll of bills out of his pocket and pay it , or make a call and the money will be there in short order , " Mr. Goldstein said . " It 's not his old auntie or poor qwq These would then be telephoned or wired to a central point and distributed to ail the states , which would then be on the watch for the trucks as they pass . their borders : Each of the states agreeing to the program would send the agents at . different tiniest One state , for example , would cover in November and another : in December . Some of this spying has been done in the past , and ? the tax authorities said today that their agpts were - alw , ays spotted arieraloWed by : " sccints ' .

You 'll do me and yourself one big favor getting out of here as fast as possible . " One of the upset customers was busily putting brown paper over the Massachusetts license plates of his rented truck . Taking part in the conference here are Connecticut , Delaware , the District of Columbia , Massachusetts , Michigan , New Jersey , New York City , New York State , North Dakota , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , Tennessee , Virginia , West Virginia and Maryland . They cite a recent case . in Nassau County that involved counterfeiting cigarette tax stainps ; The defendant was given a suspended sentence . ? Further , if only a misdemeanor is involved it is unconstitutional to stop and search trucks or cars merely on suspicion . " We almost have to actually see them making a sale to make an arrest now . " a New York State tax official said . Many legal experts believe it would be equally unconstitutional if the charge was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bill before the New York State Legislature now . Maryland . recently made cigarette smuggling a felony . The state now attempts to stop every truck or vehicle it suspects of transporting contraband cigarettes . Gangs of Lawyers ' But Mr. Goldstein said that " the gangs have lawyers fighting in the courts on the ground that stopping on suspicion violates the Interstate Commerce laws . " The felony section of New York 's proposed new law is not expected to pass the State Legislature . But sections that would provide fines of $25 for every carton of cigarettes seized and a jail sentence of up to a year will probably be passed . Another part of the proposed law expected to pass would give state tax agents the arrest powers they do not have now . New York City 's tax agents can make arrests . The states that sent representatives to this conference passed a resolution calling for tighter Federal control over the transportation of cigarettes . On a more practical level , many of the states represented agreed today to supply tax agents who would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are supplying him with the money or the legal help . " In this illicit trade , the profits are large and the risks , fines and confiscation of the contraband , are small . In North Carolina , regular brands of cigarettes can be purchased for $1.83 to $2 a carton , depending on the type and quality involved . In New York the same brands sell for $3.36 to $4.40 a carton . Carolina Sale Is Legal The sale of large ' quantities of cigarettes to anyone who can afford to buy them , tourists or known professional bootleggers , is legal in North Carolina . Only the importation into other states is illegal . An indication of the size of the business . in North Carolina is the fact that U.S. .301 , the state 's midst traveled. north and south artery , is known ar " Tobacco Road . " This is particularly true near the Virginia border , where almost every gasoline station , hamburger stand , grocery store , , motel and restaurant is also in the bulk cigarette business ? often with large r9adside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cigarettes are trucked north , some go south , particularly to Florida . Albert B. Baytel of the New ' Jersey Cigarette Tax Bureau , said that the movement north was well organized . Trucks will be stopped near a turnpike toll station by " the gang 's contact man , who will tell the driver where to take them , " he said . The contact man will tell the driver , for example to use the Holland Tunnel in going into New York City , Mr. Baytel said . " But before the driver gets to the Holland Tunnel entrance he will be stopped by another contact man who will say , ' take them to such and such an ad. dress in Brooklyn or the the Bronx ' , " he said . ' Crime Syndicate ' Seen Mr. Baytel said : " I honestly believe that there is an organized crime syndicate behind this situation . " Once in New York , the ciga. rettes are presumably distributed in two ways , and no one in authority can estimate now which method is used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $1 less a carton than the regular price , , by " cigarette runners " who hawk the cartons outside industrial plants , sports stadiums or any other place where there are apt to be large numbers of people . Sometimes they are sold under-the-counter in small stores . Officials also said they were sold by housewives , milkmen and garbage collectors . The , other method involves the counterfeiting of cigarette tax stamps and stamping dies . In it , the honest wholesalers of cigarettes are bypassed , with the gangs selling directly to shopkeepers , who pay less for the cigarettes than they would to a regular wholesaler but who sell them at or near the established prices . Officials estimate New York State 's tax loss at $40-million a year and New York City 's at $9-million . Penalties Are Small Despite the massive quantities of cigarettes being smuggled into New York , an arrest on such a charge is only a misdemeanor , with fines and jail sentences ranging from $50 and 30 days for a first offense to $250 and six months for subsequent offenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant to hand
