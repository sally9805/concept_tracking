" Mrs. Kennedy , Zindabad " - long live Mrs. Kennedy . That was the cry that welled up in thousands of Indian throats last week as Jacqueline Kennedy paraded across India in triumph , more than making up by her charm , good looks and splendidly attired figure for three postponements and at least 47 separate schedule changes . The trip , undertaken as a result of Prime Minister Nehru 's personal invitation , was semiofficial , but it had most of the trappings , tight schedules and points-of-interest panoply of a full-fledged state visit . Hailed as the Amriki Rani , or Queen of America , Jackie was accompanied wherever she went by elegantly attired attendants who , with their turbans tilting solicitously , served her food , protected her with parasols from India 's searing sun , and performed the sundry duties that attend a queen-even of America . <P> Inevitably , there were the prescribed calls . Jackie journeyed to the burning ghat on the Jumna River , laid a bouquet of white roses on the spot where Gandhi was cremated in 1948 . Visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ward of a hospital , she made her first namastes-the Indian palms-together greeting-and tried out her Hindi ( " What is your name ? " ) . She also paid a call on India 's President Rajendra Prasad at the presidential palace in New Delhi , and though she ate Western food during most of her trip , gamely dug into chicken korma and alu-mattar , washed down with spiced orange punch . <P> " She Wears 10A . " With such courtesies attended to , Jackie boarded a special air-conditioned train for a look at India 's tourist attractions . At Fatehpur Sikri , she watched in fascination as breechclothed youths made a risky , 100-ft. dive off a rampart into a well-and then did it all over again when Jackie discovered that her sister , Lee Radziwill , who was traveling with her , had fallen behind and missed the show . Sailing down the Ganges River on a marigold-decorated boat , Jackie inspected the burning and bathing ghats along the shore . In Agra she was " overwhelmed by a sense of awe " at the sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have seen pictures of the Taj , " she said , " but for the first time I am struck with a sense of its mass and symmetry . " The Indians , who crowded in everywhere for a glimpse of her , were also overwhelmed . Said a confused cab driver who recalled President Eisenhower 's 1959 visit : " Why is a young woman like that married to such an old man ? " <P> A spokesman had sternly announced that " Mrs. Kennedy does not regard this trip as a fashion show . " But the 70-odd correspondents with her paid no heed . Whether she wore a Cassini evening dress or a Tassell gown-all duly recorded by reporters-Jackie shone even among the colorful saris of the Indian women around her . When she slipped off her shoes and put on violet velvet slippers to visit the memorial to Mahatma Gandhi , Chicago Daily News Correspondent Keyes Beech was quick to peek inside the shoes , triumphantly cabled home : " I can state with absolute authority that she wears 10A and not 10AA . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith who had designed his suit .
