Most people thought bossa nova was dead , and most were glad to have simply survived the hucksterized flood of bossa nova dances , bossa nova shoes and sweatshirts , boogie bossa nova , soul bossa nova . <P> But last week a packed audience at San Francisco 's Jazz Workshop listened raptly as slim , meek Astrud Gilberto , 24 , stood before a microphone and sang The Girl from Ipanema , in a voice so soft and introverted that it barely cut the smoke . Behind her , Stan Getz wove wispy filigrees on his tenor sax to produce the most infectious " new sound " around-the bossa nova nova . <P> <P> Eloquent Sermon . It all started a year ago , when the easy charm of bossa nova had been drowned in a din of bongo drums , maracas and raucous studio bands . Getz met with Singer-Guitarist Joao Gilberto , Brazil 's " pope of the bossa nova , " and decided to cut one " true " bossa nova album . Gilberto 's wife Astrud , who had never sung outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English lyrics to The Girl from Ipanema that Joao sang in Portuguese . This spring , when it was felt that the odor of the butchered bossa had cleared , the Getz-Gilberto album was quietly released . To the trade 's astonishment , the record soared toward the top of the bestseller lists . <P> Most of the melodies are provided by Antonio Carlos Jobim , Brazil 's leading bossa nova composer , who also backs up the lead duo with sensitive piano playing . The result is an eloquent sermon on what the bossa nova was originally all about . The relaxed , almost flat vocal styling of Joao sounds as if he were whispering in your ear , and it is exquisitely embroidered by the ethereal solos of Getz 's lyrical tenor sax . <P> Six , &; Adding . Two months ago , just as Joao and Getz were about to launch a countrywide tour , Joao developed a " cramp in his playing arm " and had to bow out . Astrud replaced him and suddenly found herself a star . Astrud is herself a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkling beach front , who came to the U.S. two years ago with Joao . Last week , with the single edition of The Girl from Ipanema burning up the teen-age record market , Astrud Gilberto was trying to get used to her new billing-at least to the extent of trying to add to her six-song repertory .
