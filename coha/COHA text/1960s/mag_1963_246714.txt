The hardest thing a football coach has to learn is to keep a straight face . No coach-or con man-ever gave it a better try than Oklahoma 's Bud Wilkinson . Those might have been real tears welling in his blue eyes as he watched his Sooners take the field against Southern California 's mighty Trojans , winners of twelve straight games , the nation 's No. 1-ranked college team . " Us ? " sniffed Wilkinson . " Oh , we 're far too slow and inexperienced to have much of a chance against their superior speed , aerial play and experience . " <P> As handsome as a movie star , Bud Wilkinson , 47 , could probably charm the mittens off a polar bear . But convince anybody that he could field a bad football team ? In Wilkinson 's 16 seasons at Oklahoma , the Sooners have won 14 Missouri Valley ( Big Eight ) Conference titles and three national championships , and rattled off victory streaks of 31 and 47 games . Only once has Wilkinson suffered the indignity of a losing season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wins . So last week , after the Sooners outgained ( 360 yds. to 237 yds. ) and outscored the Trojans ( 17-12 ) , the experts were ready with their superlatives . " Magnificent , " they wrote . " Hotter than Los Angeles ' 105 weather . " That was enough to push Oklahoma back into its familiar No. 1 spot in the rankings and start Coach Wilkinson wailing all over again . " We could well lose five games this year . " <P> " Hit First ! " A leathery blocking back at Minnesota in the late ' 30s , Wilkinson arrived at Oklahoma in 1946 as an assistant to Head Coach Jim Tatum , inherited the top job a year later when Tatum left for Maryland . It was hardly a plum : over the years , the Sooners had regularly clobbered patsies like Kingfisher College ( 179-0 ) , just as regularly taken their lumps from the likes of Texas ( 7-40 ) . " You know what we were before we started winning football games ? " asks a Wilkinson admirer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of us . Bud changed all that . " <P> <P> Scouring the prairie , Wilkinson recruited squads of lean , tall , whippet-fast plainsmen . " Hit hard ! " other coaches taught . Wilkinson taught , " Hit first ! " Other teams might run 60 offensive plays on a winning afternoon ; the go-go Sooners ran 100 . <P> <P> Week after week , year after year , Oklahoma ran under , over and around a succession of bedazzled opponents . Things got so monotonous that the N.C.A.A. finally broke up the act , slapped Oklahoma with a two-year probation . Southwest Conference colleges complained that Wilkinson was pirating away Texas 's best football prospects . The probation worked : Oklahoma slumped to a 3-6-1 record in 1960 and 5-5 in 1961 . <P> <P> Local Lumber . Quietly , carefully , Wilkinson rebuilt the team-with local lumber . Six of this year 's starting eleven are Oklahomans , and there are only twelve Texans on the 63-man varsity squad . The team is big : Tackle Ralph Neely weighs in at 246 Ibs . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , runs the 100 in 9.7 sec . It is brutal , boisterous-and tricky as a sidewinder . The Sooners sometimes run plays without a huddle , trying to catch their opponents out of position .
