 | You 've heard a lot about teenage marriages . That 's the kind ours was . I was just a week past 18 and Jim 19 when we were married . We were both high-school graduates , had good jobs , had gone steady for more than a year , and were so very much in love that we paid no attention to his mother 's doubts and my parents ' fierce opposition . Jim 's mother had been widowed just shortly before , and was still overwhelmed by her own grief . She begged Jim , " Please wait a little longer until you 're sure . " But when she saw his mind was made up , she gave in gracefully . My folks , however , fought us right down the line . But then it seemed to me that they had been against whatever I wanted for as long as I could remember . We 'd always done a lot of quarreling and bickering at home , and I do n't think there was ever a time when my parents , my two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose that 's one of the reasons I felt so unbelievably wonder- ful with Jim . He was warm , kind. understanding and almost never got angry . I felt completely peaceful and protected when I was wit : - him . We were married for a whole year ? and I would say perfectly happy all that time ? before I realized with a shock that we had a problem . The problem ? or , at leas .. the way I saw it then ? was Jim. - excessive attachment to his mother . That bothered me so much tin for a while I was considering dl ing all sorts of harebrained things to our marriage . It took me six months to learn that the problem was not as onesided as I had thought . Then . when I was able to see that in many ways I had as much growing up to do as Jim , we were able to reach out to each other and find our way again . It 's funny that our troubleshould have centered around Jim ' , tiny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thingthat had endeared him to me was the wonderful way those two go-. along . When Jim 's father died , his affairs were in a tangle and Jim had to take over . During the firs . months of our marriage , he was still explaining complicated insurance policies to her , conferring constantly with her lawyer , working out a new mortgage on her house , guiding all her decisions . I marveled that someone so young could have Jim 's patient assurance and it never crossed my mind to begrudge the time he spent with his mother ; nor the many evenings he drove 50 miles to Oakdale to see her ; nor the countless phone calls . She was a delightful mother-in-law ? often giving me small , thoughtful gifts . She admired my taste and never offered a suggestion unless asked . The first inkling I had that all was not right was the night of Jenny 's birthday when Jim and I took her  | to a French film that was playing in town . While waiting in the lobby to be seated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder of Jim 's suit . Then she smoothed his sleeve and said to me , " Helen , do n't you love Jim 's new suit ? I think it 's perfect and it 's the first one we tried on . " I was startled . Not having really been aware that Jim had a new suit , I was astonished to learn that he and Jenny had gone shopping for it together . And not a word to me ! But before I could speak , the line moved into the theater and we sat down in the dark . Jim reached over a few minutes later for my hand . I pulled away . There was a cold , hurt knot inside me . I was amazed at how strongly I felt . By the time we got home , I 'd calmed down , and I asked him about the suit . " Mother and I bought it a couple of weeks ago ? one of those Thursdays I was in Oakdale . It 's good-looking , is n't it ? " " But why go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste . She knows exactly what 's right for me . " Jim 's attitude really baffled me . Since I had been twelve , I had refused to let my mother choose so much as a shoelace for me . " I should think by now you 'd want to do your own shopping , or let me help you , " I said . " Helen , honey , we 'd love for you to come along with us next time , " Jim offered cheerfully ? completely missing the point . From that day on I began to be more observant about what went on between Jim and his mother . Jim made his almost nightly phone call from our dinette . Instead of keeping busy in the kitchen while he talked , I sat quietly with my ears open . I began to learn a lot . While the calls started with a business detail , such as , " Ma , do n't forget the premium on your liability policy . . . " the talk quickly shifted from Jenny 's business to Jim 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a situation he 'd been involved in with someone named Hank in the payroll department where he worked . Another time he told his mother about a trip his boss , Mr. Fogarty , was about to take and asked , " Ma , do you think Helen and I should invite him to dinner before he goes to the coast ? " I had n't heard about Mr. Fogarty 's trip up to that point . My first impulse was to speak up and tell Jim that I thought he was altogether too dependent no his mother , that he was too old t , act like a little boy rushing int the house from school and saying . " Hey , Ma , guess what happened today ? " But I did n't say it . I just could n't tell Jim I thought he was behaving more like a child than a husband . I kept remembering the chronic quarreling that had gone on all day in my own home where someone was always telling someone else he was selfish or immature or that something awful was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would either be a lot of yelling or a long . horrid silence . In terror of introducing that kind of discord into a marriage which had been what I most wanted ? an oasis of tenderness and understanding , I held back and said nothing . But I got angrier inside . Some evenings I just stared at Jim while he recounted the details of his day to his mother , hoping he would read my mind . I suppose he did in a way , because he started getting noticeably irritable and moody . More and more , he would say he had a headache and go to bed early or spread office work on the table and hardly speak to me all evening . On Friday nights Jim and I usually went out for spaghetti dinner with several couples from my office , some of them married . others dating . On this particular night , the conversation around the table was about hairdos . One of the girls had just become a blonde . One fellow had bought his wife a wig . Another fellow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then for n , reason at all , Jane , a sharptongued girl about six years older than I and unmarried , took off after me . " You know , Helen , I 've often wondered why you stick with that baby hairdo , " she began . It 's true . I still wear my hair as I did in school , in a simple , loose style almost to my shoulders . Sometimes I tie it back with a ribbon . I 've often wanted to try something more sophisticated , but Jim has stopped me . He loves my hair long and silky . " Does n't her hair make her look about nine years old ? " Jane said and turned to her friend Sue for support . Sue nodded . " Why do you do it ? " Jane went on .  | " Jim likes it this way , " I said defensively , " Do n't you , honey ? " I looked toward Jim expecting quick , warm support . But he was digging into his pockets and not following our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked . " I just remembered I promised to call Mother at eight . " Luckily the table talk spun off in some other direction as Jim headed for the phone . My hair was forgotten , but even so I felt as though I 'd been slapped in the face . How could Jim be concentrating on his mother at the very moment I needed him ? Somehow we got through the rest of the evening , but the minute we were home I burst into tears . Jim tried to take me into his arms to comfort me and to find out what had caused my outburst . But the fact that he did n't know what he 'd done infuriated me al : the more . I tore away from him and went straight to bed . The next morning it was drizzling . Jim went to the window . looking out uncertainly . " Why do n't you call your mother and ask her if you should wear your rubbers ? " I asked . He slammed the door without saying good-by . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months were like . They were a nightmare . We went through the motions of being married so that I suppose tr an outsider our life looked the same . But it was n't . All the sweetness and tenderness , the deep . quiet understanding had drained away . It was all I could do t ' avoid picking fights in public and keep up a good front for my family . ( I could n't bear hearing my mother 's , " I told you so . " ) As the weeks passed , I wondered whether all our life was going ti , be like this . I looked at stonyfaced , middle-aged couples in restaurants , not speaking to each other , and asked myself , " Are we heading that way ? " I tried to analyze what was wrong . The way I saw it , it was all Jim 's fault . He was hopelessly tied to his mother ? childishly dependent on her , asking her to select his clothes , listen to his day 's adventures , tell him how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that I was in any way at fault or was contributing to the impasse between us . I felt terribly sorry for myself . Surprisingly , what opened my eyes was a run-in with that same girl , Jane , who 'd criticized my hair at the restaurant . Without  | even knowing she was doing it , she brought me to my senses . My boss was out of town for a week and I had time on my hands . When Jane asked me to help her out by typing part of a long report , I agreed . I assumed it was a report Jane was doing for her own boss , but it turned out that it was a favor for a boy she was dating . Someone found out ; the office manager sent for Jane and me and told us that if we did outside work again on company time , we 'd both be fired . You can imagine how burned up I was . Jane barely apologized . " Sorry , kid , bad break , " was all she had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got home that evening . I had only one foot in the door when I began to tell him what had happened . " Not now , Helen , ca n't listen , " he interrupted . " I have to eat quickly and get back to the office . Mr. Fogarty has some big shots visiting from the East , and he wants me there . " Jim bolted his dinner and rushed out . When he was gone . I was still exploding with my indignation . I had to tell someone . I reached for the phone and began to dial my sister . Suddenly halfway through the dialing , my fingers froze , and I put down the phone . Here I was calling my sister because Jim would n't listen . How often had he called his mother because I had n't listened ? Had I ever really listened to him ? Had I ever been truly attentive to the everyday details of his life ? Had I drawn him out , comforted him , shown that I cared about the small ups-and-downs of each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair and did some deep , hard thinking . Oh , yes , Jim and I always discussed big subjects like new jobs or vacations or sickness . But had n't I from the beginning closed my ears to what I considered trivial and petty matters ? the small talk of what to wear , what somebody said , how someone reacted ? Why was I like that ? Partly it was my nature ? I tended to be quiet and undemonstrative and hated idle chatter . Maybe I 'd learned at home that the best way to avoid a fight was just to keep silent . Then , too , I 'd always had an idea ? now it suddenly seemed childish ? that a really strong and independent man did n't need anyone 's help or counsel with the run-of-the-mill issues of daily life . But suppose Jim was n't that kind of man at all . Maybe he needed very much to talk about @#  | the little things on his mind , to shape his thoughts by expressing them , to share his moods and feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I surely had n't been much help to him with my stony indifference And how was he to know that inside I was not indifferent at all that I cared very much and was as easily hurt as he ? Well , now it was up to me to tell him ? and to tell him before it was too late . I had fresh coffee waiting for him when he got back from the office . " Who were the big shots visiting Mr. Fogarty ? " I asked . He looked surprised . " I thought office talk bored you , " he said . I do n't remember what I said then , but somehow I managed to show him that I actually was interested . He started talking ? about how he got on with his boss , about impending changes in his company , about lots of things that could mean a lot to his future and mine We must have talked for two solid hours that night , before we finally went to bed . The next day I clipped a newspaper ad for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to him when he got home . I was really touched by how pleased he was . At first I had to make a deliberate effort to talk about Jim 's interests . Soon I found I no longer had to try because the questions and answers and comments flowed naturally as we entered more deeply into each other 's lives and feelings . No , I did n't become a mother to Jim ? he already had a fine mother . But now at last he also had a real wife . ' The phone calls to Oakdale ? They 've dwindled to about one a week . I gave up noticing them some time back because the talk is almost entirely about Jenny 's business affairs . The other day when Jim and I made a final decision to buy a house , I knew my problem- so frightening a year ago ? was finally solved . We had had a hard time choosing between a ranch and a Cape Cod . The day we signed the papers for the ranch , Jim said , " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the house . She 'll be so hapoy when she hears we 've finally taken the big step . " Jim had n't even mentioned our house plans to Jenny , but now he wanted her to share our pleasure . That 's because he 's a good son and a good husband , too . I 'm very proud of him .
