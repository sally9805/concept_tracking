ROBERT FROST : THE EARLY YEARS-1874-1915 by Lawrence Thompson . 641 pages . Holt , Rinehart &; Winston . $12.50 . <P> To the millions who watched the old man recite The Gift Outright at the inauguration of John F. Kennedy , or learned to love Mending Wall or After Apple-Picking in their school days , Robert Frost was the serene , supremely benevolent country poet . A generation of interviewers had gorged themselves on his folksy humor and humble denims , on that familiar shock of untutored hair , those earthy accounts of his early scrabbling for a living from his New Hampshire poultry farm . Yet Frost also used to say : " I 'm liable to tell you anything . Trust me in the poetry , but do n't trust me on my life . You want to watch me . Check up on me some . " <P> Lawrance Thompson , the New Hampshire-born Princeton professor and critic whom Frost chose in 1939 to be his official biographer , did a lot of watching and checking . Out of nearly three decades of conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of two volumes-that will surprise Frost 's idolators . Thompson shows that there was very little in Frost 's style that was spontaneous ; he had to whittle laboriously at his poetry to achieve his roughhewn colloquial effects . Even more interesting is the author 's picture of Frost as a selfish , baffling , perverse and tormented soul , systematically creating a public image of a kindly , - home- spun and uncomplicated grandfather . <P> Self-Doubt &; Hatred . Young Robbie Frost was a spoiled brat almost from the day he was born in San Francisco in 1874 . His father was a hard-drinking , Harvard-educated journalist who beat Rob often . His mother indulged the boy , taught him to love poetry and nature ; she was a devout Swedenborgian who believed that she had religious visions . It was her influence , says Thompson , that encouraged Robbie and his sister Jeanie to withdraw into a private world as children . <P> Jeanie died in an insane asylum in 1929 . Robbie , infected with a tendency to explosive furies-which , as Thompson says , were much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vindictiveness , " found survival in poetry . His poems became " tools or weapons for actually trying to resolve those conflicts within himself , or between himself and others , which he viewed as being so dangerous that they might otherwise engulf him . " <P> Torn with self-doubts , self-hatred and continual impulses to suicide , Frost set himself adrift before he was 20 . He fled Dartmouth before the end of his first semester , spent three years moving from job to job , finding only in poetry " the momentary stay of confusion . " He tormented Elinor White , his shy high school sweetheart , with accusations of disloyalty because she wanted to finish college . Eventually she married him , but by that time , as he liked to say , he had " bent her to his will . " He put in two years at Harvard , paid for by his grandfather , who then bought him a farm in Derry , N.H. , and set him up in business as a poultry farmer .
