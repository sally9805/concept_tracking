txt Foreign Minister Abba Eban tonight rejected third-party mediation in the dispute between Israel and her Arab neighbors . He emphasized that Israel would accepi no substitute for a peace settlement negotiated directly with the Arab nations . He repeated that Israel would maintain her troops , along the present cease-fire line until such a peace settlement was reached . " We will reject any form of armistice and we reject all the kinds of euphemisms designed to provide our neighbors with an ' escape route from the necessity of formal interstate relations , " he said at a news conference here . It was the Foreign Minister 's first session with the press in Israel since before the brief war in June . " We think the time has come to restrict the area of choice , " he went on . " We think that if // the neighboring Governments are faced with two alternatives : to maintain the existing situation or to change it by peace , then the idea of negotiating peace might seriously enter their minds . " No Essential Change The position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has maintained since the end of the six-day war , but observers here regarded it as significant that he chose to reiterate , it so emphatically at a news conference attended by nearly 100 foreign journalists . Many observers believe that Mr. Eban 's remarks were designed as much for the benefit of the countries that might be dtafting peace alternatives as for the Arab nations . Discussing the territories that Israel occupied as a result of the war , Mr. Eban said : " There are two possible maps . There is the cease-fire map as it exists today or there is the new map of the Middle East which could be achieved only by a peace settlement . " " What that map would look like would only emerge in the peace negotiations themselves , " he said . " We : have very clear ideas of what we think it would look like and what we would like it to look like . " Promises to Be Reasonable The Foreign Minister declined to say what that map might be , but he said that Israel was prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that she would offer " reasonable and practical proposals " in the negotiations . In answer to a question , Mr. Eban acknowledged that he had no tangible evidence that the Arab countries were considering negotiating on peace but he said he still believed they would eventually decide to do so . " If we make it clear that there are only two alternatives , namely indifinite prolongation of the cease-fire situation and the negotiation of peace , then the alternative of peace wilt commend itself , " he said . But if we give the impression that there are dozens of alternatives  --  ease , facile , unrealistic ones  --  then we shall squander this opportunity . " Denies Israel Blocks Canal Asked about the Israeli attitude concerning the Suez Canal , the Foreign Minister said : " Let us make one thing clear . Israel is not obstructing the canal and the canal is not closed because of Israel . It is closed because Egypt sank ships at either end . " Mr. Ebari went on to say that there was nothing preventing free and innocent passage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that if the canal did open to other nations , " Israel would recall to the others that we have the same rights of passage . " When asked what Israel would do if the canal . were opened but denied to her shipping , he smiled and said : " I am willing to have a press conference on the day the canal is opened to intercontinental shipping to discuss the question then .
