Bobby 's Credentials <P> Sir : Senator Kennedy 's less than subtle , self-emulatory campaign and his image-making political antics disgust the rational , intelligent voter and remind one of Abe Lincoln 's familiar quote : " You can fool all of the people some of the time , some of the people all of the time , but you ca n't fool all of the people all of the time " - or can you ? <P> At least TIME Sept. 16 did n't slobber over him . <P> MARIBEL P. AGULLO Rocky Point , N.Y . <P> Sir : Why do you insist on fobbing off Robert Kennedy 's political strength on some sort of mystical personality cult ? The fact is that no other living man can show credentials of experience and accomplishment equal to his at his age-even fuller and more distinguished than John Kennedy 's at the same age . <P> <P> L. NICHOLL <P> Claremont , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : It is obvious that Senator Kennedy believes in deeds , not words . I do n't know about sounding like Bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEFF GRAY New York City <P> Sir : Taking a second look at David Stone Martin 's cover portrait of Senator Kennedy a question came to mind . Would Bobby be flattered by a picture which makes him look like a young Everett Dirksen ? <P> MICHAEL ROSENBERG Chicago <P> The Guru &; the Guards <P> Sir : Your cover story on that nut house called China Sept. 9 was a splendid piece of political writing . Mao Tse-tung has gone even beyond Stalin , his patron saint and political guru , in villainy . No political leader in history cuts such a ridiculous figure trying to stamp his aging image on the hearts of nearly 800 million people . <P> The resistance he has met shows that freedom still flickers in Red China . As hard as Mao and Piao try , they will not be able to quench this smoking flax of freedom , for this idiotic brand of totalitarianism can never ever establish itself . IVAN SASSOON Calcutta , India <P> Sir : Target the Red Guards overlooked : their atomic-weapon development facili ties and the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leibnitz , Gauss , Huygens , Kirchhoff . There , indeed , is a monument to the West that any sane man would like to see at the bottom of Lake Baikal . If they do a really thorough job long enough , they will be walking to work and working at night by the light of blazing pine knots , even in the Celestial City . <P> <P> REID WATSON <P> San Diego <P> Sir : China 's Red Guards baffle me . They order a candy shop to drop " Happiness " from its name , but allow it to continue in operation and to some extent sweeten up a nation determined to become the world 's No. 1 sourpuss . Now try to explain away capitalistic cavities from that Mukden milk chocolate . <P> DANIEL M. PEARSON Bethlehem , Pa . <P> <P> Views on the War
