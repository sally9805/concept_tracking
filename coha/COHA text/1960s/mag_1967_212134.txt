The annual report on the Harvard Law School to University President Nathan Pusey has just been published . An excerpt : " More and more law school faculties have come to be looked on as quarries from which persons may be chosen for important posts in public service . On numerous occasions they have left the Law School faculty , often on very short notice . But the process is difficult . The disruption is considerable , and one may be pardoned for wishing at times that his faculty was somewhat less attractive to the practical world . " <P> Author of the report : Dean Erwin Griswold , newly chosen by President Johnson to be U.S. Solicitor General .
