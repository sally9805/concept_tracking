The Rev. Joseph Schneiders , pastor of the First Unitarian Church of South Bend , Ind. , is not exactly the most popular figure in his politically conservative town . He has held antiwar meetings in the church , counseled youths on how to avoid the draft , been arrested with Negroes at a sit-in . Last July he invited Milwaukee 's Father William Groppi and a contingent of his followers down to join a series of Black Power demonstrations in South Bend . Less than a month later , an arsonist hurled a Molotov cocktail at Schneiders ' church , and half of it was destroyed by fire . The Insurance Company of North America duly covered the $40,000 worth of damage-but then canceled the congregation 's policy on the ground that the church was a likely target for similar attacks in the future . <P> Currently , First Unitarian has no insurance at all , since it has been turned down by at least 13 other companies . Nor is it the only congregation with that problem : a number of churches that have been involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insurance companies fear the buildings might be set afire , bombed or otherwise damaged . <P> After Boston 's Arlington Street Unitarian-Universalist Church accorded sanctuary last May to a draft resister and an AWOL soldier , the American Employers ' Insurance Co. canceled the church 's $1,400,000 property damage coverage . The congregation has failed to find a new underwriter . Westchester Fire Insurance Co. of New York dropped $256,000 worth of policies on the Unitarian Church of the Mediator in Providence , R.I. , after the company learned that the congregation intended to offer sanctuary to draft resisters ( it did , in fact , shelter two in June ) . <P> So far , none of the churches affected are letting actuarial worries curb their activism . Says the Rev. Albert Q. Perry , pastor of the Church of the Mediator : " We can always meet in a barn . But we ca n't meet anywhere if we have n't got the principles . " As a stopgap solution , the Arlington Street congregation has instituted its own fire watch : volunteers from the parish take turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
