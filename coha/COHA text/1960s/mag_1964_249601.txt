Banks are usually good mirrors of prosperity , but the $312 billion U.S. banking industry is sharing in the current economic advance to a degree that surprises even it . Bankers , in fact , are making more money than ever before . Last week alltime high first-half earnings were reported by several banks , including the two largest ones , San Francisco 's Bank of America and New York 's Chase Manhattan . Despite their rising operating costs and the higher interest payments they are forced to pay to remain competitive , the nation 's major banks earned 9% more in 1964 's first half than in the first half of 1963 . <P> Many Happy Returns . The prime reason for the rise is that U.S. businessmen and consumers are clamoring to borrow more . Outstanding loans of U.S. commercial banks jumped from $150 billion to $157 billion in this year 's first five months , and they are still climbing sharply . Much of the gain came in the kind of loans that bankers like most of all-consumer installment loans , which give them interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installment credit has increased by 13% in the past year , to $22 billion . At the same time , the amount of real estate loans , which yield more than 5% , has risen from $34 billion to $39 billion . <P> The bankers have also been earning more from the $59 billion that they have tied up in Government securities . Thanks to Washington 's policies of firming up interest rates to prevent investment capital from flowing to foreign countries , the yields on U.S. securities have risen about 1/2 of 1% in the past year - to 3 for short-term Treasury bills , and to 4% or more for longer-term issues . To further increase their income , the bankers have been switching increasingly from Government securities to municipal bonds , which are taxexempt . In the past year , they have boosted such investments by 23% , to nearly $23 billion . <P> More Powers . Prudence is a way of life for the bankers , and they would be the last to claim that their fortunes can continue to rise indefinitely. *Some bankers complain that interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , including Federal Reserve Chairman William McChesney Martin , worry that the bankers have taken on too many chancy construction loans . On the other hand , the fact that the bankers have lent out so much reduces the prospect of economic excess . Because the banks have only a small supply of liquid funds , the Federal Reserve now has greater power to tighten up on credit should strong signs of inflation appear . <P> <P> *A few overextended banks have failed lately . Last week the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . announced the collapse of the First State Bank of Dell City , Texas . Reason : an excess of bad loans . It was the third small bank failure for that reason this year .
