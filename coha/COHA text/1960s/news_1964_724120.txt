txt Dr. Sam Sheppard , who was married here Saturday , 51 hours after he was freed on bond from the Ohio state penitentiary in Columbus , spent yesterday with his bride and a few friends in his suite in the Conrad Hilton hotel . He said he and his wife will leave Chicago today , " reluctantly " because they have found it the friendliest city they have ever known . They plan to go to New York City and , after a few days there , to seek a vacation resort where they can enjoy a few weeks of seclusion . Hearing Is Wednesday All this is dependent upon the United States Court of Appeals , which will convene a threejudge panel in Columbus Wednesday to hear arguments on a motion by William Saxbe , Ohio attorney general , to withdraw Dr. Sheppard 's bond pending a decision on the state 's appeal from the freedom order . Dr. Sheppard 's status yesterday was unclear  --  to put it mildly . Until last Wednesday he was a convicted wife murderer , serving a life sentence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District Judge Carl A. Weinman of Dayton , 0. , signed an order in a habeas corpus case , he became an innocent man . The judge ruled that his 1954 trial , in which he was found guilty of the second degree murder of his wife , Marilyn , had been conducted without due process of law , and he voided both the conviction and sentence . The judge recognized the right of Cuyahoga county , 0. , to retry Sheppard on the original murder indictment . Despite the unfairness of the first trial , he indicated , Ohio ought to have another chance to give him a fair trial . Sheppard said yesterday that he has been advised by F. Lee Bailey of Boston , his chief counsel , that he need not attend Wednesday 's hearing . With his bride beside him on a sofa in the hotel 's bridal suite , Sheppard told me he is not worrying and wishes that his bride , the former Ariane Tebbenjohanns of Dusseldorf , Germany , would not . " I do not expect to be sent back to prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back I will do so , but I will have had a glorious week and will have attained happiness I had thought for 10 years would be forever impossible . " Wants to Walk Sheppard chatted easily about the exciting events of Saturday , in which he was married in the hotel - by Judge Nicholas Kure , magistrate of the Cook County Circuit court , and soon thereafter took his bride for a stroll . " I wanted to get outside and walk , " he said . " I wanted to walk like a free man along the streets of Chicago ? to walk with my wife beside me ? and to do some window shopping while savoring the knowledge that we could go anywhere we wanted to and do whatever we pleased . " People would stare at us and then approach us with friendly smiles and outstretched hands . They would ask us if we were the Sheppards and when I would nod they would pump my hand and tell me they always believed in my innocence . " Our stroll became a pro -- cession with scores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on so many subjects that I asked him if he could direct us to a good restaurant where we could get some French food . He said he knew the very place and asked us to be his guests . " So about midnight , or maybe later , we were in a restaurant . His taste was admirable . The food was great . Many of the diners came to our table to shake our hands . A television station set up lights and a microphone . We did not care . " It was after 2 a. m. before the Sheppards got back to the hotel . They stayed in their suite until noon . At that time Sam called and invited me to join them at breakfast . Sam talked of his life in prison . " It was hell , " he said . " It was simply unshirted hell . They watched every move I made for 10 years . They punished me every time somebody on the the outside did something in my behalf . I was told I. was really responsible and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I wanted to . " As soon as my engagement to Ariane was announced ( January , 1963 they put me in a maximum security cell with three roommates and told me I would be kept there until I admitted the engagement was simply a publicity stunt . I never admitted it a n d they never gave me back my honor status . "
