txt Riots that eruptdd in many American cities this summer worry labor leaders more than they care to admit . In Newark , Detroit , and other urban areas , disturbances occurred in the homelands of industrial unions  --  where labor has been most active not only in traditional economic fields but also , often allied with civil-rights groups , on social issues . Many union members , white and Negro , were victims of the riots . Labor officials concede that some members undoubtedly participated in them . Reforms sought Now that tensions have eased , the men who guide labor 's liberal wing  --  principally in the big industrial unions ? are trying to assess the effect widespread racial troubles might have on and inside the labor movement . The AFL-CIO 's policymaking executive council will have this on its agenda when it.convenes in New York next month . Labor has had close ties with the civil-rights movement in recent years .

And it has sought to abolish color lines within its own ranks . Effects weighed Labor 's efforts in behalf of Negro and other minority groups created some problems for unions : In the South , particularly but not exclusively , many white unionists resisted efforts to desegregate union halls and broaden economic , educational , and social opportunities for Negroes . In almost all parts of the country , labor 's open-housing campaigns stirred resentment among white members where the efforts touched their communities and neighborhoods . Until this summer , unions were confident that their educational ' campaigns among white members  --  on the benefits of racial equality  --  were making slow but sure progress . Now many leaders feel that important ground may have been lost because of the riots .

Among other unions , the Retail , Wholesale , and Department Store Union found a fertile organizing field  --  among white and Negro workers alike ? where there had been racial ferment . Lag forecast Now that situation , too , might have changed . Union people say it 's too early to tell , but they do n't hide their concern that labor organizing in the South  --  the area in which recent union gains have been most significant ? will be slowed considerably . Distrust of " black rebellion " is expected to increase local resistance wherever labor organizers go into expanding industrial areas of the rural South . Labor leaders , along with civil-rights leaders , deplore this summer 's riots as a " misguided 12-to ? 21 development "  --  a reference to their reports of the general age level of the majority of those who took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that troubles stemmed from " easily aroused hoodlum elements " and were not in actual fact civil-rights demonstrations that took violent courses . Where union members got involved , they were " men with grievances , " according to United Automobile Workers , United Packinghouse Workers , and other union civil-rights experts . Family disrupted For instance , many Negroes migrated into the Detroit area to take jobs in auto plants when workers were badly needed . In the past year or so , many young Negroes with low seniority have been laid off . The UAW concedes that many of them are bitter because layoffs hit Negroes , the last hired in large numbers , harder apparently than whites . Their dissatisfaction made them human tinder for the race explosion . A UPW spokesman in Chicago said that thousands of Negroes have lost jobs in the industry " due to plant closings and consolidations  --  Negroes were the last hired and so the first to go . " Resentment about lost jobs and long unemployment could have been one of many factors in " minor incidents " in Waterloo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that other factors  --  bad housing , the " retainment of Negroes in ghettos , " and " depressed conditions for the Negro " ? were more important as causes of trouble . UPW 's Russel R. Lesley , a vice-president and a Negro , added that " the breakdown of the Negro family " in cities is perhaps the most critical of all factors . He noted that under ghetto conditions " 50 percent of the teen-age Negro boys lack the guidance of a father in the home ... because of the inability of the Negro father to take care of his family , because he is unable to get a job or an adequate job . " Whatever the true reasons for the rioting , unions are studying ways of trying to relieve tensions before Negro and white views become more polarized . While they talk also of seeking solutions to race problems , some of those closest to the situation say grimly that solutions may be " a generation in the future " ? they feel that even with better homes and schooling it will take years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for racial equality . Education stressed Unions intend , for instance , to strengthen legislative programs and inside-the-union educational campaigns , with major emphasis on jobs , housing , and education . They plan to expand present efforts to make unions and their liberal leaders a more potent force in communities . And they plan , very quietly , to mobilize labor support for responsible Negro civil-rights leaders such as Roy Wilkins and Whitney Young Jr. , to help them recapture civil-rights initiative from black-power advocates . Otherwise , there is local political ferment now in many unions ; it could increase  --  and with it the problems of international leaders . Any weakening of leadership down the line affects the union internal structure . There are other worries . In most unions , Negroes are n't in the skilled-craft ranks in substantial numbers . They are n't likely to sympathize with the skilled workers ' strong pressures for bigger raises than the production workers get . If they balk at bargaining decisions that give the skilled what they demand , strike problems will be intensified for employers  --  possibly auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
