txt Mayor Wagner has put his administration squarely behind an immediate city-wide hourly minimum wage of $1.25 , to be increased automatically in one year to $1.50 . The Mayor 's policy , announceayesterday , conformed to the recommendations made last Tuesday by a majority of the Citizens Commission on the City Economy . A minority of the committee dissented , holding that the increase to $1.50 would hurt the city 's economy . Mr. Wagner said his minimum wage bill , to be introduced into the City Council Tuesday , would be " broader in its coverage than any minimum wage bill on the statute books of either the Federal or state governments . " T=axi Drivers Included " Thus , " he said , " it will include taxi drivers , domestics and employes of charitable institutions , such as hospitals and nursing homes . " Mayor Wagner attacked the state government for creating what he said was an insufficient minimum wage for the state . " The fact is , " he declared , " that we of the city government are forced to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his lie*tenants in the Legislature to entertain or urge an adequate minimum wage level . " It is the proper province of the state to legislate on this subject . " The existing Federal minimum wage of $1.15 , applying to employes of businesses engaged in interstate commerce , will go to $1.25 on Oct. 1 , 1963 . State Wage Rising The state minimum wage of $1 , applying to employes , except those specifically exempted , of businesses not in the interstate category , will rise to $1.15 on Oct. 15 of this year and to $1.25 on Oct , 15 , 1964 . The Mayor took cognizance of arguments that with a $1.25 or $1.50 minimum wage legislated in the city , businesses unable to meet those scales would be driven away . " Among the provisions I have directed be included in the bill , " Mr. Wagner said , " is one directing comprehensive economic studies of those categories of enterprises and industries which might claim to be , and in fact might be , adversely affected by a local minimum wage law . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assorted , " to help them absorb the impact of increases in minimum wage levels . " " I have noted the concern shown in the majority report for retraining workers . who might lose their jobs because of the increases in the minimum wage level , " he said . " As Mayor of this city , it is my responsibility to be concerned also for the welfare of the business enterprises which might be adversely affected . " I hope that none of them will be , but I will strongly recommend to the City Council that appropriate emphasis be given , in the authorization for economic studies of the impact of the minimum wage law , to the economic problems which might be presented to business enterprises in all categories whose wage levels are now below the minimum recommended to be established by local law . " Mr. Wagner indicated that he would defer adopting a proposal of the Citizens ' Commission majority that in the case of such agencies and institutions as voluntary hospitals , " the city should make such financial arrangements with these institutions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are involved . " " Of course , " the Mayor observed , " this is easier said than done , and certainly can not be provided for in the legislation now to be submitted to and considered by the City Council . " The city bill , Mayor Wagner asserted , will be a " major undertaking in draftsmanship . " City experts and technicians are working on it over the week-end " but its policy lines have already been laid down by me , " be said . The Mayor said he would defer giving complete details on his bill until its introduction . The Mayor insisted the city 's new minimum wage law would not be an " empty gesture . " At his direction , he said , Corporation Counsel Leo A. Larkin has prepared " provisions for comprehensive administration and enforcement of the new minimum wage levels . " The constitutionality of a city minimum wage law has been questioned in some quarters on the ground that the field has been pre-empted by the Federal and state governments , leaving the city with no power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face stiff battles before any city minimum wage is enacted . He has already come under fire from the National Associtttion for the Advancement of Colored People , other Negro and some Puerto Rican and labor groups for his indicated refusal , prior to yesterday 's statement , to press for passage of a pending City Council local bill for the immediate establishment of a $1.50 minimum wage . Vote Sought on $1.50 Several Councilmen , including some reform Democrats , have indicated they will attempt at the next Council meeting to discharge the Committee on General Welfare from further consideration of the $1.50 wage bill and force it to the floor for a vote . Before the Mayor is a telegram signed by representatives of fifteen business groups , including several chambers of commerce , asking Mr. Wagner to confer with them before his minimum wage bill is introduced . They said they wanted to discuss " the impact of such legislation on jobs , consumer prices and small business as well as its consequences to the city economy . " The majority of the Citizens Commission consisted of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two dissenters included Louis Broido , the chairman . The dissenters said they had been prepared to go along with a $1.25 wage . But they argued that $1.50 might drive some businesses from the city and probably also would cause some employes , for whose benefit a minimum wage was being sought , to lose their jobs . Mayor Wagner 's policy on a minimum wage was announced in an 1,800-word statement that had been originally promised for last mid-week and then deferred from day to day . In it , he said that the 180,000 persons now receiving less than $1.25 an hour in New York City and the 500,000 who are paid less than $1.50 " must recognize that Governor Rockefeller and the State Legislature are responsible for the present minimum wage level . " Mr. Wagner said he would receive constant " studies and reports " . on the impact of the $1.50 minimum , after it became law , " so we may have all the economic data we require to consider any action deemed suitable next year after the minimum goes into effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the majority of workers earning less than $1.25 an hour were employed in the retail trades , in hotels , hospitals , - nursing homes and in laundries . Mayor Wagner 's bill is expected to include few if any exemptions from the minimum wage requirements . The Federal and state mini : mum wage laws exempt some classes of workers , including those employed in agriculture and domestic service and by nonprofit institutions , such as voluntary hospitals .
