The works of Franz Kafka have been translated into every major language-except that of cinema . Orson Welles ' film version of The Trial failed to crack the surface of bureaucratic terror and reveal the author 's psychological insights . German Director Rudolf Noelte 's adaptation of The Castle , Kafka 's last , incomplete parable , fares little better . <P> On the surface , all is well . Like the book , the movie begins as an anonymous stranger ( Maximilian Schell ) arrives at a village . He announces that he is the new land surveyor for the " Castle " perched on a nearby hill . Inexplicably , the suspicious villagers already know and fear him . The remainder of the story simply concerns his futile negotiations to gain an identity from the impenetrable villagers and a calling from the inaccessible castle . <P> Kafka 's heroes are like the sculptures of Giacometti : all elements of mask and attitude are burned away until only an irreducible essence remains . As the surveyor , Schell accurately embodies the man known only as " K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final exhausted syllable . The villagers are a finely balanced mixture of arrogance and dread . Kafka 's tales all take place in limbo ; the movie fills its snowbound setting with an unworldly black-comic air appropriate to the author , whom Thomas Mann called " a religious humorist . " Pompous officials deliver pronunciamentos even when there is no one left to listen . A girl tumbles into the surveyor 's bed-and exhibits neither love nor lust . The sullen winter light reveals the endless decay of life . <P> Yet , for all its external excellence , The Castle is as shallow and enervated as its predecessor , The Trial . Possibly the fault lies with the master himself ; his aphoristic sweep seems cinematically untranslatable . As a novel , The Castle has inspired sheaves of interpretations . In one theory , the Castle is seen as religion inhabited by the unseeable God . The land surveyor , then , is on a pilgrim 's progression to salvation . More fashionable exegeses view the Castle as untenanted . Heaven is barren and the village is the earth below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is turned . The villagers have only his word that the land-surveyor is what he is : he produces no credentials . Thus discredited , he is under the Ptolemaic delusion that he is the center of the cosmos . It is not the Castle that is empty but man himself , beyond grace , beyond help , beyond hope . <P> The film version allows no such richness of interpretation . As if Kafka had written some Now film to capitalize on student unrest , the movie promotes itself as the story of " one man against the Establishment . " That is absurd-but not the absurdity that Kafka was writing about .
