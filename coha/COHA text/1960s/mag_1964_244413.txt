In the 13 months since eleven unions struck the Florida East Coast Railway over a wage dispute , there have been some 200 acts of sabotage against the line . All told , 82 freight cars have been derailed , a station and a bridge burned , another bridge blown up , and $1,250 , - 000 damage done in one of the meanest railroad strikes in recent U.S. history . Last week it got even meaner . <P> A dynamite blast at a trestle near Miami sent 27 cars of a 91-car freight tumbling down an embankment into a stream . Three hours later , the railroad 's only wreck-clearing derrick car in southern Florida was blown up . Later in the week , four boys found 45 sticks of dynamite wired to the main line tracks near Titusville , dismantled them barely minutes before a 70-car freight highballed by . And at week 's end , another dynamiting near New Smyrna Beach derailed 14 cars . <P> <P> Such incidents were bad enough , but perhaps even worse was a 48-hour disruption of construction at the Cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers refused to cross picket lines set up by the strikers . The railroad has a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to haul heavy building materials to the cape . As a result of the picketing , 30 projects worth $200 million were closed down , including construction of the site where the Saturn rocket moon shot will be assembled . <P> A temporary restraining order , sought by the National Labor Relations Board to halt the picketing , was issued , and work got going at the cape again . But no one knew for how long .
