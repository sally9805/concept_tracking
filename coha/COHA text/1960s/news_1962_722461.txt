txt Lieut . Comdr . M. Scott Carpenter made the mistake of leaving two control systems in operation in the final phase of his flight in the Aurora VII before firing the retro rockets to bring him out of orbit . This apparently accounts for the fact that the fuel supply on both systems reached dangerously low points . It does not necessarily account for the fact that the space capsule overshot its intended landing spot by 250 miles . Disclosure of the error was made by Project Mercury officials here and at Grand Turk , the British West Indies island where the 37-year-old astronaut has been reviewing the flight and undergoing medical examination . It was stressed by some of these officials that the mistake had not been a critical one and that the astronaut should not be unduly criticized for one oversight in the stress of getting ready for the most critical phase of the flight . Their main interest in achieving full understanding of the error was to show that the Mercury capsule had not failed . In fact , they were So encouraged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the astronaut , that they were favorably considering going to a sevenorbit mission the next time around . There were minor differences in accounts of the control system error given by Mercury of // cal name is " fly-by-wire . " Manual movements of the control stick operate the jet thrusters electronically . But here is where he made his mistake in the pressure of getting squared away for that vital moment  --  retro firings . I , n changing to " fly-by-wire , " he neglected to turn off the manual system . The over-all control system is designed so that both systems can operate simultaneously . This is to insure control on one in case something happens to the other , But dual operation is intended mainly for the " retro " firing and re-entry ? the most critical phase of the flight . Dual control is too wasteful of fuel to be used most other times . Thus fuel was wasted by Commander Carpenter when he used " fly-by-wire " and one of the " manual " systems controls while racing at 17,500 miles an hour between Hawaii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been some feeling here that the astronaut must have been on the manual-electronic system rather than the manual-mechanical part of the so-called " manual " system . But according to the Mercury spokesman , Lieut . Col. John A. Powers , at Grand Turk , the astronaut himself reported he was on the manual-mechanical . CARPENTER ERROR LED TO LOW FUEL // " ficials here and at Grand Turk . But essentially here is what appears to have happened : A Mercury capsule has two largely independent control systems . The purpose of these systems is to orient the capsule around its three axes ? roll , pitch ( nose up or down ) , and yaw ( nose side to side ) . These changes in attitude in no way change the capsule 's flight path through space . One system is known as the automatic system , though one of its methods of control uses manual pilot movements of the control stick . The other method , is purely automatic , like an airplane 's " hands off ' autopilot . Manual System The second control system is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control . Roth are manual but one is mechanical and the other electronic . The various control methods move the capsule about its three axes by squirting bursts of , hydrogen peroxide fuel through eighteen strategically located jet orifices . The so-called " automatic " system and the " manual " system have completely independent jet orifices and fuel supplies . For a major portion of the flight , Commander Carpenter was instructed to use only the manual systems in order to conserve fuel in the automatic system . The reason was that he had used excessive automatic-system fuel in the first orbit and it was important to have adequate fuel in the automatic system for the critical final stage of the flight . This stage starts with the firing of the retro , or backward-firing rockets and continues through the brutal reentry into the earth 's atmosphere . It is vital that the capsule be properly positioned for the retro firing and also that it be reoriented for re-entry to keep the . heat shield facing the direction of descent so that it can absorb the tremendous 3,000-degree heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Aurora VII arrived over Hawaii toward the end of its third orbit , Commander Carpenter was instructed to switch from the manual system to the completely automatic system as the first important step in getting ready for firing of the retro rockets . The automatic system was supposed to position the capsule automatically in the proper attitude for retro firing . In this position , it would be flying backward , or heat shield forward and narrow " nose " to the rear . It would be tilted so that the heat shield was 34 degrees above the horizontal and the other , " nose , " end 34 degrees below the horizontal . When Commander Carpenter switched on the completely automatic system , he apparently decided it was not holding position properly . He quickly switched to the manual system , evidently that part of the manual system linked mechanically to the jet orifices . Evidently , he was unable to orient the capsule properly with this control mode in time for " retro firing which was getting dangerously close as he raced toward the California coast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the manual part of the so-called " automatic " system . Its techniEither way , the fuel drained at too high a rate . As the capsule neared Hawaii , there was an adequate margin in both supply tanks . The " automatic " system was 45 per cent full , The manual system was 40 per cent full . It is desired to have 35 per cent on both systems at the time of " retro " firing . But by the time Commander Carpenter was ready for retro firing , he was below the 35 per cent on both systems . During a normal retro firing , 10 per cent is used to hold proper position through the onetwo-three firing of the three " retro " rockets . If position is not held , the thrust will not be exerted in the optimum direction . The result would be that the capsule would not be slowed the optimum amount and would overshoot its landing area . Commander Carpenter overshot by 250 miles . But it was not clear yet why . Colonel Towers said that the astronaut 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " fly-by-wire " of the automatic was " a mistake " to " the extent that he should not have been on two control modes " at the same time . He said that , so far as he knew , this represented the only " human error " by the astronaut during the flight .
