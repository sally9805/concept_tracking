MY NAME I S MORGANBroadway Carnival followed . Jack Morgan was learning how to put on a Broadway show . He toned down the vulgarity , put girls into expensive skimpy costumes , and hired a big-name comedy star to front for him . He saw horizons unfolding , one beyond an- other : Broadway , and then Hollywood , and then ? A dream he scarcely dared to admit . To produce something worthwhile , a super-epic that would please the critics and bring in the public too . A masterpiece on a giant scale , yet with all the details perfect , a work of art on a far bigger canvas than any movie ever made . It was a grandiose vision for an ex-carny man but he knew he could do it if he got the chance . Meanwhile , life with Bessie became impossible . She was still the Brooklyn girl he had married and that was all she wanted to be . Her figure had already lost its supple youthfulness and become comfortable and matronly . She was almost thirty and had obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to stay out evenings and soon she heard about other women . On the night they broke up for good , he took her out to dinner at the Rimini , a quietly elegant restaurant where not too many people knew him . They did not often go out together , but they were cele- brating his birthday . The evening started to go wrong as soon as they entered the restaurant . The hat-check girl turned on her brightest welcoming smile . " How 've you been , Mr. Morgan ? We have n't seen you here in ages . " Bessie overheard the exchange and as they followed the head- waiter to their table she murmured , " That girl knew you pretty well . She treated you like an old customer . " " I 've been here before . " " She was trying to impress you . I guess that happens with a lot of young girls now that you 're a producer . " This topic was charged with enough electricity to explode the evening , so he tried a diversion . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bessie ? " " Why do n't you tell her ? I 'm sure she 'd like to hear . She 'd proba- bly go to bed with you if you promise her a part in it . " " Bessie , we 're here to enjoy ourselves , not to have another argu- ment . " MY NAME IS MORGAN 41Her voice rose . " Did I start it ? What kind of a man are you that you ca n't even talk to your own wife ? " Several people at other tables turned to stare at them . " I 'm leaving , " he said , rising from his seat . She followed him , fuming , into the foyer , where he reclaimed his hat and coat from the hat-check girl . Bessie 's shrill voice cut through the subdued noises of the restaurant . " Stop smiling at my husband , young lady . It wo n't get you any-where . " The hat-check girl 's smile slowly faded . " I 'm sorry , " Morgan said . " My wife is upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need anyone to apologize for me . I see how she plays up to you . " He took Bessie by the arm , roughly , and guided her to the door . Outside the restaurant the freshening night air was a relief . " I told that girl the plain truth , " Bessie said . " Smart little tease , making eyes at you right in front of ... " " That 's enough , Bessie . " They drove in silence until the car stopped before the two-family brownstone in Flatbush . He reached over and opened the door on her side of the car . " This is where you get off , " he said . " Jacob . . . " " It 's something we have to face , Bessie . I do n't love you and if we live together any longer I wo n't even like you . " " You do n't mean that . Come upstairs , Jacob . Let 's talk .... " " No . " " Do n't you want to see your son ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a chance to think things over . " He sent for his clothes in the morning and took up permanent residence in the hotel . Bessie never accepted the fact of a real separation , but he had known their marriage was finished . He felt as though his life was just beginning . . . . The limousine moved crosstown to Riverside Drive , and up beside the park to the Seventy-ninth Street exit . The Hudson RiverMY NAME IS MORGANcarne widely into view , with the dark crouching hills of New Jersey across the way . Anne took her head off his shoulder . " Oh , is n't it pretty ! " The yacht lay at anchor off the pier , its lights ablaze and winking on the water . Out of the surrounding night the lights held promise of gaiety , a dimension of living above anxiety or frustration or boredom , a place whose inhabitants were all secure , powerful , andfree . " Stick with me , honey , " Morgan said , " and you 'll have one of your own . CHAPTER 4Glancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry Whirter saw Lorraine seated at a far corner table . He went down three steps into the restaurant . The decor was French provincial , fresh-painted and lacy white. ge checked his hat and coat , and as he went back toward the rear of the restaurant where Lorraine was seated studying the menu , she underwent in his mind a long distance appraisal . And there it was , the familiar , totally unreasonable , totally right twist of desire . Ile stopped by the table and she glanced up , smiling . " I very late ? " he asked . " Just a few minutes . What kept you ? " " A long session with Sol Shapiro this morning . I had a lot of explaining to do . " He sat down beside her and picked up a menu . " Explaining ? " she asked . " What about ? " " Why I have n't got started on that job of examining Morgan 's books . Morgan is tougher than I thought . " " Do you think he has something to hide ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is keep after him . Sooner or later I 'm going to break through . " " I 've read so much about him . What kind of a man is he really ? " Larry told her the whole story of his meetings with Morgan , butshe was still unsatisfied . Jack Morgan had for Lorraine not only theMY NAME IS MORGAN 43fascination of a celebrity ; his daring adventures appealed to her orderly mind in the same way that pirate stories appeal to a timid child . " There must be something about him , " she mused . " Why would a woman like Anne Allen fall in love with him ? " " I 'm not certain that she is in love with him . " " Then why does she go with him ? There are plenty of other men who have more money than he has . She could have her pick of any of them . " To answer her , Larry tried to resolve his disparate impressions of Morgan . " There 's something magnetic about the reckless way Jack Morgan operates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess every woman  --  would like to think of themselves as able to act without fear of consequences , to take impossible risks and win through in the end . Morgan just does n't seem to have doubt about anything . You 'd never know from the way he talks whether he has a dime in his pocket or a million dollars . His kind of confidence does n't have anything to do with the size of his bank account ' " " Yes . A woman could be attracted to a man like that . " " He 's the last of the old freewheeling capitalists . Just as shamelessa robber baron as Jay Gould or Rockefeller . " He heard in her silence a decisive note of disagreement . She said , " That is n't fair . Jack Morgan is just a movie producer . Those other men you 're talking about helped to build our country . " " If Morgan had been born in their time , he 'd have gotten into railroads or an oil swindle or a stock scheme to rob widows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other malefactors of great wealth . " Lorraine 's tone was chill . " That 's a quote , is n't it ? " " Malefactors of great wealth ? F. D. R. said it . " Her lips compressed . " I hope we 're not going to get into a politicalargument , Larry . " He gave her an adamantine smile . " Lorraine , you were five or six years old when F. D. R. died . You could n't have worked up a very strong feeling about him . " " I 've read a lot . And besides , Mother says . . " Your mother is a surviving relic of the Stone Age . " 4 MY NAME IS MORGANShe absorbed the impact for a moment before she answered in a firm voice : " I do n't like you to talk that way about Mother . Just because you and she have some political disagreements . . . " " We do n't disagree . I said her opinions belong to the Stone Age , and she agrees with me . Only she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little old-fashioned . But her forefathers helped to build America and she does n't want this country wrecked by people who do n't care about it the way she does . Is there anythingwrong with that ? " " just one little thing . What your mother calls wrecking , other people call change . " " There are some things that never change . " " Name them . " " You 're being cynical . " " No , I 'm not . Name something that you think endures forever . " " Now , see what 's happening ? We 're having a political argument . " Before the invincible logic of her rebuke , he surrendered . During the next ten minutes their conversation was limited to a discussion of the menu and necessary interchanges with the waiter , and that left him with an opportunity to reflect on how many people like Lorraine 's mother really believed there were eternal truths . An idea rose out of conditions that made its creation vital to men of that era , and survived long after the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century or two , a thousand years , it received the official stamp of an eternal truth and became part of the universallanguage , immutable as a law of geometry . That is why most people still thought of America as the land of free enterprise , where millions of small entrepreneurs struggled to launch their personal skiffs on the great tide of unending progress . One had only to look about him to discover that those days were gone . This was what made Jack Morgan almost unique ; he was playing the same old rules in an entirely new game . Fortunately for him , the arena of show business was one of the last in which a man , daring and flamboyant enough , could win his way to plunder . Lorraine was sipping a glass of dark red wine . A vapor of baffled desire rose before his eyes and he saw her with longing ; the quality of emotion she evoked in him left him only more helpless in the clutch of it . He had known only a few girls intimately butMY NAME IS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and forthright . He had learned how to transmute the vague hankerings of his adolescence into the strong frank satisfactions of young manhood , and there had been no vague or excess emotion left over . It had begunlike that with Lorraine , but somewhere along the way his straightforward desire had changed into something new and strange . Tenderness had come not from a new emotion that modified desire , but from simple frustration . Just as her mother believed in her few eternal truths , so Lorraine believed in a few unchanging moral principles . Chastity was one . Her faith in the virtue of virtue seemed unassailable . Nevertheless , he had begun his assault with powerful allies . There was the awakening of her own desires , the urgency of his youthful ardor , the example of their impassioned contemporaries . On a recent evening he had begun to sense that she was on the point of yielding , but then , with his flaming cheek against her chest wall , he heard the slowing of her pounding heart and knew the issue would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , the time was now . " Lorraine . " She looked at him , her spoon holding a neatly curved section of chocolate mousse . " Yes ? " " You 're right . We should n't get into political arguments . " She smiled . " You were irritable because of that meeting with Sol . " " I guess so . Where would you like to go after dinner ? " " Bob and Irene called . They 're having some people over at theirhouse tonight . They want us to come . " " Sounds like a pretty dull evening . " She began a disapproving look , and decided midway to be patient . " What would you like to do ? " she asked . " I 'm not in the mood for visiting . How about just going for a ride ? " " I do n't think we can possibly get out of Bob and Irene without a good excuse . " " Let 's make one up . " " They 're my best friends , Larry . I knew them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen them in nearly two months . They 'll be offended if we do n't show up . " 46 MY NAME IS MORGANHe could not gain anything from arguing with her . In the circumstances , his best course was to yield and thereby put her under obligation to him . Then , perhaps , later .. . About ten o'clock that night Larry decided he could not bear another minute in the Landrums ' house . He was in the midst of a discussion of the latest wife-murder on Long Island , and the three people who surrounded him were retelling the various reports in different newspapers , and the lady painter ( unmarried ) was cluck-clucking at the way in which some women such as the unfortunate victim tyrannized over men , meanwhilegiving demure glances at the male editor for the Associated Press ( also unmarried ) , assuring him emphatically that she could never be that kind of person . The other man , on Larry 's left , was the husband of a tiny and consciously dynamic redhead who was helpingIrene with the serving and constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborly mercy . Her husband was a tall , rather sad-faced man with a perpetually stunned look who hardly said anything at all . Larry would have broken away earlier from this group if he had not , tuning in to others nearby , discovered that they were discussing the raising of funds for a new church , and the advantages of different kinds of power lawn mowers . He directed a glance toward Lorraine , hoping she would rescue him , but she was occupied in a study of the Landrums ' baby pictures with the wife of the man who owned the public-relations agency . He drifted over to the bar , where Bob Landrum enthusiastically refilled his dry martini and added a new slice of lemon . " How are you doing ? " Bob asked . " Fine , " Larry said . " Lovely party . " He moved warily over to the fringes of the group of women looking at baby pictures and Lorraine instantly divined trouble . In less than a minute she came to his side . " Larry , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your-self . " Smiling at no one in particular , he said under his breath , " Let 's get out of here before I start breaking the crockery . " " We ca n't leave as early as this . " Lorraine brightened as the youngMY NAME IS MORGAN 47lady painter , with her editor now securely in tow , came in their direction . " Hi , there . Did Larry tell you about Jack Morgan ? " The editor stopped and asked , " Jack Morgan ? The producer ? " Having snared her prey , Lorraine continued in a slightly raised voice that carried to others in the room : " Oh , yes . Larry 's been seeing him regularly . He says Jack Morgan is just as fabulous a character as he 's been written up to be . " Others began to edge toward them and in a few moments there was a group of people within respectful hearing distance . " Tell them about your first appointment with Morgan , " Lorraine urged . Larry told how he had arrived in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he meant only the eveninghour . A small surprised titter ran through the crowd . " Have you met Anne Allen ? " someone asked . " Is he having an affair with her ? " the dynamic redhead wanted to know . " I met her at his office . That 's all I know about it . " The redhead was disappointed . " According to the papers , it 's the Hollywood romance . Frankly , I ca n't see why a beautiful young girl like Anne Allen , who can have her choice of just about the handsomest men in the world , would pick someone like . . . " The conversation veered to Jack Morgan and his peculiarities . They enjoyed talking about the Odd One because that reaffirmed their normality . Larry could not relate to groups like this . In the smoke-filled living room , talking with what passed for animation , they seemed to have things to say to each other . They communicatedthe minutiae of their lives , events so insignificant they hardly warranted the importance of language . Theirs was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substratum world which holds all the rest together . In every generation , through storms of social change , in the midst of Armageddon itself , these people would conduct themselves with absolute certainty that there was bedrock beneath their feet . Lorraine said softly , " Larry , for heaven 's sake ! " There was the sound of handclapping , and the lady concert pianist swung around on the piano stool and smiled at the assembled48 MY NAME IS MORGANcrowd . Someone brought her a drink , while Larry unobtrusively picked up the rhythm of the clapping . " You were n't even listening , " Lorraine said . " Lorraine , " he said , " I think we 'd better get out of here . " " We ca n't . She may play an encore . And besides , it is n't even ten-thirty . " The clapping faded out into clattering echoes , and it became evident that the lady pianist was not going to perform again . " Let 's go , " Larry said . " Larry , be reasonable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they excused themselves and , leaving a trail of " so nice to have met you 's , " made their way to the door . On the lawn outside , the glow of two huge coach lanterns relieved the darkness . They got into the car without speaking . In the dim car interior Lorraine 's face was pale , remote , spiritual in its anger . " All right , " Larry said . " Shall we quarrel now  --  or later ? " " You were inexcusably rude . " " I could n't stand it another minute . " " Bob and Irene are my very best friends . You 're just in a mood . " " Maybe I am . Or maybe I just wanted to be alone  --  with you . " The long slender column of her neck was almost hidden by the fur collar of her coat , but an inviting glimpse of white skin gleamed . He slid his arm along the back of the seat and put his hand against the delicate thrust of her collarbone . She pulled away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put his hands on the wheel . " Do you have any other suggestions ? " he said . She did not answer , so he turned on the ignition , shifted the car into gear , and headed west . As they sped down a dark wide highway , she turned on the radio and music lilted from a tiny ribbon of light . This was her way of retreating into silence . Larry settled back into the car seat and so did Lorraine . Would marriage be like this ? he wondered . To occupy his mind , and keep from worrying about Jack Morgan , he began to think about Bill Forstmann , an accountant in his office . Last week Bill had told him that he was going to be married . He tried to picture Bill 's Janice . MY NAME IS MORGAN 49Bill , balding , toothbrush mustache , slightly protruding teeth , locked in embrace with an unidentifiable dark-haired girl . Bill , on the wedding night , in pajamas , going into the privileged bedroom with his peculiarly boneless way of walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first hour ? For an instant he felt a deep communion with Bill , the warmth of comrades facing common danger . He knew that Bill had arrived at the idea of marriage in much the same way that most men did . Janice had held him at bay , letting intolerable desire increase until sheer weight broke him as though he were a diver too far down in deep water . " What 's that ? " Lorraine suddenly asked . " Hmm ? " He turned to her and saw that her face muscles had relaxed . She was almost ready to forgive . " You were humming a tune . " He had not been aware , but now he recognized the melody . It had come directly from his subconscious . It was the old show tune , " The Night Was Made for Love . " " I do n't know , " he said . " I was n't listening . " Fortunately he had never been able to carry a tune properly , and she had n't recognized it . " Try to be quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She went softly into the foyer of the apartment and he followed , closing the door . Through the kitchen windows he saw the East River shining with reflected light . A dim light blinked from the living room . She had turned on the lamp and was fluffing her hair . " Would you like coffee ? " " Not especially . " He went toward her and took her in his arms . After a momentary stiffness she became willing and pliable . She sat on his lap in a chair and urgent messages passed between their hands and lips . Finally he said , " That damned light . " He moved her aside and got up and switched off the light . The living room became completely dark except for the distant reflected river shine . They embraced , standing in the middle of the room . " I 'd better make sure she 's asleep , " Lorraine whispered . He sat down on the sofa , waiting with terrible impatience . And50 MY NAME IS MORGANthen she was back with him . Her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He forced her back , with his weight upon her , until she was lying on the sofa . She fought free , her eyes bright-shining in darkness . " Larry . . . " " Yes ? " " Let me go . " " I ca n't . . . . I love you so .... " " I 'm afraid . I  --  I ca n't think straight when we 're together like this . Oh , Larry , " and she moaned . He felt the rapid beating of her heart . She turned her head to one side , not looking at him . He froze at a sound from the bedroom . She had not heard it , but she sensed his sudden change , and looked at him . The creaking of a bedspring . " It 's Mother . She 's awake . " She sat up , quickly , and began to rearrangeher clothes . From the next room bedsprings protested beneath a shifting heavy weight . Sibilant rustle of sheets being pushed back . Panic in the dark air . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry brushed off his clothes . He got to his feet and turned to the window as though hoping that he would not be observed with his back to where her mother would emerge . Slap-slap of slippers across the bedroom floor . He wondered whether he should turn on the light . Then he realized that sudden brightness would only make her mother aware that they had been alone in the dark . The slap-slap moved from a carpet onto bare wooden floor , whereit became louder and clearer . Larry tensed , waiting for a voice . After an interminable interval , there was the muffled slam of adoor . He turned . Lorraine was sitting on the sofa , staring at him , her hair still mussed , her face still wearing the heightened look of recent emotion . " She went into the bathroom , " she said . He nearly laughed but tension forbade him . Noisy swirl of a toilet flush , creak of a door , and the slap-slap resumed , fading at last into the familiar whine of bedsprings . He let go the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 51Lorraine nodded to him and they went back to the kitchen . Using the mirror from her purse , she began to repair her make-up . He drew a cold glass of water from the kitchen tap and drank it . Then realization hit him that their moment had passed . " Next time , " he said , " we 'll go to my place . " Lorraine finished rouging her lips . " There must n't be any next time . " He had known she would say it , yet hearing the words made him angry . " I do n't understand what your mother 's going to the bathroom has to do with the fact that we love each other . " " If you really loved me , you would n't want me to do anything I 'd be ashamed of . I do n't enjoy the feeling that we might be caught , as though love were something dirty . " " Nobody will bother us at my apartment . " " You 're trying to twist what I mean . " " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not playing to an audience . I 'm in love with you and if you 're in love with me , what 's wrong with going to bed together ? " She stared at him until mist came into her eyes and her lips began to tremble . " We 're going to be married , " she said . " Is it asking so much to wait ? " " It 's asking a lot , " he said . " In fact , it 's reversing all the rules of nature . " " You do n't really love me . " She stood in the middle of the kitchen , her hands at her sides . He waited as long as he decently could beforehe went to her and put his arm about her , and she held tightly to the lapel of his coat . " Oh , Larry , please do n't try to make me do something I know I should n't . Please ... " " All right , " he told her . " Do n't worry . It 's okay . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment slightly after two o'clock in the morning , turned on the lights , and looked challengingly about the long narrow living room with the rumpled sofa at one end , and the right-hand wall of books . Through the archway to his right he glimpsed the tiny bedroom with the still unmade bed . This night had been his last chance . The opportune moment had52 MY NAME IS MORGANpassed , and would not come again . Marriage remained . For that , he would have to wait until his partnership was assured and he could plan a reasonably stable future . He picked out a book to read and flung himself down on the sofa . After turning several pages he could not recall anything he had read . He put the book down and went to the portable bar and measured out a drink of Scotch . He sipped it until he felt the warmth in his body and began to relax . With his second drink the liquor began to work on his suppressed emotions . He poured himself another drink of Scotch and returned to hazily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of anythingexcept his need . Drawn by a fierce and elemental gravity , all thought descended to his loins . He had been faithful to Lorraine for six months , and the few girls he had known had drifted away . If he phoned one of them now , she would act cool and surprised but might agree to have a date with him in the future . Only he did n't need a girl in the future . Now . He could go to a house . There had been a place where fellows went when the hunting was lean , a brownstone on the West Side . But he did not know how to find it or whom to ask . There was no one to call . He had lost touch with the pals of his roistering days . In that circle of young bachelors marriage was considered something like a malady , a disease which narrowed down a man 's vision of the world to a workaday spectrum of procreation and toil . He found his way uncertainly to the liquor cabinet and refilled his glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell him to make a personal demand on Jack Morgan . This was risky in several ways : If nothing was wrong , Larry would bear the blame for pushing matters to a showdown . Or Earl Hollis might resentbeing forced to move out from behind the protective cover of his accountants and decide that they were incompetent because they could not handle the assignment without involving him personally . Yet the risk had to be taken ; Morgan had to be compelled to open his books . Once that was accomplished , Larry could handle the rest and keep everyone satisfied . Then he could go to Lorraine and she would melt into his arms . He pictured the wedding night . Her shy smile , complete surrender , nothing held back , nothing conquered , giving and taking sanctified . All sacraments in place , soMY NAME IS MORGAN 53clothes could come off . He could hear her deep-drawn passionate breath . He was holding his glass loosely and some liquor spilled on the carpet . He stared at it numbly , the sodden black spot fading before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! he thought . CHAPTER 5When Morgan brought Anne Allen aboard the **27;4744;TOOLONG Truly Yours at the Seventy-ninth Street basin , he arrived with an ulterior motive . Any group assembled at the Elder Barrows ' was likely to represent a net worth high in the millions and with that much money around there was always a chance . There was no way to pursue moneyed men because they were harewisewith having been pursued too long . All Morgan could do was indicate the presence of his cabbage patch and hope to entice one of the timid creatures nearer for a nibble . While this need compelled him to be here , he was uneasy as he followed Anne across the wooden pier to where the yacht was moored . He felt the instinctive wariness of a lone warrior trespassingon hostile ground . The few stars out were faint in the pale milky night sky , and they were dimmed by the immediacy and brightness of the yacht 's lights . Anne would demand all of his attention , as always , and that would complicate matters because if he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a score , of men eager to take his place . On pleasure bent , they would all consider Anne , rightly , as an ultimate challenge . He had outfaced that kind of competition too often before not to recognize its inevitability . But he wished that he did not have to contend with it again , when there were other pressing considerationson his mind . The dark body of the yacht rose , festooned with lights , before them . A crewman was waiting at the gangplank to help them aboard . The yacht Truly Yours was a meeting place for the inhabitants of two worlds  --  show business and society  --  but it was a kind54 MY NAME IS MORGANof no man 's land where both groups moved with uncustomary caution . Once , a joining of these worlds would have been as unthinkableas a knight jousting with a kitchen lackey in a tournament . But times had changed , taxes and inbreeding had done their debilitatingwork , and the one-time unreachables of society had turned to a wider world to restore their finances and their virility .

A no man 's land , truly . Those who came with open hearts , ready for pleasure , were safe . Those who came , like Morgan , lightly armoredin purpose , had to watch for the first suspicious glance , the first menacing gesture . I hope all goes well , Morgan thought . But he did not trust the hours to come . Aboard the yacht Sandra Barrow came forward with outstretched hands to greet them . As Sandra Huff , she had been the childhood victim of a great custody battle of a generation earlier . In the headlines ' aftermath Sandra 's wealthy father had refused to do more than obey the court 's injunction , so that Sandra and her mother , who eventually won custody , were reduced to a moderate income . Sandra had turned to a singing career and had graduated from the supper clubs to a brief fling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Her short-lived career was now eleven years past , but she still retained a slim youthfulness and her face , with the artful aid of cosmetics , seemed almost as beautiful as ever . " Anne , my dear , " Sandra said in a mellow , cultivated voice as she kissed Anne Allen on the cheek . " How wonderful of you to come . " She turned to offer her hand to Morgan . " Mr. Morgan . I 've heard so much about you . " " Only about a third of it is true . " " That would still make you a fascinating man . " Sandra laughed . " I 'd like you to meet my husband , Elder . " At fifty years of age Elder Barrow was still a magnetically goodlookingman in a big-faced , big-nosed fashion . When Sandra marMYNAME IS MORGAN 55ried him , he had been the most eligible of bachelors , rich , influential , a coming power in the corporation board rooms . " How about a drink ? " Elder asked . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard liquor if you prefer it . " " I 'll go along with the mob , " Morgan said , lapsing into his hardguyargot . When he was with people who considered themselves his social superiors , it was his refuge to be colorful . They repaired to a bar in the lounge , where the bartender was popping corks and pouring foaming goblets of amber . Nearby , a banquet table was spread with platters of fried chicken , broiled lobster , an earthenware crock of caviar , and huge wheels of artfullyarranged sandwiches . Elder Barrow introduced Morgan to his brother George , a smaller grayer version of himself , and then to other guests nearby . Morgan clocked off names in his mind , associated them with faces , and shook hands all around . " Here 's to Mumm 's , " said a tall gaunt man named Harvey Asbo . " A very good word . " " A very good year too , " someone added , " Good for champagne , " Morgan said . " Otherwise it stank . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went broke , " Morgan said . There was a round of slightly skeptical laughter . For most of those present , the idea of being without money was metaphysical . Only those who have worked for their money ever acknowledge , in their deepest consciousness , the possibility of losing it . But it was a good opening remark , for with it Morgan set himself up as a frank and open man and at the same time threw a line across to their cupidity : he had been broke and then had made a fortune , so he was likely to do it again . Two or three of the men with Morgan were not giving him their full attention ; occasionally they stole sidelong glances at another part of the lounge , where Anne Allen was in the center of a large group of admirers . She had been encircled with attention from the moment she came aboard , and while Morgan had expected this , it only sharpened his awareness of danger in this hostile air , this strange environment . Anne had been invited because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize worthy of social capture , and Morgan was sure he had been asked solely because he was known56 MY NAME IS MORGANto be her steady escort . He could safeguard his rights only by being constantly at her side ; and she would demand no less . As Morgan started toward Anne , he was intercepted by George Barrow and his wife , an angular woman with a severely plain face . " Mr. Morgan , " she said , thrusting herself edgewise across his intendedpath , " I 've heard you 're producing a motion picture . " Morgan answered agreeably , " My business is producing . You got ta keep rolling the dice if you hope to come up with a natural . " " Is Anne Allen going to be in it ? " she asked . " No . I never mix business with pleasure , " Morgan told her . She smiled , creases forming and disappearing in her hollowed cheeks . " Well , is it going to be good ? " Morgan shrugged . " It 'll make a potful of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's any good . " George Barrow chuckled , but an arch to his eyebrows revealed that he had gotten the message about the cabbage patch . After a while , when conversation languished with the George Barrows , Morganglanced around to see where Anne was . The people in the lounge had broken into two separate large clusters that centered around Sandra Barrow and Anne . One young man in particular dominated the male circle around Anne . He was rather tall and thickset and wore a gray semiformal jacket over a thin white silk shirt with stiff collar and cuffs . His lank yellow hair was brushed partly forward and to one side off his forehead . He was talking directly to Anne and holding forth with animation . Morgan excused himself and drifted to the bar to refill his champagne glass , and allowed himself to be drawn into the perimeter of Anne 's group . " ... You never saw such magnificent ruins , " the young man with yellow hair was saying . " Ancient blocks of stone in the moonlight . Shadowed mountains beyond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , " A perfect setting for romance . " " That all depends on the point of view , " Morgan said . The young man reluctantly turned his attention from Anne to give Morgan a slightly annoyed glance . He had a rather serious set to his jaw and a somewhat pasty complexion , and these two features kept him from being handsome . A certain assurance in his manner told Morgan he was rich , and the fact that he was verging on portliness added to his air of authority . MY NAME IS MORGAN 57 " We were talking about the Aztec ruins , " he said . " I returned from a long stay in Mexico last week . " Anne said , " Jack , where 've you been ? I 'd like you to meet Paul Beaumont . " Paul Beaumont 's plump soft hand had a surprisingly firm grip . Morgan asked , " Did you get to see the stone block where they used to spread-eagle prisoners of war ? Four priests held the prisoner'sarms and legs while the high priest ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart . " Anne shuddered . " Oooh . " " It was n't very romantic , " Morgan said . " That kind of knife makes a pretty ugly gash . Must have been a messy business . " Paul Beaumont smiled faintly while his eyes said clearly that he knew what Morgan was trying to do . " It was to make the sun rise , " Morgan continued . " The priests thought they had to offer the Sun God enough human blood or he would n't let the sun come up . I 'm not sure why they had to use an obsidian knife , though . Do you know the answer to that one , Paul ? " " I 'm not an authority on Aztec lore , " Paul Beaumont answered . " I did n't realize you knew so much about it either , Jack , " Anne said . " Honey , you 'd be surprised at the kind of stuff I louse up my mind with , " Morgan told her . Actually , he had picked up his small store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie about Montezuma . Anne gave Paul Beaumont a conciliatory glance . " Well , I 'd still like very much to go there . " " Maybe I 'll take you there sometime , " Morgan said , asserting his proprietary rights for the benefit of all within earshot . A moment later Alec Lipton , the theatrical agent , came over with Harvey Asbo . Alec said to Morgan , " Sandra Barrow was just telling us about her experiences with some movie producers she worked for . I think you know some of them , Jack . " Morgan left with them reluctantly . He knew what was happening . Sandra was suffering desertions as men drifted away toward Anne like chips to a summoning vortex and Alec Lipton and Harvey Asbo had volunteered as scouts to find suitable replacements . He stayed to talk motion picture business and politics with Elder58 MY NAME IS MORGANBarrow and Givenchy dresses with Sandra , who preferred Pepe . ( " You really must tell Anne to go there . " ) Then the conversation turned to Morgan 's production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lively interest , and Morgan was able to plant a few items , the grosses on De Mille 's Biblical epics , and the fact that foreign revenues now surpassed domestic income for the big-budget spectaculars . George Barrow edged in closer . " I suppose the budget for a motionpicture like The Apostles must run up well into the millions , " he said . " Who counts the cost of sinking an oil well , " Morgan asked , " when you know the oil is there ? " Alec Lipton convulsed with laughter and Morgan wondered why the little agent was playing up to him . Elder Barrow smiled , while his brother George 's eyes remained fixed on Morgan a second longer as though trying to divine the answer to an unasked question . Just then Morgan felt the thrumming of the yacht 's engines . " Are we getting under way ? " he asked Elder Barrow . Elder nodded . " I told the captain to cast off at any time . " Morgan said , " Anne would like to see that . Excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my homework . " Anne was now in the center of a much larger group than before , but Paul Beaumont had maintained his position at her side . Morgan shouldered a path through to Anne . " We 're getting under way , " he said . " Let 's go out on deck . " " Oh , I do n't know if I . . . " She glanced appealingly at the men around her . Morgan did not wait for their verdict but took Anne gently by the hand and led her through a channel that opened before him , across the lounge , and on to the deck . The lights of the yacht basin were starting to fall behind them and on the starboard the dark shadowed cliffs of New Jersey loomed . " I wanted to be alone with you for a while , " he said . " I have n't noticed it , " she said crossly . " I 've hardly seen you all evening . " " That 's because you 're always in the middle of a small riot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to get to see you . " She would always accept a compliment as an excuse . " Other menMY NAME IS MORGAN 59do n't seem to have any trouble , " she said . " It might be dangerous to leave me alone for too long , you know . " " I know , " Morgan said . He tried to kiss her , but she broke away quickly . " What 's the matter ? " She shivered . " It 's damp and foggy out here . I do n't want to stay long . " " I thought you 'd like a breath of fresh air . " Her look was mildly accusing . " Well , I do n't . And next time I wish you would n't try to make up my mind for me . I 'm perfectly capable of doing that for myself . " " Okay , honey . Anything you say . " She was vexed because she had been taken away from her admirers . During the brief time they remained on deck she stood beside him sullen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giant reaching arms of the piers , he brought her back inside the lounge . Several men closed in at once . Morgan , noting with relief that Paul Beaumont was not among them , surrenderedher gracefully . As soon as Morgan was alone , Alec Lipton succeeded in getting him off in a corner of the lounge . Alec 's thin mobile face reflected a friendly eagerness . " I 've got a great idea on casting for that movie of yours , Jack . Somebody different . A fresh face . " " I have n't got around to casting yet , " Morgan said shortly . He could not waste time in conversation with Alec . " I 'll give you a sensational idea for Mary Magdalene , " Alec said . " Somebody you 'd never think of . But she 's absolutely perfect . She 'll make a real impact on an audience . " " You ca n't sell me any of your kids , Alec . " " The woman I 've got in mind for the Mary Magdalene part has been around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she 's unknown to the movie-goers of today , so she 'll be a new face to them . Plus she 's got the spiritual depth to really project in a role like Mary Magdalene . " " I 'll bite . Who is she ? " " Sandra Barrow . " Morgan stared at him and in that instant all the small pieces fitted into the puzzle , the real reason he and Anne Allen had been invited on this cruise , the unusual interest in his production of The Apos-6o MY NAME IS MORGANties , the convulsive friendliness of Alec Lipton , and even , in part , the receptivity of George Barrow . Sandra Barrow had not entirely abandoned her theatrical ambitions . " Are you kidding ? " Morgan asked . " Why should I kid you , Jack ? What 's the matter with Sandra ? She 's got looks , acting experience ... " " She never acted in anything except corny musicals and that was a dozen years ago . She 's a clotheshorse . " Alec warmed to his task . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's got depth and brains and talent . With the right kind of director . . . " I remember one of her reviews . They said she projected as much emotion as a Gutzon Borglum stone face . And that nobody short of God could make her into a decent actress . " " You know the critics , " Alec said deprecatingly . " Besides , she was a lot younger then , Jack . She 's lived . " He waited , with the attitudeof a man about to play his trump card , then he said : " There 's a couple of angles in this deal might interest you . " " Yeah ? " Morgan said , with calculated disinterest . " I 'll level with you . Sandra would like to make a comeback in the movies . Her husband does n't even know about this . But if you offered her the Mary Magdalene part , there 'd be an open door to investment from Elder Barrow and his banker friends . " " In other words , " Morgan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her way into my movie . " Alec answered with confiding warmth , " You 've got to admit it makes sense , Jack . I 'm not talking out of school , but everybody knows that with a big budget like you 've got , even Sam Goldwyn could find himself strapped . " Alec had left a polite opening for a partial confession . Morgan wondered how much Alec knew about his financial difficulties  --  probably no more than rumors . But in the world of show business , which deals so little with facts , rumors were acceptable currency . Trading in them had to be stopped . " I know that ten-percenters have onions in their heads , " Morgan said . " But you got enough to make a soup . " Alec was startled . " I did n't mean to say you were in any trouble , Jack , but . . . " Listen , " Morgan told him , " when I want to crumb up a movieMY NAME IS MORGAN 6iI 'll do it my own way . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so happens I 've got all the money I need . But even if I did n't , Sandra Barrow could n't buy the part of Mary Magdalene for a milliondollars cash . " Alec blinked nervously . " I think you 're making a big mistake , Jack . I really do . " " - Now we 're straightened out , " Morgan said , " I 'll tell you what I will do . Strictly because you 're a friend of mine . I 'll let Sandra test for the Mary Magdalene part  --  just like anybody else . If she 's as good as you say she is , she 'll get it . But no promises . And no tie-in deals with Elder Barrow 's money . " Alec 's eyes widened . He was impressed . " I understand . " He touched Morgan 's arm gratefully . " Thanks , pal . Let 's have lunch together next week . And if I can ever do you a favor . . . " Forget it , " Morgan said . After Alec Lipton departed Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was some kind of an enthusiast on the subject , and this broadened out to a discussion of the annual race at Cannes in which one of the guests had competed in a specially designed racing car . An hour passed before Morgan was able to break away and go out on deck . A gray mist lay close to the black glistering water and deep runningswells were veining white . The yacht 's deck was unsteady and damp underfoot . He had not seen Anne in the lounge , and he went almost completely around the deck before he saw her , with Paul Beaumont , about a dozen feet away , leaning over the rail and talking . Their heads were close together . Morgan watched them for a moment but they were too intent on each other to notice his presence . He went over to them . " I 've been looking for you , honey , " he said . Anne turned , slightly flustered . " Oh , hello , Jack . " " It 's still pretty damp and foggy out here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a breath of air and we got talking . I was telling him about life in Hollywood . " She smiled gaily . " He thinks it 's some kind of never-never land . " Paul Beaumont slowly uncoiled from the yacht 's rail . His lank yellow hair was wet with spray. 62 MY NAME IS MORGAN " I never believed most of what I read about Hollywood , " he said in his rather high , pleasantly nasal voice . " But Anne makes it all seem believable . " " She 's pretty good at that , " Morgan said . Paul Beaumont said patronizingly , " It 's quite a different world from the one I 'm used to . " " What kind of a world is that ? " " Oh , I work in a brokerage firm . I 'm learning the ropes . " " He 's being modest , " Anne said . " His father is Peter Beaumont of Beaumont , Wylie and Fletcher . Even I 've heard of them . " " It must be nice , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Paul Beaumont glanced at him rather sharply before he returned his attention to Anne . Morgan understood the young man 's bedazzlement . A beautiful movie star like Anne Allen was like a brightly plumed peacock fluttering down into Paul Beaumont 's arid world of board rooms , drab business , and sumptuously dull parties . Morgan put his hands on the railing and listened to Anne 's aimlesschatter for a moment . Paul Beaumont casually mentioned a stud farm in Normandy , a house in Palm Beach , and a villa on Lake Como . " My father is an internationalist , " Paul said . " He likes to be a good citizen of all countries and so he builds houses there rather than rent apartments . " Staring at the black water , Morgan said , " I 've never had anythingagainst inheriting money . But I feel a little sorry for rich boys . They never find out how much fun it is to make it on your own . " Paul Beaumont said , " We all ca n't be born poor , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel coming to the surface . Morgan said , " Anybody can let money pile up by putting it in a bank and letting compound interest take over . But when you have to scratch for it , money is a good way of measuring whether you 've got what it takes . " " You seem to have a lot of respect for money , Mr. Morgan , " Paul Beaumont observed . " Just a way of keeping score , " Morgan said . " That 's not the way I heard it . " " What do you mean by that ? " Paul Beaumont 's smile remained deprecating while his pale eyes leveled with insult . " It 's been rumored , Mr. Morgan , that you'reMY NAME IS MORGAN 63fairly free with other people 's money when it 's invested in one of your enterprises . Has anyone ever made a profit with you ? " " Now that , " Morgan replied heavily , " is the kind of rumor I would n't like to get around . It so happens that a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says anything else , I 'll call him a damn liar to his face . " Paul Beaumont 's pale smile stayed fixed with skepticism . Anne quickly held up her empty glass . " Oh , dear , I need a refill , " she said . " Let me get it for you , " Paul Beaumont volunteered before he realized that his offer would remove him from her presence . " Would n't you like to come inside ? It is getting chilly out here . " Anne gave Morgan a questioning glance . Morgan slipped out of his jacket and put it around Anne 's shoulders . " She 'll be all right . " Paul promised , " I 'll be back in a minute . " He left and Morgan put his arm about Anne and turned her so they were looking out at the dark waves of the water . The moon scudded among thin black wisps of cloud . " You 're jealous , " she said . She drew closer to his shoulder . " You really should n't worry about Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much too young . Even if I were interested . " " He 's at least eight years older than you are . " " Oh , but he 's ever so much younger , really . He 's a boy . " " A rich boy , " Morgan said . " That makes a difference . " " Why ? " " Rich boys are dangerous . They 're used to getting what they want . " She giggled . " You are jealous , " she said . " You do n't have any reason to be . We 're practically engaged and everyone knows that . " Morgan looked at her thoughtfully . " You ca n't help being what you are , " he said . " Probably the most beautiful woman in the world . And men ca n't help making passes at you either . All I do is try to keep my eye on the most dangerous ones . " " Take Paul Beaumont off your list . He definitely is n't my type . " Her effort to divert his attention from Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of assurance that might carry him a long way with Anne , whose need was to rely on someone stronger and surer than herself. 64 MY NAME I S MORGANElder Barrow came out on the deck . " I hope you 're not going to be selfish , " he said to Morgan , " and keep her entirely to yourself . " " We were just coming back inside , " Morgan said . They returned to a party that was gaining momentum . Just insidethe doorway Anne was swallowed into a devouring circle of men . Morgan wandered with Elder Barrow to the bar , where they had a drink together , and then Elder left and Morgan casually looked around for someone he could attach himself to . George Barrow saw that he was alone and came over . " Enjoying the party ? " George asked . " Depends on where you sit . " George smiled . " A theater expression ? " Morgan nodded . " Yeah . Whether or not you enjoy a play depends on where your seat is . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm enjoying my favorite star . " George Barrow followed Morgan 's gaze to where Anne Allen was now seated on a sofa , with four eager young men around her and Paul Beaumont safely relegated to the background . " She 's lovely , " George said . " I really had n't expected her to be more beautiful than she is on the screen . " " The camera gets a lot of it . But there 's something no camera ever gets . " " " I agree , " George said . " I only saw her in one motion picture  --  something about a girl in a logging camp . The movie was atrocious , but she was unforgettable . " " That was Reap the Whirlwind . I 've seen all Anne 's movies , some of them two or three times . Unforgettable is the word for her . " He remembered the crowded set where he first saw Anne Allen in person , the cables and cameras everywhere , the babble of commands , interjections , shouts . Anne was playing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in costume as a chorus girl in a nightclubline . Among the other girls she stood out like a lighted Christmastree in a forest . He had not seen her again , except on the screen , for almost two years . In the meantime she had married  --  at nineteen  --  a French actor almost twice her age and divorced him six months later . Morganmet her just before her twenty-first birthday at a party at Ben Sturm 's house . At that time she had seemed almost too beautiful . MY NAME IS MORGAN 65The loveliness of most women only makes a gradual impression  --  complexion , eyes , lips , face , hair , all come together to form a picture ; but with Anne the total impact was clear in a second , simple and overwhelming as a knockout blow . He had asked her for a date at that party and she had refused him , and the next day he had sent her a roomful of roses . He was already in love with her , his desire multiplied and reinforced by that need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George Barrow said musingly , " It 's no wonder so many men fall in love with her . " Morgan grinned ruefully . " If everything goes according to schedule , she 'll probably have a couple of proposals by tomorrow . " Ever since he had become Anne 's chief suitor , he had been aware that he could never be sure of her . Beauty like hers was a public possession . George Barrow chuckled . " If I were n't a married man , I 'd probablypropose to her myself . " " That should n't stop you , " Morgan said . " I was a married man myself when I first proposed to her . " He had proposed on their very first date , and regularly thereafter , and that was when he discovered that Anne was a pliant girl to whom nothing verbal meant much . She gave him every indication that she loved him  --  except one . She was tongue dutiful and mouth obedient , like a hypocritical child who would still follow the course of her balky whims . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in themselves , that only when put in the proper order could spell out the true alphabet of her meaning . When he tried to pursue her to the hard dimensional reality of actionand response , she refused him . George Barrow asked , " And did she say yes ? I mean , when you proposed to her ? " " She said maybe , " Morgan told him . That was the truth . She had been receptive to his proposal on a certain level , which allowed him to ply her with presents and conducta fantastically expensive courtship . She had reminded him of the difference in their ages . When finally she accepted him as a principal suitor , she would not allow him the expected privileges of a lover . " After all , Jack , you still are a married man "  --  which66 MY NAME IS MORGANmeant that she was not going to sleep with him , but he could continue to woo her with his extravagance . George Barrow said , " She 'd make a wonderful star for your next production . Real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . " Morgan thought , the hare is nibbling in the cabbage patch . " She 's not the type , " he answered carefully . " Besides , this movie I 'm making does n't need any insurance . It 's going to be too good . " " Is n't there always the danger that you 'll be over the heads of your audience ? " " Do you think the Bible is over the heads of its audience ? " " No . That 's a good point . " " This movie has the biggest theme of all time . The men who followed Christ . What kind of men were they ? It will be the story of their lives , their dreams , their failures , their triumphs . " " I 'd like to hear more . " " Why not ? I have n't got any secrets . " They went onto the starboard deck and sat in chairs next to each other and in half an hour George Barrow was inquiring about the possibilities of investment . Morgan carefully promised nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Barrow . " Actually , " Morgan said , " there 's never any shortage of capital for a deal of this kind . It 's easier to raise ten million dollars than a million . But I 'm pretty sure it 's going to be the biggest money-maker ever known and I do n't mind letting a few people I know into the deal . " " I appreciate that , " George told him . When they returned to the lounge , Anne was on the sofa but Paul Beaumont was no longer in the background . He was talking to her while the other men were scattered about in a disorganized , defeated fashion . Anne 's luminous eyes were fixed on Paul Beaumontin a stare that meant she was more than a little drunk , but which Paul obviously found enchanting . Morgan excused himself to George Barrow and crossed the lounge toward them . Paul Beaumont saw him approaching and Morgan crossed through an area that was mined with Paul 's resistance . " Hi , " Morgan said . " I see you two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling , " Anne said vaguely , lifting her hand in an uncertaingesture . Morgan took it and drew her unprotesting to her feet . MY NAME IS MORGAN 67 " I 'm going to reclaim her for a while , " Morgan said to Paul Beaumont . " You do n't mind ? " Someone had put a samba record on the hi-fi , and two or three couples were already dancing . Morgan led Anne onto the floor , where she floated sinuously into his arms . She was a fluent dancer , and Morgan found it difficult to keep up with her . He knew the steps , but he moved with a mechanical forcefulness that meshed badly with her expert grace . " I 'm having a wonderful time , " Anne said . " Is n't it a wonderful party ? " " It 's okay . I 'm glad you 're enjoying yourself . " " Sandra 's been so sweet to me . She 's even sending me to her favorite dress designer , Pepe . She buys all her own things there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , " Morgan said . She leaned her head back . " I wish this could keep on forever . Champagne and dancing and people enjoying themselves . I wish tomorrow would never come . " " If you do n't stop with the champagne , you 're going to have quite a hangover in the morning . " She made a rebuking face . " Spoilsport . You know I never have hangovers . " She was right . Hangovers were only for old and tired people , in whom the resiliency of youth was no longer working . He felt old enough when he said , " Just the same , I think you 've had enough for one night . " Before she could reply , someone tapped Morgan on the shoulder . George Barrow was standing almost beside him , with his angularwife jutting into him . " I suppose you know you 're the envy of every man here . But you wo n't object to letting me have her for one dance ? " " Just do n't make it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the dance with George Barrow 's wife , and discovered that her name was Edna and she had three children and a cocker spaniel and a darling Siamese cat and the servant problem in Westchester was getting worse all the time . They stopped at the bar for a drink and she went on talking with the compulsive force of a released coil spring . Morgan kept a covert eye on the dance floor where George Barrow had been forced to relinquish68 MY NAME IS MORGANAnne to a younger man . Then there was a Sinatra recording , but Edna Barrow said that she was not interested , she was having much too interesting a discussion with him and dancing was just a little bit silly for people their age , was n't it ? Morgan saw that Paul Beaumont had claimed Anne on the dance floor and Anne was keeping her eyes closed as she swayed in time to the music . Sinatra always put her into a romantic mood and Paul Beaumont was an excellent dancing partner ; he moved with her in an intuitive union . Harvey Asbo gallantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan could escape , George Barrow came up . " Ever done any pigeon shooting ? " he asked . " What ? " Morgan was half-listening as he watched Paul Beaumontand Anne on the dance floor . " Elder brought a hundred live pigeons aboard . They 'll release them at eleven o'clock tomorrow morning . Aft deck . If you 've never tried it before , you might enjoy it . Pigeon shooting is very popular in Spain and Monte Carlo , you know . " Morgan reluctantly turned toward him . " I 've never fired a gun in my life . " " We use a twelve-gauge shotgun . Fires a perfect hail of buckshot . You do n't need to be a sharpshooter . " " It 's not my line . " " Would you care for a game of bridge ? " George asked . He was trying to be agreeable . " I do n't play it " " Gin rummy ? " " Poker is my game . " He glimpsed Paul and Anne again , whirling and whirling like a handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can get together five or six of us for a game in the cardroom . Reasonable stakes . What do you say ? " " I do n't know .... " " Elder will play , and so will Harvey Asbo and Paul Beaumont . ... " George hesitated , trying to think of others . But the mention of Paul Beaumont was sufficient . There was no danger if Paul played too . Morgan shrugged . " What have I got to lose ? " MY NAME IS MORGAN 69George Barrow went to work at once and rounded up four other players . Paul Beaumont resisted until Anne said that if he played , she would watch . They began playing at a reasonable limit , but Morgan asked for table stakes and then the game began to get interesting . After the first few minutes of play Anne became bored and drifted away from the table . Harvey Asbo and Paul Beaumont were the big early winners , but after the first hour Paul Beaumont started to play indifferently and lost his winnings back . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've had it for tonight , " he announced . " My luck ran out . " He went across the cardroom to where Anne was seated , leafing through a fashion magazine . Morgan , without seeming to take his eyes from his cards , watched Paul Beaumont sit down beside Anne . He would have to break that up in a few minutes . " What 's your bid ? " someone asked . " Oh . " Morgan glanced over the cards in his hand . " A hundred , " he said . They brought fresh drinks around and by then everyone had managed to switch from champagne . Encouraged and warmed by liquor , Morgan played with more than his usual flamboyance , makingthe cards go further than they had a right to . He thought he could risk a few more rounds before joining Anne . He won a few early pots but others at the table realized by then that he was playinghis character rather than his cards and began taking advantage of his gaudy gestures . " Deal me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beaumont and Anne were deep in conversation . " This is my pot . " Red-backed cards slicked down upon a green cloth . Under the bright overhead light Morgan knew the others were watching him as he picked up cards from the table one by one . His face , carefullyschooled , revealed nothing . In the center of the round table the pile of varicolored chips grew to alarming size . There was nearly four thousand dollars in this pot and Morgan wanted badly to win it. 70 MY NAME IS MORGANAnne came over to the table . " I 'm tired and I 'm going to bed , " she announced . Morgan felt as though a weight had been lifted from him . " What time is it , honey ? " " Almost five o'clock , " Harvey Asbo volunteered . They had been playing for two hours . Outside the porthole he saw a multitude of winking shore lights and realized they had passed the Rockaways and were nearly abreast of the familiar shore of Coney Island . " I 'll quit after this round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll be asleep by then . " She smiled . " Do n't take all their money , darling . " Morgan put the cards together and sifted them apart so he could see the corners . He took the cigar out of his mouth and tapped an inch of ash into the tray at his elbow . He had made the same gesture when he was holding a king-high straight and there might be someone who would notice . " I 'll see it , " he said slowly , reaching into the chip compartment before him , " and raise five hundred . " George Barrow smiled thinly . He pushed his chips into the center of the table . " I 'll stay , " he said . Harvey Asbo studied his cards , chewing his lip . His thin , graying hair was disordered and there was an uncontrolled look in his eyes . He had been winning through the early part of the game , and was still ahead even though luck had turned against him . He was starting to play recklessly in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and raise a thousand , " he said finally . Once again the bidding went the rounds , and everyone stayed except Alec Lipton . Now there was twelve thousand dollars in the pot . " Three queens , " Harvey Asbo said , tossing his cards down with affected negligence on the green cloth . The cards spread out , roughly fanwise , with the three queens staring up from the center . Elder Barrow topped Harvey with a flush in diamonds , nine high . Two others at the table sighed and tossed in their cards . With a questioning glance at George Barrow , Morgan spread his five pasteboardscarefully on the green cloth . " Full house , " he said . MY NAME IS MORGAN 71For a second , George Barrow did not reply . Then he gently shook his head . " I 've got four of a kind . " He showed the four sixes and , almost apologetically , reached over to take the pot . " That 's the big hand of the evening , " someone said enviously . Morgan examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on these if my luck does n't change . " He signaled the steward to bring another Scotch highball . Alec Lipton stretched his arms . " That just about cleaned me out . If I had any sense , I 'd quit . " George Barrow , dealing , held up . " Well ? " " Who said I had any sense ? " Alec asked innocently . " I 'm in . " Morgan finished his drink and pushed back his chair . " I 'm going out for a breath of fresh air . I need it after that one . " George Barrow nodded , barely interrupting the smooth rhythm of dealing cards to skip the place where Morgan had been seated . Harvey Asbo said , " Come back soon , Jack . You 're the only one losing more than I am . I need somebody around to give me con-fidence . " Morgan waved his cigar and strolled casually away . More than seven thousand dollars , he thought blurrily . He should never have gone into the game tonight , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . A few thousand was available from petty cash in the office . That was all . He would have to give George Barrow and the others a check and there was not seven thousand dollars left in his personal account . Draw from the corporation ? Damn young accountant would be snooping around and that was just the sort of item he would pick up and question . Emerging onto the deck was like coming from stifling depths of ocean into air again . He felt the cold shock and then a dizzy lightheadedness . Too many drinks had left him not quite in control of himself and his step was unsteady on the planks . The sobering image of Larry Whirter came to him , a tall young man with cold eyes and briefcase loaded like cannon . One of the faceless young men with the comptometer minds , clicking and cold , black and white , add or subtract . They had no background in the past , no human ties , no vulnerable point against which to mount an attack . It was like warring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladder to the deck of the wheelhouse , above the battle . The moon had freed itself from the fleecy grip of clouds and rode high and full in the heavens . The air was fresh with salt and had invigorating bite . He blinked his eyes to clear the grainy dryness . " Paul . Do n't ! " The voice seemed to come from directly beneath him . He went to the railing and looked forward . In a lounge chair , in the shadows near the prow , he saw two indistinct figures . Anne 's face was briefly revealed in moonlight . She was half encircled by Paul Beaumont , who was in the chair with her , his arms about her . Wind whipped her voice clearly back to him . " I do n't ever want you to do that again , " she said . Paul Beaumont said something inaudible . " No , " she answered . Quickly , Morgan went back to the ladder and descended to the main deck . By that time Paul Beaumont and Anne had already left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led down to the cabins . Paul was holding Anne 's arm and talking swiftly . A shadow fell athwart the deck as the moon passed behind a cloud , and just as its black length enveloped them , Morgan saw Paul Beaumont take Anne into his arms . Morgan stopped , swaying slightly with the motion of the yacht . They were close together for a dozen heartbeats before they separatedand Anne went down the stairwell alone . Paul Beaumont turned , slowly , to the deck railing and took a cigarette from his pocket . A cherry-red glow punctured the night . Gray smoke rose and hazily flowed backward almost into Morgan 's face as he crossed the deck to him . Paul Beaumont heard his footsteps coming and turned . " Oh , hullo . " " I 'm looking for Anne , " Morgan said . " I believe she went below . " " You know damn well she did . I watched you just a few minutes ago . " " Did you ? " Morgan spoke carefully so that no syllable would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne . This time it 's just a warning . Next time I 'll do something about it . " MY NAME IS MORGAN 73 " Will you ? " Paul Beaumont asked insolently . Morgan clenched his fist and took a step forward . Paul Beaumont flipped his cigarette , tumbling red toward the water below . " I should tell you , " he said calmly , " that I 've boxed a bit at college . I 'm out of condition now but I 'm quite sure it will not be an equal match . " " You do n't scare me , " Morgan said , and swung . At that moment the yacht pitched forward and the sudden slant of the deck caused Morgan to miss badly . He stumbled , tried to regain his balance , and fell heavily against the railing . Paul Beaumonthad moved aside to take the blow on his shoulder if it came . He looked at Morgan , lying partly on his back , with one hand gripping the lower bar of the deck rail . " This could get awfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Morgan . " He walked off , not too quickly , leaving opportunity for Morgan to follow if he insisted . Morgan pulled his legs up beneath him and stood erect , balancing with the deck beneath his feet . Paul Beaumont'stall shadow left the moonlight and joined the darkness . The desire to run after Paul Beaumont quivered into stillness along Morgan 's nerves . His heart trembled and his breath came fast as he realized how quickly this encounter had developed into farce . A sudden weariness assailed him , a heavy lassitude that invaded his chest and ran like sheets of numbing ice through the rest of his body . He held to the railing as he made his way uncertainlyalong the deck and descended the stairwell . In the cabin he closed the door , locking himself into safety . He lay down on the bed with his clothes on , not bothering to turn on the lights , staring at the wavering dark ceiling until he turned onto his back and invited sleep . At last a restless drowsiness came over him and suddenly deepened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear light blue sky outside his porthole , removed his shoes , and promptly fell asleep again . Sharp noise wakened him . He sat upright and heard the noise again like a semidistant clap of thunder . He glanced at his watch and the dial pointed to a few minutes past eleven o'clock . Then he remembered . George Barrow had mentioned a pigeon shoot . He groaned , swung out of bed , and stumbled to the washbasin . The blasting noise came at regular intervals . In the cabinet74 MY NAME IS MORGANbehind the washbasin mirror he found shaving supplies neatly paralleled on a shelf . He shaved and showered , ending with needlelikecold playing on his chest and face . In a closet he found slacks and a T-shirt on gleaming curved wooden hangers . A short while later when he went out onto the deck , Elder Barrow greeted him . Elder was trim and natty in his yachting outfit and visored cap . Morgan had to shield his eyes from the dazzling sunlight . Everyone was gathered on the aft deck . Anne was wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs were bare to above the knee , and her skin was tanned . She wore a bright ribbon around her loose hair . Morgan had hoped to speak to her alone this morning but Paul Beaumont was with her . As Morgan approached , unnoticed , Paul Beaumont said something that made Anne laugh . The shotgun dinned . Morgan winced . " God ! Ca n't they put silencers on that damn gun ? " Anne turned to see him and her look of pleasure was unfeigned . She moved a step away from Paul Beaumont toward him . " Jack , darling , this is the most thrilling sport . " She kissed his cheek lightly . " Did you sleep well ? " He looked at her . " Until they started launching missiles off the pad . For a minute I thought it was Cape Canaveral . " The gun thundered . " They never miss , " Anne said . " It 's really remarkable . " The shooting was taking place from a wooden gunstand about ten feet back from the rail , facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled several large wire-mesh cages , each holding ten pigeons in compartments . At a signal a sailor would pull a string that collapsed one of the compartments , frightening the pigeon into flight . The pigeon soared up , fell swiftly astern . Hanging almost motionless in mid-air , the bird made a perfect target for the gunners . Elder Barrow finished his shots , and there was a minute 's hesitation . " Would you care to take over ? " Elder asked , offering the shotgun to Morgan . " No , thanks . I 'll watch . " " I 'll have a go at it , " Paul Beaumont volunteered . He took his place in the gunstand , waiting with shotgun at the ready . MY NAME IS MORGAN 75Elder Barrow , big and confident , stood beside Morgan and Anne . His gray hair fluffed out at the temples , which somehow added to his solid , magisterial air . " We 're observing Monte Carlo rules , " he said . " Each gunner is assured of one shot . If he misses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is entitled to keep shooting until he 's bagged his score of ten . " " You did n't miss once , " Anne said . " I watched you . " Harvey Asbo , standing nearby , smiled . " Elder won the Grand Prix de Monaco for two years running , " he said . Paul Beaumont shouted , " Pull ! " and the sailor collapsed the cage . A pigeon fluttered up , awkwardly . There was a blasting reportfrom the twelve-gauge , and the bird quivered in a hail of buckshotand plummeted into the sea . " Bravo , Paull " Anne shouted , clapping her hands . Twice more the scene was repeated . On the fourth try the pigeon took off slowly and erratically , fought to gain altitude while frantically beating its wings , then glided down into the foaming wake of the yacht and was lost without a shot being fired . " What was the matter with that one ? " Morgan asked . Elder shrugged . " Their tail feathers have been removed . That makes them fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary altitude . " " And they drown ? " " Of course . We do n't count it against the shooter , however . He 's entitled to another bird . " " Pigeon does n't get much of a shake , does he ? " " It 's not as easy as it looks . Why do n't you take a turn and see for yourself ? " Paul Beaumont missed his next shot . Before Morgan could object , Elder took the shotgun and gave it to him . " Go ahead . " " No , " Morgan said . " Jack , " Anne protested . " Do n't be a bad sport . " Morgan felt the heft of the shotgun as he stepped to the stand , put the stock firmly against his shoulder , and waited . His heart was beating strongly . The palms of his hands were wet . " Pull , " he said . He blinked at the black fluttering shape of the pigeon against the76 MY NAME IS MORGANlemon-yellow sky . His finger pulled the trigger and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape , still fluttering , was now farther away and fading . " Too bad , old man , " Elder Barrow said . " It 's your first try . Have another go at it . " Morgan started to shake his head , then saw Paul Beaumont watching with an amused smile . He returned to the stand , held the shotgun firmly in place , and squinted . " Pull . " This time the burst of shot was like tiny ink dots staining a space below the flapping bird . " Keep at it , " Elder Barrow said . " You were closer that time . It 's hard to get the knack of it , at first . " He missed a third and fourth time and after his last miss , by a wide margin , he heard a tittering laugh . His hands had stopped perspiring but his face felt hot and his shoulder was sore from the bucking of the shotgun . Anne came up to him . " I think you should stop now . " She looked worried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the gunstand before he resumed his stance , with the gun ready . He had begun to feel a dislikeof the pigeons . He had a mental picture of the next one , quivering , mortally struck , in a fatal stream of shot from his gun , and with definite pleasure he imagined its soft plump body hurtling into the sea . Still holding that picture he called " Pull ! " and moved the gun muzzle along with the slow-flying bird that staggered upward towardfreedom . As he slowly squeezed the trigger he muttered an imprecation beneath his breath . A roar assailed his ears and he knew he had missed . Sandra Barrow said something Morgan did not hear and someoneelse laughed aloud . Elder Barrow was smiling genially as he came toward him . " Would you like me to show you how it 's done ? " " Never mind . I 'll figure it out myself . " Elder Barrow inclined his head , backed away , and stood there , his hands in his pockets , smiling . When Morgan missed his next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide grin . MY NAME IS MORGAN 77 " Care to try again , sir ? " Morgan nodded . He was afraid to turn to look at Anne because that might weaken his resolution . The wooden stock of the shotgun felt comforting against his hand . In this unfriendly world , the gun and he were allies , sharing the same objective . If only he could hit one of the damned birds ! He would make a joke of it then , turn to the crowd and say something like , " That one must have been asking for it , " or " I was just practicing before . That 's the one I was really after . " Everyone would laugh with him , sharing the release from the mounting tension of failure after failure . But he had reached the point of no return . If he quit now , he would force them to laugh at him , or to feel sorry for him , far worse than laughter . If he kept on , and missed , the situation would dissolveinto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good manners . " Pull , " he said . This time he fired before the bird had flown ten feet from the cage . The hail of shot barely cleared the aft rail and sped out along the widening foam of the yacht 's wake . Borne upward on the suddenrush of air , the pigeon fluttered aloft , circled , and tried to return to the deck . But without its tail feathers , its progress was slow , and it fell steadily farther and farther behind , beating its wings against the slipstream of air , sinking lower and lower toward the waves below . He saw it touch the crest of a wave and then disappearlike a stone . " Eight out of eight , " intoned a voice . " Drowned . " Laughter ran around the circle of onlookers . The sailor at the cage glanced nervously around to make sure that he would not be reprimanded , and his narrow shoulders shook . " Oh , Jack "  --  Morgan heard Anne 's voice clearly  --  " for heaven 's sake . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring straight ahead , and something about his grim attitude discouraged the growth of hilarity . " Pull , " Morgan said . The sailor collapsed a box , a pigeon took startled wing , and the shotgun bammed . Paul Beaumont said , " We should throw them a life raft . " Morgan heard Anne laugh , an involuntary sound that choked off78 MY NAME I S MORGANabruptly . Quiet desperation had taken command of him now . He felt as though he were throwing his body hopelessly against an iron gate , and he could not stop hurling himself at it until someone came to his rescue . " Pull , " he commanded . This time his shot was so far wide of the mark that there was an involuntary gasp from the watching crowd . His shoulder ached with a pain he welcomed because it kept part of his mind occupied with a problem other than his humiliation . He bit his lower lip to keep it from trembling . Just then he felt a touch on his arm . Elder Barrow was beside him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ten is the limit for each gunner . " In another tone this might have been a sarcasm , but Morganknew what charity was meant . Elder Barrow put his arm about himand for an instant Morgan welcomed the salvation being offered . Then he shook his shoulder free . " I 'd like to try again . " Elder Barrow hesitated , and the sailor at the pigeon cages lookedto him for guidance . A spurt of laughter that began at the fringes ofthe crowd perished in the hot , still air . Morgan stepped back to the gunstand and put the wooden handle of the shotgun against his shoulder . " Pull , " he said . The sailor did not move until he glanced at Elder Barrow , who nodded , then he collapsed the wire cage and the pigeon leaped aloft . The bird moved quickly and there was no chance for Morgan to hit it . Silence surrounded him . He was in a world entirely his own , a world of a gun and a pigeon and a single resolve . " Pull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pull . " Miss . All the effort of his will went into transforming the unspeakable fate that thwarted him . He would not fail this time . " Pull . " MY NAME IS MORGAN 79Miss . He had , for an eternity , been unable to think of Anne , standing behind him , with Paul Beaumont . If there were some sacrifice , some promise he could make to the One who controlled the uncapricious actions of the world . Oh , God . On another occasion he had called upon Him . That was a long time ago . He had asked God to make a proof to him of His existence and God had ignored him then . Where was He now ? " Pull . " A bird fluttered directly into his sights and he pulled the trigger . In his eagerness he forgot to squeeze slowly , and the slight jerk on the gun threw off his aim . The blast of the shot knocked the pigeon aside and he kept willing it to go down as it fluttered sidewise away from the yacht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing again and rose upward in thin spirals over the endless ocean as the yacht pulled steadily away from it . " Pull . " Miss . Those watching were past laughter , past pity . They watched with awe as he tried again and again with monomaniacal earnestness . At last someone cleared his throat in embarrassment . George Barrowmade a gesture to his brother , but Elder Barrow turned his palms up helplessly . It was in the hands of Fate . Morgan put the gun carefully on the stand and waited . His shoulderwas ablaze with pain and he could taste salt blood in his mouth from where he had bitten the inside of his cheek . His voice was rasped . " Pull . " " Oh , Jack , for God 's sake , stop it ! " That was Anne , sounding almost hysterical . If he turned to look at her , he would be lost . He would be subject to the laws of the world where no one acted this way , and where others ' opinions were to be weighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible run of luck . He had lost every cent he had with him and exhausted his credit . Leaving the casino , he found a two-dollar bill tucked into a flap of his wallet along with his identification card . That was his lucky bill and it seemed ironic that he should have found it at the lowest point of his fortunes . Then he realized what good luck it was , for without it he did not have enough money to pay8o MY NAME IS MORGANfor a taxi back to his hotel . But as he went out the entrance of the casino and down the wide stone steps to where the taxis waited , he had a change of mind . He went back and bought two one-dollar chips and put them on a number at the roulette table . Everyone was staring at him , knowing how much he had lost and that this was all the money he had . He had a feeling of terrible , splendid aloneness , of being in a foreign land , far from home or help , far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He staked his last chips and he won , and won again , and an hour later he left the casino with four thousand dollars in his pocket . That had happened , and it was the sort of thing that might always happen if a man had the will to go on . The will is everything ; it is the fundamentalto which a man is stripped when all other things buffet him without mercy , when hope is gone and pride is gone , and the final remnants of humanity , except this : that he will endure . That he will , at all costs and through everything , endure . " Pull . " The bird fluttered aloft , and the recoil of the gun against his shoulder was raw to tortured nerves . He had ceased to look and so he did not see , but heard , the collective indrawn breath of the watchers . Then he caught a glimpse of the shattered bird with feathers scattering in the air as it death-dived into the green and white burial vault of water . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . He turned and handed the gun to Elder Barrow , who was nearest , and he noddedto the sailor at the cages . " Thanks , " he said . Without another word he left the stand and went through the silent crowd . They parted a little to make way for him , understandinga little of his bitter and solitary triumph . He was lying face upright on the bed in his cabin when the knock came . For a moment he did not answer . He had been gathering strength from the walls and ceiling of this tiny cubicle where he was dimensionally removed from contact with reality . Then all distorted perspectives slid back to normal , the doorfell slantwise into place , and his bed slowly settled to the floor . " Jack ? " a voice inquired beyond the door . " Are you there ? " " Yes . " MY NAME IS MORGAN 8i " I 've been looking for you . You did n't come down to lunch . " Lunch had been three hours ago . He had heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left his cabin . A strength had gone out of him in his ordeal at the gunstand and he had not yet replenishedit . He lay in a stupor below the levels of response , wondering what was the matter with him . " Jack ? " " Yes . " " Are you all right ? " The handle of the locked door clicked . " It 's a beautiful afternoon . Paul and I have been sunning on deck . " Rude anger routed the last particle of energy from him , broke up the image of her for which he had roused himself , and flung the fragments away . " I 'm sleepy . I 'm going to take a nap . " " You 're not upset about this morning , " she said . " Are you ? " " Of course not . " " All right , then . The captain promised to show us around the engine room . Would you like to come along ? " He started the effort to rise and then discovered bitterly that he could not ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have a good time , " he said . The light flutter of footsteps moved off down the corridor . Let them poke through the grime and slime , spoil and stain her with the ineradicable grease of engines . ( Oh , dear , look what I 've done . ) The dark smudge on her dress grew larger with rubbing and no cries of protest or alarm availed her . The smudge widened across his horizon and became the first bluedark of sleep , and in oblivion the events of the night and day lost their substance and became charged instead with emotion . He was very , very tired . He rolled over on his back and lay spread-eagled , in the heat of a blazing alien sun , while four priests held his arms and his legs and an obsidian knife began tearing at his heart . After resting until dinnertime he felt a return of his old vitality . Dinner was fine . Duck with mandarin orange sauce and some kind of wildly flavored rice . A few brandies , and he was even able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I guess I 'm the reason we did n't have squab . " Everyone laughed , and he felt that he was back in his usual con-82 MY NAME IS MORGANfident form . He kept his cigar puffing , and Elder Barrow tried one of his brand and pronounced it excellent . " I have ' em made to order , " Morgan said . " Some guy down in Havana . Rolls ' em in his own special kind of spit . " He relaxed in his comfortable portrayal of colorful vulgarity and managed to appear undisturbed about the fact that Anne spent most of the two hours at the dinner table in rapt conversation with Paul Beaumont . Paul had hardly touched his dinner and kept staringinto Anne 's eyes . Several Scotch highballs helped Morgan to retainhis good humor and eased a little of the painful ache in his shoulder where the shotgun handle had bruised him badly . After dinner Elder Barrow suggested that they return to the poker table . Morgan said he thought that was a good idea and joined the others in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Paul was adamant . " I just do n't feel lucky at cards tonight , " he said . At that point Morgan said that perhaps they should all forget it , but a young man named Frank something-or-other volunteered to take Paul 's place and the game got under way . Morgan had to join them . This time they were playing for blood from the start . The young man named Frank dropped out after an hour when the going becametoo rough . That left Harvey Asbo , Alec Lipton , the two Barrowbrothers , and himself . Shortly after Frank left , Morgan glanced around the lounge and noticed neither Anne nor Paul Beaumont anywhere in sight . He promised himself that he would quit after the next round and go look for them . But he was already several thousand dollars behind and he stayed with jacks and fives in an attempt to make up his losses and dropped nearly two thousand dollars more . " The cards are n't going your way tonight , " Alec Lipton said sympatheticallyas he dealt around the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Barrow said . " Lucky in love . . . " The next pot was a small one and Morgan won it and that encouragedhim to believe his luck had turned . Then he lost four rounds in a row , and quickly calculating in his mind , realized that he was behind more than eight thousand dollars . Added to his loss of the previous evening , he owed more than fifteen thousand dollars . MY NAME IS MORGAN 83After the next round , which he lost again , Morgan tossed in his cards with a muttered impatience . " I think I 'll take a break , " he announced . " See if I ca n't change the rhythm . Deal me out . " After the long session in the smoky lounge he felt stale and out of sorts . His throat was dry , from too many cigarettes and too little liquor . Sober or drunk did not seem to matter . He wished he had never agreed to come for this weekend . He could not afford to lose , and there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on deck . He walked around the yacht and they were nowhere to be found . Passing the window of the lounge , he glanced in , saw the men still playing cards and a steward bringing drinks to their table . There was a small group of people at the bar , but neither Paul nor Anne was among them . In a few minutes he had covered most of the places they would be , except the cabins . He went down a corridor to Anne 's cabin and saw that there was no light showing beneath her locked door . He knocked , lightly at first , then with authority . There was no reply , no stir of movement within . " Anne , " he said . He knocked again , with the side of his fist . " Anne ! " A white-coated steward appeared at the end of the corridor . Morganput his clenched fist into the pocket of his jacket . " Have you seen Miss Allen ? " " No , sir . " As he went back down the corridor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironing . Morgan went upstairs and made a vain circuit of the deck again , knowing that he would not find them . He stopped on the port side to glance over the railing . There was a dim circle of light from the porthole in Paul Beaumont 's cabin . He thought he heard Anne 's voice , but the wind was blowing and he could not be certain . He waited a moment longer , straining . The porthole light , quite suddenly , blinked out . He stared at the black hole in the yacht 's side as though it were a darkened screen which would presently light up again . Spray from the swift running sea dampened his face , but he made no move to brush the droplets away . They ran like sweat , gathering on his84 MY NAME IS MORGANcheekbones and tracing out a long continuous line of wet to his jaw . Back in the main lounge two young couples were dancing . The young man named Frank who had begun playing in Paul Beaumont'splace turned from his blonde partner to ask : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " In the game . " " Oh . All right , I guess . " " Pretty fast action . I 'm glad to be out of it . I 'd have a hell of a time explaining to my wife how I lost that much money . " His blonde dancing partner laughed ; she was a pretty girl , about twenty , and her glance dwelt on Morgan with friendly invitation . He nodded to her . Girls were as plentiful as summer grass and all that was needed to pluck them was to know what they wanted . Money or career was the answer with the kind of girls who did not particularly care about marriage . Why did he have to have Anne ? A father was all she wanted , so she could always be the spoiled and favorite child . He drifted closer to the corner of the lounge which had been set up as the cardroom . If he went back to the game , he was certainto lose . They were on to his style of play and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably drink too much . There was nowhere else to go . Still he hesitated . He could go shouting through the corridors , but Anne would never speak to him again . No matter if he were right . Nothing , not even injured innocence , is more righteous than injured guilt . And if he were wrong . . . ? In spite of himself , his heart leaped . She had been angry with Paul Beaumont in the lounge chair on the ship 's deck last night . Paul was not her type , really . Only his image intrigued her , rich , powerful , and sure . She and Paul had nothing in common . If only she knew her own mind . . . She said No , do n't ever try that again . He remembered her saying it , and knew from experience that she meant it when she spoke like that . She would n't let any man trifle with her . She had no reason to . She could keep a man enchanted forever with her presence , so why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table George Barrow glanced up . " Welcome home , " he said . " Feeling lucky ? " MY NAME IS MORGAN 85Morgan bit off the end of a new cigar and lighted it with a flaring match . Through the sting of smoke he saw them watching him , with surprise , amusement , calculation , greed . He had come back like a sheep to the shearers . Well , Morgan thought , drawing out a chair to sit with them , at least sheep have no horns . Then he cut the thought adrift , to keep his mind firmly anchored to untruth . Anne was n't like that at all . She knew how to handle Paul Beaumont . He even managed a convincing grin as he clamped the cigar at a confident angle in his teeth . " Deal me in , " he said . CHAPTER 6The phones kept ringing . Small shrill crouching colored animalswith imperious demands , for time , for answers , for money , questions in the form of demands , and demands in the form of questions , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one phone to the other this Friday evening , barking staccato orders . He was in his shirt sleeves , and he had chewed his cigar soggy wet . Dave Gilmore came and went , so did Mrs. Hardy ; secretaries came , visitors went ; traffic in and out of the double doors was as continuous as the jangle , jangle , jangle of the telephones . Agents and actors and costume designers and location scouts and people with bills bills bills . Papers mounted on the spindle , waving tiny white flags for attention , and when they filled the spindle to overflowing Mrs. Hardy took them away . " Listen , " Morgan said to a telephone , " this movie surpasses your imagination . It 's a tremendous thing , Fred . I 'm giving you a chance to make history . But you 've got ta give me a price , honey .... " Dave Gilmore came to the door . " When can we have the script conference , Jack ? I 've got the writers on the other phone now . " Morgan waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He picked up another phone . " I suppose you 'd like to cut yourselves a slice of the foreign distribution rights .

He 's talking about getting the sheriff to hold an auction .... " " Penny ante , " Morgan said . " You handle it . Tell him there 'll be a check in the mail at closing time . " He reached for an insistent phone . " What ? There is n't any top on this promotion budget . Before we 're done , every kid old enough to masturbate is going to know about this picture .... " Another phone shrilled at him . " Sure . I 'll take a float . We 'll work up a big display and send it along . When that parade goes in front of the TV cameras , they 'll know about The Apostles in twenty million homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city block ! " " Hey ! " he called Mrs. Hardy , who passed near his desk . " I 've just got a great idea . Hire Yankee Stadium and give a whole performanceof the Passion Play . Just like they do it in that little German town . . . . " " Oberammergau ? " " That 's the place . Import all the actors . We 'll give it right here in New York City . Think of the publicity for The Apostles . Get Jim Grove to work on that right away . .. . " There 's a call from your accountant , Mr. Morgan . I 'm holding him on 51 . Do you want to talk to him ?

That 's for you and the lawyers to handle . I 've got a movie to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me worry . That 's why I pay me so good . " Dave Gilmore came to the door . " We 're ready for that script conference , Jack . Any time you are . " Morgan nodded , and Dave Gilmore left . Morgan said , " I ca n't talk now , Bob . " He hung up the phone , kept his hand on it for an instant . It began to ring , and he felt the vibrationof the soprano summons through his wrist . Suddenly he flicked the switch of the intercom and told Mrs. Hardy to take all incoming calls for five minutes . He sat back in the chair , crossed the palms of his hands over his eyes , and stared into created darkness . A trick to relax , to refocusMY NAME IS MORGAN 87energies . Five minutes . Easy to make that request sound as though he were harassed by demands upon his time , but time did not truly exist for him unless it was measured by work to do ; all other time was nothing , blankness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leisure was death . Work was electric : buzz and crackle of himself flowing out to others , returning flow of vital current to sustainhim . No , it was not work he wanted to call a halt to . He wanted to stop that monkey , Memory , from making obscene simian gestures ... . There had been a scene with Anne in the taxi that took them from the pier . He would n't let her wait for the Barrows ' limousine . She had been annoyed about that . " You could have waited , " she said . " Now they 'll have to send the luggage after us . " " I want to talk to you about Paul Beaumont . " A slight flush began at the base of her neck and traveled upward . " Where were you last night ? " he asked . " You were n't in your cabin . I knocked . " " I took a walk around the deck to get some fresh air . You did n't expect me to stay and watch you play poker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction , this beautiful wisp of a girl without substance . How could he tell what she really felt about anything ? Her feelings shifted like waves with a wind until he wondered whether there was any current of emotion running in her at all . " I looked for you , " he said . " You were n't anywhere on deck . " She turned to him a countenance that was washed clear of meaning . " Yes , I was , " she said . It was not truth , not even a simulation of truth . His voice choked . " You were with Paul Beaumont in his cabin ! " She did not blink at the accusation . " I ca n't see any harm in my having a drink with somebody if he asks me to . " Shock registered inside his body before his brain formed the words into coherence . He quickly turned his head to stare out the window so that she could not see what his face revealed . She went on , " Paul is a very nice young man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything between us . . What he had feared was probably true , and the thought was88 MY NAME IS MORGANagony . Sharper still was the foreknowledge that even if she admittedall , he would forgive her . There was no sense in pushing this to a choice of leaving her , or forgiving , because he could not leave her and to forgive would be more shameful than to accept what she said as truth . He said angrily , " I do n't like your paying attention to other men . " " Well , I do n't like you to be jealous . It makes me nervous . " Her lips trembled . " I do n't know why I have to explain , as though I were guilty of something . If you cared about me at all , you would n't want to make me feel this way . " " Anne . . Her violet eyes were wide with reproach . " I would never hurt you , Jack . I 've never known anyone like you in my life . You 've been wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said harshly . She touched his cheek with the palm of her hand . " Come to my place tonight . After midnight . " He kissed her again and put away the thought of what might have happened aboard the Barrows ' yacht , and with the thought behind him he could be content with the reality of what he was about to achieve . In Morgan 's world no thought of pain could equal the pleasure of a fact . Tonight , she had said . After midnight . The needle , dancing in grooves of memory , finally stopped . Sound ceased . Visions faded . Alone at his desk in the soundless immensity of his disappearing five minutes , Morgan considered a new problem . The last session at the poker table aboard Elder Barrow 's yacht had cost him thirty-five thousand dollars . More than made up when George Barrow invested a quarter of a million for Celestial Films , Inc . It had been a lifesaver ; he had arranged a short-term financing deal against it . With money in the bank even at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentum again . But there was still no script . Until he had a script all the wheels were turning over in neutral gear . If he could only buy the right words with money . What price Shakespeare ? Five minutes were at an end . He glanced at his watch and saw there was more than an hour to midnight . He could get a lot of work done before he left for Anne 's apartment . MY NAME IS MORGAN 89He switched the intercom . " Hello , Dave . " Dave Gilmore 's soft voice answered . " I 've been holding them here until you had a chance to talk to them . " " I hope you 've got something this time . " " Just wait until you read it , jack . " Dave Gilmore entered Morgan 's office a moment later with two men , a tall man with a casual air whose long handsome face held a peimanent look of skepticism , and a heavy-set short man with a dark beard and an aggressive waddle . Sam Epworth and Billy Sands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook hands all around and for an opener discussed the state of the movie business . This went on for ten minutes , establishingthe ground of camaraderie necessary for any serious discussion of a creative problem . " People have got out of the movie-going habit , " Billy Sands said finally . " What the business needs is a blockbuster . Something to get ' em back into theaters again . " Morgan was grateful for a signal that the warm-up had ended . " That 's what I 'm going to give them . Provided you bastards come up with a usable approach to the script . " Dave Gilmore said , " Bringing in Sam and Billy on this was an inspiration . They 've broken the bottleneck . " " Can I see the outline ? " Dave handed over five single-spaced pages of manuscript and settled back with a half-smile on his face while Morgan began reading . When Morgan was finished , he asked , " What did you like about it , Dave ? " Dave 's eyes shifted slightly , as though to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has some wonderful touches . Out of the ordinary . Nothing Hollywood about it . " " Spell it out for me . " " Well , I think we all agree that if you hand a problem like this to the regular run of screenwriters they 'll fall back on the usual cliches of the spectacle pictures . Sam and Billy did a good job of avoiding that . " " I want to know what you liked in the script " " Well , if you want to be specific . . . " Dave was losing his as-90 MY NAME I S MORGANsurance . He fell back to the prepared defenses of his ego , taking the safe high ground of intellectualism . " I particularly admired the character study of Judas and the motives that finally led him to the betrayal , the implication of his father-relationship with Christ . That 's really modem  --  and good . In everything I 've read , from Renanright on to Fulton Oursler , there 's never been a really profound attempt to apply the teachings of Freud . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the subsurface values . You can leave it to us to bring out the usual surface gloss of character and study .... " " Do n't start tossing around the words , " Morgan said . " I want a plain , simple narrative that 's going to hold the attention of fifty million people . I do n't want to fancy it up with crappy philosophy and pseudo-Freudian analysis . " " That approach will never get the critics , " Billy Sands put in . " It does n't take intelligence to lay out this story the way it was written , Jack . The Bible did that . " " If I could hire the guys who wrote the Bible , I would . " Sam Epworth 's perpetual look of skepticism deepened . " You do n't really mean you want the Bible story as written ? That 's hackneyed as hell . " Dave Gilmore ventured , " I know what you 're driving at , Jack . But in my opinion we 've got to beware of just giving people an empty spectacle . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible was written . We 've discovered an awful lot about the human psyche , and it 's our job not only to tell the story of the apostles but to interpret it in the light of modern science . " Sam and Billy gave Dave Gilmore an approving glance , and Dave seemed to draw strength from their support . He waited , calm and smiling , for Morgan 's rebuttal . Jack Morgan said , " You do n't want to interpret , Dave . You want to try to improve on the Good Book . I do n't believe that a couple of Hollywood hacks can do it . " Billy Sands said , " No need to get insulting about this , Jack . " Morgan rose to his feet slowly . " I do n't want my movie to be a springboard for a bunch of frustrated geniuses to prove how smart they are . Sitting around this office we can all talk about how simplemindedthe Bible is . We can dig into it and change the story by finding all kinds of hidden motives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , and forgetting the things that might sound stupid to people today . " " Nothing wrong with that , is there , Jack ? " Sam Epworth asked . " That 's the intellectual for you . The born critic . If you 'd been around during the Creation , you 'd have put in your two cents ' worth direct to God . " Morgan began nervously pacing the room while the gaze of the three men followed him . Suddenly he turned . " You people make me sick . You 're like a goddam pigeon making on a statue by Michelangelo and then claiming joint credit for the final result . " Billy Sands said coldly , " You have n't told us your ideas for this script . " " Take the story , just the way it 's told , and tell it again for the screen . Dress it up . Let the audience see it , not just read about it . Give them colored pictures in their heads instead of words , people to look at instead of names . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " people . The people in the Bible are just cardboard abstractions . Do n't you agree , Dave ? " Dave Gilmore had been sitting quietly , his brown face serious , and a moistness in his eyes . His fingers played with the crease in his trousers . " I see what Jack is driving at , " he said . Sam Epworth and Billy Sands stared at him without speaking . " I do n't necessarily agree with everything Jack says , " Dave Gilmorewent on . " But if that 's the way he wants it , then we ought to try to give it to him . " " It 's a question of artistic integrity , " Sam Epworth said without conviction . " Personally , " Billy Sands said hurriedly , " I do n't think there 's much disagreement here . It 's mainly a question of semantics . We agree that we 've got to stick pretty close to the Biblical story as it 's written . And , in a picture with this kind of a budget , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing about is what kind of approach we 'll use to the characters in the story . Right ? " " Billy 's got a point there , " Dave Gilmore said hopefully . Morgan gave him a withering glance . " Pay them off , " he said curtly . " What ? " 92 MY NAME IS MORGAN " I said pay them off . We own the outline and we 're a few more grand in the sock . Cheap at the price . " Sam Epworth seemed about to say something , and then he shrugged easily and stood up . He held out his hand with a smile . " No hard feelings , Jack ? " " I 'm not mad at anybody , " Morgan told him . He ignored Dave Gilmore , who looked as though his suit had crumpled over the chair without a body in it . When Dave Gilmore and the writers left , Mrs. Hardy buzzed on the intercom . " The man from the Vance Survey is here . " " Send him in . " A tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black leather , came into the office . He fluttered a hand at Morgan and Morgan shook it . " I am very glad to meet you , Mr. Morgan . I 'm from the Vance Survey and I brought with me the results of eight hundred stratified interviews we 've made over the past month in connection with your forthcoming motion picture . " He sat down and placed the portfolio between his legs , turning his knees inward to hold it . He zipped open the cover and took out several large stiff paper charts with colored graphs and hand lettering . Morgan said , " I 'll look at the charts and stuff later . How about giving it to me straight ? " " Well . . . uh . . . " He twisted his head and blinked surprisedly . His teeth were a bit too large for his mouth . " Of course , Mr. Morgan . But first there are some things I ought to explain . Before we make such a survey for any producer we ask ourselves certain questions . " Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's get to the meat , shall we ? " he asked . His visitor nodded ; he was like a dowdy stork with tall ungraceful body and uncertain movements . " We ask ourselves how many persons know about the book or the play on which the movie is going to be based . And then we ask how many would like to see it filmed . Of course , with a movie like The Apostles , which will have an original script , we centered our attack upon the basis for the script rather than the script itself . " Morgan lighted his cigar and waited , impassive . MY NAME IS MORGAN 93The man lifted up one of his charts hopefully . " Now , tables six and seven show the tabulation of answers for five cities .... " " I do n't want a chart . Tell me . " " The degree of penetration was very high for the name The Apostles . Eighty-four percent of those interviewed were aware that this would be a topic from the Bible , and another sizable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Testament . We consider that very promising , since even a well-known play like South Pacific did not score higher than sixty in the recognition survey . " " People know the Bible better than Rodgers and Hammerstein . I could 've told you that without a survey . " The man from the Vance Survey gave Morgan a glance of mild reproof . " That was just our first question . We then asked the intervieweeswhether they would like to see The Apostles made into a movie . More than seventy percent replied in the affirmative . " " That 's promising ? " " Very promising . Now , however , we come to the part of the recognitionsurvey which will particularly interest you , Mr. Morgan . We gave each subject a list of fifty names and asked them to identify which of these were names of the apostles . Only three or four names were correctly identified by a majority of those interviewed . " There was a pause pregnant with meaning . " What am I supposed to do about that ? " Morgan asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or four of the apostles are well known has a great bearing upon the appeal of the story line that is selected . We believe that an audience will react more intensively to a story which revolves about the characters known to them . " " You 're entitled , " Morgan said . The stork gathered its plumage . " You may scoff at figures if you like , Mr. Morgan . But statistics are what count . And statistics are what we find out . I might add that everything I 've told you has been conclusively proved correct . " " How ? " " By a special service which makes the Vance Survey unique in its field . The psychological interview in depth . " He announced this like a trumpet call . " In this follow-up interview to our story response , we establish the hidden likes and dislikes , the mental images and94 MY NAME IS MORGANassociations , which each interviewee has toward elements of the projected motion picture . " " A hit-and-run psychoanalysis , " Morgan volunteered . " We discovered some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the report . If you 'd rather read it ... " Morgan grinned widely . " I would n't miss hearing it for the world . " The man gave him a disapproving glance that traveled the length of his nose . " For one thing , the psychological interview completely supported our story-response survey in the fact that the respondents clearly preferred a story line dealing with the three or four apostles with whom they were most familiar . There were also favorable satisfaction-indices in relation to the support of a romantic element in the story . " " Read it back to me . " " Pardon ? " " What in hell did you just say ? " The man rustled his papers . " Perhaps you would prefer to read the report for yourself , Mr. Morgan . " " It 's written in English , is n't it ? And that 's the language you 're supposed to talk . Talk it . " " What I was trying to convey , Mr. Morgan , " the tone had become patient now , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture will do a bigger business if it concentrates upon the story of three or four disciples and also introduces a love story . " " Let me get this straight . If I make the movie the way you say I should , you 'll guarantee me against losses ? " " We are not in the business of producing motion pictures . " Morgan stood up suddenly and the quick motion brought an instinctive flinch into the stork body opposite him . " Thank your lucky stars , " Morgan said harshly . " Because if you ever try to make pictures based on what that research stuff tells you , you 'll lose your shirts . You ca n't put a slide rule to show business . This is one business where figures never add up . It 's a guessing game , and the best showman is the best guesser of the lot . There are no formulas . Every time you try to make one , it springs a dozen leaks . And that 's because even the public does n't know what it wants  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluttering protest . " The results of our interviewsusually correspond to the box-office results of the picture . " MY NAME IS MORGAN 95 " Do n't lie with figures . You guys distort figures like Picasso distortsa face . You twist ' em into pretzels and make ' em prove white is black four times out of five . And you can keep doing it , and probablywill , until the end of time . But I 've seen the figures on some story lines you guys approved . Most people bury their own mistakes ; your mistakes bury other people . " There were signs of offense being taken . " If you feel that way "  --  stiffly  --  " why did you engage Vance Survey to do this research for you ? " " Because it impresses suckers , " Morgan said . " Because money men like to put their money on some kind of statistics , not on what 's inside one man 's head . Because every other business is run by the slide rule and the IBM machine , and men who make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show business is n't like that . I 'll tell you something . The day show business gets like that , I 'll climb out . Because that 's the day I 'll have to admit a machine can do my job better than I can . " The man from Vance Survey rose huffily : " I 'll leave the charts with you , and the report . You paid for them . " " Keep punching those comptometers , " Morgan said , grinning . When the double doors closed , the buzzer sounded . " A few telegrams have come in , " Mrs. Hardy said . " Bring ' em in . " Mrs. Hardy brought a thin sheaf of yellow sheets . He glanced through them cursorily ; one caught his attention . WOULD APPRECIATE FULL COOPERATION . ACCOUNTANTS ASSURE ME NO INVENTORY OF MY CURRENT FINANCIAL POSITION POSSIBLE WITHOUT EXAMINING BOOKS . I KNOW EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT BUT DO N'T HOLD UP THE WORKS . It was signed Earl Hollis . He held the telegram a moment before he crumpled it and tossed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path to any place was full of mines that could blow you up . You had to pick your way on a path that was really no path at all but an obstacle course . Damn . No sooner did he get money from somebody like George Barrow than someone like Earl Hollis came along and tried to gum up the96 MY NAME IS MORGANworks . He could n't let accountants in now . There were still too many unexplainable items , things that the accountant 's mind , the Larry Whirter type , could n't put tidily away into profit and loss books . It would be like a woman having company in before she had a chance to clean the house . Why did n't they leave him alone ? All he needed was a little time , with the pressure off , and he could make everyone happy . Mrs. Hardy asked , " Do you want to answer any of the telegrams now , Mr. Morgan ? " " Not right away . " He turned over the other telegrams . There was one from a wellknownliterary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR BLADES ? CURRENTISSUE NEW YORKER REVIEWS MY CLIENT SIMON LEV AND LIFE IS ETERNAL SHOW . COULD THIS BE THE ANSWER ? ANNIE MACDERMOTTAnnie MacDermott was a shrewd , hard-bitten woman who had been responsible for uncovering several of the screen 's hottest properties . She specialized in moving unknown talent up to the big time and over the years she had launched a score of highly successful novelists and playwrights . Her recommendations were taken with respect in the topmost echelons of show business . He buzzed Mrs. Hardy and told her to get Annie MacDermott for him . A moment later she reported back . " Miss MacDermott does n't answer at her office or her home . " " Send someone out to get the current issue of the New Yorker , will you ? " A few minutes later when Mrs. Hardy brought the magazine into his office , Morgan leafed through it until he came to a column reviewing a TV show which appeared every Sunday morning , called " Life Is Eternal . " It was a religious show , not the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been looking for a new topic for his weekly review . The show under consideration dealt with the relation of the Sanhedrin synagogue to the disciples of Jesus and , according to the New Yorker , made exciting drama out of the conflict between the old and the new . The writer , Simon Lev , was highly praised for his compassionate portrayal of bothMY NAME IS MORGAN 97sides of the controversy and for establishing clearly that the Jews of Sanhedrin had not really been responsible for the death of Jesus . In fact , the Sanhedrin had not sentenced anyone to death for blasphemyfor two hundred years and only the Romans possessed the power of condemning to death . Crucifixion was a Roman type of execution and the Jews favored stoning . All of this , according to the review , was presented not as history , but as topical drama , and the writing itself was of a very high order . There followed a brief summation of Simon Lev 's previous creativeactivity , which included two years of writing for the " Life Is Eternal " show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severalyears before , and a book , Master and Men , which dealt with the life of Jesus and His apostles . He had Mrs. Hardy look up the unlisted number of Selig Arkon , a friend of his who worked for the TV network , and told him he wanted to get in touch with Simon Lev . " At this hour ? It 's pushing midnight , " Selig protested . " I tried to contact him through his agent , but I ca n't locate her . This is important . Will you find out where he is now and ring me back ? " " Okay , " Selig said with a sigh . Ten minutes later he had his answer . Simon Lev was in California , staying at a rented bungalow in Bel Air . Selig Arkon gave him the address . " He got a leave of absence from the " Life Is Eternal " show . I think he 's been signed to write a teen-age B-movie in Hollywood . He wo n't be back for a couple of months . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Los Angeles exchange and got Simon Lev 's number . After a slight delay a somewhat accented voice came on the phone . " Yes . Who 's calling ? " " This is Jack Morgan in New York . I think you may be the writer I want on my new movie , The Apostles . Drop everything else and fly here right away . " " Is this a practical joke ? " " If you want to prove I 'm on the level , I 'll hang up and you call me back collect at this number . " 98 MY NAME IS MORGAN " No , thanks . I 'm leaving for a premiere now . It 's almost eightthirty . I 'm sorry , Mr. Morgan , but ... " " I 'm offering you the chance of your lifetime . If you turn out an acceptable script for my movie , you 'll be made in Hollywood . You can name your own price for anything you do . " " I 'm not sure I want to stay in Hollywood . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this trouble to locate a writer who was still fighting an esthetic battle with Hollywood . " You 're out there now , are n't you ? " he asked . " I 'm here on a twelve-week deal to pick up a little money so I can afford to work on a book I 'm planning . " " Okay , then . I 'll offer you enough money to write a dozen books . What are they paying you ? " " I do n't think I should tell you that . " " I can find out . How much ? " A slight hesitation , then : " Seven fifty a week . " This was progress . Morgan knew what he had to beat , and it was almost too easy . He just had to decide what would impress the voice at the other end of the phone . " I 'll pay you three grand a week  --  firm  --  for the same twelve weeks , " Morgan said . Silence on the line . Then : " I 've already signed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the differential was great . That meant money was not the crucial factor . " Leave the details to me , " Morgan said . " I 'll take care of your contract . Just say yes and I 'll handle the rest . And I promise there wo n't be any trouble . " " What do you want me to do ? " There was interest now . Perhaps if he just made it sound easy . " An outline , " Morgan said . " Half a dozen pages . We 'll sit in my office and knock it out together . And when we 've got something we like . . " Sorry . " Morgan was not prepared for this short , harsh interruption to his sales pitch . " Sorry ? " " I 'm not going to fly back to New York on a tentative proposition . " MY NAME IS MORGAN 99 " This is the chance of your lifetime . " " That may be so , Mr. Morgan . But I 'm not anxious to do your script and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . So I 'm not going to run to you . There 's only one way that I could work with you . . . . " " Name it and you got it . " " You 'll have to come here . " A break in the thought , before the accented voice continued regretfully , " But it would n't do any good . Unfortunately , I 'm starting work on this picture Monday and that would n't leave enough time to . . . " " Tomorrow 's Saturday . That gives us almost a whole weekend . " " I 'm afraid it would n't be very satisfactory . You see . . . " Morgan broke in curtly , " Do n't make any other appointments . I 'll be seeing you . " He hung up and buzzed Mrs. Hardy on the intercom . " Get me a ticket to Los Angeles on the first jet leaving the city . And get my overnight bag ready . No , make it the valise . " He always kept a complete wardrobe at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost no notice . It was one of the few precautions he could take against the unexpected . A short time later Mrs. Hardy and Dave Gilmore came in for last-minute instructions . Morgan began dictating to Mrs. Hardy at a rapid pace , interspersed with asides to Dave Gilmore . He was almostfinished when he heard the bell of a distant clock chiming the hour . He glanced at his watch . It was midnight . " What time did you say my jet was leaving ? " he asked Mrs. Hardy . " Two o'clock from Idlewild . You 'll get there in time , Mr. Morgan . " Everything in the room stopped . Mrs. Hardy 's face stayed alert , ready , and Dave Gilmore remained half slouching in his chair with his arm over the back of it . Even the light in the room became as fixed and steady as in a photograph , while quickly neatly he was outside it all in darkness . He was supposed to see Anne after midnight . This was the night . In his stomach there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flight to Los Angeles . It might be a wasted trip anyway . Simon Lev might not have the right words to sell . But time was working on Simon 's side . Anne could be postponed , ioo MY NAME I S MORGANbut , once missed , the chance for the right script might be gone forever . More important , the money he had gotten from George Barrowwas n't going to last long , not at the rate Morgan was spending . He had to have a working script at least before the cash register was empty or it would be strictly no sale with Federated Pictures . Federated would distribute and put up the major part of the financingonly on approval of a script . " I guess that 's all , Mrs. Hardy , " Morgan said . " Can you get the limousine service to drive me to the airport ? " " I 've already arranged it , Mr. Morgan . " Morgan nodded . " Excuse me , Dave . I 've got to make a couple of personal telephone calls . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Morgan reached for the private telephone on his desk . When he heard her little-girl whisper , he matched his tone of voice to it : " Hello , baby ? " " Jack . " " A terrible thing has just happened , " he said . " I could kill myself . But I ca n't make it up to your place tonight . " " Oh ? " The question reserved decision on a reply . " Nothing in the world could have kept me away tonight  --  except what did happen . This is something that involves the whole future of my business . I tried like hell to put it off , honey , but I just could n't . " " I see . " Cool withdrawal in the small voice . " Try to understand , baby . You 're the only person in the world that matters a damn to me . That 's why I have to do this . It is n't just the business alone . I 'd give it all away if you wanted me to . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in  --  for good . But it 's the business that makes it possible for me to do all the things for you that I want to do . " He hesitated , his thoughts racing like fingers over piano keys to find the one note to which she would respond . " I 'm going to send you something that you 're going to like . " The note hung shimmering in the air until mellowly she answeredit : " What ? " " You 'll find out in the morning . If it 's something you 've really alwayswanted , will you forgive me ? " " Well . . MY NAME IS MORGAN Ioi " I promise you 'll like it . " A slight warmth returned to her cool sibilance . She said with petulantcoquetry , " Jack , darling , I was expecting you tonight " " I know that , baby . But I 'll make up for it when I get back . What I 'm getting you will keep you warm while I 'm gone . " Silence ticked on . " Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . Pure coquetry with the last trace of petulance vanished . He knew how to deal with this : offer the living sacrifice to be coiled in her whim . " I 'll prove how much I love you . Just tell me not to go and I wo n't . I do n't care if the whole damn business goes smash . " " You do n't mean it . " " Try me . I 'll come there right this minute . " A whispery laugh . " You 're crazy . . . and I 'm tempted . But I 'll let you go . I 'm just not sure that I 'll ever forgive you . " " You will , honey , when you see what the mailman brings you in the morning . " When he finally lowered the receiver into its cradle , the underarmsof his shirt were stickywet . He shook his head to clear away the tension . Then he buzzed the intercom and asked for Dave Gilmore . Dave appeared in the doorway . " Dave , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell him to pick out the finest chinchilla coat money can buy and rush it over to Anne 's apartment . Charge it to me . Okay ? " " Okay , " Dave said . " By the way , I 've been thinking about what you told Dave Epworth and Billy Sands . You were absolutely right , Jack . You 've got a sure instinct for these things . " " Yeah , " Morgan said . Dave glanced at his watch . " It 's twelve-thirty . You 'd better hurry if you want to catch that plane . " As Morgan emerged into the outer office , Larry Whirter was standing by a desk talking to one of the girls . " Oh , hello , Mr. Morgan , " Larry said . " Can you spare a couple of minutes ? " " Not now . I 'm on my way to the airport . I 'm flying to California . " Larry 's surface geniality rubbed away. 1oz MY NAME I S MORGAN " This is important , Mr. Morgan . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I got a wire from him a little while ago . When I get back to New York , I 'll see if there is something that can be done . " " That wo n't be necessary , " Larry said incisively . " If you 'll just leave instructions for your accountants ... " " You could n't pick a worse time . I 'm sorry , but I do n't leave carte blanche for anybody in my absence . You know how it is . " " I 'm afraid I do n't know , " Larry said levelly . " It looks to me as though you 're deliberately evading the issue . And that 's what I 'll report to Mr. Hollis . " Morgan put his hand paternally on Larry 's shoulder . " One thing you ought to know . I do n't react to threats . As far as I 'm concerned , Earl Hollis can go stick his head in a barrel of wet cement . " Larry Whirter stood rocklike until Morgan removed his hand . Then he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who has risked money in your business , Mr. Morgan . " " Just setting the record straight . " Morgan grinned . " Having said that , I 'd like to be fair . I wo n't open my books to you but I 'll answer any questions . " " That is n't enough , Mr. Morgan . Besides , there are likely to be a number of questions and they would take time to answer . " Morgan 's shoulders straightened . Larry Whirter had persistence , that most desirable or most dangerous quality , depending on which side of the fence it was operating on . In this case it was the wrong side , and so Morgan made a quick decision . He could not risk leavingthis young man behind him in New York , to stir up trouble , while he himself was three thousand miles away . " Come along , then , " he said . Larry Whirter stared at him . " Where ? " " California . Got anything more important on your schedule ? " " You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's your chance to ask all the questions you can think of . If you 're not satisfied then , I 'll see what else I can do for you . What can you lose ? It only takes five hours on a jet . " " Mr. Morgan , all I want is permission to examine . . . " " Take it or leave it . " MY NAME IS MORGAN 103 " I have n't got any clothes . I ... " Morgan found it refreshing to see Larry Whirter flustered ; it proved the young man was human . " If you need a clean shirt , I 'll buy you one when we get there . As for the rest , you wo n't need money , and you can call your boss from the airport to explain what 's happening . I 'm the most important thing on your agenda , right ? " " Yes , but .. " There 'll be a limousine downstairs in a few minutes . Make up your mind . " Larry said , " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this young fellow had it . It would be fun matching wits during the plane trip . They went outside and Morgan rang for the elevator . The light blinked on immediately , and the elevator arrived with a new attendanton the car , a short , young man whose quick , eager smile showed a readiness to serve . A big improvement over the old relic who worked the elevator before , Morgan thought . He was pleased with this small change in his routine ; small changes augured a significant change for the better . Everything moved in cycles and when you were in a down cycle the best thing that could happen was to quicken the tempo . That way , you got out of the rut sooner and started the climb back . He could feel the pulse of things speeding up around him . There were always problems and setbacks  --  the solution was to keep thinking up new schemes , get involved with new people ; something always resultsfrom activity . On the street , watching the limousine pull into the curb for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a trick of Fate , he would be with her now . What was it the soldier poet told his sweetheart ? How did it go ? I could not love you so , my dear , loved I not honor more . . . . Times change . Honor did n't matter so much any more . Morgan opened the limousine door and Larry climbed into theback seat . As Morgan got in , he told the driver : " Get me to the airport in forty minutes . I want to make some phone calls . " CHAPTER 7A light rain began to fall as they were driving to Idlewild Airport . A close film of droplets frosted the limousine windows and when they entered the winding approach to the terminal the bright lit signs above the buildings glowed fuzzily . As they got out beneath the archway entrance , the asphalt road behind them was dark , glistening and glowing with reflected light . Morgan pressed a roll of bills into Larry 's hand . " Buy yourself a ticket . Flight 173 . Get next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the public phone booths . " He plunged away with his aggressive leaning stride . Larry entered the building where a large crowd was already gathered , crossingbetween the ticket windows and the boarding aisles , stolidly occupying seats and benches , picking out magazines from the colorfulnewsstand . After a few minutes ' wait Larry reached his ticket window and purchased a seat on jet flight 173 to Los Angeles . " I can give you a seat two rows back of Mr. Morgan 's , " the pert airline counter girl told him . " You can probably switch once you 're on board . " He found Morgan in the last of a line of four pale green telephone booths . Morgan had the folding door closed and was talking forcefully . He hung up the receiver and started to dial again . When he saw Larry standing outside , he cupped the receiver on his shoulder and folded the door open part way . " I 'll be half an hour or so , " he said . " Are n't there some calls you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use my credit card ? " " Never mind . Mine are local calls . " By then Morgan had reached the other party on his line and was already unfolding the door to close himself in the booth . " Hello , Ray . I 'm in the airport waiting to take off . I want to talk to you about an idea I have for the score for my movie . " Larry stepped back a few feet so that he could see when one of the other booths became empty . In his booth Morgan shifted restMYNAME IS MORGAN 105lessly on the seat , grimaced , gestured in the air , talked incessantly . Risky business , Larry thought , investing in an enterprise that dependedso exclusively on the driving force of a single man . Everyonewho worked for Morgan seemed to function merely as an extension of himself , a useful hand , a voice , someone to run an errand . This was not the day of the individual entrepreneur . This was the day of the Manager and the Machine . No man could organize his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balances , of a well-run machine . The Machine was not capable of suddeninspiration , daring , or the last gasp mind-shattering effort of the solo performer , but the sheer weight of its monumental rightnesswas enough to overwhelm all that stood in its path . Morgan had been born out of his time , in a world unmade for him . There must be many such , Larry thought , living out their span in the wrong time , struggling to adapt to our unwelcoming era : Renaissance men , feudal lords and knights of the Round Table , Heidelberg men with low foreheads and clubs for argument , Spanishgrandees with lace at their wrists , prophets afire with messages that had been delivered long before their birth ; all of them alive in the wrong hour , flying the flags of their forlorn causes over a battlefieldwhere the trophies were already won and the corpses descended to burial . A woman emerged from a phone booth at the other end of the line and Larry went over to it and put in his coin . The Machine needed nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intricate gears . It hummed , waiting . Larry dialed Sol Shapiro 's number . If he were to vanish this instant , if no human voice were to answer , or none to question , the usefulness of the Machine would not be a whit impaired . The phone would ring and emptiness would return its busy signal . He hung up and dialed again . This time Sol Shapiro 's voice answered . " Hello . " " Hello , Sol , " Larry said . " I 'm at the airport with Jack Morgan . We 're leaving for California in a few minutes . . . . I know it sounds crazy but that 's the way he operates . . . . For all I know , this is another runaround . . . . Listen , that 's what I 'm getting at . Call Earl Hollis and tip him off . Have him set up a meeting in Hollywoodwith the others in the syndicate . They 'll find out once and for1o6 MY NAME IS MORGANall what the situation is .... I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... I 'm okay , Sol . If I need anything , I 'll call you ... . Thanks . Be sure to do that now , wo n't you ? " He sat , perspiring slightly , in the closeted warmth of the telephone booth . He put in another coin and dialed Lorraine . Her mother 's voice answered . " This is Larry . Can I speak to Lorraine , please ? " " Is there something wrong ? " " No . Lorraine will tell you about it later . " Lorraine 's sleepy anxious voice came on . " Larry , darling . Why are you calling at this hour ? " " I 'm leaving for California . I 'm at the airport now , with Jack Mor-gan . " " You 're joking . " " No . This all came up suddenly . I 'll write you and tell you about it . I just wanted to call and say good-by . " " When will you be back ? " " I 'm not sure . But I do n't think it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was a little excited . A brassy voice camethrough a loudspeaker : " Passengers for flight 173 . Passengers forflight 173 . Boarding now at Gate 5 . " The hum of the announcement seemed to fill the tiny closeted booth . " Darling , I 've got to run . I love you . I 'll call you from California when I know more about this . " " Larry ... " " Yes . " " " I  --  I do n't know what to say . This is all so . . . quick . Be careful , wo n't you ? " As her tiny voice crackled caution , he heard the summoning of the loudspeaker . " Darling , I have to go or I 'll miss my plane . I 'll come back as soon as I possibly can . Good-by . " He heard her faint " good-by " as he was putting the receiver back into place on its hook . He left the phone booth and saw Morgan emerging from his . A bustle of movement was in the terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and people threading swiftly in and out toward varying destinations . AtMY NAME IS MORGAN 107the circular newsstand the clerks were rapidly making change , handing out newspapers and magazines . Morgan fell in beside him . " Did you make your calls ? " " Yes . " They went together toward Gate 5 , where a crowd was already gathered and was dwindling one by one , through the narrow doorwaywhere their tickets were checked . Beyond lay the concrete apron of the airfield and the planes waiting . " You married ? " Morgan asked , as they waited their turn . " Engaged . I just called my fiancee . " " You 're still young , " Morgan said . " Enjoy yourself while you can . " They moved a step nearer to the doorway and the ticket checker . Morgan said , " There 's a hell of a lot of difference between romanceand marriage . The same difference between window-shoppingand a sale . All at once everything gets down to brass tacks and real life starts to show through . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way through the door and showed their tickets . A few minutes later they were crossing through darkness to where the huge silvery jet plane 's lights were glowing red-and-blue . They went up the staircase past the smiling stewardess and inside the plane Larry found his seat two rows behind Morgan 's . When a sturdy self-possessed little man with a briefcase showed up to claim the seat beside Morgan , Larry spoke to him and arranged a transfer . He sank down beside Morgan just as the jets trembled the plane to life . Morgan got a cup of water from the stewardess and swallowed a pill . " This is the only time on a flight that I get nervous , " he said . " I 've got high blood pressure . This stuff keeps it down . " The jet plane wheeled around into position . Beyond the far reach of metallic gray-green wing was the thickly grown garden of luminousblue lights marking the runway . The jets roared and thin black streamers raced backward like shadows and the plane moved faster and the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights below and tiny Long Island towns shining like crowded pinholes of light in carbon paper . When Larry turned , Morgan had drifted off into a troubled doze . His rather square face was solid as stone and beneath bushy black brows the narrow eyelids showed a trace of white eyeball. rob MY NAME IS MORGANLarry picked a gold-bound magazine from the rack and began to read an article that attempted to forecast the immediate future of the economy , weighing the increase in industrial output with a slump in new car sales , the plateau of consumer buying , the federal budget deficit , and adding these imponderables to a sum of ponderableperhaps . After fifteen minutes he turned to see that Morgan'shead had sagged slightly to one side and his lips bubbled each exhalation of breath . " Mr. Morgan . " The plane banked and Morgan rolled with the movement . Larry touched his shoulder . Morgan 's eyes opened . " Are you all right ? " Larry asked . " I thought that pill might have knocked you out . " " I 'm okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stared out the window , unfocused . " Where are we ? " " We 've been under way about twenty minutes . I 'd guess Pennsyl-vania . " Morgan blinked , but the whites of his eyes stayed prominent . There was a slight thickness in his speech . " Did I tell you why I was making this trip ? " " No . " " I 've found the writer to handle The Apostles . Only he 's tied down to another assignment and I 've got to shake him loose . " " It must be hard to find a man who can rewrite the Bible . " Morgan grinned . " This movie is going to make the Bible famous . Wait and see . We 're going to do it with class . I never buy the idea you ca n't sell class to the public  --  only you got ta give them the rest with it . Lots of action . A production that will knock ' em out of their seats . Drown ' em in colors . Dazzle ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry . Then you 've got a picture that will have the crowds waiting in line at the box office . " For an instant , vibrating to the sound , something inside Larry respondedas a tuning fork , but then the hum of persuasion ceased . He remembered who Jack Morgan was : ex-carnival huckster , producerof burlesque-type musical comedies . Larry said , " I guess most of the Biblical epics do pretty well . I do n't go to them myself . " " You 'll go to this one . Are you religious ? " " No " MY NAME IS MORGAN 109 " You do n't believe in anything ? " " Not in the way you mean . " " A man has to believe in something , " Morgan said . " Where do you think we go when we die ? " " I suppose I 'll find out when the time comes . " " Yeah , " Morgan said . " We all will . " He sank back against the pillow . The stewardess moved down the aisle toward them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm Jewish . You know that ? " " Yes , " Larry said . " Jews believe in religion more than your people . We had to fight a hell of a lot longer to keep it . " " I do n't think that 's a reason , " Larry said . " As a matter of fact , my father was a very religious man . He was a minister . " " No kidding ? My grandfather was a rabbi . " They were flying almost soundlessly above dark level plains occasionallyillumined by city splashes of white and yellow and orange light in which ghostly towers rose like child toy shapes . " I wonder what they 'd have thought of us , " Morgan said . " My grandfather called me a bum because I did n't go to shul every week . " For Larry , putting his father and Morgan together in imagination brought an odd reaction . In the full roar of contempt for Jack Morgan , his father would not have seen the man . He would have dismissedMorgan with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of invective . Pirate flying his solitary flag with the skull and crossbones . Vulture pecking at the skeletons of the helpless to sustain his scrawny life . Larry said , " My father did n't approve of anybody who tried to make money . He was a great believer in being poor . " " That 's pretty easy to do if you put your mind to it . A lot easier than getting rich . " Morgan stared out the window at the immense cup-curve of dark blue sky . " Just the same , everybody needs something he can pray to . It 's a relief to bow your head to something bigger than you are . " " I wo n't argue about that , " Larry said . " Maybe you 'll find something someday . " Pale streamers of mist foamed over the edge of the plane wings . The stewardess stopped at their seat. no MY NAME IS MORGAN " We 'll be serving in an hour , " she said . " Would you like a cock-tail ? " " No , thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey . " He turned on his side and shifted the pillow beneath his head . Larry pushed the release and tilted back in his seat . Brightly colored folders in the slit pocket on the seatback faced him but he glanced at them without interest . He found it odd that Morgan should be religious . It seemed out of keeping with his character . Morgan 's faith could not be deep , and yet it might be a source of his profound belief in the future , the unflagging optimism that passed for courage . Not real courage , Larry thought , because it takes more courage for an atheist to die in bed than for a Christian martyr to go to the cross . Suppose this plane were to crash . Who would sort out passengers for heaven or hell ? Up or down , sir . Which way ? Man is a thistle ball who in death crumples to nothing . He dozed a little . After a while he awoke . Morgan was moving restlessly and finally stood up . He had regained his amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going back to the lounge for a drink . Care to come along ? " " Sounds like a good idea , " Larry said . The lounge , a semicircular arrangement of booths and small round tables , was almost full . They were looking about for a seat when a voice rose above the babble : " Hey , Jack ! Jack Morgan ! " A man , half risen in a cramped seating space , waved to them . Morgan went over to him , and Larry followed . The man shook hands with Morgan vigorously . " What a coincidence  --  meeting you here . After all these years , " he said . " How 've you been ? " He was a medium-sized man with a barrel-deep chest , and his homely face had a certain force and vigor . He had a broad fleshy nose , too-thick lips , and rather small gray eyes , but his smile crinkledthe lines of his face into a pleasing pattern . Morgan made the introduction . " Larry , this is an old army pal . Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " O'Keefe said . " Let 's have a drink . " MY NAME IS MORGANThe efficient blonde stewardess brought dry martinis on a metal tray . Sipping his drink slowly , Larry kept a responsive smile fixed on his face . He was not really listening to the conversation , but after a few minutes , against his will , something filtered through . He learned that Johnny O'Keefe was a pilot who had toured around with Morgan during the war when Morgan had been in special services , assigned to help produce shows for the military . They were talking now about a time they commandeered an abandoned farmhouse as a rehearsal hall . It had once been a Nazi command post and the Nazis had left behind their wireless equipmentintact . During a break in rehearsals of a show to be known as Patton 's Follies , the star sat down to tinker with the sending set . There was a shattering roar and flying debris . Thoughtful Nazis had booby-trapped the sending set , and their star was taken to the hospitalwith sixty pieces of shrapnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the metal out of that poor bastard 's ass , " Morgan said . Their reminiscence drifted to a time when O'Keefe had been impatientfor action , had taken a plane and mounted it with a gun to go on strafing missions behind the lines . " You were the best damn pilot I ever saw , " Morgan said . " You could 've been an ace . By the way , Johnny , what are you doing these days ? " " I run a flying school . Got three Cessnas and a couple of guys working for me who give lessons . We also fly some short hops to a few towns not covered by regular carriers . Mostly to accommodate business customers of mine . " " Sounds good . " O'Keefe shrugged . " It 's a living . If you need somebody to tour you around while you 're in California , I 'll be glad to oblige . " " I 'll keep that in mind . " After two more martinis Morgan excused himself and walked a long , swaying path to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry . " I 've always been crazy about that guy . Ninety percent hokum . But the other ten percent is better than anybodyyou 'll ever know . " " I ca n't imagine him as a soldier . " O'Keefe chuckled . " His identification card read Captain but all112 MY NAME IS MORGANhe did was stage a few shows . That was in the last weeks when the German front was falling apart . He was only overseas a few months . You a friend of Morgan 's ? " " I know him in a business way . " " He 's a great guy , " O'Keefe said . " A really great guy . " There was a silence . " I only saw him once since the army , " O'Keefe said . " A few years ago at a cocktail party . We sneaked out to a bar and got loaded and picked up a couple of babes . I woke up in a hotel room with Morgan still asleep in an armchair . We 'd been rolled for every penny we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , the hotel manager ended up inviting us to stay for a week . " " Sounds like Morgan . " In a changed tone O'Keefe said , " You do n't like him , do you ? " " I do n't know him well enough . " O'Keefe put a thumb to the side of his fleshy nose . " I 'd rather have Morgan in my corner than anybody I know . He just does n't give up when he 's licked . He 'll fight long after they lock up the arena and all the customers go home . " Larry turned his martini glass within its own wet circle . " You 've got to know him to understand him , " O'Keefe went on . " A lot of people do n't approve of him . But we practically lived togetheroverseas and I can tell you he 's got one big thing going for him . " " What 's that ? " " He does n't get scared . He 's got guts enough to try anything ... and brains enough to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here 's to guts . " O'Keefe glowered . " Here 's to Morgan , " he said , and drained his Scotch and water . They sat quietly a few moments , measuring their hostility , surrounded by a babble that made conversation unnecessary . Morgan returned to their table . " They 're starting to serve in a couple of minutes . Time enough for a quick one . " When they returned to their seats , the attractive blonde stewardessfixed trays in place before them . She was just serving sandwiches when a man wearing the blue cap and uniform of a crew member came up to Larry , holding a slip of paper in his hand . MY NAME IS MORGAN iii " Mr. Whirter ? Message for you . " Larry opened the folded paper and read : EVERYTHING ARRANGED . HOLLIS WILL CONTACT YOU AT BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL TO SET UP MEETING . SOL . Morgan was prodding open the cellophane wrapped sandwich with his stubby fingers . Seized with an impulse as clear as a hypnoticcommand , Larry handed the message over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surprised glance Morgan took the message and read it . The hard , square face did not noticeably change expression . He handed the message back . " I guess this means Earl Hollis is looking for a showdown , " he said . " Well , now you can relax and enjoy the trip . " " No sense in your asking me a lot of questions now . I 'll save all the answers for Hollis when we get there . " About an hour afterward their plane was soaring high over the Rockies . Inside the cabin a card was passed back to Morgan , telling their location , ground speed , wind speed , and on the card a dot indicatedtheir approximate position on a map of the United States . Morgan looked at it and passed the card back over his shoulder to a hand that reached for it . Far , far below them was the dot that was a city . Dark and light passed . The plane passed . Jack Morgan 's chin sank slowly to his chest . Dot upon dot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words came . In the Beginning were the words . Words came in endless columns across the white land , over the peaked clouds . Words became fluttering sheets of paper ... borne on a spouting fountain of black oil . Put them together in a hurry . Words before numbers . Numbers are weakness . Fitful wakefulness . Earl Hollis one more hurdle along the endless line of track ... of track . All committees fall off the wall and one bright man picks them up and puts them together again . Word glue . Talk to the writer ... his name ? He saw the face clearly ... lean-bearded , with large liquid eyes .... Oh , Christ , no .... Time enough to114 MY NAME IS MORGANroll away this rock and there will be enough ... Only ca n't fool the people . Money 's worth . Money 's proof . Sara had short plump hands . One evening having coffee together she let him pick up her hand and hold it . Her hand was soft and he kneaded the skin below the thumb where the mound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown eyes full of misunderstanding .  --  Is something wrong ? she asked . Sara was one of the Chosen People . Chosen for shame and injury and insult . Chosen to be hedged in and ovened and over there in another country killed faster than we are born . In this land they kill in the cradle , with the first words . Sheenie ... sheenie ... kike.  --  He 's a dirty Yid , dirty Yid.  --  Let him up . In the school courtyard cement rough under him and the basketballhoop high overhead . Nobody 's head dropped through . Score one for our side . John Casey , not a friend exactly but he let him hang around and John was the biggest toughest boy in the school.  --  Hey , Jacob , do my homework for me , will ya ?  --  Sure , John.  --  Hey , Jake , y'gotta dime ? Tiny , shiny dime lost forever . John Casey , boon beyond price . John said let him up and they let him.  --  What about it , Jake ? Want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are ya , Jake ? Ever been with a girl ?  --  Lots of times.  --  This one 's one of your people . Can she shake and rumble beneath the sheets . Oh , Mama . Sara was not in a house , really , but she made appointments and this night there were five . John Casey went first , by unquestioned right of the strong , and the others sat hardly letting their eyes meet and when they did smiling nervously and looking down between their legs . Listening carefully he could hear sounds from the other room . John Casey at last came to the door with sweat glistening on his forehead and Jacob saw him and smiled with a twitch of nervousness . John said with a sudden and uncalled for vehemence :  --  Whassamatter , sheenie ? You got something to laugh at ?  --  I was n't laughing , John . MY NAME IS MORGAN 115  --  You better not , Jew boy . John put his cap on the back of his head and went out of the house without speaking to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and then after a long time his turn came . He went into a long low room with a single floor lamp burning beyond the bed and a small square window at the far end . She was sitting on the bed wearing only a pink slip a bit frayed at the edges and her hair was long and brown and fell to shoulders that were white and bare . He had thought that he could not , but after a minute he became aware that he could and she helped him , keeping her brown eyes on his and making little noises in her throat and then holding him tight tight tight and through the time of yearning until he was broken on the rack of her sweetness.  --  Sara , can I see you again ? I do n't mean like this . Just to see you and go out.  --  If you want to . Dates together , going for a walk or to the movies and sitting holdinghands as though there were not this other thing waiting afterward . Love was strange and part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her as a Jew . He seized her arm.  --  You 're not going with another man.  --  Take your hand off me.  --  Sara , please ... Eyes and mouth opened in mock surprise.  --  Listen to him . You do n't own me , Jacob . I do what I please . In a fury he pushed her and she slapped him . His heart was beatingtoo fast and he knew further talk was useless . It was lost and over with and it was the beginning of his invulnerability . Swallow down choking hurt and suddenly you can breathe because the secretis never to let anyone know you are hurt . Public injuries never heal . Failure is the sin and weakness the shame . Keep swallowing hurts like huge metal cans in the revolving jaws of garbage trucks . Bump of jangling cans against mangler garbage pours in and curved wheels grind up digestible portions whump-phlat , whump , phlat , whumphlat , great toothless gums masticating spoonfuls of cereal . " Jack , are you asleep ? " O'Keefe standing in the aisle , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling in soon , " O'Keefe said . " Make sure to look me up while you 're in town . Where are you staying ? " " The Beverly Hills . " O'Keefe handed him a business card . " I 'll call you if I do n't hear from you . Let 's have a real night on the town . " " It 's a date , " Morgan said . Above each seat tiny white yellow signs blinked on , No smoking please , Fasten your seat belts . O'Keefe returned to his seat . Morgan buckled himself in . Below were the blue mountains of the Sierra Nevada , wearing their ski-white caps . The plane rose on a sick slow lurch of air humping below and rolling them over its back like a playful kitten . As the plane wing dipped , there was the first heavy pouring of the Pacific , unmoving as molten lead beyond dark blue mountains . " That 's Los Angeles , is n't it ? " Larry asked . " Yeah , " Morgan said . The array of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had assaulted this city before . It was not impregnable . He tried to remember what he knew about Simon Lev . " Life Is Eternal , " brief run of a Broadway play , and a book  --  what was its title ?  --  Master and Men . Nothing much . Nothing to shape a character or plan an attack . Hollis waiting too . Aiming questions like cannon . The great plane banked lower , sweeping in toward the city that was guarding hostile thunder until they were within range . They began leveling off for the approach . Coming in now . Steady . Steady . Jack Morgan shifted in his seat , placing his feet firmly . It would be all , or a smoking wreck . .. . CHAPTER VIn the late afternoon Morgan drove a rented white Cadillac convertible through the Hollywood hills , past Spanish stucco homes clinging to the hillside . Their modest one-story fronts and threestoryfallaways behind were like the problems life confronted him with , the same deceptively simple facade and the unexpected depths . He was not discouraged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to California to find a writer had become a sharper crisis ; Earl Hollis and his investor friends were waiting , and he could not put them off . And Larry Whirter , the human computer , would be there to add up Morgan 's answers and find the excuses wanting . But Morgandid not divide problems into categories or into people ; having met crises head-on for so many years , he could no longer think of them as made up of bits and pieces ; it was all one problem , one need to survive , and you either did or you did n't . Sometimes the threat was acute , sometimes not , but he could never let down his guard , because the next thrust might get through to him . His real contacts were with things rather than people , and he regarded peopleonly as a means to get the things he wanted . He passed a home with a high front wall , another with a stone fountain in the garden , and a third with a great eucalyptus tree and a picnic table beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Simon Lev 's home just ahead , outside a Spanish stucco house with an outer staircase that descended the hill . He pulled into the drivewayof the garage and parked behind a year-old Buick . A tall man answered his ring at the doorbell . In the dusky interiorMorgan could not make him out clearly . " My name is Jack Morgan . " " Come in , " said the familiar , accented voice . In the foyer , as his vision adjusted to the absence of sunlight , Morgan saw a tall , unhandsome man with kindly eyes and a slightly receding chin who wore a black skullcap pushed back far enough so Morgan could see the bald head beneath it . From another room he heard children 's voices squealing with laughter , and out of the corner of his eye he caught a flash of two small shapes darting across the foyer . A moment later , from another room , there began a high wailing , a sound like a high-pitched rubbernoisemaker with air being squeezed out of it . The wailing continuedbeyond the possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the shrill violence of an air raid alarm . " That 's the baby , " Simon Lev said . " The commotion you hear is usual here . We have six children . " " Congratulations , " Morgan said . Then he asked worriedly , " Is there a place we can talk ? " Simon Lev smiled . He had a gold cap on a prominent tooth . " Of course . Come in to my study . " 3.3L8 MY NAME IS MORGANThe small study room consisted of a desk , two chairs , and several rows of bookshelves , the door safely closed against the uproar beyond . Simon said , " There is n't much time , Mr. Morgan . We 're making preparations for sundown . We are Orthodox , you know . " " That 's interesting , " Morgan said . " My family used to observe the Sabbath , too . " Simon Lev nodded with a slight impatience . " If you came this far to see me , you must be serious about wanting me to write your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . " I told you on the phone . You can have a firm twelve weeks at three thousand per . " " That 's a lot higher than my agent 's asking price . I 'm sure she would be pleased . But I tried to explain that I 've already signed a contract . " " Who with ? " " Group Artists . " " I know Max Molinsky over there . I 'll get you out of it . " " I 'm not certain that I can do the kind of job you want . I 've had no experience in writing motion pictures . " Morgan 's face bore the faintest of smiles . The lure had been cast , the hook taken , and now the trick was to play the line easily , not reeling in too fast . " What kind of a project are you working on with Max Molinsky ? " Morgan asked . " It 's a low-budget movie , but it has good possibilities . It 's based on a short story about a young gang of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teen-age girl thinks she 's pregnant ... : ' Simon Lev went on telling him about the plot of the movie and Morgan was sure now what kind of man he was dealing with . He had not understood why Simon Lev would have agreed to write a low-budget thrill movie about teen-agers . This one , however , was based on a literary short story , though it had the built-in exploitation angles of juvenile delinquency , teen-age pregnancy , and crime . These angles had caught Max Molinsky 's attention , but Max was shrewd enough to realize be bad a good chance of getting better than a B-movie with the right approach . Max would exploit the basic situation for the thrill seekers while the literary values , handled by a solid craftsman like Simon Lev , would come through in the finalMY NAME IS MORGAN ugscreenplay and help Max beat off the censors and perhaps even attractwell-heeled first-run audiences to see a " social documentary . " Simon Lev finished telling him about the movie and Morgan lighted a fresh cigar and leaned back . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said to Simon Lev . " It shows you understand how movies are put together even though you do n't have much experience . In some movies it 's better to get a writer who does n't know all the cliches . " Simon said , " It will be an interesting experience  --  for me . I hope Mr. Molinsky will like it , when I finish the screenplay . " The time had come to start reeling in . Morgan said , " The main thing to remember is not to think about a movie as a movie . It 's a story , told in pictures instead of words . Now , I do n't even want The Apostles to be treated as an ordinary movie . It 's got to be a kind of pageant , a re-creation of the great scenes of the Bible .... " Morgan avoided any suggestion that The Apostles would be anotherBiblical movie . Intuitively , he knew that Simon Lev would not approve of a project designed strictly for the masses . Simon Lev had integrity and a solid understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never wrote The Apostles he would go on building a reputation and a career , becoming admired by fellowwriters , and one day he would write the book or the play or the motion picture that would move him into the front rank of money earners . All that Morgan could lure him with was a short cut to sudden success . But it had to be a challenge . That was the way to handle him . " I 've always thought of the Bible as a kind of play , " Simon said thoughtfully . " All the pictures are there , all the characters defined , and everything points to the inevitable climax .... " " Right , " Morgan said . " That 's the way I want you to do the outlinefor me . " To his surprise , Simon interrupted : " I 'm sorry , Mr. Morgan . I ca n't accept your offer . " " Why not ? " " From what you tell me , it 's a big project and will take a good deal of time . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other movie . I ca n't spare that time . I 'm working on a book , and want to get back to it as soon as I can . I only accepted Group Artists ' offer to get a little money ahead so I could finish the book . " 120 MY NAME I S MORGAN " The Apostles is going to be a lot more important than your book . I guarantee that . " Simon Lev 's eyes became veiled and Morgan instantly realized his mistake . " You 're quite right , Mr. Morgan , " Simon said slowly . " My book is not important at all  --  except to me . " " I did n't mean that . Believe me , I 'm not measuring a literary work just by the box office . I meant The Apostles will be the kind of movie you 'll always be proud to have been associated with . " Morgan was angry with himself for his blunder . He had to redeem himself quickly before his whole line unraveled . Simon Lev said , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan . This just does n't fit into my plans . Your offer is very flattering but I 'm afraid the answer is no . " Morgan tried to keep tenseness out of his voice . " We do n't know how long it 'll take . Let 's get started on it and see what happens . If everything goes well , we can wrap up all the writing in a few weeks . " " That is n't likely . " The cold flat answer jarred Morgan . " As a matter of fact , " he said , " it has to be done that fast . I need a first draft right away . I 've got to get to work on sets and casting . If we hammer out an outline in the next few days . . . " Simon Lev answered , " You can find a hundred better-qualified writers to do the job . Now I think you must excuse me . It is only half an hour to sundown and I have to get ready for Shabbath . " Simon opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctantly . " When can we talk this over again ? To-morrow ? " " Shabbath lasts from Friday sundown until the end of twilight on Saturday . We do not work until then , Mr. Morgan . Remember the Old Testament . Six days you shall labor and do all your work . But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God . You shall not do any work ... : " Morgan shifted the cigar in his mouth . " If I tried to take a day off , it 'd kill me . " Things had not gone the way he expected and he was trying to maintain contact . " Every man to his own belief , Mr. Morgan . " MY NAME IS MORGAN lzlMorgan hesitated . " You 'll think about it , wo n't you ? I 'll drop over tomorrow night . " Simon shook his head gently . " I will not have thought abut it , Mr. Morgan . We are pious Jews , and we observe Shabbath strictly . We do not concern our thoughts with work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even answer the telephone . " Morgan shook his head admiringly . " How do you do it , in a tough racket like this ? I mean , everybody 's working against a deadline . How do you just decide to shut up shop ? " " My grandfather did it before me . " " Yeah . But things were different in his day . " As they left the study , Morgan was surprised at a sudden quiet which seemed to have settled over the house . Even the wailing of the baby had stopped . In the living room he saw a Bible lying on top of several volumes of the Jewish encyclopedia . Two boys and a girl , dressed in holiday clothes , were sitting on the sofa nearby , and their air of imminent amusement reminded Morgan of something . " They look like we used to on Seders , before the asking of questions , " Morgan said . Simon Lev smiled . " That is one of the perils of Passover . " " I 'll bet they throw you some toughies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good at that myself . " Simon Lev 's smile broadened to show his prominent gold tooth . " If God began everything , then who began God ? " Morgan rolled the cigar in his teeth . " Yeah . Questions like that . My grandfather was a rabbi , you know . " " I did n't know . " Morgan noted the quickening of interest , the slight tug on the line . " We kept all the holidays . I remember we had some great Seders . " " Simon waited a moment before he asked , " Would you care to have dinner with us , Mr. Morgan ? " " You 're sure I wo n't be intruding ? " Simon Lev answered , " The Bible also tells us to give cheer to the stranger within our gates . " Simon 's wife and five of the children were already gathered in the living room . Simon 's wife lighted the tall candles and said the Licht Bentchen while from the bedroom the baby signified its presencewith a cooing babble. 122 MY NAME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to perch oddly there . He sat with his head bowed , among the others , while Simon gave the ancient prayer of the Sabbath , Kabbalat Shabbat , and later he tried to join in singing the Shabbath hymns . But he had forgotten the Hebrew and could only make sounds as harmonious and inobtrusive as possible . How many years had it been since he had last shared ritual ? Suddenlyhe had a clear vision of himself with his father , at a Seder , and all the words , clothed with a familiar mystery , fell into mournful rhythms . He saw Simon Lev watching him and realized that his own eyes were dim with wetness . " My friend , " Simon said , " I did not know that the old rituals still mean so much to you . " Morgan said , " I did n't either . " He lifted his head to look around the others at the table . He wished he could smoke a cigar . Watching Simon and his wife , Morgan wondered at their simple and complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirs in modem times . And what did they get for it ? Did they have a feeling of belonging to the tribe that began in Abraham 's house ? There must be a need Simon and his family felt that was satisfied only by repeatingthe acts and ceremonies of times forgotten . What was it ? Morgan ( born Jacob Moscowitz ) , sitting in the parlor of the stucco home , wondered . The sense of mission of some Jews had no real meaning to him . He accepted the fact that he was Jewish , but the change of his name had only recorded a change that had taken place within himself a long time before . But there was something about the Hebrew ritual that fascinated him and in a moment he found the clue . It was the emotion that hung around old ceremonies like the ghost image on a television screen , not really a part of the action , but almost as visible . That was the kind of emotion that should be incorporated into The Apostles , and Simon Lev was the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon Lev gently touched Morgan 's shoulder and Morgan understood that Simon still thought him to be deeply moved by the ceremony . He waited a second before he rose ; everything , even sincerity , was a matter of timing . MY NAME IS MORGAN 123 " This has been a great experience , " he said . " I want to thank you . " " You are a different man from the one I 've been led to expect , " Simon Lev said , offering his hand . " I 'll look forward to seeing your motion picture . " " I only wish I could get the religious feeling of Shabbath into it , " Morgan said . He turned to Simon earnestly . " How many people realize that the apostles were devout Jews ? I want to show that it was possible at that time to be a good Jew  --  and a good Christian . " Simon nodded . " The apostles were men moved by a great new vision , but they were not deserters from a cause , like so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breakers of tradition . But they considered themselves to be Jews , followers of the true Messiah that the Jewish people had been awaiting for two thousand years . " Morgan smiled slightly . " Quite a job , trying to get all that into a movie . It can be done  --  by the right man . " " A big challenge . I agree with you . " Morgan answered with a sad fervor , " I want to make a movie that will entertain millions of people . But I want it to lift up their hearts , too . I want them to realize that the apostles were men of flesh and blood  --  with deep religious convictions . Above all , I want to show that before and even after they were disciples of Christ , they were Jews . " They went to the door silently . Outside , the music of a million crickets seemed to fill the perfumed night air . In the darkness the crickets softly rustled their wings . And waited . Simon Lev spoke with solemn feeling , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To show what kind of thoughts and emotions really moved those men to do the things they did . " " No writer can do anything but his best . I just need somebody who realizes that it will take his best to do it . " There was a long pause . " Do you think you can get me out of my contract with Group Artists ? " Simon Lev asked . " I 'm sure of it . " " Then , " Simon said , " if you still want me , I 'm your man . " Without speaking , Morgan put his hand in Simon 's . He knew that Simon was still full of the vision and he did not want to say any-124 MY NAME IS MORGANthing that might disturb the mood . Then the right words came . " I knew from the first you were the one to handle it . After all , was n't Peter the leader of the apostles ? And his name was originally Simon . " He had remembered that from his background reading for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not break the rhythm . Simon smiled gently . Morgan went to the driveway and climbed into his Cadillac . He waved to Simon , standing in the doorway , almost transfigured in moonlight . Well , Morgan thought , he had landed his writer . He threw the gear into reverse and backed out of the driveway . As they worked together , he would lead Simon away from the narrowreligious angle . That approach was fine , but The Apostles needed a broader appeal . After all , he could not afford to make a movie that would offend millions of people who did n't share Simon 's intense religious feeling . This was not going to be a Christian or a Jewish movie . Atheists bought tickets too . Morgan lived by the old axiom that a showman sells entertainment , not sermons . Entertainmentwith a great big Capital E.He drove away from the house , the big car purring smoothly down the gently curving road . During the weeks ahead he would have plenty of chance to work over Simon . There would be practical problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to die , he would hardly be aware of how much his original concept was changed . Only one idea about this movie had to remainconstant : Morgan 's . He would hold on to that through all the fights , all the arguments , all the opinions of people who saw it differently . Let them color in the squares he assigned to them ; the paintingwas his own . His thoughts returned to Larry Whirter and the next problem waiting ahead like a blind turn in the road . He was confident he could get around it . Driving through moonlight dappled with palm-tree shadows , he thought : things are starting to go my way . Larry Whirter had not been in Los Angeles a full day before he was sure he hated it . He hated the lights in the palm trees that touched the drooping fronds with crimson and blue and pale yellow , and the stores with their Diner 's Club and American Express andMY NAME IS MORGAN 125Hilton Carte Blanche symbols . The whole town was a dry oasis watered with credit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car on the street was a Jaguar , a status symbol consonantwith wealth and individuality , the conformist 's idea of nonconformity , like the expensively casual sports clothes and the sprawlingmagnificence of homes that lacked foundations . Hollywood seemed to him to revel in its conspicuous and gaudy lack of ostentation ; everyone spoke as equals , even movie stars and bus boys , but the class lines were drawn as rigidly as in Calcutta . On Hollywood Boulevard the names of movie greats were set in gold stars on the pavements for tourists to walk on , their immortalitysealed with the public 's notary stamp of chewing gum . In front of Grauman 's Chinese Theatre crowds matched their feet to celebratedfootprints , seeking a metatarsal brotherhood . Larry disliked the Beverly Hills Hotel , where Morgan had reservedtheir rooms . To Larry , the high-piled stone building , haughty in its privacy on an island above the street 's workaday ebb and flow , was trying to maintain a spurious grandeur . Even the green portal 's sign of welcome , Bienvenidas Amigos , recalled a past it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the feeble salute of a hemophiliac descendant of royalty to his full-blooded ancestors . On the way out , the other portal read Vayan Con Dios , thereby invokingan alien medieval deity out of place in this town 's tonsured cathedrals , a deity who would have leveled the impious stucco jungle with thunderbolts . On this rainy Friday night , in the quiet elegance of the Scandia Restaurant on Sunset Boulevard , there were no signs of divine anger . At a corner table in the large room beyond the bar Larry Whirter sat with Earl Hollis and Gregory Williams as they plotted the strategy for dealing with Jack Morgan . Earl Hollis was a tall , spare man in his early sixties who had a small black mustache and a full head of gray-black hair . " We got plenty of reason to think Morgan 's been tossing our money around , " Hollis said . " If he has , then I want to know how he 's been doin ' it and for how much , so we can hit him with everything in the book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a short heavy man with a startling pale face and slanting eyes that gave him the look of a white-complexioned Asiatic. 126 MY NAME IS MORGAN " If he 's been stealing from the corporation , I want to see him behind bars . And I 'll spend twice the six hundred thousand we 've got invested just to put him there . " " You 'd better start , " Larry said , " by telling me just what the grounds for your suspicions are . " Hollis touched his lips with his napkin and tossed it crumpled onto the table . " To begin with , I never did trust Morgan 's type . Morgan is n't even his real name . I do n't trust men who 're afraid to use the name they were born with . " " Nevertheless , " Larry said , " you invested a great deal of money with him . And so did your friends . " " I did n't know as much about him then as I do now , " Hollis said . " He 's barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a couple of years ago . " " It 's a pretty risky business , " Larry said . " Mind you , I 'm not defendinghim , Mr. Hollis , but movie producing is subject to violent ups and downs . " Gregory Williams said , " We were shooting crap when we put money into this movie . We thought Morgan had as much in it as we had . It turns out he raised almost all of his wad from a so-called investor 's group that 's really a front for underworld money . " " Their money 's as good as anybody 's , " Hollis said . " But Morgan 's been livin ' too high off the hog since we came into the picture . He 's a big gambler , and we have word from someone who knows , that he dropped some pretty big bundles at Las Vegas and at the race track in the last few months . We 're darn sure it is n't his own money he 's been losin ' . " " Why not ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started with this picture . We did a little investigatin ' , and he 's still broke . And he 's been paying most of his corporation bills in sixty-ninety days . Slow pay for a man who 's supposed to have a million pre-production money sittin ' in the bank . " Gregory Williams added , " Everybody knows how he 's been squandering money on Anne Allen . Where 's all the money coming from ? That 's what we want to know . " " Worst of all , " Hollis said , " is that Morgan has n't gotten anywhere near production yet . But he 's still got that big staff workin ' for him and those fancy offices in New York City . I do n't cotton to the ideaMY NAME IS MORGAN 127of some smart little Yid thinkin ' he 's puttin ' anything over on me . No , sirree . " Gregory Williams looked at Larry with his strangely slanting eyes . " Well , Larry , " he said . " It 's up to you . Do you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stubbing out his cigarette deliberately in an ashtray . " First of all , can the person who told you about Morgan 's gambling losses be at the meeting tomorrow ? " " What 's the point ? " " It will be harder for Morgan to deny a story like that face to face . " Earl Hollis said , " Well , Greg , he 's your friend . Will he come along ? " " I 'm sure he will . As a matter of fact , Louis has an interest in this himself . He 's . . . uh . . . a part of that investor 's group I mentionedbefore . " " Fine , " Larry said . " Now , my second suggestion is one you probablywo n't like . If you want to nail Morgan , you 're going to have to stop being polite . " Earl Hollis asked , " What do you mean by that ? " Larry chose his words carefully . " We 'll have to drop the flimsy pretense that all we want is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Morgan believes it for a minute . And as stockholders , you have a perfect right to demand . . . " " We do n't know enough to call for a showdown , " Earl Hollis cut in . " All we got are suspicions . " " Pretty definite suspicions , " Larry added . " Suppose it turns out we 're wrong ? " Earl Hollis asked . " Suppose Morgan has n't been fiddlin ' around with our money ? Where does that leave us ? " " I should think you 'd be glad to find it out . " " What Earl means , " Gregory Williams said , " is that we 'd have created a lot of hard feelings for no reason . It does n't pay to make enemies if you can avoid it . In business you 're bound to make some enemies anyhow , but you do n't go looking for them . It 's nicer to keep things on a friendly basis . " " You ca n't have it both ways , " Larry said firmly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't agree to let us examine . I 've tried the polite128 MY NAME IS MORGANapproach with him and it does n't work . We 're going to have to play rough . " Earl Hollis asked uncomfortably , " What 're you intendin ' to do ? " " Ask him some pretty direct questions . You 've given me enough material to get started . When I 'm finished , we 'll have a pretty good idea of whether Morgan 's been dipping into the till . " " Then why do n't we wait to see what his answers are ? " Gregory Williams suggested . " If he looks like he 's holding back , or trying to put one over , we can always call for a showdown to examine the corporation 's books . " " I 'm in favor of that , " Earl Hollis said . " Let him get tangled up in his own rope afore we start to tighten up on him . " Larry nodded . " All right , then . We 'll put Morgan through the wringer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll put our requestin terms of an ultimatum . On the other hand , if you 're satisfied with the answers he gives , we 'll still try to get him to open the books . But we 'll keep the party polite . " " Looks to me like we 've got him comin ' or goin ' , " Earl Hollis said . He rubbed his hands . " It 'll be fun lockin ' horns with Mr. Jacob Moscowitz tomorrow . " Larry said nothing . Earl Hollis looked at him challengingly . " That 's Morgan 's real name , you know , " he said . " And we 're gon na show him no shrewd little New York mocky can get the best of us . " Larry picked up his briefcase from the empty chair at the table and began to put papers away . It occurred to him that not far from this spot Balboa and his men had first set eyes on the Pacific . Now he was setting sail on a sea of intrigue with two men he entirely disliked  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful destination . But in business , as he knew well , a man can not chart his own course . The telephone rang in Morgan 's hotel bedroom . " Hello . " " Did I wake you ? " Larry Whirter asked . Morgan sat up in bed . Through window blinds he could see the bright glare of sunlight on the tropical foliage outside his room . " No . I 'm awake . " " I spoke to Earl Hollis yesterday . He 'd like to set up a conference at noon today . " MY NAME IS MORGAN 129The clock on the table near Morgan 's bed read two minutes past ten . Saturday morning was here . " That 's fine . " " Gregory Williams ' house . Mr. Williams is one of the investors . He has a home in Laurel Canyon . " " I 'll meet you in the lobby in an hour . " Morgan sat on the side of his bed and rubbed his eyes . He had been sleeping soundly when the telephone rang . Now his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses came awake . This was a Big Day . On his calendar there were only important days , redletterdays , and Big Days . No space of twenty-four hours passed without decisions of importance , things that had to be moved from doubt to certainty , but as months went by the number of decisions increased until it was hard to tell one from another . All he could remember were the Big Days . Oddly enough , all the Big Days he remembered were good ones . Along the way there must have been Big Days that ended in failure . But he could not remember them now and that meant that they had ceased to be Big Days and were lost in the blur of all the other days that did not matter . He had a regard for a record of success that bordered on piety and was almost religious in its capacity to block out understanding or sympathy with failure  --  even his own . It was difficult for him to pay attention to anything that had not received the official stamp of success , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following his personal imperative , would ignore him as though he had committedan unpardonable social error . From the faraway street a horn honked . As he pulled on his shorts , he remembered how the pilots put it . Any crash you walk away from is a good landing . But you had to walk away and never look back at the wreckage . He picked up the phone . " Room service , please . . . . Hello , room service ? Send up some orange juice , toast , and coffee . Make it quick . " He went into the bathroom and grimaced at his face reflected in the mirror . He was awake now . He picked up the electric razor from a shelf and started to plug it into the socket . As the whirring started he stopped , unplugged the cord , and put the electric razorIgo MY NAME IS MORGANback on the shelf . He took a shaving mug and safety razor out of the white enameled cabinet , dashed cold water onto his face , and poked the bristled brush into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close shave . At quarter past eleven Larry Whirter was in the lobby of the hotel looking at a wall mural when Morgan came up to him . " I 'm ready any time you are , " Morgan said . " Hi , " Larry said . " There 's a cab waiting . " Morgan shrugged and allowed Larry to lead the way . About twenty minutes ' ride from Beverly Hills the taxi mounted a small private road to where Gregory Williams ' house stood at the top of a round hill that surveyed the surrounding country . Larry thought that even by Hollywood standards the home in Laurel Canyonwas impressive . A six-foot hedge wall circled the rambling mansion , and the road went through a wide opening in the hedge to become a driveway at the front of the house . On the lawn were tables with orange and green parasol covers . A West Indian dressed in tight black trousers and a loose-fitting floral shirt opened the door of the taxi . " Mistah Whirter ? Mistah Morgan ? " " Yes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back by the swimmin ' pool . " His voice had the happy lilt of the West Indian tongue . Larry and Morgan followed him along a stone-inset pathway around the house , between rows of high dark hedge . In the rear the house extended deeper than Larry had imagined , and there was a wide expanse of smooth green lawn behind it . Where the hill started to slope downward , a series of wide concrete steps had been fashioned , leading down to a mammoth free-form pool set into a plateauhollowed out of the hillside . Around this pool Larry saw four men gathered , all in their brief swimming trunks . A lean-muscled , gray-haired man was in the act of diving off the board into the pool 's blue water , Gregory Williams was lying back on a sun chair and sipping a drink from a tall glass with a straw ; he was paunchy in his bathing trunks and his skin was pasty white . Earl Hollis sat with another man on the far edge of the pool , their feet dangling in the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small geyser eruptedMY NAME IS MORGAN 131at the spot he entered . He came up a second later and swam with decisive strokes to the pool edge where Earl Hollis and the other man sat . Morgan and Larry descended the wide steps toward the pool . As they neared the bottom , Gregory Williams saw them . He put his drink down on the table . " Hello , there . " He rose and came forward to meet them with his hand extended . " This must be Jack Morgan , " he said . " I 'm glad to know you . " They shook hands all around . Standing , Gregory Williams did not seem as heavy as when lying down . His weight had sagged into his lower stomach and abdomen but his legs were thin and knobby and his arms were slender . A huge twisting artery protruded on his left arm . His long face , in which the slanted eyes like an Oriental'speered deeply , wore a solemn expression . " I appreciate your coming here , " Gregory Williams was saying as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl Hollis , do n't you ? " " Jack Morgan , " Earl Hollis said in a loud cheerful voice . " Sure am glad to see you again . " He shook hands vigorously with Morgan , and shortly with Larry , before he introduced the two other men . The lean graying diver was Tom Ervine and the other pool-sitter was a swarthy thickset man with a chestful of luxuriant dark hair . " I know you , " Morgan said to the swarthy man , " Louis Trotto . " He might have mentioned , Larry thought , that every newspaper reader also knew Louis Trotto , better known as Louie the Hammer , a once prominent figure in Chicago gangsterdom . Now retired , he acted as a kind of counselor emeritus to his former cronies , an unofficialumpire in their disputes , and was well rumored to still have profitable interests in several illicit enterprises in which he was no longer active . He was , Larry realized , the source of Earl Hollis ' confidential information on Morgan 's losses at Las Vegas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louie ? " Morgan asked . Louis Trotto nodded . " Gettin ' along , " he said . He moved a hand over the black forest of hair on his chest and tugged experimentally at a few strands . " Would you like to change and have a dip in the pool before lunch ? " Gregory Williams asked Morgan. 132 MY NAME IS MORGANSo far , no one had addressed a word directly to Larry . He was being made to feel his role of subordinate , a useful though intrusive presence like a stenographer at a Board of Directors ' meeting . At the Scandia last night Earl Hollis and Gregory Williams had been more polite , but that had been only the preliminary , the necessary interlude before the principal contestants met in the main event . " We 'll sit this one out , " Morgan answered . " I want to soak up some of this sun . " He glanced at Larry as he removed his tropical-weight jacket and hung it over an iron chair . He indicated a beach chair next to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan sat down and stretched out his full length . He looked a picture of relaxation in his short-sleeved sport shirt , cigar in mouth , long cool gin and soda at his elbow . " This is the life , " Morgan said . " It could be worse , " said Gregory Williams . " I do n't know why I knock myself out back in New York , " Morgan said , " when all this is waiting here . " Larry checked off a point . Morgan had registered how he slaved in their behalf while they lounged in the sun . The opening riposte was unimportant , but nice . Gregory Williams said , " I 've invited a few girls over later . Nothinglike pretty faces to brighten up a business conference . " A mistake in view of the opening Morgan had chosen . Earl Hollis frowned slightly and Gregory Williams , looking up , became aware and withdrew into his gin and soda . Louis Trotto said heavily , " I ca n't hang around , Greg . I got a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of signal , everyone came to attention . Trotto , sitting cross-legged on a beach mat , stared dispassionately at Morgan . Gregory Williams stirred his drink with a long glass mixer . Tom Ervine stretched self-consciously , tightening muscles across his hard-ribbed chest . Larry , standing nearby , took a step nearer . Earl Hollis smiled widely : " Why do n't we get business talk out of the way so we can all relax and have fun ? " Morgan shrugged . " I 'm willing , " he said , passing the initiative back to the others . MY NAME IS MORGAN 133 " Maybe I should explain about these other fellows , " Earl Hollis began . " You know , Jack , I head up a syndicate that put money into this picture of yours . Well , Greg Williams and Tom Ervine put a little money in with me . And I figured it would be sort of nice if we all got to know each other . " " Always glad to meet money men . They 're a real necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis Trotto chuckled politely . Trotto said in a tone that expected no reply , " Some of my friends already got money in with you , Jack . In a manner of speaking , I 'm standin ' up for their interests . " Silence . Gregory Williams stirred uncomfortably and asked , " Anybody like his drink freshened ? " Heads shook . Larry Whirter said , " No , thanks . " " Of course , " Earl Hollis said a little loudly , " we 're all figgerin ' on making a piece of change out of our investment in Celestial Films . How are things comin ' along , Jack ? " " It 's always a little slow getting started , " Morgan said . " Somethinglike a train picking up speed . First the wheels hardly seem to turn and then , before you know it , you 're racing . " Earl Hollis made a vague gesture . " Some of the boys were afraid you might be spendin ' too much money getting started . We all decidedit would be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just between friends . " " What would you like to know ? " Morgan asked . " Well , for one thing , " Gregory Williams said , " just how far along in production are you ? " " I 've bought a dozen treatments from a dozen writers and I did n't like any of them . But I 've finally found the writer who 'll do the job the way I want it . We 've got most of the costumes and sets designed . We 've launched a publicity campaign and I 've already started to line up a cast . " Earl Hollis said , " Sounds like you 've been pretty busy , Jack . How d' you find time for it all between trips to Las Vegas and the race track ? " Morgan pursed his lips . " I never let pleasure interfere with business , Earl . Anybody who knows the way I operate will tell you the same thing . What I do in my spare time is my own business . " 134 MY NAME I S MORGANLarry said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Provided you do it not only with your own time but with your own money . " For an instant Morgan remained motionless , almost without sign that he had heard . Then he turned to Larry sharply . " Just what are you trying to imply ? " he said . " He 's not trying to imply anything , Jack , " Gregory Williams said placatingly . " Just stating a fact that 's well known to some of us here . You 're a gambling man , and when you win , you win big . And when you lose ... " Louis Trotto said , " You dropped eighteen grand in one day about a month ago at Bowie . And you 've had a bad streak with the handbooksthat handle the big action . Altogether , about a hundred and eighty grand worth of bad luck . " Morgan said , " I did n't know you were keeping tabs on me , Louie . I thought you 'd retired . " " I still keep up with what 's goin ' on . The boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weekend at Vegas a while back . " " I hope the federal government does n't get as nosy as you , Louie . It could get embarrassing . " " You play a lot of high-stakes poker , too , " Louis Trotto said . " And you do n't win too often . " " I win and I lose , " Morgan said . He glanced around at the others and sat up slowly . " What is this ? An inquisition ? " " We just want to know where you 've been getting the money to lose with , " Louis Trotto said . " That 's all . " Morgan looked up at Louis and suddenly grinned . " Well , I do n't mind satisfying a little healthy curiosity . Your information is n't as good as it should be , Louie , or you 'd know that I 'm in hock to some of the best shylocks in town . Just the interest I 'm paying would keep them in blondes for a month . " " It 's all on personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Morgan asked . " No bank would underwrite the fact that I 'm partial to a horse named Broadway Carnival , because it happens to be the name of my second big hit . I bet the nag seven times running , doubling all the way , and lost every time . Then they shipped her to Tanforan and she ran in an allowance race and won . I did n't have a nickel on her . She paid fourteen to one . " Trotto said , " A smart guy like you oughtta know you ca n't beat the ponies . " MY NAME IS MORGAN 135 " Look at the fun I have trying , " Morgan answered good-humoredly . Earl Hollis touched his small mustache with the middle three fingers of one hand . " It 's not our business how you spend your own money , Jack . If you want to be a big spender in the night clubs , that 's fine . You want to bet the horses , that 's fine . But we get worriedwhen we see your corporation  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow in payin ' bills . " Morgan 's face assumed a slightly surprised expression . " Who says it does ? " " We 've had reports , " Gregory Williams said , " that you pay in sixty to ninety days . That is n't good business , Jack . " Earl Hollis said , " You do n't want to get yourself a bad credit ratin ' for a few small items when you 've got a million dollars sittin ' right there in the bank . " Morgan said slowly and distinctly , " When you fellows invested in Celestial Films , you were backing me . That means you were backingthe way I handle things . And this is the way I work . I pay the big bills  --  because those boys can kill you  --  and I let the little ones dangle . Do n't worry about credit . I can raise all the money I need with just a couple of phone calls . Anytime . Anywhere . " " We just hope you 're not gon na need any more money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're all partners in this thing and we do n't like to see you get into any trouble . " " If you ever get really worried about your investment , " Morgan said , " you can have your money back . I 'll raise the money to buy you out . And you 'll make the biggest mistake of your life . Because Celestial Films is going to pay off better than an oil gusher . " Larry , watching , indrew a slight breath . Morgan had made a bold offer , and the issue was joined . By linking an investment in his picture with an oil gusher , he was talking in terms these men understood , spelling out the possibility of huge rewards . Larry looked away , across the wide blue green of the pool , to where a bank of crimson and white flowers waved their scentless heads . " Nobody wants to sneak out the back door to the corral , " Earl Hollis said . " We figger you know your business , Jack . " Larry moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that I think everyone would be happier , Mr. Morgan , if they saw The Apostles actually getting into production . " 136 MY NAME IS MORGAN " It would n't hurt my feelings either , " Morgan said . " But you ca n't always say when production actually begins . How do you figure that oil gusher  --  from the time you survey the land , or sink the first shaft ? Or only when the stuff comes steaming up the pipe ? " The West Indian servant appeared discreetly on the steps above the pool and caught Gregory Williams ' eye . " Time for lunch , " Gregory Williams said . " Let 's adjourn our discussionto the luncheon table , shall we ? " There was a general assent . As the others moved slowly to where a long table had been set on a stone plateau above the pool , Morgan lingered on the steps until Larry came abreast of him . " Quite a hovel , is n't it ? " he asked . " Not bad , " Larry said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercourse as a means of weakening a chief adversary , not to prevent him from doing his job , but to pluck the barb of personal venom . " Would you like to live like this ? " Morgan asked as they mounted a stone step in unison . " It 'd be pretty easy to take , " Larry said . " The trouble is , it 's too easy . " " What do you mean ? " " A man gets soft if he lives like this too long . If you get everythingworth fighting for , you stop fighting . " This was an unexpected admission , an unintended reach towardtruth , and Larry decided to exploit it . " Would you ? " he asked . " Suppose you already had it made , would you quit ? " " Hell no , " Morgan said indignantly . " I got too much to do . If you really want something to happen , you 've got to fight hard for it . You ca n't let anybody get ahead of you even for a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't mean in any particular case . It 's just the only way I know . " " I understand , " Larry said . As they mounted the last stone step , he deliberately broke his rhythm and they did not arrive together . Over the shrimp salad at lunch Larry returned to the attack . The others at the table were engaging in small pleasantries with Morgan , apparently willing to abandon the initiative . " I was impressed with your offices in New York , Mr. Morgan , " heMY NAME IS MORGAN 137said . " That 's a big staff you 've got there . And they all seemed to be pretty busy too . " " I do n't pay anybody to loaf , " Morgan said . " If you have n't got into production yet , what are they all working on ? " Larry asked . " That 's pretty hard to explain , " Morgan said . " And it would be boring to anybody who 's not in the business . " " I 'd like to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Earl Hollis said . " We got our stake in with you , have n't we ? We like to know how it 's being spent . " " It has to do with the reason I got into this end of show business , " Morgan said . " After all , I was doing pretty well on Broadway and I did n't have to move . When I made up my mind to go into pictures I decided to be big or nothing . None of this arty-farty stuff for the little theater crowds . I wanted to get into the big game , play it the way Zanuck and Selznick and Goldwyn play it . There 's money to be made in this business and the funny thing is it 's easier to make millions than thousands . The competition is n't so fierce on the big money level . All you need is the courage to play with the big chips . " No one at the luncheon table seemed to be aware that Morgan had not answered the question . " You were telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Larry said . " I 've set up a ten million dollar budget for The Apostles , " Morgan said . " It takes people to watch that the costs are kept in line . My talent is for makin ' money , not watching it . I figure the budget and then it 's their job to see I do n't go overboard . Plus they look after the couple of million details that I ca n't keep an eye on myself . " Morgan chuckled . " Of course , I 've got to make sure they do n't pinch the pennies so hard that this becomes strictly a barefoot boy pro-duction . " Tom Ervine blankly asked , " What do you mean ? " " The one thing you ca n't afford to do in this business is skimp , " Morgan said . " I 've got to keep lifting my sights so we can hit that hundred million dollar gross we 're aiming at . Maybe you 'd like to know some of the ways I 've been spending that million-dollar kitty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture his-tory . " Tom Ervine said , " I 'd love to . " 138 MY NAME IS MORGAN " You know that chariot scene in Ben HurP " Morgan asked . " I 've heard people say it 'll add twenty million dollars to the eventual take on that picture . Well , they 're wrong . Without that chariot scene Ben Hur would n't gross ten percent of what it 's doing . " With a forkful of shrimp halfway to his mouth Larry paused to look up . A faint note was clear in Morgan 's preamble , and Larry heard it as though an unexpected , perfectly right chord had been sounded in a concerto . Morgan was introducing a new theme , leavingbehind the adagio melancholy mood for a lively scherzo . Morgan said , " I got something worked out for The Apostles that will make Ben Hur 's chariot race look like a picture postcard . " " What 's that ? " Tom Ervine asked , dutifully prompt . " Do n't forget , " Morgan said , " our story has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman soldier like in The Robe , who only got hold of Christ 's garment . Not Moses in Ten Commandments . Not Ben Hur . " He waited , as though he were making a special announcement : " We 've got the Saviour himself . " Larry slowly put down his fork on the plate before him . The others were impressed by the ultimate in Morgan 's declaration . Glancing at them , Larry had the odd feeling of being a member of an orchestra in which only he and the conductor , Morgan , knew what was happening . " In the original treatment we were just going to concentrate on Jesus and the disciples in that scene where He feeds the multitude . With a few camera tricks we could have faked enough of a crowd . Then we changed it , and got a scene of Christ feeding the multitudethat will lift the hair on your head . " Tom Ervine was nodding already . Morgan went on softly , " Picture it . The whole mountainside black with people listening to the greatest teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't eat or drink until somebody reminds Jesus that the people are hungry . And Jesus says , pass out what you 've got . There is n't enough to feed a dozen people but Jesus says , go on , pass it around . " His voice lifted to meet the vision , " And no matter how much food they hand out to those hungry people there 's always more . They never run out of it . And we cut back to the face of Jesus watching , all lit up with a holy glow , and we know this is a miracle . Pretty soon the people know it , too , and they andMY NAME IS MORGAN 139the apostles fall down on their faces and the whole mountain comes alive with ten thousand voices singing the praises of the Lord . " " God , " said Tom Ervine after a moment , " that 's beautiful . " Agreeableness was Tom Ervine 's distinguishing character trait . Curious , Larry thought , how mistaken the first impressions of peoplecan be . When he had first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim with hard purposeful strokes he had marked him as a leader of the group . But Ervine was a hanger-on , the weak member of the wolf pack , tolerated by the others for reasons of loyalty or simple kindness to their kind . When Larry glanced at the others he realized that Morgan was holding them spellbound . Earl Hollis was partly turned away in his chair , one arm draped loosely over the back with his head turned to Morgan as fixedly as a mesmerized rabbit . Louis Trotto was movingthe flat of his hand absently over his hairy chest , and after a moment his back teeth came together with a small clicking sound . Gregory Williams stirred his gin and soda , seemingly unaware of the rhythmical musical clinics the stirrer made against the glass . " Listen , " Morgan said , " I do n't say it 's bad to compromise . You ca n't afford to do everything . In that big scene leading up to the Crucifixion , for example , I was going to stage the Saviour carrying the Cross so that nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up I knew I could n't afford to do it . All the way up that hill , with the Roman soldiers jeering at Him , and the sweat like blood on His forehead . And that great moment when the woman lends Him her handkerchief to wipe the sweat and her handkerchiefcomes away with the imprint of His face . " " Jesus , " Tom Ervine said and it was unclear whether he meant more than an imprecation . Larry said forcefully , " That does n't seem like such an expensive scene to film . " " In the crowd , " Morgan said , ignoring him , " I was going to spot all the key characters from other scenes in the movie . Lazarus , back from the dead . The leper healed of his disease . The woman who anointed Jesus ' feet with oil . Even some of the apostles who kept hoping right up to the end that Jesus would save himself and conquer his enemies . Remember , they thought Jesus was the Messiah , the warrior who would eventually make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carried himself with pride also  --  but it was a perverse , insolent , grinning pride , as if he were pleased with his slouching posture and damp clothes and the sweat that seemed to seep out of his skin , as well as the more obscure fact of his accompanying a Negro obviouslyhis superior , obviously more attractive to any women they might encounter . It was the morning of the Synderdale picnic and race . The two were not really connected : the picnic was sponsored by volunteer firemen in the county to make money and the race was controlled by people outside Synderdale who rented the old fair grounds for the day . As Mitchie and Ponzi walked through town they enjoyed the sensation of being strangers and of being looked upon as superior . Groups of teen-age boys crowded along the street and looked at them , wondering if they were drivers in the race or owners ; no one dared ask them . " A hell of a hot day for a race , " Ponzi said , wiping his face . " He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard he lost eight or so one day , " Mitchie said . " That was before I was with them . " Traffic moved slowly through town . There were groups of people in uniform : they wore satin and gold braid and carried musical instruments that gleamed importantly in the sunlight . Drum majorettes , some of them not more than children , ran giggling along the sidewalks in short shiny skirts . Tassels on their white boots jiggled in their excitement . Catching sight of Mitchie and Ponzi , the girls whispered together and peeped at them slyly and surrendered to gales of laughter . " These countrygirls , " Ponzi said , grinning . A fat man in the street , dressed like an army officer of high rank except for the splendid scarlet of his uniform , blew experimentallyon a tuba . Perspiring men carried flags of various colors and dragged drums across the street . One of the drums ,  |p105Ponzi  saw , said MARCHEN COUNTY CORPS . Still in the back of apick-up truck was another drum , a newer and larger one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum with their fists and , just before Mitchie and Ponzi passed by , began to kick it angrily . People shouted . Someone had arranged for music to be broadcast throughout the town by means of a loudspeakersystem , and the music got suddenly louder : it was a popular song , twangy and persistent , a woman 's voice strainingagainst a background of frenzied guitars and electronic instruments . She sang : " The way love is it treats you wrong , It do n't care for hearts that break . Take your burdens to the Lord ... Teen-age boys in roaring jalopies drove up and down the main street , waving and shouting . Someone on the sidewalk picked up a big stone and threw it after them , but it bounced harmlessly across the street ; one of the uniformed firemen , tacking up a poster , looked angrily around to see who had thrown it . Before a drug store a sound truck had been parked , decorated with red crepe paper . A man dressed in a suit and tie stood on a platform with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinning and trying to draw into the conversation the group of people who stood silently watching . As Mitchie and Ponzi passed by he said , " Now folks , folks , this is a busy day in Synderdale ; a busy morning in Synderdale ; there 's folks all up and down the street , and out in the park the firemen and their wives are getting tents set up , and games set up , and the big chowder kettles are filled withchowder  --  andeverything is getting ready for the parade ! The parade is at one o'clock ! The parade will be led off by the Synderdale Consolidated High School , and I have the young lady here who is president  --  what ?  --  vice-president of the ba-P106ton twirlers . A young lady who  --  " The girl wore white with gold braid . She giggled behind her hand . A woman in the crowd , probably her mother , nodded anxiously as if she were trying to tell the girl something . Young girls strolled along the sidewalk , four and five abreast , with linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others were dressed as if it were Sunday , in high heels , and others wore the gleaming short skirts of the baton twirlers : approaching Mitchie and Ponzi , they pretended to look away and to talk breathlessly among themselves , but at the last moment they would turn on the men their neat , hard , sharply sweet looks and release each other so the men could pass by . Ponzi smelled their harsh perfume . He heard them giggle something about " that nigger . " Again he felt a thrill of insolent pride , and glanced at Mitchie to see if he had heard . Mitchie wore sky blue and white : he looked careful , even cautious , about his dress . A solemn necktie of gray gave him the look of a professional man . His hair was cut short , hardly more than a dark film on his head ; his face was clean , a little shiny from perspiration , and his eyes and teeth , astonishingly white , seemed to hide themselves : he had the look of being on view and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone other than himself . Ponzi , walking proudly beside him with his chest out , wore a stained shirt of yellow , open at the neck , and khaki pants that were too big for him at the seat and knees and were stained with grease . His arms swung militantlyback and forth as he walked , and his hands , clammy white beneath the grease stains , sometimes caught each other in mid-swing and for an instant clasped together , caressingly or nervously . " When did you say they 're coming ? Why are n't they here ? " he said . " Shar 's been here for a day . What is he like  --  Max  --  will he notice me ? What is he-like ? " Mitchie did not look at him . He seemed to feel embarrass/ment for Ponzi 's anxiety . He said softly , " Do n't you worry any about him . It 's most likely he wo n't even notice you . " But this was not what Ponzi wanted to hear . " What 's he like ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How old is he ? What does he look like ? " Mitchie shrugged his shoulders . " I do n't know him too well . I do n't do no business with him anyway . " " But what is he like ? Does n't he ever talk to you ? " " He does sometimes , " Mitchie said . " He told me he 'd heard some good things about me , about my driving . He said Shar was the one told him that . " Mitchie could not help glancing at Ponzi as he said that . " Shar himself told it . Shar clocked me going around  --  " " But Max , I mean Max , " Ponzi said . " What does he look like ? " " He 's a big man , " Mitchie said slowly . A horde of boys stood about the sidewalk , smoking . They watched Mitchie and Ponzi silently . Behind them , as if protected by them , was a poster advertising the race : the garish picture of a racing car and a helmeted man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame . The man 's eyes were hidden by his goggles , but his mouth  --  open , grinning , twisted  --  shouted of terror . The poster had not even been defaced . For some reason a truck came down the street with banners draped about it  --  bright colors , red and blue  --  and boys of about ten years sat with legs dangling in the back , waving condescendingly at people on the street . Stones were thrown at them ; some bounced up against the cab of the truck . One of the boys , who had been shouting and waving white fists , was struck in the face and scrambled up and started to cry . The truck passed out of sight . Horns blew , cars drove grandly down the middle of the street . They were filled with passengers and sagged gently.  |p108Activity  increased . As if spurred on by the frenzy of the music , new groups appeared around corners , drove down the street . A bus stopped to unload teen-agers , some of whom carriedlunch bags . One of the baton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette . She was perhaps fourteen , but big for her age : her white satin outfit strained to contain her . She had red-blond hair and eyes outlined in black . As she inhaled the smoke she bent her head forward , making her white throat arch . " I never seen you here before , " she said . " You two in for the races , ai n't you ? You got something to do with it ? " " Mitchie might be a driver , " Ponzi said at once . He grinned , sweating . He put one arm around Mitchie 's shoulders . " How do you like that ? He might get to drive . " The girl stared in awe . " No kidding ? " she said . " Me , I crawl in the grease . That 's what I do . I roll around in the grease . " Ponzi laughed extravagantly , as if he had said something funny . Mitchie pulled away so that Ponzi 's arm hugged the air . " It 's goddam safer there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the girl said to Mitchie . " Is that no kidding ? " " I 'm not the driver , " Mitchie said . He did not look at the girl . " You 're not ? Who is it then ? Is it somebody around here ? " " The driver 's here . He 's here . Do you want to meet him ? " Ponzi said . " Do you want me to take you to meet him ? " " Jesus Christ , " said Mitchie . He stared out at the street . " No kidding you could ? " said the girl . " He ai n't married , ishe ? Where is he ? " Seeing Mitchie 's look , Ponzi suddenly calmed . He said sadly , " I guess I ca n't just yet . Maybe later . " " Later when ? " said the girl . She followed them along for ap109while . " Listen , mister , I never met a driver before . That 's the truth . I never yet met one . I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You come by later on . " The girl called after them for a while , but was lost in the crowd . More people appeared , many of them in uniform . Some men blew noisemakers . The golden gleam of braid and buttonsand musical instruments filled the air . Before a hardware store a girl who looked hardly more than sixteen stood on top of a chair , holding her baby up to look around : the baby , eyes closed and face as blank as if it had been erased , moved its lips helplessly . There was a smell of hot dogs in the air . Mitchie walked in the street to get away from the crowd . Ponzi , hurrying with him , walked in the gutter . Mitchie began to talk suddenly , though his face showed no sign of expression : " Shar says it 's only fire that worries him . I thought about that too . If it could be a crash and everything over at once , all the bones broke you 're going to have , over at once  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes right away and keeps on . That 's bad . " Ponzi had begun to pant . " Fire ? " he said . " What about it ? " " I do n't like it none myself . Dream of it sometimes . " " A big strong nigger like you ? " Ponzi said . " Hell , do n't letit worry you . I would n't let it worry you . " " I ast Shar if he dreamt of it too and he said he did a few times , when he first started . But then he said too after you die worms and things eat you ; if you was burnt away they could n't get at you . You got to think of that . " " Shar said that ? " " Shar got it all thought out . " " He does n't like me much , " Ponzi said , grinning . " Telling that girl I was the driver , like you did , it got me to think for a minute I was it . Scairt me some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . That 's how it is , " Mitchie said . They stopped in the street and Mitchie lit a cigarette . Ponzi saw some people watching Mitchie : he was a tall , handsome Negro , and people could not decide whether he knew it or not . " Now , " he said , tossing away the match , " Shar told me one time we were drinkingtogether something he thought out . He said , Why should anything be safe ? ' I wondered that too ; why should it ? Who says so ? A man fell in love with a car , like some of us , he do n't owe it to himself for things to be safe . They ai n't worth it to be safe . I understand that . " " You 're a hell of a lot smarter than me if you do , " Ponzi said . His irony was lost on Mitchie . He did not even think Mitchie heard him . " Now , even a piddling race like this one today , even with no special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other . ' Course Max and them want him to practice up for the Fourth of July race ; but Shar do n't think of that . He just thinks of the car . You ever seen a driver around a car so much ? He come in early with it himself and balanced the wheels himself . He wo n't let anybody else at it , he checks over the parts himself . He does it every time . How many guys , got up to be drivers , would bother with that ? They 'd s'pose it was below them . He told me how a man has got to love his car or else he wo n't win . " " Love his car ! " Ponzi laughed . He looked around as if for an audience . " I heard different about your driver ! " " This first race we had he mostly burnt his foot of-f , taking the car around that goddam gravel track at Jasper . But he kept on going till he won . " " A hell of a stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot was about cooked from all that heat , but he said itp111was just numb . He said he never felt it so long as he kept on going , but Max got mad as hell , told him he ought to take care of himself more ; ' cause Max loves him , " he said oddly . " I seen that . He takes it hard , any trouble of Shar 's . But you got to love the car ! I know that for a fact . Look at them all , Shar and the other drivers  --  their hands all blisters and eyes burnt , cars about ready to explode or fall apart  --  wheels , axles , anything  --  but they love it all the way ! A man puts in years out on the track  --  in ten minutes he gets that much living out of it . And you see how Shar takes a race . All quiet , like he was under a shot . " " Nerve but no nerves , " Ponzi announced , as if he had just thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pavementoutside one of the bars . Ponzi squinted at Shar while at the same time trying not to be seen , because something about the man worried him . It might have been his closeness to mutilationand death . Shar and Mitchie nodded solemnly to each other ; Ponzi , behind Mitchie , nodded too . " Weather ai n't gettingany cooler , " Mitchie said . Ponzi had been surprised at the amount of attention given to the weather by racing people , but he was grateful for it too , since it was something he could understand . Shar , wearing sunglasses , stared coldly at him as if he could read Ponzi 's mind . " You , " he said to Ponzi , " what the hell time is it ? " He held out his arm and they compared watches . " They 're late . They 're an hour late , " he said to himself . Ponzi wondered if he wanted anything more from him . In Shar 's presence Ponzi 's self-mocking slovenliness ebbed ; he no longer thought himself funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late ? " he said . But that was a mistake . Shar turned away as if he did notp112like the smell of Ponzi , and did not even answer . Mitchie made a face at him . " Goddam big mouth , " he said . " Why do you pretend things all the time ? " " Did he mean Max ? " The other driver was about Shar 's age , but already balding . He looked nervous . Shar stood staring out at the street and the man talked behind his back , loud enough for Shar to hear if he wanted . " We were hoping for a little rain this morning , to keep the dust down . Hell , they might not even have sprinklers here  --  this is a two-bit track . My first time here too . I 'd like to be in the Cherry River race  --  that 's Fourth of July  --  but my managerhad some trouble getting us in ; I might get in , though . " " That 's a good track , " Mitchie said cautiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The money 's good too , " the man said , winking . " But the competition 's bad ! " He laughed , glancing around at Shar 's back . Shar did not turn around . " I was telling your boy here what some local bastardis doing . Did you hear about it ? The seats in the stands go for a dollar or more , and they let kids and people sit around on the grass by the track for half a buck . But this bastard  --  runs a shoe store in town  --  got up the idea to rent some space there , and paid five bucks for it , nobody any wiser . So what does he do but put up some kind of goddam stand himself ! Made out of pipes and things , like in a kid 's playground where the kids climb around on them , going up in the air , so he figures to put thirty people on it , not counting little kids , and the ones right on top can see as well as anybody in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to teach him a lesson . And he figures to make a lot by it  --  him and some friends are in the bar there laughing about it , and how they put one over on the racing people . My manager will be mad as hell when he hears of it . " Shar turned . He had lit a cigarette . Ponzi thought idly thatp113he did not look so calm  --  his face looked strained , pale , his lips turned up in a tight , mocking grimace . Whether he was angry at the other driver or at something else was not clear . " Jesus Christ , " he said . " Yeah , it 's a goddam thing , " the man said , as if Shar had agreed with him . " Nobody knew what he was up to . " " You talk too goddam much , " Shar said . The driver blinked at him . He laughed nervously . Shar said to Mitchie , " If you see them tell them I 'm at the hotel . I had enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mitchie said . When speaking to Shar he looked down at the man 's feet , as if he thought looking at Shar 's face would annoy him . " Good luck this afternoon , " the other driver said as Shar left . He shrugged his shoulders and moved closer to Mitchie and Ponzi . " He 's really a son of a bitch , is n't he ? " he said cautiously . " I mean , gets mad pretty fast . He told somebody 's managerinside there he 'd send his boy spinning off the track today , dump him right in the guy 's lap . Nobody knew how to take it  --  serious or not . Shar was n't smiling much when he said it . " Mitchie frowned and licked his lips and looked away . Ponzi pretended to be angry at what the man had said about Shar and glared at him . " He does n't joke much , " he said importantly . The man ambled back into the bar , wiping his balding head . Outside the bar the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms , and boys in tight , surging hordes , and small children , barefoot , and the girls who would march in the parade : proud and slyly shy they were , sipping soft drinks from perspiring bottles , looking at the men , ignoring the boys , now and then lifting arms to caress their hair and to show the little half moons of perspiration underp114their arms . Ponzi was drenched with sweat ; he seemed to glow in it and in the crowd 's excitement . He liked being jostled , especially when one of the girls pushed against him , and he even liked the incredible wailing from the loud-speaker , a voice that could have been either male or female , screaming about love : " Searching , searching , I spent my whole-life-through Searching , searching for someone Just like you ! " Ponzi saw the automobile at about the same time Mitchie did . It had been edging in and out of traffic down the street , traveling fast , and approached them with its horn blaring impatiently . Four or five old women scurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his haste to get away a boy on a bicycle fell over , hard , right on his side . Uniformed men in a great friendly crowd pointed at the boy and roared with laughter . The boy , his face almost swollen with blood , ashamed , tryingnot to cry , dragged himself painfully over to the gutter . The car was black  --  a black convertible . People pushed out to look at it . It was piled in back with boxes and suitcases and a man sat on top of the pile on the left , smoking , looking at the people who stared back at him . In the front seat sat a neatlookingman with black hair , driving , honking his horn without any show of impatience , judging from his face ; next to him sat a big man with a pale , dough-colored face , looking at the town as if he were delighted with it . Beside him , pushed against the door , was a girl with blond hair who sat with one arm outstretched , fingers idly spread to catch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back , who nodded mysteriously at people on the sidewalk . Up the street someone stepped off the sidewalk : it was Shar.  |p115He  waved to them . The car screeched to a stop , dust rising immediately around it . The man in the back seat stood and beganyelling something but no one paid any attention . Shar opened the door and pulled the girl out , leaned across to talk to the heavy man with the big , pale face for a minute . The car started and stopped again , rocking . The man in the back seat picked up some suitcases and handed them to Shar , but Shar refused to take them ; they were put back in the car . The little man in the driver 's seat , dispassionate and hardly glancing around , now started the car again and drove away . Shar and the girl crossed the street . On the sidewalk Shar embraced the girl . She allowed him to hold her : Ponzi stared at them through the thin , hot , dusty air . His eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitchie wanted to go  --  they stood on the sidewalk with people passing and looking too , Shar holding the girl anxiously and the girl in white high-heeled shoes , with bare white legs , straining upward , leaning forward against Shar 's chest and straining up to him , her black skirt showing the backs of her knees , her blouse pulled out and up in back by Shar 's embrace so that Ponzi could see , below the wrinkled blouse and the wrinkled cotton of Shar 's sleeve , the girl 's bare skin . " He 'll be all right now , " Mitchie said . " He 'll be better now . " He even smiled at Ponzi , he was so pleased , so relieved . But Ponzi , struck by something  --  it might have been the girl 's youth  --  felt strangely depressed . He pulled his collar away from his throat . The excitement of the crowd , titillated by Shar and the girl and the magnificence of that automobile , no longer interested him . For a moment he felt afraid , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawn shade of the room in which Shar lay with Karen . Down on the street there were shouts and murmurs and a sound like firecrackers being set off , but in the room it was quiet , still , even a little restrained . Shar lay beside Karen and looked at her : her hair was outspreadon the pillow , as it always was , sleek and fine , her eyes matched his in their seriousness , her lips were a little open as they were when she slept . Their reunion had been violent  --  Shar felt he was hurting her  --  and the knowledge that shep117felt little , that she did not really share in the sensation that overwhelmed him , had made his brutality more unchecked . Now , watching her closely , as if he did not see she was aware of him , Shar thought of the few times he had been able to draw her along with him : the memory shot through him , a pang of excitement . " Are you happy ? " Shar said . Karen smiled gently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " Yes , " said Karen . " How was your drive down here ? Jerry drives all right , does n't he ? " " It was a good drive , " Karen said . " I wanted to come with you , though . You should n't have made me stay behind . " " No , I had to do it , " Shar said seriously , " I had to work that car out by myself . I do n't put enough time in it . I got to know it before I can drive it . " " I wanted to come with you , " Karen said . Shar hardly heard her . The smell of her hair and of her body enchanted him . He touched her face ; she held his hand gently . In his violence , when desire was so strong it made him anxious , almost desperate , Karen 's gentleness did not soothe him but goaded him  --  as if deliberately ; he felt himself entrapped , falling , incomplete until he gave himself to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so vivid he could smell the rich perspiring warmth of her body and remember her expression : frank , innocent , brutal in its simplicity . It was only in his imaginationthat she lured him to her ; Karen herself did nothing , or seemed to do nothing . He thought that at times he could touch the queer love she had for him , but they had never talked about it . Only in the last two months , when Shar had begun racing for the summer , had they begun to speak much to each other . Their conversations seemed incomplete , as if they could not really understand each other 's language . Much of what Karen said Shar understood to be paraphrases of things he hadp118said , or anticipations of things he would say . When she spoke he would listen to the self-assured sweetness of her voice and watch her face , allowing himself to be enchanted . Now she spoke about something : it did not matter what she said , what mattered was the manner in which she said it , luring and captivatinghim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as he . " Do you love me ? " Karen said . Shar sat up and lit a cigarette . The smoke would clear his head ; he had to think . Immediately his mind filled with the race , the grandstands full of people , the relentless dirt track . He felt something  --  a queer little force  --  drawing at him , luringhim into the center , to death , but he did not understand what it was . Death for auto racers came not through surrender to the center , but through surrender to the outside  --  to centrifugalforce , a sudden careening off the track . Green infield , dotted grandstand , blue sky : these would reel before him , narrowingto the white retaining wall and then to the flash of impact . Shar had awakened out of various nightmares upon the moment of impact , drenched with sweat , his fists clenched on an invisible wheel , his legs and feet straining to keep him in , keep him in ... . He turned to Karen as if he had not heard her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with satisfaction . Little he said or left unsaid seemed to have any effect on her . " You scare me sometimes , " Shar had said once nervously ; he felt Karen oddly like himself , for she reflected his surface calm with her entire being , while Shar 's mask did little more than mock his feelings . It was as if she had designed herself so : a woman imagining what would attract him , entrap him , and creating herself in that image , hair and eyes and mouth and body , and the hints of a soul that Karen revealed . Shar remembered that she had not always been like this.  |p119She  had emerged out of a week of pain and hysteria , attended by Max 's doctor , to claim him . When Max had demanded what Shar wanted to do with the girl , what point there had been in abducting her , ruining her health , almost ruining her sanity , Shar had really been unable to reply ; he did not know . He had not thought about it . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted it , but his common sense rejected that and his expectation of Max 's outrage silenced it . Shar had not had time to think about it , and now the familiar image of Karen 's presence obscured all thought . At times he could not remember ever having been without her . As if she understood his thought , she moved to take him into her arms . " Come here , " Karen said . Shar let the cigarette fall on the floor with the dirty clothes and empty whisky bottles and came to Karen . He embraced her with his body . Anguish overtook him that he would not be able to make her feel as he did , then frustration , then the beginning of his mute , angry violence : she resisted him at the same time she gave herself to him , he thought ; she did not love him , she mocked him , she used his infatuation to degrade him . In the face of such mockeryKaren 's gentleness , her silence even to his deliberate coarseness , irritated him until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as she sometimes did  --  in sharp , surprised pain . But her body had adapted itself to him now , he could hurt her only from time to time , and as he did it he was tortured by the fact that he wanted to do it ; he could not understand . Anger at himself expressed itself in anger at Karen , who accepted it as she accepted everything not bravely but only silently , innocently , as if everything he did were normal , as if these were the rituals that passed between a man and a woman in love ! It was indecent  --  dirty  --  Shar thought , his outrage rising , it was dirty , dirty , he had made himself dirty in doing it , yet he enjoyed it , he loved it , he was obsessed by it ! Karen , stained by his exer/tions , exhausted by his energy , was really untouched by him : he could not reach her . In desperation he gave himself up to the hot sucking softness of her body . He could stand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her tensed face , he felt her small limbs brace him as if to prevent his doing violence against himself . Some time later when Shar awoke he found that Karen had pulled the sheet over them and held him in her arms . His face had been against her shoulder ; her skin was wet with his saliva . Shar drew away . " Christ , it 's hot , " he said . He felt strangely irritated . " What time is it ? " Karen reached for the watch on the night table . " It 's five after twelve , " she said . He sat up and reached for his cigarettes . He did not look at Karen . " What the hell is that noise down there ? It sounds like firecrackers . " A slow uproar was sustained down on the street , punctuated by explosions and horns . Someone on the sidewalk three stories below was laughing hysterically . Listeningto the laughter , Shar glanced at Karen : she was watching him steadily . Her face was damp with perspiration , her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment he sat with a lighted match in his hand , looking at her . He wanted to appeal to her , cringe before her , bury his face in her stomach , hide his eyes . He did not know why . He wanted to beg something of her , but he did not know what it would be  --  she was little to him , after all , new to his life and temporary to it ; he had had other women longer than this . Before her pleased silent gaze he felt helpless . Even his strength was helpless . It occurred to him that if he wanted to be free of her he would have to kill her . This thought bothered him . " Hell , " he said aloud , lighting his cigarette . He tossed the burned match onto the floor with the rest of the refuse he had accumulated  --  crumpled candyp121bar wrappers , soiled underclothes , bottles , opened newspapers . His shoes , white with dust , lay against the baseboard of the wall as if they had been thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Shar said . " I 'll see you after the race . " When he looked around he saw Karen trying to hide a small yawn . The movement of her arm , the sleepy luxury of her expression , touched him ; he smiled at her . But his smile stopped when he felt with alarm his body preparing itself for her . He looked away . He got up . What did he want to beg of her ? It might have been freedom  --  freedom to rid himself of her , clean himself of his intoxication for her , so that he could approachher as a man . Never had he made any choice about her : she had happened to him as accidents happened to him , immediate and complete . He had talked to Max about it . In the past Max had helped him with everything . Max listened to him , asked him questions , shared in his life ; sometimes Shar felt that Max wanted too much , crowded Shar a little , but Shar had grown almost as dependent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the relationship , he was not interested in understanding it . Shar 's experience in racing , his experience with violence , with women , certain events in his past  --  these Max had shared , had drawn out of Shar so they really did not belong to Shar any more . But of Karen Shar had been able to tell Max little . He could not talk about her with anyone . She belonged to him , she seemed to have no life except with him . The thought of this maddened him , made his brain buzz and flinch  --  he had tried to explain it to Max but had grown so angry that he had been incoherent . And sick with desire for her . He could not escape her . He felt that she was nothing apart from him , she had nothing of herself but what she gave him , she was nothing in herself but what he touched  --  unlike the other women whom he could not even rememberp122now  --  she did not turn away in secret , she did not avert her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . She gave herself to him at once , and constantly ; even the expression of pleasure she revealed from time to time was no more than a part of Shar , of what he created in her . Shar chewed on a piece of chocolate candy left on the bureauand went into the bathroom , leaving Karen to herself . He was angry with her and he knew she understood , though neither of them could have explained . Under the shower he thought of sweat running off his body , dirt licked free , the intenseheat of the bedroom exorcized by the water . He would be free of that ; he would be ready for the race . Systematically he began emptying his mind of all things irrelevant to the race . First there was Karen : there was always Karen . On the verge of sleep at night he confused her in his mind with other women , with all women up to the first girl he had had , years ago ; she blended with them , distorted their faces to hers , usurped their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polkadotclothes , blond curls , plump soft legs , busy fists ! That had been Karen too . Remembering her thus strained Shar 's sanity ; he could not believe she was the same person . He had tried to explain it to Max : " I picked her up and handed her to her fatherthat day . I was about sixteen  --  I do n't know . She was two or three . She could n't talk sense yet . Can you believe it 's the same person ? " Max thought it delightful ; he had wanted to hear more . For the first time Shar resisted his questioning . Gladly , zestfully , had he reviewed his experiences with other women  --  Max had listened impassively  --  but something dulled his energy when he started to betray Karen . Max had asked his usual question : " Did you make her happy ? " Instead of saying , as he usually did , " You 're goddammed right I did , " he had fallen silent ; he did not know what to say . " Not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the start he had been ablep123to say , when Max asked him how it was with Karen , that it was wonderful , beautiful , that he " could n't last five minutes with her "  --  Shar 's tribute to a beautiful woman  --  but after a while he had shrugged his shoulders , he had not wanted to answer . For the first time he felt that Max wanted to know too much . " The fat old son of a bitch ! " Shar growled into the shower  --  inexplicably , for he really liked Max . There were other things he must cleanse himself of : his hatred for the people who crowded the street and who would be watching him this afternoon . A grandstand filled with hungryfaces , murmuring lips . What delicious pleasure it would give them to watch him die ! He knew them ; he understood them . But he must not think of them , for anything beyond the pure experience of the speed alone was degrading . It was a private ritual  --  Shar shared it with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no one in the crowd ; he shared it , perhaps , with Max , but only partially . Max , who sat propped up with pillows in a chair , fingering pages in his innumerable books , fearful of his heart , of heat stroke , of cancer , of anything  --  Maxcould feel the beauty of Shar 's experience only in his imagination , while Shar felt it in his very body . At a certainpoint the speed became his body : he was one with it . Those who sat sweating and chewing popcorn and drinking beer in the stadium watched the drivers tear around the track , but what they saw had little relationship to what really happened  --  to the private experiences of the drivers , who moved in a world apart . " Safe from those goddam bastards ! " Shar said with immense satisfaction . And on the track he would be safe from entanglements with anyone  --  with himself , even , his usual self , the mortality in him that linked him to other men . He would be safe from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human bondage , of hatred , of jealousy , of anger , of lust , most of all , of love !  --  free of love ! For him there would be dustp124and the smell of oil and the terrific reality of that dirt track and the speed at which he moved above it . When the race was over , when he came back , he would feel cleansed , exorcized of fragmentsin him that were not really himself , that cluttered and obscured his vision . It was good to work up the speed , good to give it up , to return to the normal world of time : it was good to see the sun perfectly still in the sky . If he could return from a race and meet Karen for the first time , then it would be possible for him to love her ; he felt that strongly , angrily . If he could approach her without lust , withoutfear , he could love her . He did not know if he wanted to love her , if he was strong enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone before . But he did know that his bondage to her was driving him insane , splitting him from what had always been essential in his life  --  a simplicity of vision , and simplicity of emotion  --  and that he had to free himself from it . Again the thought came to him that his freedom would be the same as Karen 's death . But he shook his head in disgust ; he did not believe it , he did not want to hear about it . Emptied of the past , he prepared himself carefully for the future.  |p125At  one time the several acres of land north of Synderdale that were set aside for county use had been the site of the annual county fair , but now everything but the racing track and its stadium was abandoned . The track had originally been used for horse racing  --  farmers and their sons had showed off their horses with great pride ; but for the last several years the track had been used for auto racing and , more often , for stock car racing  --  spectacles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day the dirt parking lot was filling up early with cars and pick-up trucks . Children rode bicycles and parked them in the grass . Old buses , of the sort usually seen transporting migrantfarm workers from place to place , showed up filled with strangers from cities to the north . Hot-dog stands were crowded , cotton candy was sold , beer , soft drinks , souvenir flags and whistles , racing caps and goggles for children , straw hats , noisemakers  --  all were for sale . It was impossible not to feel the intense excitement in the air . The impending communion in such a spectacle , well worshipedby most of the people , gave them a sense of brotherhood . Gangs of boys sought each other out , young girls drifted about in slow loose clusters , smiling at everyone . Many of the older people , still dressed in their fine uniforms and flushed by the joy and success of the firemen 's parade , argued and shouted and slapped one another on the back with great gusto . They eyed with suspicion and admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the beautiful young girl  --  no doubt his daughter . These two were strolling slowly through the old fair grounds , waiting for the beginning of the race to near . The man kept looking at his watch . He wore a very light gray suit of a rich material , unfortunatelya little too tight for his big , almost fat body ; his shirt was cream colored and his necktie a modest blue . For all his bulk he walked delicately , as if he were not used to it or as if he feared it might somehow injure him . From a distance his face looked merely blank , and of a bloodless , stony color ; at closer range his face was heavy and burdened with many tiny lines about his eyes and cheeks . Wrinkles of delight and of angerhad imprinted themselves into him , running from his massivejaw and mouth up to his nose , out from his eyes in a fanshapedspread , and across his forehead in irregular precision.  |p127One  of his pockets was stretched almost to bursting by a small blue book that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dress that did not belong exactly to summer or to the race track , and about her neck a necklace of silver hung catching the sunlight . Her pale hair hung straight to her shoulders . Her face was small , childlike , yet at the same time elegant  --  so people thought who stared at her . Sunglasses hid her eyes , and the careful vacuity of her expression , the deliberate set of her reddened lips , hid any feeling she might have had . Automobiles were beginning to fill up the lot in which they strolled , so they turned away . Flies and mosquitoes buzzed in the air . They passed old buildings : the biggest , with most of its grimy windows broken , declared itself in a long weatherstainedsign before its entrance : DAIRY CENTER . Now the doors were open and led into nothing but sunlight and buzzing flies . The man , who fondly called himself Max , spoke confidentially to Karen with a forefinger raised , as if he were delivering a lecture . " You are thinking you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think to yourself  --  a fat man on a hot day , what a fool he turns out to be ! Sweats himself away in little dribbles . Ah , that 's true , " he said , wiping his forehead , taking off his sunglasses either to wipe his eyes or to peer at Karen . " Heat , this heat disintegrates me  --  given a high temperature , a man caught in it  --  what happens to God at such times ? So far away  --  Impossible  --  Just like no man with a toothache can be a believer . " Karen smiled to show she appreciated his humor but did not believe in it . Max 's eyes , intent upon her , were startlingly small , small within the harsh pasty expanse of his face , and like the eyes of an animal , without much thought or perception : a deceit Karen knew he did not contrive . " But you arep128fooling me ! " he cried , taking her arm . They passed through parked cars now , heading back to the stadium . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hysteria ? Was it Shar ? Shar was drunk ! It was I , and I understood you then , and I thought  --  a clever girl , a very intelligent girl , he is drunk and sick to death because he does n't know what to do with her ! I thought  --  she is a strange girl , but she will come around to me , she will see I am her friend ; she will see that we are kin . Our minds are kin . I am positive of that . " Small boys ran shouting about them , intent on a game . Max stared at them for an instant in terror ; but they did not notice and ran away behind the cars . Karen noticed his fear with a slight impulse of pity , but she said nothing . She had been tryingnot to surrender to pity for herself and , more immediately , to block Max 's subtle probing into her mind , his groping for her secret . The effort to resist him had weakened her . " But when I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you realize . No , it is about yourself  --  your very being . Your very being is a puzzle to me , a most delightful puzzle ! " And he smiled to show he found her delightful . " You are the second to come down out of those mountains and to me  --  the first was Shar , a very young man then , no more than a boy . And you  --  You are a delight to me , you have made us very happy . " They passed by an old statue , overturned in the grass at the end of the makeshift parking lot , which was little more than a field . " Look here , " Max said . He put his big hands on his thighs and grunted with the effort to bend and read the inscriptionon the statue . It was of a bearded man perched on a crumbling stone platform , with eyes of hard stone , rigid and consciously blind , who held in his lap sheaths of wheat . A colliedog with tongue breathlessly exposed sat leaning against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and children had defaced it with chalk . " Out of our land ' it says there ;  |p129very  nice . " Max straightened with a luxurious sigh . " Very nice  --  it reminds me of a graveyard piece ; his eyes are angels ' eyes . " Karen stared up at Max . She had had the same thought . " Now , my dear Karen , " the man said , smiling , " if you say that you do not want my man to examine you  --  and he is a fine doctor , a very learned man , you must not think that his giving himself up to me  --  to my atrocious health  --  means he is inferior  --  nothing could be more misleading  --  If you do not want him to examineyou I can only conclude that you are indeed pregnant and that you will have to tell Shar about it , or I will have to tell him , one or the other ; maybe both . Both of us at once . That would be nice , would n't it ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are  --  you are worried about  --  Shar is sometimes  --  But still you must do something about it . You agree with me ? " " I have nothing to say , " Karen said . " But you fool me so ! Not a one of them fools me like you do , " Max said , touching her chin . He held her face for a moment . " A very beautiful girl , it 's no wonder you are as you are ! I suspect you have been pampered all your life and I agree with that  --  that is absolutely correct  --  you are made to be pamperedand that is why we pamper you like we do  --  That is why I enjoy your persona , your little mask ! Very discreet and learned . You think , I will make them think how stupid I am , how little I know ! But you do not know how other women are  --  how . . . completely , happily stupid they are , how the wind whistles through their minds ! Maybe Shar does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ; I know . I know everything . " Where the stadium ended and there were no refreshment stands or parked automobiles people were sitting peacefully in the grass . Many of them had picnic lunches and were drinking beer . A strange device had been set up : a stand made of pipesp130on which people were sitting , crowded happily , waving to peopleon the ground . There were perhaps fifteen people , includingsmall children and even babies , on each of the five levels . Those on top had field glasses and straw hats to shade their eyes from the sun , and looked about proudly . Some of the men grinned down at Karen as she passed . They waved beer bottles . " Do you see those lightning rods ? " Max said . He pointed to the rods gleaming frantically on the old section of the stadium . " They are supposed to have been hit by lightning many times . Something to see , would n't it ? Have you ever seen lightning strike ? " " Yes , " said Karen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disappointed by this , he gave no sign . He seemed to take on the excitement of the crowd , and his walk became more spritely , almost youthful , as they approached the gate . " This will be a fine race , fine practice for Shar , " he said . " A good day for him . He 's beautiful to watch , is n't he ? I am the only owner who follows his men around , the only one who loves to watch them ! I suppose they say I am queer  --  touched in the head . " Karen smiled grimly . Max 's reputation , among his own men and among people who knew him , was not tempered by whimsy . His origin unknown , his motives inscrutable , he had worked his way into auto racing by force alone . Karen had not asked about him , but she had heard vague remarks : he was supposed to make his fortune in gambling . Wherever he traveledhe was accompanied by two men : one of them Jerry , who drove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , silent , morose man of about forty who looked after Max 's imaginary illnesses . Max 's love was for Shar , however , and since Karen meant so much to Shar she deserved his love too ; he had explainedthis to her carefully . " You will open my heart , " Max had said once . " You must not be afraid of me . I am prepared top131love you  --  I want to love you . But you must not keep yourself from me . " Their seats were near the wall , in the shade . Jerry and the doctor awaited them . Max complained merrily of the heat to the doctor , Jerry asked if there was anything he wanted done , any messages run down to the garage ; they arranged themselves in a row . " My grandmother 's silver necklace , " Max said , pointing to Karen . " Never did it look so good on anyone before ! She is a beautiful girl . " The doctor , sitting on the other side of Max , leaned over to stare without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bald spot at the crown of his head . His eyes were sunken , flesh hung in loose folds on his face . On his lap , nearly embraced by his long arms , was the black bag in which he kept medical oddities for Max and liquor for himself . He said nothing . On Karen 's right Jerry sat , his legs crossed , his smartly polished shoes gleaming . He nodded sagely at Max 's remark and looked sideways at Karen . Karen did not meet his gaze . " Maybe she will grow more beautiful still , " Karen heard Max say to the doctor . " She has nothing to tell me . We will have to wait and see . She keeps secrets , she keeps to herself . " Jerry lit a cigarette and said to Max , " It 's Shar you ought to of talked to . It 's his goddam fault . The way he acts you 'd think a baby come out of a haystack one morning ; he never did have any sense . " " He is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll catch something one of these days , " Jerry said . " You can have the doctor shoot him full of something  --  good for all ailments . " Behind them the stadium reared up gigantically , swarming with people . The frank , excited murmur of the crowd put Karen in mind , as it always did , of the danger that was impending ; the delight of the crowd depressed her , oppressed her ,  |p132she  felt the bitter certainty that this would be Shar 's last race . She had seen many races , and each had promised to be the last . She tried to put the noise out of her mind and sat gazing at the slow melting of the sky above the curve of the stadium . Sunlight slanted down across the weathered roof of the stadium , sheering off the lightning rods and the dull rotting shingles onto the track and the dry green infield . There were billboards and posters on the stadium walls , shredded by wind and rain . The wall to Jerry 's right was covered with scrawls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at them guiltily , as if they were something she had done . She closed her eyes . She was exhausted : Max 's presence exhausted her , threatened her , the impending trial of speed exhausted her  --  paralyzed her mind . She felt the brutality of the contest . Down at the garage Shar would be in the car , and one of the men , perhaps , leaning in the doorway of the garage enclosure ; the barbed-wire door , eight feet high , would be ajar . Someone 's cotton gloves , smeared with oil , would be stuck through the fence . Oil would lie on the ground in shallow pools . Shar 's face , partially concealed by the helmet and the green glasses , would have taken on the aspect of a mask , and except for his repeated grimaces , his lips grinning and relaxing , he would seem no more alive than the slender car . One of the men would be patting the hood of the car , showing his devotion . The gleam of the hood would look cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanics , would watch Shar curiously , though not with concern , since they could not believe he was like them ; they could not sympathize with the man who stared out at them through the green glasses . Perhaps they believed , as Karen did , that Shar had yet to learn fear , that he required someone to teach him . A gust of wind would pick up dust and blow it hotly against the faces of the men  --  they would blink against the pain , a tribute to their mortality.  |p133A  voice over the loud-speaker announced the race with great pleasure and zest . Karen opened her eyes reluctantly . " Let 's feel your hand , " Jerry said . He took hold of her and said , grinning , to Max , " She 's afraid of this one . " Jerry was a short , slim , neat man of about thirty-eight , though he looked younger . " Her hand is like ice . " " Let go of her , " Max said without looking around . The sound of the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She forced herself to stare down at the track . She awaited the familiar roaring . The voice over the loudspeakeridentified the drivers and their cars lovingly . " Here it goes , " Jerry said , craning his neck . For a moment the roar of the autos filled the air ; then it seemed to be yanked away . The car designed by Max 's companywas silver , and gleamed in the sunlight with a fine , sleek cleanliness . It sped above the dark earth with such precision and power that Karen felt , as always , the suggestion of something unnatural  --  almost mystical  --  in what she saw . " Beautiful , beautiful , " Max murmured , clasping his big hands together . " A fine start . " The crowd cheered . Shar drove in a whirl of dust , through the dust , around now to the turn , and the dust wove through and behind him , for a moment obscuring the soiled white of the outer retaining wall , as though the wall itself had turned to swirling dust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start , and ahead of him the uneven string of cars seemed to jerk and glint in the light , veering from left to right . Seeing Shar approach them , the crowd yelled its encouragement , as if they supposed Shar was behind because of his clumsiness and was now making a move to catch up . The lead cars were so far away that Karen could not see their numbers . She heard Max and Jerry exchanging information that meant nothing to her ; Shar had an enemy some/where , one of the drivers . One of the men . Now Shar 's approachsteadied and it looked as if the distance between him and the lead cars was static . All the cars looked as if they were set motionless on a great revolving disc . " He 's waiting for something , " Jerry said . Races made him excited , like a child ; he began them coolly , ended them in a passion . " There . He 's starting in to move . " Karen felt the excitement of the crowd begin to pulsate within her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now back toward the stadium . Sunlight flashed off the hoods , then was obscured by a thin floating cloud of dust . " There , there , " Jerry said , reaching across to grip Max . " What did I tell you ? " They clasped hands in their excitement . Shar was still behind the other autos , but he had begun to swerve his car out carefully toward the retaining wall so that he could inch up on the others . For all his speed , he moved slowly and painstakingly , as if he were able to draw himself forward only by a dizzying rapport between himself and the next car . " Look at that , " Jerry said . " Beautiful driving ! Did you see that ? " Karen did not understand . Out on the track Shar began to overtake the others more deliberately . He moved above the dirt in the little car as though he were willing the movement  --  Sharwith his look of neat , useless , splendid artifice , his shielded eyes , gloved hands , the stiff appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their encouragement . Their strained voices were tense with anticipatedpleasure . The silver car moved up alongside the others , passing them with effort . Fragmented clouds of dust blew against it . Karen'sthroat was dry . The voice out of the loud-speaker suddenlyannounced something : there was an accident out in one of the fields , there were spectators involved . He asked for calmness , for people to keep their seats . Everyone , even Karen ,  |p135wanted  to brush aside his words , as if they hovered like insects about them , distracting them from the race . " Accident ! " Max said . " A terrible word ! The man should be punished , to use such a word at this time ! " They heard the wail of an ambulance ; one of the ambulances down by the track turned and moved out of sight . Again the voice asked for calm , and then it too returned to the race . Jerry gripped Karen with his lean , strong fingers . " Son of a bitch ! " he said happily . Shar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any second she would see him swerve out of the groove and into the pile of tire dust at the turns , and then swerve and spin helplessly to the outer wall , his figure within the careening car a blur  --  the crowd would scream in delight , Jerry would stand  --  suddenly  --  swearing  --  But nothing happened . He passed three cars ; another ; he was moving up skillfully on the outside . It was queer to think that Shar performedthis game as if he were nothing to her , as if none of them even knew him . He might have been a stranger , reeling around through the blinding dust and the hot smell of oil ; and for an instant she felt the fear of losing him , greater than the fear that he might die . What could draw that man to her , what could strengthen the rapport between them , jerk it taut like a length of wire ? " Shar , Shar , " Karen murmured aloud , her heart pumping as the stadium shivered with excitement . She felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the drivers . She felt herself ease in among them , her own body wet like theirs with perspiration . The muscles about her mouth were taut as she tried not to cry out . The silver car moved up into third place , on the outside . A long trail of dust lifted behind it . Four cars swerved around the turn at once . " There , " Jerry said in alarm , " look at those sons of bitches . What did I tell you ? That 's him  --  that 's the one . " The two lead cars raced side by side ; Karen gathered fromp136what was being said that they were from the same company . She could not understand most of what was going on and took no interest in it except at this time . " What did I tell you ? " cried Jerry to no one . Racing down the stretch toward them now , the cars were still together ; they sped in a tight , shivering clump , slowly drawing closer to one another . Now Shar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . He wanted the car before him to move over . They sped past , swerving around the curve . The other car  --  it was bright red  --  slid out a little , but before Shar had time to ease into the space the other car came back . Beside Karen Jerry sat striking his palm with his fist . " The sons of bitches , " he said . " Small-time hicks with two drivers . " Shar had drawn up close behind the outside car and now he eased his car forward so that it touched the other , gently ; everyone saw the man 's helmeted head jerk around as if he were terrified . " My good God , " Max said . In astonishment his hand crept to his chest , as if to soothe his pounding heart . The man in the red car made a motion for Shar to get back . Shar prodded the car again . Now some of the people in the stands got to their feet . " Get him ! Get him ! " they shouted ; Karen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and perspiration seemed to be pushed forward by their noise . " Look at those sons of bitches , " Jerry said , " think they got it all planned ! Are n't they asking for it ? Why wo n't that guy let him through ? Do n't they know who he is ? " Jerry was grinding his hands together , flesh against flesh . In reality he hated Shar , but at races he adored him ; like most of the men , Shar included , he seemed to come alive only at this spectacle of danger . " There ! There ! " Jerry cried with pleasure . " Now he 's coming . " Everyone stood . Max helped Karen up , taking time to smile down at her . A murmur rose to a swellp137and broke as Shar prodded the red car again  --  this time the car gave way , easing out to give Shar room . The driver turned and motioned for Shar to pass . The people cheered . They felt the silver car had made its way forward against all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there he goes , " Jerry said . Shar had begun inching up into the space . The lead car whirled around the turn as if trying desperately to get away from him . Shar was a few yards behind it , and the red car , on the outside , was a few yards behind Shar ; the fourth car had dropped behind . They made the turn and raced now down the stretch . Karen could see , shielding her eyes , that Shar and the driver in the red car were making signs to each other . " What are they doing ? " she said aloud . No one heard her . The red car began to drop back deliberately . It gave way to Shar and the crowd took this with disappointment ; someone cried , " A coward ! A coward ! " The car dropped back again and Karen saw  --  at first without comprehension  --  that Shar too had dropped back , as if to tease him ; they raced now side by side . At this maneuver a group of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they grinned and nodded at one another . This was something to see ! This was how it was done ! Max reached across Karen and touched Jerry . " Get down there , " he said . " Have them tell him to stop . This is enough . " Jerry leaned across Karen and said with a pained look , " What the hell ? Do you think I can tell him anything ? " " Have them down at the garage write do n't ' on the blackboard  --  go on . Do it , " Max said , showing his teeth . Jerry got up and went somewhere . Down on the track Shar was bumping the red car . The red car tried to speed ahead to escape , then tried to fall back to escape ; Shar kept even with it . The lead car strained to get away from this trouble , and behind the two struggling cars the others rushed in a flurry of mute order , stung with dust.  |p138Max  and Karen looked up to see Jerry return . " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max . " I saw the pit , though . Mitch is out there holding up a sign . " Behind them the crowd roared continuously . Max strained to hear Jerry . " He 's got something written on it for Shar  --  I ca n't do no more . " " Ca n't you even get down there ? " Max said . " The exit 's blocked with kids , " Jerry said . " Besides , I ca n't do no more . Let him have his fun . " Max stared . Veins in his forehead had swollen . Karen , looking at his big face so close to hers , felt sudden revulsion for him . " You could tell him a tire 's going . You could tell him to come in , " Max said . He spoke calmly . " I ca n't , " Jerry said , " Goddam it , I told you the exit 's blocked . " Max sat back . Shar and the driver in the red car were approaching the turn before the other wing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prod , then he pulled past ; he straightened out and began to move away . The crowd showed its disappointment . " Ought to show the bastard ! The coward ! " a very drunken man behind Karen screamed . Though the spectatorsseemed to think the fun was past , Jerry said into Karen 's ear , " Watch this . Watch your boy . " Karen stared as if there were something down on the track she ought to be seeing . " Here comes an accident if I ever saw one , " Jerry murmured . " That son of a bitch ! " And then it happened , as neatly and as surprisingly as if it were truly an accident  --  no one could blame Shar for this : at the turn , the silver car , going a little too fast , swerved out and sideswiped the red car , not very seriously . The silver car , shaking for a moment , regained control of itself . The red car seemed all right  --  everyone screamed , but for what , for whose sake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to the crowd 's secret desire , the car spun suddenly out of control . Out of the invisible ring of pressure it flew , and as Shar and the lead car sped away , the red car traded ends , dust exploded up like a bomb , the volume of the crowd 's delight swelled to burst/ing . All eyes followed the stricken car as it headed for the retaining wall . For an instant it looked isolated : it seemed to hang against the dirty wall , a little off the ground . Then it jerked back into motion and , bursting into flames , scraped along the wall like a discarded toy , farther and farther along the wall , perhaps for a hundred feet , skidding , with its yellow flames almost obscuring it . What was left of it slammed finally against a concrete jutting and stopped . Karen sobbed aloud . A siren began to wail and people shouted , individually now  --  behind her , beside her . At the wreck masses of flame licked up against the glowing concrete . Across the track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds of dark smoke had begun to rise . Max had hold of Karen'sarm . " An accident , an accident , " he murmured . " An unfortunatehappening . " Unless wreckage interfered with the race the other cars would not be flagged down ; so far as they were concerned nothing had happened . Karen had witnessed this before but still could not understand it . She watched the untouched cars reel in their frantic order , glad to be alive . Shar was in the lead now , and dust roared up behind him grandly . The cars rushed , one by one , through the screen of black smoke and fire . " Look at that , " Jerry said , laughing . " Going right through . Like drivingthrough the poor bastard 's blood . " Karen put her hands to her face . They were cold , shocking . " My God , my God , Shar , " she whispered , " do n't let it be yet . . . not yet . . . . " The line of cars passed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their colors in spite of the dust that had covered them . At the wreck men moved about slowly ; the ambulance had been backed up to the wall . The fire burned with gusto . It looked as if the car had stopped tilted on end , its top in the air . Men battled the flames energetically , with the air of people who are being watched.  |p140Yet  the horror of what had happened did not really dawn on Karen until she heard , a moment later , Max 's murmuring voice . His forefinger was upraised . " What keeps them on it ? " he said philosophically . " By common sense you would expect them all to fly off like that  --  drawn off  --  so ! " He made a deadly flicking motion with his wrist and looked at Karen . She stared at him . Her eyes burned in her head . " It 's the law of the circle , the one pressure on the outside and the other on the inside , they push together  --  the little car , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . And the speed he makes , the little engine , and the pressure up in front of it , weight he has to push into  --  " He looked down at Karen , his mouth about to expand into a smile . " Amazing thing ! Amazing , the two pressures , one pushing in , the other pushing out . That is how our lives are ! " He stood , his face twitching with the discovery and the delight his words were leading him into . " Yes  --  see  --  the pressures are opposed , they fight each other . The law of the circle , that keeps the planets , you know , on the circumference , the other wants to draw them out and off somewhere  --  off somewhere , lost  --  Two forces , one to live and one to die  --  An amazing thing ! A most wonderful thing ! You see today how it works , like lines drawn to show you  --  Our Shar is full of life , he can not be killed . He is filled with life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a considerable distance . The crowd applauded dutifully ; some of their attention was drawn to the burning car , some of it to Shar and his triumph  --  for , though death fascinated them , victory was an admirablething and they wanted to share in it . Karen said clearly , " Shar is a killer . " Max turned to her . They were still standing , like everyone else . He put his hand to his wet chest ; he pretended he had not heard her . Karen knew that he , too , was a killer , and that his past consisted of brutalities he never had to watch or to ac/count for . " And you disgust me , " she said , staring at his little astonished eyes . " Why , Karen  --  I ca n't hear you  --  what did you say ? " " I said you disgust me , " Karen whispered . Max 's face was wet with perspiration . It had gathered like dew on his forehead and hung in little salty drips on his broad nose . Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the unbelievable crudity of Karen 's words ; as if for her sake , for her own good , he seemed reluctant to have heard her . " You disgust me ! " Karen cried , so loudly that peoplearound them turned to stare in amusement . " All of you ! Disgusting  --  dirty  --  you do n't even clap to see men die , or pant for it  --  like the others  --  you 're beyond that  --  It 's a theory to you , it 's nothing to you  --  Shar kills a man and it 's nothing to you ! Shar is filled with life !  --  Shar is filled with death ! Shar is filled with death ! " Max took her arm . " My dear child , my child , " he said . " This was an accident . " Karen snatched her arm away from him . " Not all things are accidents , " she said coldly , staring at Max 's bewildered face . She understood , beyond his polite bewilderment , her own fate  --  she saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning fatly to open a book , sitting propped up with pillows in the sunlight ; but she did not care . Even the child growing within her  --  a speck of life , a ghostly image , a mockery of life  --  would not escape his wrath ; but she did not care.  |p142That  night Max sat with his back to the wall so that he could see everything that went on in the crowded place . He ate melonsluxuriously : pale green melons , smooth as skin , that the waiter  --  a boy of about seventeen  --  kept bringing him . Seeds had spilled out onto the table and on the front of his shirt , though he did not seem to notice . He waved the big glistening knife at them as he spoke . " This child was frightened by the race  --  her hands were cold , ice cold . " He made a move to embraceKaren , a symbolic gesture . " She can not get used to it.  |p143Every  race is new to her . She can not believe you will survive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been drinking for some time and , as usual , the liquor worked to quiet him in preparation for later outbursts of rage . He smiled tautly . " A woman 's love is a beautiful thing to see , " Max went on , licking at a sudden rivulet of juice that ran down his chin . " She is transformed by it , absolutely transformed . That has never been part of my experience  --  I know you will survive the race , I have no doubt in you . My mentality is masculine and objective , but hers  --  hers is possessive . She fears she will lose you . " Max 's bright , merry words evoked a painful smile on Karen 's face . She avoided Shar 's eyes . With a flourish Max finished this melon and took a deep breath and called for the waiter . " Anotherone of these , " he said , sighing helplessly . The table was wet with juice and scattered seeds that the boy  --  a rushed , alarmed-looking country boy with long hair  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me how the race was for you , " Max said , laying a damp hand on Shar 's arm . The place was already crowded , yet more people came in continuously . At the bar a child had been lifted up so he could look around , squinting through the drifting clouds of smoke . His mother , whispering something to him , evidently meant him to see Shar . Along the bar and at the other tables , and milling about at the door , eyes would be directed toward Shar with great wonder and pride , as if he were somehow a credit to them . From time to time men ambled over to congratulate him and , for some reason , to congratulate Karen too . She would stare at them with cold astonishment . Music from the jukebox exploded into the room . Mosquitoes and flies scattered to the ceiling . The sense of well-being that pervaded the place showed itself most explicitly on Max 's face as he bent forward to listen to Shar 's words . Shar talked of thep144race in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen , for she felt there was something unhealthy about them ; excluded from them , her isolation pointed out as if Shar and Max were staring hard at her , Karen sat in a flurry of smoke and music and insects , pretending to be interested in something across the floor . At the bar Jerry stood talking with some women . He had a neat , smooth head , smooth skin that looked ageless ; his eyes were small and bright , like buttons . Whatever he said made the women laugh  --  they turned to each other helplessly , sighing in their laughter . From time to time Jerry glanced over at Karen and , as if stimulated by her blank , weary expression , was inspiredto charm the women even more . One was fairly old  --  perhaps forty , with fantastic red-blond hair that lifted away from her head as if electricity were coursing through it . The other , quieter , her expression sly and pleased , had long black hair curled at its tips . Her face was large and amiable , teased into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes , and a violent , exotic outlining of her lips . Whenever anyone fended his way over to see Shar , to attempt to shake hands with him , Jerry would straighten quickly , ignore the women , and watch to see if he was needed : this would be indicated by a flapping of Max 's big hand . So far there had been no trouble . The men connected with the garage whose car had crashed were not around  --  they were believed to have left right after the race . When Jerry saw that everything was all right he would relax and his grin would come back , bright and mischievous . One of the women leaned to him and asked him to light her cigarette . In one corner a few couples tried to dance . They seemed to gallop together , violently ; feet kicked the floor , kicked the air , tangled together and left the dancers hugging each other and gasping in ecstasy . The jukebox glowed grimy colors : red , yel/low , green . Karen , who had been forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music lull and soothe her , easing her gently away from herself . Max and Shar talked together , heads conspiring . Shar had a hard , handsome face . His eyes were dark , shadowed by the strange light , and his lips , twitching up into a grin from time to time , looked hard , as if chiseled out of stone . He blew smoke luxuriously about him . " Did you hear the people much ? " Karen heard Max ask . " Did you hear them applaud you ? They were mad for you  --  they were in ecstasy for you ! " The boy returned with another melon . He carried it balancedup beside his head in one hand , without ceremony , as if it were a rock . Karen saw Max 's tongue skim his lips as the melon was presented to him . Max picked up the wet knife , brandishing it aloft for a momentas if he were pleased by its look of competence . With a sigh that reached every part of his vast body he bent to the melon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table as if shocked . Max cut a slice out of the melon and offered it to Shar , who shook his head ; then he offered it to Karen , who did not understand for a moment . Then she too shook her head . Her fingers tightened around her glass . Max lifted the slice to his mouth and bit into it : for a moment his expression hesitated , judging , tasting ; then it was found to be good . A good melon . His eyes swam with the pleasure of its taste and with the delightof such company  --  such beautiful young people . " What he tells me is fascinating  --  it is as if I had been there myself , " he assured Karen . " He makes me relive it . Perhaps at night I will dream about it  --  who knows ? I will be stuffed in the little car , my stomach pushed up into my face !  --  driving and winning a race to make people cheer ! " He laughed at his humor , Shar grinned mockingly . Karen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone at the table next to them was Max 's doctor . His black bag beside him , ready for use , he sat gazing vaguely towardMax ; he drank with perfunctory regularity , as if he were taking medicine . Something had happened to make his frizzy hair stand up , for it framed his bald spot like a tiny halo , glistening with perspiration . His face was slack ; he was silent . In the months Karen had been associated with him , in company with him , she had never heard him speak to anyone but Max , and then only when he was addressed . He seemed to live in a trance : even tonight , when women or even the girls still dressed in their satin outfits approached him , merry and teasing , he stared at them with silent fury until their smiles faded and they backed awkwardly away . Never did he act outside of his role except to follow Max around with his black bag and to pour out liquor for himself , which he did fondly yet without emotion . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined Karen herself ; he had seemed a different person then . But it was long ago , before she knew who he was , and at a time when she had almost lost her capacity for memory ... . A fat man in a maroon uniform , unbuttoned on his chest , pushed his way through the crowd to get to Shar . His face was red and shiny , as if polished . " Did they glue it on ? Eh ? Did they glue it back on ? " he cried , winking at Shar . " Glue what ? " said Shar . " That guy 's head ! I heard the top of his head was sheared off ! " the man exclaimed . " Oh , but he ast for it ! He ast for it ! Listen , mister  --  " Shar stared up at him . " Listen , I think you done right  --  in a race like that was  --  I  --  " " What the hell are you talking about ? " Shar said . " I know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all again but his enthusiasm had begun to ebb ; he turned to go . " ' Course could n't nobody be sure of it  --  that 's smart that way , " he said . " I 'll come to see you any time you 're here . " He disappeared . Shar shrugged his shoulders . " There is some/thing about you that appeals to them , " Max said . " I 'm not sure what it is  --  perhaps they sense you are like them , I mean originally  --  fromthe country , like them . They distrust people from our civilization ! " " Nobody could judge if that was on purpose or not , " Shar said thoughtfully . " Nobody could tell , least of all me . They think they would have done it out there , if it had been them ; but they ca n't speak for me . " " Did you hear that ? " Max said to Karen . He was impressed by Shar 's words , which were indeed thoughtful for Shar ; the liquor had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that myself . " " Nobody in the world could do that on purpose , " Shar said . " Not going around a turn like that . The car acted by itself  --  by itself . I might have been thinking of it , just thinking  --  and then it acted by itself ! " Karen looked at him in disgust . He met her gaze with a mocking grin . " I had power out there , " he said , leaning forward , " I felt that car moving with me , me moving with it , all the same thing ! The same soul ! A good way to die , that would be  --  to turn the car toward the stand , slam it into all those fat faces , shovel it into them ! Not a driver but that he thinks of that  --  wants that . A good way to die when it comes time . " " You are no one to speak of dying , " Max said , eating his melon . " You have a long life before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . " Shar looked at Karen . His face was hard and empty . " But what good is that , " he broke out , " if all of them are different  --  all those lives  --  if you ca n't put them together ! One good car after another , one car better than another , and every time I take them out I 'm better than before  --  But a race is no sooner started than it 's over , another one over . There is n't enough time for it all ! "  |p148Max  wondered at him . " There is time for everything , " he said sententiously . Shar finished his drink . " I never had any trouble finding the right car , " he said to Max . They looked at each other seriously . " Some guys spend their lives looking for that  --  I found it right off . I found it with you . I took it to the limit , the first one  --  until the rear hub wanted to come off , goddam threads cut the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm still alive now  --  still alive now , and how many of them are dead ! Poor goddam bastards ! I force them  --  force them  --  Cars or people or myself , all the way out , to the limit , as far as it can go without killing me . I force it ! What the hell is it any other way ? Are you alive any other way ? I know how much the car can take , but not what I can take . I never yet found my limit ! " he cried . This was taken up by Max with great admiration . He turned , nodding , to Karen . In a voice meant to be confidential he murmured , " You hear him ? He is a fine man , he is filled with life . You must not try to pull him off  --  you know  --  I spoke of that before to you  --  You must cherish him . " " I cherish him , " Karen said . " She sucks me to death ! " Shar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Max and Karen watched him ; Karen had begun to tremble . " He is angry with you , he does n't know why , " Max said , licking his lips , pretending to be sorry . " You must tell him soon about the child  --  if there is a child  --  I ' 11 help you with it , I 'm good with him , he will listen to me . He wo n't be angry if I tell him . I 'll tell him  --  it would be like a grandchild to me , a child related by blood to me ! Related by the soul ! He is filled with life and will understand what it is like to spread life  --  to give birth , to reproduce himself  --  " " You 're insane , " Karen said.  |p149Max  wiped seeds off his chin . " You are hard on me , " he complained . " Do you think I 'm insane ? What is insane about me ? I am given to reading too much ; I sit too much in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a vice inherited from my great-grandmother , who weighed three hundred pounds ! Will you blame me for her ? Did she know you , would she be judged by you ? A fine , respectable woman with her own bed built especially for her !  --  You are my delight , Karen , my puzzle , my mystery , I could dream of you at night ! We must know each other better ; you must tell me of yourself . You must tell me what you dream  --  like Shar does ; some of the most fascinating hours of my life have been spent listening to that man talk , allowing him to lead me through his mind , reveal himself to me ! You look away  --  you seem ashamed  --  what are you ashamed of ? That Shar reveals himself to me ? That we are close , that two human beings are close ? That we love each other ? Do you think all Shar 's passion is for you ? He tells me of you  --  he describes his feelings with you , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent . Karen stared at his averted eyes and at the hungry gleam of his big teeth . What he had said alarmed her . She was struck by a sense of terror greater than any disgust . " Tells you of me ! " she wanted to cry . She wanted to seize him , shake him , shout into his face . " What does he tell you of me ? What does he say ? " As if Shar knew what was going on , he faced them with a mock grin . He sat down heavily and poured a drink out of the new bottle he had bought . " Karen ? " he said . She said " no " and turned aside . As the hours passed , the tavern became more crowded and noisy . It was a small , shanty-like building out in the country , not far from a swamp , which Max had noticed on the way into Synderdale and had admired for its authenticity . His own money made by investments in gambling spots and taverns ofp150a more sophisticated nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had explained , the kind of people one met there ; he liked the muddy floors , the jukeboxes , the country girls with their big smiles and strong arms . He liked the old neon signs and the old-fashioned bars and rickety tables and the proud photographs , yellowed by time , that showed local hunters with moose and deer and bears subdued by their guile and skill . " I love their lives , " he cried , waving at the boisterous crowd . " I love to see them so  --  they 're happy , they enjoy themselves ! They do n't think about it  --  they drink , they dance , the floor shakes with their joy ! " It shook now , not only with the feverish dancing at the far end of the place , but with scufflings and aborted fist fights . Karen watched them cautiously . She had seen men eying her , at the same time , and in almost the same way that they eyed Shar : it was an envy not far from open spite . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the black-haired woman leaning seriously toward him . The doctor had been forced to move and now sat behind Max , though not at the table with him and Shar and Karen . Groups of men circulated , laughing importantly , calling out friendly insults . Mosquitoesbuzzed about the lights as if driven insane by the noise . Karen tried to close her eyes against the whirling faces and eyes and smells , but she was jerked awake by the slow , fond conversation between Shar and Max that was drifting toward her . Max was saying , " I have talked with her and I believe we are getting to know each other better . We are beginning to communicate . She has opened my heart wider , I will see you more clearly , more completely , through her  --  " Two men appeared at the table to interrupt this . One was a young Negro , absurdly dressed ; he looked like something professional  --  doctor , minister , schoolteacher . The other was ap151slovenly young man with wild hair and a slack , pouting face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered that these men were employed by Max . One of them , the Negro , seemed favored ; Shar invited him to sit down . The other pulled up a chair as well . Both were fairly drunk . Max was eating oysters now . He offered them some : the Negro declined graciously , the other scooped out an oyster and stuffed it into his mouth . Watching him , Karen felt a swirlingof nausea . She saw that as he ate his eyes wandered over to her and  --  incredibly  --  seemed to hint at recognition , comradeship . She looked away . The talk now centered about the race : moments were relived , details repeated . Snatches of conversations with other people were told . The plump young man  --  his name was Ponzi  --  talked with skill , evoking imagery and impressions that showed his imagination . Max and Shar listened to him in silence . The Negro put a hand on his shoulder , looking a little embarrassed , but Ponzi ignored him . " Found me sitting in his room ! I was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ! Such a woman , such big blond hair ! " Ponzi said . " He got mad and asked me what I wanted and damned if I could think of it  --  could n't think of it . " He hiccuped sadly . " Found me sitting in the dark . I used to sit in the dark , by myself , in one of the upstairs closets  --  had to get away from them . " Jerry came over to the table , followed by the women . They touched their hair , looking at Shar . One of them , the sly-faced one with black hair , crowded in next to Karen . Ponzi , instead of giving way to these people , instead of taking the hint his Negrofriend gave him  --  that he was annoying Shar and Max  --  began to talk louder , not even giving himself time to eat any oysters . Jerry reached over Shar 's shoulder and took an oyster , dipped it in the sauce , and ate it with obvious satisfaction . Thep152women , offered some , demurred sweetly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clouds of smells  --  perfume and beer  --  made Karen feel faint . Ponzi was still talking . " The goddamnedest thing ! Mitchie here told me not to tell it  --  says he ai n't got the stomach or the ears to hear it  --  Those people on the grass . I went out back just in time to see it  --  was n't trying  --  hell , I did n't know it would happen . How would I know that ? Did I come on purpose to see that , or the accident either ? Mitchie says he took care of two cousins of his that lived with them , that had  --  that were  --  " He tapped his forehead decisively . " Says he got along with them good and played with them  --  so he can take care of me ; thinks I 'm a little loony ! He does ! " He gave the Negro a playfulpunch . A girl dressed as a baton twirler appeared behind the Negro , gripping his shoulders ; when he looked around she bent and smiled into his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this girl the two women tensed . They had hardly noticed Karen . " Well , these people piled up like sardines in that what-do-you-call-it  --  a homemade grandstand some bastard built out of pipes or whatever it was , " Ponzi went on , louder . " On the top they had bottles and were dumpingthem out on the ones beneath , to make them yell . And they had bags full of lunch , too  --  eating like pigs . Mostly men on top , a couple of kids . There were five levels . A lot of kids , they jiggled it  --  probably caused the trouble . A whole lot of people . The cars were going around the farthest turn and somebodyprobably leaned over to look , or maybe some of the kids scuffling around  --  and the goddam thing begins to tilt ! Starts tilting ! Everybody screams . Did you hear that ? Or maybe you could n't  --  too much noise already . The people sitting down in the grass around it point and gape like mad and watch it come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of men to scramble off and jump off the back  --  theyp153got away . It fell over and crushed them all together ! Poor bastards ! " Ponzi cried . Karen saw that there was something peculiar about his face  --  it was mocking and anguished at once . The young girl  --  she was about Karen 's age  --  put her arms around the Negro 's neck and leaned against him , peepingover his shoulder at the rest of the people . She had big arms , a little flabby at the tops , but was pretty in a broad , blunt , happy way ; her lips glistened . Karen saw Shar watchingher . " They screamed and screamed  --  two or three of them were dead right away , broken necks , and some others had backs broken  --  or cracked  --  whatever happens to a back , " Ponzi giggled shrilly . " I do n't know . And wriggling around ! Wriggling with arms and legs sticking out of the pipes , wrapped around the pipes , some of them crawling out  --  blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people came to help  --  I helped them  --  I  --  " As if this were saying too much , he returned to his earlier tone . He said with mocking relish , " All around them people sat on blankets , drinking beer and eating chicken  --  cold chicken ! You could smell it ! Some of them gave us their blankets , some came over to help  --  the ambulance got there then  --  Most of them kept right on watching the race and eating . They would n't be bothered . I got a blanket away from one of them  --  dirty bastard !  --  I put it over a girl to hide her , her face was  --  it was  --  She did n't die , I do n't think she died , " Ponzi said , " but she was  --  She could n't scream , even , it was Jerry , catching a glance from Max , went to the young man and poked him in the back with a finger . " Outside , " he said . " You can puke it up outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just telling you ! " Ponzi said , blinking as if sweat had run stinging into his eyes . " Thought you 'd want to know ! Did n't you want to know ? " He leaned around clumsily and looked at Karen , who had drawn back from the table ; shep154stared at him as if he were a creature in a nightmare . The women looked at Karen as if she had just appeared beside them . Shar stared at her  --  furiously . Karen murmured , without thinking , " You 've suffered . " Ponzi was herded outside . He seemed to go without any protest . Mitchie followed him  --  he explained to them he had promised to keep Ponzi out of trouble . He wished that crazy white man had let him alone  --  all white men told him their troubles , that was because he was Negro so it did n't count . They could tell him anything they wanted , no matter how bad it made them look . Later on , if they decided to hate him , that was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It joined them to the brotherhood of white men ! Mitchie got his laugh and turned to leave ; he was liked by them , Shar and Max approved of him , though as soon as he left he was forgotten . The girl in the satin outfit sat down plumply in his seat , smiling in a veritable sweat of anticipation . " A loud-mouthed bastard , " Jerry said , reaching for another oyster . " I 'll drown him in a pan full of grease tomorrow . " Shar had not spoken for some time . During most of Ponzi 's monologue he had been drinking steadily and staring at Karen . When he put down his glass she saw that his hand was trembling . He pointed across the table at her . " What did you say to him ! You said something to that fat son of a bitch ! I heard you ! " The women shivered deliciously ; the girl , her mouth openingwetly , looked around at Karen . She blinked to see Karen there  --  she had not noticed her before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we all were , " Max said , putting a hand out on Shar 's arm . To his chagrin , Shar jerked away . " A bitch ! A cheap bitch ! " Shar said . Karen saw how he hated her . " Come crawling to me for it ! Left the old man bleeding like a pig  --  flat on his back in the mud ! She did that  --  she did that ! She sucks me , " he said , " sucks me  --  She kills me  --  " Max looked alarmed , but Jerry , standing back , just watched in amusement . The doctor 's eyes wandered briefly to Shar 's face and then drifted away . Karen sat , feeling everyone 's eyes on her , in a trance of fear  --  yet , beyond the fear , her mind worked clearly , without confusion ; she knew who she was . " Sucks me dry ! Sucks me dry ! " Shar shouted , showing his teeth . " She wants to kill me ! " Max stood , jarring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tavern , but Shar , yelling across the cluttered , seed-strewn table , kept on , his voice climbing to hysteria : " Sucks me ! Sucks me ! The old man flat on his back  --  mudtheother one shriveling up to a bunch of ashes ! She comes to me ! She comes to me ! " Max and Jerry got Karen out . They fended their way through the fascinated crowd , Karen closing her eyes against the looks , against the hungry faces of the men around her . At the door Max cried out : some kids were playing with a long , limp snake . " Get it away ! Get it away ! " Max screamed . When Jerry had taken care of it they went outside to the car . They only had to wait a minute for the doctor , who ran up , panting , and climbed in the back seat . Driving away , they heard a happy roar of music and voices . It was fortunate the doctor had come , for Max soon had need of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack of some sort , he accepted pills that the doctor gave him  --  his big fingers , still sticky , trembled as he raised them to his mouth . His breath was labored and frightened and he seemed to have forgottenKaren . Jerry , on Karen 's other side , drove fast ; he was sullen and angry . " What the hell is he going to do with three of them ! " he muttered to himself.  |p156She  could not believe that in the morning her life would not continue as usual . Back in the hotel room she had stood for a while at the window , looking down at the crowded street with the curtains held aside as if she were expecting someone down there to glance up at her suddenly . Her isolation made her feel viciously powerful , yet she was conscious always of the gentle , sickening loss of her power , a failure she could not admit , as she had never been able to admit when she was a child that after some trivial argument her father had really for/gotten about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiveness . Behind her the room was cluttered , the bed rumpled and dirty . In the sullen light nothing looked familiar , though it was the same room  --  it was always the same room  --  she had lived in for months . It was not the thought that something was going to happen that paralyzed her with anger , but rather the knowledge that she could not control it . She took a shower , wasting time , standing with her head bowed and her eyes closed . She played back to herself things that had happened that day , thinking of Shar and of Max . Their faces appeared in her mind 's eye like faces in comic strips or cartoons , creatures bereft of life and soul , therefore invulnerable . And had she come so far , she thought angrily , to discover that he was not vulnerable ? In the bathroom mirror she watched herself without interest , dryingher hair , combing it out . The ceiling light cast shadows down upon her . Little lines appeared about her mouth and underher eyes . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask as indifferent to itself as to anyone else . Staring at that face , she understood that Shar would not be with her tonight ; and she did not wonder at him . He was with another woman . And yet , she thought , her face twisting , becoming so ugly she had to look aside , he would not forget her that easily . He would think of her , just as she thought of him . The fact that she thought of him would force him to think of her ; he would not be free . In the other woman 's face he would see her face and when the woman touched him he would feel Karen touching him .... She walked slowly about the room , pleased at her own calmness . Now and then she stumbled into something and drew back dreamily , setting it straight , picking it up and staring at it , letting it fall again to the floor . She had not just recently learned the value of forced , feigned calm ; it had been with her forp158years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed the perfect control with which he had faced death ?  --  her own mother 's death , when Karen was still a child , and she and the others had been forbidden to enter that queer-smelling room for so long . Men spoke of his steadiness at hunting ; there was some story , some vague story of a wounded bear , she remembered , a dog torn in half , and her father . . . her father doing something , something unexpected and brave . She and her brothers had tried to envision that scene from the fragments they had been given ; it had inspired them to ecstasies . Her childish nightmares pitted bear against father , a match of insanebrutality that she could not stop , could not look away from , as if the blood had fascinated her . From these dreams she had awakened sobbing with terror , the bedclothes twisted around her like arms or legs , struggling to hold her down . The bed was still a little damp . Karen pulled the sheet up and lay on top of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globe  --  she lay in a stupor approaching sleep . She knew she should turn out the light but she did not want to get up . At the point at which sleep began her mind warned her against it and jerked her awake . It was as if she were being drawn toward a great dark hole , a kind of mouth . Dreams and fragments of dreams crowded her mind . Shar in the silver auto  --  Shar with his helmet , his green goggles , walking somewhere as precisely as any machine  --  yet when she approached him he turned and was someone else . He snatched off the goggles and stared at her in dismay , as if he too were sorry they did not know each other . Karen was seized by a sensation of hatred , and she thought for the first time in her life that hatred charged her , nourished her , prodded her along . She hated all strangers . She hated the vast , strange world that she could not control , that her family could not control , that her father did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might wan/der down on the street , alone , unrecognized . . . . " I hate all h strangers , " Karen said . This woke her . She sat up suddenly as if she supposed herself in danger . Her arms and legs were stiff and her throat dry . When she went to the window and looked out she sensed that it was hours later , perhaps almost dawn . The street was desertedand the hotel was quiet . Her hands clasped before her , she looked around as if she expected to see Shar . In the light the room was yellowed and tattered , the wallpaper stained at the ceiling with brown watermarks . One of them was in the shape of a gigantic cockroach ; this caught her eye . She wondered what she would say to Shar in the morning . For the first time silence might fail her . It might not be strong enough . She had always felt her silent , limp passivity to be powerful , a bloodless power she knew was not admirable but could not be matched by real passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen 's silence was static and could not be wearied . When , after a one-sided argument , Shar would seize her and press his face against her and tell her he was sorry , he was sorry , she felt how precarious was his strength and how tormented he was by her quiet assurances that he had not hurt her , she was all right . She would pretend not to understand his anguish . Yet if became to her in silence and did not hide his face , if he simply ill looked at her in this ugly light , judging and assessing her , she did not believe herself strong enough to face him . Her fingers twitched . They might have been yearning for something  --  the scissors in the kitchen drawer at home , the fishing knife one of her brothers had found . But at the back of her mind , dreamily , was the stubborn conviction that nothing had changed . He could not have gone to another woman , she did not believe it . She could not imagine it . Had he really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things she could not even imagine ? She did not believe it . Itp160was impossible that she could be unfaithful to him  --  she was disgusted by the thought  --  and so it was impossible that he could be unfaithful to her . Before this knowledge her superficialworries ebbed dizzily . Such things did not happen . Yet , at the window , she closed her fist in the curtain . If it were true , somehow , it would still mean nothing . At the instant of his passion he could think only of her  --  in his imagination it would be Karen who held him . He would never be free of her . She opened the closet door . Idly she looked through her clothes , as if they might tell her something . The blue dress she had worn to the race : once she and Shar had been walking somewhere and she had had that dress on and she had noticed him glancing at her  --  how fiercely proud she had been , how she had wanted to take his arm and feel his hard muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little soiled . Karen had bought it one afternoon by herself , wasting time again until Shar was finished at the track . In the store mirror her smug little reflection had stared back at her coldly , contrived by her art to look ageless . She had been isolated , complete ; a stranger . The other women in the store were commonplace , they bustled about and touched things , asked prices , chatted with saleswomen ; not Karen . She had felt feverishly isolated . What pride , what ferocious satisfaction ! The ordinary lives of those ordinary women trailed in and out of the store and were not capable , even , of assessing Karen ; she had felt that . Watching herself in the mirror , her shoulders taut , her eyes deliberating , avoiding the pleased face of the saleswoman at her shoulder , she had held her jaw so rigid that her teeth had begun to ache . And now she remembered what she had thought then , what had come to her suddenly without preparation : she had thought , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch the mirror , perhaps embrace her image in it , but of course she had done nothing . She had stood with herp161arms stiff at her sides and her jaws paralyzed until the momentpassed . Her terror had been such that she might have been staring out into some future room , that reflection staring past her and into the future and yet seeing nothing . So that was her mirrored self  --  a face unrelated to her , to her soul , a mockery of what she knew she was ( for she knew who she was , always ; inside her , somewhere in her heart , or in her brain , somewhere , was her true self ) , a distraction . Only to herself was her soul revealed . It was defined only in terms of what it had surrendereditself to : to claims of blood and duty , to love , to religious ecstasy . In itself it had no existence . It was like , she thought wildly , the things that lay about this dirty room  --  clothes , shoes , suitcases  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We are kin , " Max had said to her once , seated fatly in some other hotel room just like this one , when Shar was away . And that was true , Karen thought . For just as Karen realized she had no existence without the greater presence of someone to acknowledge her ( her father ; God ) , so did Max realize that his existence depended upon the life of others . If some men supposed themselves free it was only because they did not understand that they were imprisoned  --  bars could be made of any shadowy substance , any dreamy loss of light . Karen turned off the light and lay down again . There were footsteps out in the hall but they went nowhere . She listened to them , her heart pounding in excitement ; but nothing happened . The sky outside the window had not lightened . On the bureau there were pills , sleeping pills Max 's doctor had given her . But she would not take them . She despised pills . She wanted no help . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain belonged to her , she would feel it ; it was hers . Then , abruptly , she was dreaming . A child had died . It had been growing insidea closet , on the dusty floor , a clothes closet with bright summer dresses in it : tubes ran in and out of the child 's body ,  |p162|plastic  veins , queer bright colors of red and blue and yellow , a transparent chest so that one could see the damp red heart . A plastic heart . But she would not cry for that , she thought angrily , it was a trick to make her pity herself , or pity someone , when pity was disgusting ! Pity withered one 's heart , bore into one 's stomach . Pity ruined love . " God ! " she said , grinding her teeth . Her heart was hardened : she could feel it turn to stone . She would pity no one . Certainly she would not pity herself . She thought of the fragmentary stories of men and women in the Bible , people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , had always seemed to her , bizarre , wildeyedcontemporaries of her own . No pity . No mercy . Nothing . Had she been born for this , come into the world for this , that she should pity herself ? On the contrary , someone was telling her , it was herself she must forget . Did she not know that the universe had contrived her life , her father had planned her birth , so that she might be here tonight in this dirty hotel room , alone , waiting ? Of course the mind jerked away from such thoughts , but that was only because such thoughts terrified . Better to look into an empty drawer , stare into an empty hole , than to discover oneself looking into a darkness filled with shape ! She began to twist her body as if someone were struggling with her . How much easier to look into a darkness that meant nothing than into a darkness that was really an open , straining mouth , a vast waiting hole that claimed her ! It was as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight but in darkness . If she had ever expected to see God ( and she had expected to see Him , as a child ) she would have supposed Him to come in light , in fire . Not in darkness . But now she ground her teeth together savagely , twisting on the damp bed , and just at the moment when it seemed to her she would suffocate , her dream snapped clear and it was Shar who struggled with her . He lay above her , hard arms and legs , his hard wetp163body so familiar that she did not at first recognize him as someoneapart from herself . She forced herself awake . She was frightened , damp with perspiration . Someone was crying out , somewhere  --  far away . She listened ; nothing . An automobile 's brakes screeching . Now her heart began to pound with fear , for it was true that Shar was with another woman . He lay somewhere now , drunk , asleep , peaceful , safe from her . The realization that he had truly betrayed her seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could deal calmly with the truth . And , as if her failure with him endeared him to her , made him seem much more a man , she lay back again and thought of how they had first met : of Shar 's strangeness , his look of having come from another country . Then her father , and that trip to town  --  yes . Yes , she thought , how well it had all worked ; she might have planned it herself . Shar jerking and straining to escape , but Shar trapped by her all the same ! The fields , the barn , the back room of that country store , and after that , as if by magic , another room in the city  --  and Max 's ritualistic behavior , his grave gentlemanly concern for her that she had distrusted for so long until she realized he was somehow seeing Shar in her , and that she was valuable to him because of this . She had been in bed then , attended by Max 's doctor . Perhaps they had expectedher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been arranged : a coffin , a grave . But she had not died . She had waited as they had waited , day after day , more patient than they . Max had brought her newspapers and magazines and a radio , then some books . Karen had turned the pages of the books idly , too weak to read . When she saw that the books had been charged out of a library in the city she was struck by a sense of disorder , of wonder , as if it were somehow absurd to have to see her bed and this anonymous room in relationship to a larger city , a coherent world of governmental design that inp164turn related itself to the world of her family . Max would talk to Shar about Karen , fondly , in her presence ; he admitted himselfquite fascinated with her . " She suffers without knowing it , " he said often . " A strange thing . That endears the sufferer to us , but also makes us fearful of him  --  sometimes contemptuous ! " And he had winked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never understand . Shar watched her but seldom spoke to her . If he spoke , it was usually to Max , with Karen as a third party who might or might not be listening . Now and then he would glance at her as if he expected her , in those moments , not to notice him . He said things like , " It 's warmer out today . " " It 's raining out this morning . " " I had some stuff to do downtown . " Always his words were accompanied by queer silent pleas , questions . He would stare at Karen secretly , indulge himself in long heavyliddedexaminations masked by clouds of smoke about his face . His legs , seemingly so idle , were really tensed to keep him on guard , protect him , get him out of the room if necessary , if the preposterous situation in which he discovered himself were suddenly too painful , too dangerous . Karen , dizzy with her own pain and with a despair so overwhelming she knew it must approachsin , absorbed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were older than he , stronger and wiser . They had surveyed each other carefully at this time . Shar 's first impact upon her had been physical : he had appeared as a body , a presence . Smears of color  --  lines of movement , a peculiarawkward grace  --  certain gestures with his fingers , which had struck her as nervous , nervously appealing . Beneath his contemptuous control there had always been distrust  --  he had learned that distrust as a child . Now , sitting with her in Max 's presence , forced to sit still , to meditate , to stare in disbelief  --  and , in spite of her condition , with lust  --  he emerged in a sense from his body and created for her an image of himself that shep165had learned to cherish as time passed , since it was only at such times , in perfect stillness or in sleep , that he appeared to her so . It was strange that even then , even when she could not have known clearly what he was going to do with her ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or abandoned somewhere in the city or passed around to the innumerable men who , it seemed , stomped about on the periphery of Shar 's life ) , she thought of the various shades and complexities of his person as possessions of hers . It was almost as if he were offering himself to her , shielded as he was behind nervous clouds of smoke and by the rigidity of his being . " Remember , I am a stranger , " he seemed to say . But he was already familiar : she might have known him for years , watched him secretly for years . The man who had , in a final vicious exasperation , made love to her that morning was not lost and did not belong to a painful nightmare , but sat with her often , gazed upon her with bewildermentand calculation , and identified himself always as the same man . He sometimes seemed to sweat with inertia ; he could not move . The fat man who pampered them both seemed to sustain , witnessing Shar , a mild and delighted astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was happening ? When Shar was gone Karen had the idea other people were watching her , spying on her drugged composure . Time passed . Reality slipped from her , she could not even soothe herself with tears for the life she had given up  --  she knew in her heart that she had not given it up  --  but the center of this new world , the force that controlled it , Shar , sat firmly and familiarly at her bedside , offered himself in mute impatience to her examination . He was to her lean and hard : his physical presence blocked the light from the window , scattered and diffused its rays , so that his body , even in relaxation , had a precarious and threateningsolidity that did not belong to other objects  --  the chippedp166bed railing or the shade at the window . On Shar clothes lost all identity , became at once colorless and nondescript . Karen could never , in her imagination , see clearly what Shar wore  --  he wore wrinkled clothes , soiled clothes , perhaps ; what was important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was not inescapably himself . His leanness was expressedespecially in movement , and in the taut look that suggestedhunger and dissatisfaction , the uneasiness of the predatorybeast that suspects he can never achieve satiation . His hardness came from other sources  --  from within , behind his eyes . He was to her a strangely beautiful machine , a creation shaped by hand , perhaps carved out of stone : the hardness had been set in him too , placed deep in his brain like a tiny pebble or seed . It inspired all his movements , all his words . Whatever he might say to her  --  and everything he said to her was abrupt and self-conscious  --  resulted from the angry agitation of this secret hardness , its friction against other oiled and clicking parts of his being , the parts that had run him for years , had initiated him to a pattern of reacting and understanding that was now being violated . She had not been too delirious to sense the irony here : upon whom had that violation been performed ? It was true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really within her experience  --  it was abstract and theoretical , like tiny points in a catechism lesson ( to daydream duringso many minutes of Mass was a venial sin , so many more minutes a mortal sin ) ; certainly it was to this bitter forlorn man that the violation was real , and all his minutes with her in that gloomy room must have grated upon his brain and body , mocking his strength , establishing for him that personal dislikefor her beyond his impersonal infatuation that he still showed now , months later . He had spoken as if always astonished by the fact that he was speaking at all , that he was recognizingher as a reality in his life , and as if astonished by thep167stupidity of whatever he said . " They got some stuff on the road , some junk , black tar that gets all over everything , " he had said once . It was an effort for him to speak to her . He had the air of a man apprehensive of being fooled . " I went out to the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his words getting harder and tighter instead of relaxing , " and had a talk with this friend of Max 's , the one in the downtown precinct , and he says nothing  --  no news , nothing . Like nothing ever happened . " He might have wanted to add , " Why are n't they looking for you ? " but he did not . At such moments he would stare at her and their eyes would meet helplessly . Karen thought they might have been two people condemned to an eternity in each other 's presence , lovers or criminals who had sinned together on earth but who could not understand precisely what they had done , or why , or in what way it was a sin demanding damnation . " But what are you doing here ? What do you want with me ? " Shar asked with his silent , baffled , murderous eyes , and his fingers would pick nervously at one another as the hard , diamond-sharp little pebble in his brain pressed and maddenedhim . It was not that Karen obscured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but rather that  --  she could only guess at this  --  he had come to feel that in some way she exemplifiedthe rest of the world , or somehow invalidated it , so that it became irrelevant . Karen took his hatred for her as a token of their growing familiarity , something he revealed to her constantlywhile she revealed nothing to him . She would smile faintly and murmur , " Yes . . . yes . . . I think so . . . That man told me . . . " and allow her words to disintegrate , pushingat him the burden of carrying on this performance . She took courage from the simple knowledge that she had not abandoned anything of herself and so was in a way protected ; she understood too that the looks they exchanged , the brief meaningless words they exchanged , were blind moves in ap168game of some sort , like the elaborate and cunning games of chess her father and brothers sometimes played at holiday reunions  --  and that Shar did not know the rules of the game . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely the secret in her that commanded her degradation and did not even require hysteria to narcoticize it  --  her knowing that if some morning Shar or the strange fat man were to see her crying , pleading for help , pleading not to be abandoned , not to be returned to a world that would never forgive her shame , pleading , above all , for Shar himself  --  then the game would be finished , the pieces swept off onto the floor with a slash of Shar 's victorious hand . But they never found her this way . Even alone , awake for hours , she never gave in . Despair tempted her but it was a dry , hollow despair , the anguish that must lure people on the brink of death when tears and frenzy would change nothing , the despair one might experience upon seeing his heart snatched from him , slit and opened and turned neatly inside out , empty as an old soiled change purse . But Shar never detected that despair in her . If he hid a sharp , glintingknife in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hid her knife also and did not even grimace  --  as he often did  --  when its brilliant edges cut her . The question in everyone 's mind ( so clamorous as to be almost vocal ) was what Shar would do with her , and if Karen herself posed this question she did not offer it to him but thrust it upon him  --  not as a questionbut as a taunt , since she knew that nothing less than this could touch him . He was a man of violence , a stranger to her life , a man who could not even sit comfortably but must always be dreaming of air and space and speed  --  yet she was so arrogantas to suppose herself a match for him . She was so shamelessas to show him that she knew his feeling for her , exactly what he wanted from her . There was nothing secret about this ; it showed in the sweat on Shar 's forehead , in the hot icyp169gleam of his eyes that held her rigid while his voice went on to speak of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five papersdown there and reads them through . " He would sometimessquirm in his chair , and if Max was in the room he would look around at him with a gesture that made Karen understand that his eyes showed anguish as soon as they were turned from her . The game continued for days , weeks . She did not know how long she was drugged ; she took as a familiarity the equally drugged look of Shar 's contemptuous , disbelieving face , turned upon her with a strange baffled urgency , as if they were conspirators and had no one but each other . One day Shar abandoned the game . Karen was not quite sure of how she knew this , but it was true . He abandoned it and admitted defeat , as if with a sudden uplifting of his hands toward heaven . Karen , by then accustomed to a life that began nowhere and headed nowhere , geographically or morally , understood that she must not abandon the game herself but must continue to play it in secret , plotting and calculating her moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Shar went out for long , aimless , yawning walks . It was an effort for Shar to walk slowly enough for her ; he was always straining ahead , peering enviouslydown alleys , up at the tops of buildings . They did not touch , and to a passer-by it might have seemed that the two of them  --  a man of about thirty with tiny perpetual lines of disapprovalon his forehead and a girl of uncertain age , under twenty , who blinked at the sunlight as if unaccustomed to it  --  were not really aware of each other but simply happened to be going in the same direction at the same time . Shar expressed in his gestures and in his walk the brittle , impatient nervousness of the man who is frightened at his loss of self-control and cannotunderstand it . He was happy only when in control of some sort : driving his machines , drinking himself into a stupor , see/ing the tabulation of his threatened violence on another 's face . He never touched her , as if her skin might be poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt victory approaching  --  hewould not be able to resist for much longer the generousacquiescence she promised , could not help but promise , and the rich anarchy of the control he would then achieve over her . If he did finally surrender to her it was no more than himself he was surrendering to  --  already he must have thought of her as an appendage of his , an extension of his own body that he craved if he was to exist for other things . So in her presence he was alone ; he contemplated her as they walked , puzzling and accusing the image of her that he carried with him , glancing over now and then in surprise at the actual young woman beside him . Karen caught these moments of surprise . " How do you feel ? " Shar would say . His fingers would rub at his cheek , at his nose . " Are you tired yet ? " Hopelessly they fell into silence . Shar would buy newspapers and sit in cheap diners reading them , frowning seriously , while Karen sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shar leafed through the newspapers impatiently , reading only headlinesand looking at pictures . When he was finished he threw the papers down and sat , smoking , looking out the greasespeckedwindows to the street . It did not occur to him to offer the papers to Karen ; he might not have known she could read . In her role she could not ask him . She had no idea what was happening in the world , if anything was happening . She had withdrawn from history and had no interest in it , just as Shar , though he glanced at photographs of diplomats and African leaders and automobile accidents , had no interest in it , having created his own pastoral history out of the strength of his own body . What he looked for were items concerning Karen  --  GIRL REPORTED MISSING , GIRL SUSPECTED KIDNAPED  --  that he never found , and all other events baffled and angered him , as if theirp171space in the paper had usurped the place of the other ghostly story . They walked through the slummy downtown of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of factories , and across railroad tracks , and past fences topped with barbed wire , and through soot-darkened residential neighborhoods , and past schools with windows decorated with flowers , rabbits , and trees . Just as all external details disappeared in Shar 's presence , so did Karen 's vision of what they saw disappear . Shar walked impatiently through a vacuum composed of store-window reflections of himself and the silent girl beside him , and when there were no store windows to give him these reflections he must have contrived them himself . He smoked constantly , waited perfunctorily at deserted street cornersbefore crossing , glanced with a dull , angry gaze to notice little corner stores that sold pretzel sticks and candy and popsiclesof various flavors  --  orange , raspberry , root beer , cherry . If it was warm , they would stand on the steps of these stores while Shar , frowning in thought , sucked at a dripping popsicleand children straddling bicycles a few yards away ate the same thing . Karen never asked herself the question , " What is he ? What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no life , he had nothing , he was simply himself . Other men hurried out of factories in the late afternoon , or were to be seen on errands , going somewhere , having come from somewhere , but Shar came from nowhere and went nowhere . He seemed also to noticenothing . Beside his muscular propriety the ordinary world paled and fell away . He was a sojourner here , and never confusedthe intricacies of this surface world with the reality of his own world , which consisted of himself . His simplicity , Karen thought , made him dangerous , for to him the world of man was not valued for its uniqueness , nor was human experiencejudged to be good or evil , nor was sin possible : there wasp172only Shar 's will , the deadly whimsical range of his desire . He was as perplexed as she by his strange refusal to dismiss her . He wanted her gone yet he did not want her gone , not so simply . Once he had turned to her  --  they were near a mudsplatteredexcavation site  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this , " When are you going home ? " Karen stared at their feet and pretended to be thinking . Shar had hard , big feet , dirty shoes with frayed shoelaces . After a while he said , " Max can fix it up for you . Buy the tickets or drive you right up there himself . " Karen 's silence forced upon them both the realization that there was for them in these roles no common language . Daily he was being drawn to her , his initial failure to escape her had decided everything ; it was only Shar 's simplicitythat blinded him . " I ca n't leave you , " Karen said , still staring at their feet . His affinity was with machines , though none they saw were so finely geared and meshed as he . He loved to watch excavatingmachines and great straining trailer trucks maneuvered with astonishing skill ; he even watched men repairing streets , enjoying the vibrations and the roar of the air drill . In the smelly bars they wandered in and out of he played **30;4802;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he was not with her , over at the garage , Karen believed he was trying to blot out his confusionover her with the blunt , exhilarating performance of machines . But he reappeared to her always , and something in the repetition of their days  --  they began to eat together , they had periods of real silence that were more intimate than anythingKaren had ever experienced  --  seemed to satisfy him . One morning they went out walking , again in silence , but Shar was humming to himself and Karen had the numb feeling that something had been decided . They walked in a park bordering a cemetery . The air was fresh with spring , the grass vividlyp173green . Karen touched her hair , her cool face , feeling herself unrevived by spring , pale and lifeless , unattractive , while the man at her side had to hold back his energy and could not stop his eyes from staring at the tops of trees and beyond them into the blue sky . Something had been decided , Karen thought . She had won . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground and the cheap gravestones looked oddly healthy . Karen felt in the warming air that she had no right to be here , that she had really died ; she had escaped illness and insanity , perhaps , but she had really died somewhere in the past . She could not help but stare at Shar 's back with a kind of fond contempt  --  clumsy , ignorant man , to suppose he could understand her ! She saw him looking about with a precision not ordinarilyhis . He said nothing , there was nothing hurried about him , and though later she would be able to sense , by the suddenrigidity of his jaw , exactly when the bitter pressure of his obsession overtook him , she did not understand until he finally touched her what his intention was  --  it must have been , up untilthat moment , ceremonial and plotted , an act his mind and not his body had prescribed for him . " I 'm not well , " Karen said . " I 'm not  --  I might bleed  --  " She had begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He gripped her shoulders as if listening to her heartbeat . " It wo n't hurt , " he said . But he waited . Karen felt her eyes harden ; she looked behind him at the bare tree limbs stretched out so absurdly against the sky . As her strength ebbed out of her , the trembling lessened ; she might have been fleeing her body , plotting to leave it behind with Shar in order to please him and cheat him at the same time . Shar touched her hands , her arms , her shoulders ; very gently and seriously he stroked her body as if trying to bring her to life , while Karen closed her eyes and felt her soul contract itself into a tiny pebble-like thing safe in her brain . Her hand reached out and groped against his chest . She slidp174her fingers inside his shirt and touched his skin , and in that instantshe felt her trembling pass over into him . Still he crouched over her and stroked her limbs and her body , so gently and lovingly that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no shame . It might have been night , she might have been asleep , and this lover come to her made innocent by his being only a dream , something over which she need have no control . Suddenly he was like Jack and the other young men she had known who had tried to make her love them , tried to make her feel something for them  --  though they had never dared to do what Shar did to her . She wanted to take hold of his wrist , but she knew she did not have the right . She pitied him for trying to evoke in her a feeling she would never give him , just as she had pitied Jack and the others , though contemptuously , and with her eyes still closed she reached up to touch the nape of his neck . Then she heard something overhead  --  an airplane  --  and opened her eyes suddenly . She squinted and stared up at nothing . Then she looked at Shar 's face and what she saw there made her lips jerk up in an angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was breathing through his mouth and she could see his teeth . Then he straightened and brought his hand around and slapped her face . " Look at me like that , you little bitch ! " he said . His face was white . Karen was frightened , but she could not change her expression . Her lips seemed frozen in their grimace . Shar slapped her again . She shut her eyes , her face turned away , while he raged above her . This was something real , something she could understand , the selfish little pebble in her brain rejoiced in it because it could make her hate this man so much more clearly . The memory of his patience was dissipatednow by the violence of the pain she felt . They grunted together , Karen squirming backward in the damp earth , Shar grinding himself against her . Karen felt her hair tangle in the wet grass . " You little bitch ! Little bitch ! " Shar sobbed . Karenp175heard cloth being ripped . She pushed against him , her forearm against his face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard against hers , blindly , his teeth wet , the hard deadly pressure of his skull holding her still . " I 'd like to set you on fire like I did to him , " he said , " take a match and set you on fire  --  burn everything  --  your clothes catching on and burning  --  you screaming for help , you little bitch ! And all burning up , hair and insides , so you could see inside and see the things burning there , melting away , burning  --  " He was enlivened with rage as with charges of electricity , grinding and lunging against her , as if his murderous spite were trying to bore its way out of him and into her . Karen woke to hear someone knocking at the door . She could not think for a moment where she was . She was alone , and she could not remember being alone . The knocking was soft and discreet . " Yes , " she said vaguely . She did not move . Sunlight streamed in the grimy windows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheets up to her chin and said nothing . Her heart had begun to thud . Then she heard the sound of a key in the lock . Knowing it was not Shar made her feel reckless ; she did not even look around . " My dear Karen ! " Max closed the door behind him . He was fat and apologetic . " I was waiting for you downstairs  --  I thought you might come downstairs . " Karen said nothing . " But my dear child , " Max said , shifting his weight from one foot to the other , " you must look at me . Here . Yes , like that . How pretty you are , even after last night ! I 'm sorry to tell you this  --  it 's hard for me , very hard for me , a strain on my heart  --  Are you listening ? Shar is gone  --  I 'm sorry to be the one to tell you , terribly sorry  --  He 's gone , he said for me to tell you . He  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's difficult enough for me to tell you this , " Max said , though his pert , benevolent expression seemed to suggest he was enjoying himself , " I could hardly eat breakfast , thinking of it ; my appetite is gone . I thought of you up here , my poor forlornKaren , and it made me think of the other women , the young women that Shar  --  It made me think of you all together , and made me think of how old I am  --  I told him he should be the one to tell you himself , but  --  " " He is n't gone , " Karen said . She stared angrily at Max . " I do n't believe you . He ca n't be gone . " " But he is gone , " Max said , lifting his palms in a gesture of defeat , gently , smiling gently , " he is gone  --  and you will never see him again . For your own good and his . Do you understand that ? "  |p177Max  had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about half an hour , awaiting Karen . He had arranged himself in the creaking chair with much effort and tenderness , hesitatingmany seconds before he let his legs slide out from under him . He wore a suit of light , faint blue , buttoned across his chest and stomach . His face was newly shaven and looked a little raw , as if he were being seen in too exposing a light . He crossed his short , thick legs with an effort , sighed unhappily , and opened a book . In a minute his reading so engrossed himp178that he chuckled out loud and took a pencil out of his pocket to mark something in the text . A few people walked past but he did not look up . Jerry came downstairs and sat heavily in a cracked leather chair not far from Max , but said nothing . Max did not look up . The sunlight brightened , pouring warmly on his head . His fair , thinning hair had been dampened , and now the sunlight played minutelyabout it . Jerry , gazing blankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own head and yawned . Outside , automobilehorns blared angrily . As soon as the sound of sharp clicking heels came to Max 's ears , he looked up . Karen passed by , heading for the street . He called to her ; she turned quickly , showing her desperation . But in the next instant Max felt he had misunderstood her  --  she stood staring coldly at him , her lips firm , her neck very tense . She wore white : a hard , dazzling white . As if to mock him , the silver necklace he had given her gleamed proudly back at him ! " You must understand that he is gone  --  he is gone , " Max said . She stood before him now , looking past his head . He was tempted to turn around and see what she was looking at . Jerry , slouched in his chair , watched her with the sort of helpless look Max had noticed in him when Karen was in their company . " You must learn to forgive him , " Max went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had felt it a delicious , dramatic moment  --  yet Karen , after the first instant of her surprise , showed no emotion , as if she had thrust upon Max the burden of making this difficult . " It has been difficult for him  --  I saw this coming in him , before he realized it himself . That was one of the reasons I talked to you yesterday  --  " Karen 's young , clever face showed nothing . Max was amazed as always by the clarity of her eyes  --  faint blue , modest blue , refusing to shift away under the impact of fear or shame.  |p179Perha|ps  he had always misjudged her , and what he thought to be shrewdness in her was simply ignorance  --  profound ignorance ? She did not even relish what suffering came to her ; she did not seem to always know it was supposed to be suffering . Max was not sure if this was admirable in her or if it was an indication of her vulgarity . " You will allow me to help you , " Max said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to help you  --  to see that you return home safely . And to see that your health is good . Of course it is no business of mine , but  --  " He saw , to his alarm , that she was about to turn away . " Where are you going ? At least let us talk together . Let me help you with your grief . " Karen did not appear grieved , but in a daze  --  a hard , tearless daze . She looked at Max as if she had never seen him before . " Perhaps I can tempt you into coming to breakfast with me , " he said . His appetite now had returned most powerfully . " We can talk there . You surely ca n't be in a hurry to go anywhere  --  why , where would you go ? " In the murky coffee shop of the hotel they sat in a booth by one of the high , grimy windows . Max 's doctor was already in there , sitting languidly at the counter ; he turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee endlessly . " This looks fine , by the window , " Max had said . He sat across from Karen and Jerry , smiling hospitably at them . " Such brilliant sunlight ! It woke me early this morning . I had difficulty with sleep  --  some trouble with my nerves , trouble as always with something ! I 'm afraid my health is disintegrating , " he said . Karen wanted nothing ; Jerry ordered coffee . Max read off an order for breakfast from a fly-specked menu he had been given , then leaned forward , pressing his stomach against the table , to look seriously at Karen . " First of all , my dear , " he said kindly , " you must not think of desperate measures  --  of violence againstp180yourself . You must accept what has happened . It is for the best  --  certainly  --  ultimately for the best ; all things are . If you were to have a baby , if you had been pregnant  --  " He spoke now as if this were a possibility that no longer existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction might have been  --  violent , or  --  He is governed by his passion , his emotion ; he does n't think . Exactly like a child . I have always considered him a child  --  the young man from the provinces , seeking his fortune . What sense is there in him of his condition ? The whole world is shrunk down to fit him  --  he carries it around in his head ! Exactly like a child ! He is the child who does nothing , to whom all things are done . Whatever happens to him he has n't deserved or earned  --  good or bad  --  whatever  --  these things simply happen , accidents . And that is true for you as well ! " Max smiled as if he had made a brilliant point . " We others  --  we who are more worldly , who are n't , properly speaking , from the provinces '  --  we realize that life is something else , that we are always responsible for what we do . But you children  --  you do not !  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerely ; I assure you I do . It is innocence . It is lost to all but children . " Jerry , who did not seem to be listening , took out a pack of cigarettes and selected one carefully . He lit the cigarette with a heavy silver lighter that was designed with small intricate hearts . His expression , professional and deaf , would have been the same had he been sitting alone . " That is something you can not understand , " Max said softly . " A lost innocence  --  you can not understand it . Those who are protected by innocence are not even aware of it ; they know nothing . They know nothing . Yet you are innocent , my dear Karen , in spite of your knowing quite a bit  --  and you know these things , incredibly , without understanding them , without having been transformed yourself by the knowledge of them ! "  |p181He  wiped his forehead . " That is what is incredible . . . . Nothingeither you or Shar will ever do will have anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You heard Shar talk of the accident yesterday . Precisely ! No one could say what had happened  --  Shar least of all . He would be the last to understand  --  He operates from his stomach . " " And I do too ? " Karen said . It was impossible to tell how she meant this . Max believed she was serious . " Perhaps not your stomach , " he said , making a kind of gracious bow with his head , " that sounds . . . indelicate . . . for such a pretty girl . Your heart , perhaps  --  You operatefrom your heart . " " That is true , " Karen said queerly . The waitress brought their orders . Jerry accepted his coffee without looking up , Max the first part of his breakfast  --  a grapefruit , cut neatly in half and seeded  --  with a fond , condescendingsmile for the waitress . He ate with relish . The grapefruit was sour , even after he had put several spoonfuls of sugar on it ; but still it was fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man in his condition . He talked for a while of the grapefruit and of fruit in general , then reverted to his subject . " I sometimes think , " he said philosophically , wavingthe dripping spoon at Karen , " that children like you understandthe world best . You are perhaps most sophisticated , after all . To take life as an accident , and everything in it as an accident  --  whatsophistication ! Why should there be any logical pattern of events , any distinction between an earthly order and an . . . oh . . . eternal order ? Why , indeed ? We religious people  --  " He noted how Karen 's eyes narrowed as he said this . " We religious people search for meaning , and we are humbled . What brilliance there is in a child , who takes the world as chaos and never thinks about it ! There is innocence  --  it is impossible in anyone else , in anyone who believes . "  |p182Jerry  sipped his coffee and blew on it when he found it too hot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his face was expressionless . He never looked at Max or seemed to hear him , though Max 's words gained momentum with his excitement . He finished his grapefruit in a burst of enthusiasm and went on : " Yet when I lose my faith  --  and I am constantly losing and regaining it  --  do I fall back to innocence ? No . Innocence is lost to me . I have never been innocent ; I have always been this age . " The waitress , nervously approaching them , placed another plate before Max  --  a plate of soft eggs , mixed with colorless strips of bacon and little sturdy-looking globules of fat . " Always  --  always to have been the same age ! Can you understand that ? " His gaze was tempted downward ; he began to eat , slowly at first , then , as the food lured him , faster and faster , though he did not stop talking . He seemed to think that if he stopped he would lose Karen 's attention . " How well I know that life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in anythingexcept life . I wo n't come again to this  --  I will never sit here again . I will never eat this again . " This was apparently a good point , for not only Karen but Jerry as well looked up . " Men make the error that things will turn out for the good  --  we religious people make that error , though our experience contradicts us . In literature , now , things are different ; this long poem I 've been rereading . . . temptation , sin , fall , and expiation , all around in a circle , into the garden and out of it , many angels , great blazes of rhetoric and light  --  an immense scheme of tautological relationships you need never believe in ! As if it mattered that there was ever a paradise , or in what way it was lost to us  --  the only important thing is that we have no paradise ; we have none . Yet a most beautiful poem ! All an expression of something else  --  an imitation , a metaphor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around ,  |p183they  can not penetrate through to the outer world ; there is no outer world . But life is not like that , your life is not being createdfor you out of a mind . Your life is not a metaphor for anythingbeyond it . It ends when you do  --  and when your grave is lost , where are you ? Where is my pretty Karen then ? " " My grave will never be lost , " Karen said . Apparently this was funny , for Max laughed luxuriously . He stopped eating for a moment to surrender himself to laughter . " She would be good for you , " he said to Jerry , " if it were not for Shar  --  as you say , very shrewdly ; if it were not for Shar . I would like to keep her with me always ! " Jerry looked at Karen . " Except for Shar and something that needs an operation , " he said . " An ugly topic to suggest at breakfast , " Max said , wiping remnants of egg off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the one I 'd like to give the operation to , " said Jerry . He looked at Karen with an amused , sadly sympathetic look . " How much would he be worth then ? " Karen 's face began to burn . She stared at Jerry 's fingers as he tapped them patiently on the table . " You know nothing  --  nothing , " Max said angrily . His face was distorted with toast . He raised a finger and shook it at Jerry , as if Jerry were a child . " You degrade all things to your level . " " The hell with it , " said Jerry . " She 's going back home . " " That 's it , of course , Karen , " Max said , pointing the finger now at her . " We decided that , Shar and I , we talked of it for a long time . He understands that what he did is for the best . ... Karen , I am prepared to help you , I hope you will allow me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not  --  Perhaps you would like to talk to me alone ? " Before Karen could reply , Jerry had already stood . " I 'll be out in the lobby , " he said.  |p184Now  Max clasped his hands before him and leaned toward Karen . Sunshine through the dusty window gave him a clean , eager look , though it seemed to trouble his eyes ; they had narrowed until they were quite small , fringed by babyish lashes , and out of these he peeked earnestly at her as he spoke . " You wonder at me  --  you wonder what I am doing here with you , appealing to you . You wonder what kind of life I come from . I wonder at you too  --  I seriously wonder . I have never been able to understand you . I see you as innocent , and yet sometimes I am not so sure  --  not so sure of my own judgment  --  Perhaps I am the innocent one ! " He smiled at her . His teeth were big and white . " My sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a woman in your family who sees ghosts ? Why is it ghosts appear to women ? I did n't mind it but you do come to believe it  --  I mean , believe she sees them ; I never did ... myself , but perhaps it was only a matter of time  --  What could we say to her ? I felt I should say something to her , since silence was , simply , a collaboration in ghosts ! But you must be cautious with other people , people are so delicate , a word misspoken might never be amended , a look of the wrong sort never negated  --  no negations , only a slow piling up ; try to get there and see what they want , to get it for them , you see how delicate it is  --  delicate and out of reach  --  dealing with the souls of others . Yourself you might negate , the conflicting wants , all , all the conflicts , you might negate one with another , heal yourself , but no one else  --  you only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . So it is with caution I approach you  --  with respect for you , for what you have endured . I will be happy to help you if  --  " Here he stopped to take a breath . But it was at an awkward moment , since his last words hung between them . Karen stared coldly . Max , sensitive of an indiscretion , raised his hands as if to distract her and went on , smiling , " I have always en/joyed as much as we have said to each other , for I do feel , as I 've told you , that we have something in common  --  something mysterious in common ; I feel this . I  --  " He licked his lips . He was conscious of a rapidity of heartbeat that startled him , but he was so caught up in what he had to say that he had no time to worry . He was afraid Karen would rise suddenly in disgust and leave . " I would like to talk to you . Perhaps up in my room ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Shar  --  but about your life before him , your childhood , your father , and family , your experiences  --  Your dreams  --  And , of course , of Shar  --  you have told me little of him , what you 've felt with him  --  And the baby , " he said . He was now leaning so hard against the table that his stomach bulged painfully against it . He and Karen looked at each other . " Will you come up with me ? " he said . Karen 's eyes wandered behind him , behind his head . He felt for an instant that he had lost her . Perhaps she had heard little of what he said , perhaps she had been thinking all along of Shar . . . . Max waited , sweating , while she hesitated ; then she said , " In what way will you help me ? " " Money , " said Max . " How much money ? " " I thought of a thousand . " " A thousand ! " said Karen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it , " Max said quickly , " that is  --  if you need it ; I can arrange for you to have the best of care  --  " Karen looked frightened . " I want to have the child , " she said . Max clasped his hands as if congratulating himself . " We 'll talk about it . We 'll decide about it . " Karen sat as if in a trance . Max could see tiny dots of perspirationon her forehead and upper lip . Her look of hauteur hadp186changed and she seemed now surprisingly young  --  almost indecentlyyoung ; but the incongruity of her youth and her situationdelighted Max . Inspired by her helplessness , he began to shift himself about the cramping seat , crossing and uncrossing his hot legs at the ankles . " We 'll decide about it . It 's nine o'clock now . Nine o'clock , " he said , wiping perspiration out of his eyes . His voice trembled with excitement . " At twelve o'clock we 'll take you to the train station , we 'll get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to see when your train goes . Now . . . shall we  --  " He pulled himself up out of the booth and waited for her . At the counter the doctor did not glance around ; he sat stirring his coffee . A few other customers looked over their newspapers and white coffee cups to stare blankly at Max , and then with interest at Karen , as she got unsteadily to her feet . In the hotel lobby Karen saw Jerry waiting for them . As they approached , Jerry stood up . For the first time since Karen had known him , he looked uneasy ; he was licking his lips as he and Max conferred together . Though it must puzzle Jerry , Karen could not help staring at his face . She heard Max say something about Shar  --  " if he should come back . " Karen wanted to run at him , pound his fat , perspiring back , wanted to cry , " He will never come back ! You know that ! " When Max turned and took her arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm going home now . I 've decided to go home now . " Through the buzzing sunlight Max wondered at her . For a moment they seemed to brace each other in their astonishment , their arms lifted ; then Max released her . " Going home now ? " he said slowly . " Why are you going home now ? " Karen tried to force him back by the bitter contempt she felt for him , by the power of her stare alone ; but she could not.  |p187He  accepted and absorbed her hysteria and left her exhausted . " I want to , " she said , backing away . " I 've decided to . I 've decided to . " " My dear child  --  " " I do n't want the things upstairs . I 'll leave them . I 'm going back now . I do n't . . . I do n't want anything . Please  --  " " At twelve o'clock we will take you  --  " " No , " Karen said , shaking her head cautiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going home now . " She rushed past him just as he was about to reach out for her . She heard him say something to Jerry but she did not hear Jerry 's reply . Outside , she turned and hurried along the sidewalk , as if she knew where she was going ; she walked for some time , breathing through her open mouth , her heart pounding , without seeing anything . People loomed up before her , bright-faced , anonymous , and sidewalks gave way to streets that she crossed when others did , staring fixedly ahead of her . She was conscious of having avoided something , just as she avoided colliding with people on the sidewalk ; but she had acted by instinct only . Where had her mind been ? Her mind had been raveled out into the sunlight , giddy and unbalanced , she could not depend on it . Though Karen touched her hot face and saw her reflection in store windows and in the eyes of people who passed by , she thought that perhaps her humanity was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that had made her herself , were confused , weakened , and she had nothing left to show of herself but a face , a body , a set of emotions . A face and a body ! She looked at her reflection in a store window as if she could not believe it . Yet there she stood  --  dressed in white , a skirt being caressed by the hot dusty wind , stark , pale legs , uplifted arms , hands about to reach out and touch their reflections . An incredulous face , incredulous that anything should be behind it  --  that anything shouldp188stare out of those eyes . People passed her , amused reflections . Amused at her conceit , perhaps , or not noticing her at all . Karen felt a thrill of horror that she should deceive them  --  that they should assume , however briefly , that a human being stood where she was . All she could be sure of was a face and a body  --  her emotions came out as ordered . They were contrived . She could not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgust for what had nearly happened , and yet , perhaps , she felt only regret for it , regret for having lost a thousand dollars ; and the disgust was contrived to soothe her conscience . She walked on . She murmured to herself , " I am lost . I am lost . " The day was hot and windy with sunlight . It blew at her skirt and hair ; sometimes raw bits of dust were flung up against her face . Scraps of sentences came to her , jumbled words . She found herself thinking , inexplicably , as she sometimes did when Shar made love to her , of scenes of her childhood  --  out-of-the-way barns , gullies , a bend in the creek she had not thought about for years . The proud pony one of the boys had ridden to school that time  --  why did she remember it now , and the big blue-black flies that worried it ? The boy who owned it was forgotten ; the day was forgotten ; the child , Karen , who gaped at it was forgotten  --  only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had wanted a pony like that ! How she had cried for it , crawling about her father 's knees ! " But why did n't he ever get it for me ? " Karen wondered . She was struck by her father 's queer injustice . She felt she could not forgive him for that . She had prayed for the pony for months , and now these prayersreturned to her . Mechanically her mind ran through them . Other prayers suggested themselves ; she closed her eyes with the effort to remember them . Gradually her sense of horror lessened . She had left that behind , in the hotel . She had escaped him . The center of their lives ! He drew them in to him , P189sucked them in , his appetite was insatiable . Perhaps Shar had not gone anywhere , but had been devoured by Max . . . . Her prayers redirected themselves , attached themselves to somethingelse , more vague than the pony , more inaccessible ; it had fled her . She could not quite reach it . The humiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen felt that she had lost her mind . She could not even understand her emotions , or understandif they were truly hers  --  perhaps she took them from people who passed , that small boy crying and wiping his eyes with dirty fists , a man leering out at the street from an upstairs window  --  skinnyin a white undershirt ! In the middle of a confused " Our Father " she stopped and found herself staring at another of her many reflections . It was in a drug store window . The sight of herself staring at herself struck her as funny : murmuring to God , evoking Christ , she was in fact talking only to this reflection . The thought overwhelmed and disgustedher . The very presence of her image , the slight tilting of her head  --  was that coquettishness ?  --  emphasized her isolation ; she was indeed lost ; she deserved to be lost . Like Shar , who could not hold together the fragments of his life , Karen could not hold together the snatches of herself that were revealed to her . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her beauty mocked the vacuity of her soul . She felt that the straggling people in the street , the people who lounged in doorways , could see through her disguise to the barrenness of her soul . Walking on , she became burdened by the pressure of their attention ; she felt their curiosity turn into shame for her . . . . After a while she found her way to the bus station . It was small and grimy , in the rear of a garage . She had no money , so she sat and watched the clock as if that might tell her somethingwhile the ticket seller whispered about her to one ofp190his customers . The morning went on : bus drivers sourly announcedtheir buses , people milled in and out , a woman addressedher , asking anxiously if the newspaper on the floor belonged to her . One of the mechanics from the garage , a young , foreignlookingman , swaggered through , wiping his hands on a rag ; someone must have told him about Karen . She did not look up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in detail at her white dress , which had become soiled by ashes on the chair . He hummed loudly to himself as if he were very pleased with something , then very vexed . He cleared his throat finally and said , " Miss , there ai n't no bus out of here till three o'clock now . You waiting for that one ? " Karen looked around slowly , but her eyes stopped before they reached the man 's face . He stared at her a while , then scratched his head , muttered to himself , and arranged things before him on the counter . Another mechanic from the garage drifted in , smoking a cigarette , and put a coin in a soft-drink machine . He and the ticket seller talked together about the weather . Karen heard the ticket seller say something pettishly and end with : "  --  no bus out of here till three o'clock . " A while later Karen looked down from the clock  --  she was waiting for something , perhaps twelve o'clock  --  to see Jerry come in . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , sharp brows ; he looked pleased with himself for finding her . " That fat bastard back there is all in a sweat , " he said , " but he sends you this anyhow . " He took an envelope out of his pocket and gave it to Karen . She wondered at it : it was a wrinkled , used , manila envelope with farming equipment advertisedon it . " He says good-by to you . He wishes you good luck . " When Jerry left , Karen looked inside the envelope . She took the bills out to count them : ten hundred-dollar bills . Her facep191went hot with blood . The bills and the envelope trembled in her hands . The murmuring prayers and doubts and selfaccusationsof the morning were hurled back at her : hypocrite , she thought , and liar ! She felt that now , with this money , with even the dirty envelope it had come in  --  fished out of a wastebasket  --  her degradation was complete.  |p192The  history of the city of Cherry River covered a respectable amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up until the Civil War , though its prime had really been in the late eighteenth century . A few homes and gardens from this era remained in spite of violence during the war and neglect afterward  --  CherryRiver , belonging to a part of the country borderingthe South , had been mobbed righteously by both sides . The neglect was more natural . After the days of the sailing fleets had passed and industry along the coast settled in otherp193cities , the population ebbed , young people moved to find work in coal fields , liquor distilleries , and tobacco markets elsewhere , or penetrated the mountain wall to the west and dissociated themselves from the civilization , now thought aged , along the east coast . At the turn of the century the town consisted of a main street , unpaved , and a few stores and a post office serving the farms in the area . The old harbor still put out fishing boats , and sometimes wealthy people from the western part of the state  --  wealthy from coal  --  came there to sail or to fish from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that seemed to operate in a vacuum , as if done by amateurs . Because of its position on the ocean and its tendency to attractnortherly winds , Cherry River remained mild until Augustand September . Its horseshoe-shaped , picturesque harbor , in some places visibly rotting , attracted boatmen and retired landowners from farther south , who were sick of long summers . It also attracted a businessman who had already started small amusement parks and commercial beaches in small cities along the coast and by palatable lakes , and who had built a boardwalk along as much of the harbor as he was able to buy , beginning out of nowhere and ending nowhere . The beach was improved by mountains of sand from mysterious sources  --  fine , pure , sparkling sand . The first dance hall was built , and then , annexed to it , the first tavern of a sophisticated nature . Prohibition made the prosperity of the town a certainty : so promising was its future , so forward-looking its new inhabitants , that the first Cherry River  --  cotton and tobacco port , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no longer had any relationship to the new Cherry River at all . The present and the past were so incongruous that when a horde of boys from the beach , most of them of foreign descent , tipped over and defaced the Civil War cannon by the church  --  in Cherry River , it was called the " War Between the States " cannon  --  nothing was done to repair the damage . The new people could not remember any such war and had no interest in it . Decades later , when the huge auto-racing track was first opened , the city was a strange blend of old buildings and new , sleek creations , many of them adorned by intricate neon signs . The old boardwalk had been replaced by a wide , gigantic walk that ran almost the entire length of the inner harbor , and betweenit and the beach ( admission to the beach was now fifty cents ) were restaurants and night clubs and side shows and games and tents  --  at one end , near the new racing track , fairly expensive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side , " cheap and noisy and dangerous after dark . The land to the north of Cherry River , bordering the ocean , had long since been sold to private , wealthy families , some of whom had made their fortunes during Prohibition and many of whom now owned interests in Cherry River . The commercial part of the city was operated by a congenial arrangement between two or three gambling syndicates to the north . The population of the city was now vividly mixed  --  there may have been descendants of the original inhabitants , but no one knew about them . Tourists were surprised to discover a littleNew England-looking town behind the hotels and restaurants , with its own churches and a red brick high school and homes that were not beach houses . Many of the oldfashionedbuildings on what had been Main Street were now turned into apartment houses to hold the Negroes and other workers , mainly of Italian descent , who had been attracted to the town to work on the beach or as waiters or janitors or kitchen help . The city 's oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nigra " in their lives , were now accustomed to seeing Negro children running freely about on Main Street and seeing Negro families present themselves in church Sun/day mornings , scrubbed and polished and dressed with a vengeance . Though the population was sharply heterogeneous and the most recent section of it expanding rapidly , there had been littleconflict until recent years . During Prohibition there had been violence and occasional murders , but these had to do with privatequarrels begun in northern cities ; the population was not hurt or even offended by them . In recent years , however , there had been a few instances of brutality without apparent motive  --  a carload of Negro teen-agers had been forced off a highway , a row of Negro huts in the old " Niggertown " section had been set on fire , and from time to time car windows had been smashed indiscriminately . On Hallowe'en the windows of the high school had been broken , but whether this had been done by the Negro children , who went by school bus to another school , or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first summer that Shar had come to Cherry River there had been some beatings of both Negroes and whites , and investigations , but nothing had come of them . Someone had had a shrewd idea and violated all precedent to appoint several Negroes to the police force  --  they would be assigned to their own neighborhoods  --  but no one could tell , of course , whether trouble had been averted by this . It was thought generally that it had been a good decision  --  it showed progressivethinking . Some of the oldest people , frightened by changingtimes , alternated between thinking of moving farther South and reflecting complacently that they did not have much longer to live . Though some of the night clubs and hotels remained open all winter , summer was still the most prosperous season for Cherry River . The Fourth of July race was the most important event of the year , since it attracted people from remote parts ofp196the country . On the days before and after the race the streets would be crowded , the boardwalk milling with humanity , the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach hordes of people would lie in the sun or swim or fend their way around , walking stiffly , as if walking itself had becomea struggle . The sunny air would be filled with excitement and expectancy as well as with the tumultuous din of voices and music from transistor radios , held fondly up to ears and evoking in eyes a dreamy , narcotic peace . Toward the end of June Shar and a few men had come to Cherry River to prepare themselves for the race . Shar had come immediately after leaving Synderdale , alone , and was joined before long by the mechanics and his alternate driver , Mitch . Following Shar 's example , they declined Max 's offer of rooms in a motel he partially owned  --  the offer included even the Negro Mitch  --  and rented rooms in an old boardinghouse not far from the garage they used when they were in Cherry River . The days before the race passed calmly . Shar woke early in the morning and went down to the beach to swim , sometimes alone , sometimes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early morning the beach , though littered with papers and refuse , had a pale , clean glare , and the water smelled hard and salty . Shar felt his strength returning . The air intoxicated him . Mornings at Cherry River had always been good ; it was later , when the afternoon and night crowds dominated , that he hated the place . The look of the crowds with their sweating faces and bright clothes tightened his stomach so that only working out with the car relaxed him , or , if that did not work , he could begin drinking after supper until all tension dissolved into a hot stupor . One morning , a little groggy , Shar had explained to Mitch the secret of his life : " You got to keep going.  |p197When  you stop , it all catches up . Being a nigger , you 'll understand that . " Mitch agreed with him . They were sitting at the edge of the beach , their feet waiting for the waves . " I been going for a long time , " Mitch said , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can buy anything , " Shar said , " as long as it stands still for them . They can buy anything , the best drivers , the best mechanics , the best races . They can buy me , I s'pose . . . I s'pose they have . But when I 'm out there , there 's no bastard that owns me , a fat millionaire or whoever it is . And they Jesus-well better remember that . " " He said anything about a circuit ? " " Hell ! What is he waiting for ? " Shar said angrily . " How much more money does he need ? No , he puts it off ; he puts me off . I got both arms broke once or twice , a leg broke  --  I forget which  --  collarbones a few times , lost count of it , ribs up and down and back again  --  and wrists and fingers and feet , off and on . What is he waiting for ? That fifty-thousand-dollar policy he has on me ? If I belonged to somebody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago  --  I 'd be a grand prix winner . How 'd you like that last son of a bitch that won  --  foreign bastard ! " But as he spoke , he felt odd  --  as if he were not telling the truth . As if Mitchie had said something , Shar snapped , " And I 'm not old ! I 'm good for another ten years . Look at the South American bastard , how old is he ? Forty-six ?  --  What they 're grooming you for , Mitch , is n't motor-racing . They fooled me with it . For them it 's money and for me , waiting to die . " " The hell with that ! " Mitch said . He looked at Shar with proper astonishment . " Who are you kidding ? " " But over there , driving a car , a thousand miles of a real road ! How 'd you like that , a real road for once ? Not a goddamp198horse track  --  a greyhound track ! I been so many times around a circle I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a circle but carried out in parts ? I 'd like to stuff that fat bastard Max 's money down his throat , stuff him up to his mouth . He wo n't let me go . . . . " Shar 's argument , familiar to him and his friends , lost its enthusiasm . He could not help but feel that the American track , compressed and spectacular , answered his own hunger for brutality in a way that the European track would not . But that was not the only reason he no longer wanted to leave the country . Later , swimming with Mitchie , lunging against the surf , Shar felt the strength of his body like electricity buoying him up . The sun was just above the horizon , streaking across the water . The staleness of his mind was freshened by the water and air ; he felt young . The surf pounded behind him up to the empty shore , but before him there was nothing but water and light  --  nothing that was familiar . He yelled over to Mitchie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mitchie put his hand to his ear as if he were deaf ; he grinned clownishly . " It does you good to have it like this ! God , how I love this world ! " Shar muttered fiercely . " A damn good world ! I ca n't get close enough to it  --  " Mitchie shrugged his shoulders ; he could not hear . Shar did not look at him . He stared at the skyline and the hot sun . With the coarse water lunging about him he thought again that he could not get close enough to it , just as he could not get close enough to anything , finally  --  not even his racing , certainly not Karen . At the thought of her he felt his heart sink , as if he had succumbed to something forbidden . " A bitch ! " he said . He trembled with anger at her . " Dressed like that , looking like a kid , to shame me ! To shame me ! " In those days Shar was accustomed to leaving places suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to thoughtsp199about Karen . He seemed to think that in this way he would elude her . With a vague explanatory wave of his hand he left Mitchie looking after him and went back to his room . Mitch came up a while later , his clothes changed , and he and Shar went to have breakfast at a diner . It was made of rusted tin and had tinfoil in its windows to keep out the sun . Mitchie noticedhow some of the men inside  --  workingmen on their way to jobs  --  looked at him and Shar , but Shar , settling arrogantly into himself , noticed nothing . Mitchie said to Shar in a low voice , " You heard about that fight last night ? It was after you left . Right out in the street in front of Max 's place . " " No , " said Shar . " Was it anything to do with us ? " " A nigger had too much to drink was being kicked around . They used their knees on him , " Mitchie said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mitchie , " but I  --  " " But you for Christ sake had better keep your nose out of it , " Shar said , as if reading off something that had no interest for him . " It 's got nothing to do with you . " Shar spent his days at the garage or sitting in a bar nearby or driving south along the interstate highway that overlooked the ocean . He showered many times in one day , discovering himselfsweat-stained and dirty  --  there was dirt under his fingernailshe could not get out , though he spent half an hour one day digging at it with a toothpick . Night began after supper , and he would spend it in one of the cheap bars that the Cherry River workers frequented instead of the tourists . Sitting at his table , there would be an Italian-looking woman not much younger than Shar , with a big , healthy , smiling face , a large body , a loud , vulgar laugh ; it had been the laugh that , for some reason , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her along the highway and listen to her talk  --  she was full of anecdotesabout things that happened to gamblers in the backp200rooms of the night clubs and children on the merry-go-rounds and Ferris wheels and misguided Negroes and friends of hers , girls , who took up with one man after another ; all tales would be followed by her satisfied laughter . In Shar 's room she would hold him , strong as a man , she would moan and rub her arms tightly about his body . Shar wanted to put his hand over her mouth . Her big , sweating body dazzled him , her opened red lips , her strength , and her response to him  --  they left him dazzledbut oddly unmoved ; he reacted by instinct most of the time . The first time they had met they spent the night together and did not get up until three the next afternoon . Shar had brought a bottle up with him and the woman had been sick off and on , but infatuated with him , and both had staggered downstairs with white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind , whatever past he had had was obscured by a thick mist.  |p201When  Max arrived , Shar allowed himself to be persuaded to eat at Max 's motel and to spend part of the night there , but he refused to move in . It was a gigantic building , made mostly of tinted glass . People with colorful clothes and straight , white teeth milled about in the doorway and in the lobby ; they smiled tentatively at Shar , mistaking him because of his dark , surly look for the gunmen who were rumored to be around . In the lounge of the motel there was a cascade of water bubbling blue and red and green , falling in sparkling crashes onto rocks.  |p202Max  was particularly proud of this , which he had insisted upon himself , and he and Shar sat at the bar so they could see it better . " Now , outside the sun would get in your eyes . There would be mosquitoes or ticks or snakes  --  bears , anything . A herd of cows with horns , maybe , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Max sighed . The lounge was dark and spacious and voices were no more than murmurs in it because of the thick rug and the special ceiling . " In here there is no trouble  --  it is all under control . This is what civilization brings to us . I could exist nowhere but in civilization . " " You Jesus-well could n't , " Shar agreed . At their first meeting Shar had cautioned Max about speakingof Karen , so that now , at times , Max had a blank , stopped look and his lips worked enviously ; he looked at Shar as if pleading for the opportunity to say what he was thinking , but Shar ignored him . " A son of a bitch for not even asking , " Jerry said to Shar 's face . Shar , who had been drinking , did not think Jerry worth answering . " No , no , " Max had said , upset , " you do not understand . You are sentimental  --  I am sentimental . Shar is different from us , we ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How I envy that ! A brutal , clever child ! " Most of their conversations were about the impending race . Shar 's only important rival , Max informed him , was a young Negro who had begun racing just this season . He was twentyone , a slender , jet-black boy with a reputation for being wise as well as a skillful driver . He called himself Vanilla Jones . Max had pointed him out to Shar one day on the boardwalk : he had been standing in conversation with two white men and a white girl , waving his hands , throwing his head back with laughter . He had sideburns and wore sunglasses of the silver metallic kind that look like mirrors ; Shar had despised him at once . " It is n't because he 's a nigger , " he had said , " but that might have something to do with it . " He wondered if perhapsp203another accident like the one at Synderdale would happen . " This time you must take care , " Max had said seriously . " Not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But because of you . Because you can not be replaced . You must win the race straight . " " Mitch can always put in for me , " said Shar , " if you do n't like the way I do it . " " My dear God , Shar , " sighed Max , " you misunderstand me ... you weary me  --  and this weather . . . this weather is so hot . I am thinking of you yourself . I am worried about you . " " Worried about me ? " " Of course I am worried . You know how you are  --  " " How am I ? " " You do n't look well . You do n't eat . How do I know ? I watch you eat , I see what you leave . I ask Mitchie what it is you have for breakfast . And too much drinking  --  you drink too long , too much . You are with bad companions . " Shar laughed aloud , though he did not know why . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true , but he did not know what to do about it . " I 'm not taking any shots , " he said peevishly . " You should be happy for that . " " I am happy for that , " Max said , making a bowing gesture with his big head . " I have n't had any since April . Since before I went up to that  --  " He stopped . A memory of that trip came to him at once , a startling picture : he saw his father burned alive , crawling out of bed just as the fire began and shouting curses at Shar , waving his bony fists at him . " At Eastertime . But this was no son that got laid out by his father , " he said strangely . He felt feverish . He despised Max for Max 's shrewdness , for the man 's little piercing eyes , and he despised himself for his own weakness . He thought of asking about Karen but said nothing . " Now , they tell me you started this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me you got up early  --  went swimming . They tell me you had a good breakfast and spent the day at the garage and the track . They said you looked well , you were  --  " " What kind of bastards are they ? " said Shar . " Who is this that tells you ? " " The men . The men like you  --  they worship you , " Max said apologetically . " They want you to win the race . They want you to survive . " " But I do n't give a good damn about them , " Shar said . " I would n't care if I had to rip through them to get the car in . Like me ? Do they like me ? But how could anyone  --  like me ! " Shar shouldered his way along the boardwalk to get a better look at Vanilla Jones . He stood against the railing and lit a cigarette , watching the Negro . But his anger was not directedat the young man , whose behavior was self-conscious and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots on it  --  but against the men who had professed liking for him , against Max , who loved him , and against himself . The purity of hatred appealed to him : how easy to hate a Negro , to spend no time with complexities but to jump right away to the righteous conclusion of hatred ! How much that appealed to Shar , who discovered , with some surprise , that he could no longer love and hate immediately and distinctly : his life had become too complicated . He had left behind in the uncertain world of childhood such healthy , clear distinctions  --  a " brutal , clever child , " Max had called him fondly , but that was not true . Shar , standing alone on the boardwalk , felt strangely old  --  aged  --  and he could not help but think it fitting that this young Negro would triumph over him , that youth would alwaystriumph over age  --  and happily , too , and blindly , without even grinning back over his shoulder . He looked back at Max . The fat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peering anxiously at Shar while ap205stream of people passed before and around him ; he looked like a gigantic rock protruding up in the center of a creek . Max had a dough-colored face and thinning hair ; he looked awkward even while sitting , or standing still , as if life itself were a struggle for him . Strange man ! Shar thought it queer he should have anything to do with such a creature . Separated by the crowd , they were strangers  --  how did it happen they knew each other ? Better for Shar to approach the young Negro and to embrace him , to embrace his youth and vitality , than to return to Max  --  a bloated , insatiable spectator , a product of a refinedcivilization . Shar felt for an instant as if he were lost . That afternoon Marian had another story to tell him . " Now , this girl used to be a friend of mine and I really did like her  --  I really did . I do n't mean anything there . We went to school togetherand went around together  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was to hear about what happened ! That was just this morning I heard . The man is down at the police station . Nobody knows about it , and we would n't yet , except for Hannie  --  he lives next door ; I ever tell you about him ? " Shar was staring at the window . The shade was drawn and moved idly in the wind . " No , " he said . " Hannie works for the Dew Drop Inn , that big place . It ai n't the biggest one any more , with those two new ones built last year , but it 's pretty big , and nice inside . He worked in the back room to keep things quiet  --  you know  --  and seen some things in his time . He says he saw a man knocked out , beaten over the head with a shoe  --  they could n't find anything else and did n't want to use a gun  --  and some other things too that I ought n't to be telling about . I used to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl was all beat up so there was hardly a face there ; one of the cops said that . The guy that was with her got found on the road , trying to flag cars down and none ofp206them would have any of it except a cop car going by , and that was an hour or so afterward  --  after he woke up , anyhow , and seen what happened . They took his car and drove it in a ditch with water in it a few miles away , ' course he did n't know about that then  --  the cops found it later on . So they picked the guy up and could n't make much sense out of him till they went back to see , and found that girl there . That was Veronica . Veronica herself , and her with a husband working down at the boardwalk ! He was her second husband  --  she was married before , about sixteen then , to a kid her own age ; but it did n't work out . He worked on a freighter and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  so they broke up . He was a good friend of my brother 's . We all moved down here together , his family and mine , our fathers decided on it . . . . " Marian 's story was told calmly and with much interest , and she took it so seriously that she did not laugh at all . Shar watched her . At times , as she spoke , he wanted to put his hand over her mouth so there would be nothing to hear  --  there would be only her smeared face and perspiring , healthy body to see . Shar found himself wondering who the woman was and what he was doing with her , what he could have possibly wanted from her . He began to doubt his own sanity . " So it was Veronica , all right . The guy told the cops all about it and Hannie heard from one of them  --  he 's in good ' o ' them , from where he works . The guy says there were four niggersthat did it . He says one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the oldest one was maybe thirty and had a familiarlook ; he seen him somewhere before , around the boardwalkprobably , and thought he could remember him . But hell , no nigger that did that and had any brains would stay around here  --  he 'd be on the first train out , hiding in a boxcar . Hannie told me that . He 's sure as hell right , they 'll never find them , they can take every nigger in the town and give them pills top207make them tell the truth , or whatever they give them , and they wo n't find the right ones . But Jesus ! Veronica herself ! She got warned to be careful , but no , not her , one man after another -- 'course her husband liked to twist her arm around , some judo trick he learned somewhere , and even bragged about it and did it to her with people around  --  to make her squeal . So he was n't an angel himself . But Hannie says he broke down when he heard about it and kept wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Veronica herself ! I ca n't get over it . It 's a hell of a thing ! " " You stink , " Shar said suddenly . " Do n't you ever wash ? " When Marian turned to gape at him , Shar made himself smile . She hesitated a moment , then slapped his stomach with her hand . " Who the hell are you talking about ? " she said . She leaned over him . Shar saw a look of fondness start out from the loose pursing of her mouth , move to her eyes , which were heavy-lidded and smeared with mascara , and to her arms and hands , as she caressed him . She forgot her story  --  it was to Shar strangely incomplete , since she had not laughed abruptly at the end . " What a bastard you are , " she whispered , " you know what that smell is from . What a bastard , a bastard , a bastard . . . . " She struggled tenderly with him ; she took hold of his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shemurmmered to him hoarsely , and Shar , dizzy with excitement , thought of the first time  --  it had happened only twice  --  that he had been to able make Karen feel this way . He had made love to her slowly and patiently and had talked to her , bringing his eyes close to her until she had cried out in fear and astonishment , as if she had been betrayed . . . lying in his arms with her face hidden , she had whispered something to him , something about being afraid , and that her body would not stop throbbing , and Shar had thought that he loved her . He loved her ! The memory seized and overpowered him and when hep208lay beside Marian again he was filled with a peculiar tenderness for her , as if she were a victim he had discovered  --  the faceless woman found in a ditch , attacked by four Negroes and beaten to death !  --  and one Negro not more than fourteen . Shar and Marian were sitting at an outside cafe on the boardwalkwhen Mitch and a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of them looked as if they had been drinking , and it was with a mysterious , awkward leer that the fat young man , holding hands with the girl , approached Shar . " So we meet again ! Did you think you had lost me ? You and your boss ! " the young man cried happily . He had pulled the girl along with him . She protested weakly , touching her curly hair , and arranged a smile for Shar and Marian . " Did you think I would be left behind ? Just because he had me fired ! Did you think I had no presence of mind , or parents to write home to ? They sent me money to keep me for a month ! What do you think of that ? " Mitch put his arm around the sweating young man 's shoulders and said quickly , pretending to be more drunk than he was , " Ponzi said how he wanted to see you again . He was in the pit for you at Synderdale  --  you know . Got in some trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was after you left town . He 's all right , though . He 's all right . He come down here to Cherry River to see you day after tomorrow . Just come down to see the race . " " I come down to see my old friends again , " Ponzi said . " This is a friend . Him there , drives the car . What did I tell you , honey ? I told you I knew the driver . That 's him . He drives . He won the race last week  --  a man was killed in it . An accident . " Here he laughed suddenly . " A goddam sad accident , with the car tilted up on end . He had his head sheared off . " Shar stared at him . He felt no emotion at all , not even dis/gust . Mitch , looking anxiously at Shar and trying to edge in front of Ponzi , gestured with his hands more than usual and even cracked his knuckles , trying to think of something to say . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with long , complicated hair tinted a pale red , curled in a loose crown around her head ; she kept licking her lips and staring at Shar . Behind them on the boardwalk people passed in bathing suits and playsuits and straw hats , some of them carryingballoons . " I never met them before , " Marian said , leaning forward as if she meant to embrace them . " You just come down here ? " " I just arrived this morning , " Ponzi said . His nose was sunburnedand had started to peel . He had a frantic , young , earnestlook , as if he were having difficulty with the language . " Now what am I stuck with ? A goddam chaperon ! A chaperon ! " And all the time he stared at Marian and back to Shar , as if something mystified him . " A chaperon . . . . They got me to walk around with them and hold her hand so it do n't look  --  it do n't look bad . But no mistake about it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not me ! " Here the girl giggled and allowed her face to turn red . She and Marian exchanged a look . Ponzi straightened his broad shoulders and sucked in his breath so that his damp shirt suddenly went tight across his chest . " Why the hell she would prefer a dirty nigger to me I do n't know . I do n't know . Because of Mitchie 's new suit ? And that hat he 's got , a straw hat with a chicken feather in it ! He catches all the girls ' eyes that way and I got to hold their hands and walk around with them  --  a hell of a thing . It 's embarrassing . " Mitch laughed with more enthusiasm than he felt . He had begun to look around at the other tables and at people passing behind him to see if anyone heard Ponzi . " A girl do n't hold it against a man on account of his color , " Marian said seriously , " when he looks like him . If he was fat orp210real black it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-looking man . " Ponzi roared with delight . " That 's right ! And I 'm the fat one , are n't I ? I do n't have no straw hat with a chicken feather either . A hell of a poor slob of a bastard I am  --  got the same stinking clothes I had on at Synderdale , ca n't get them off , all grease and dirt got so stiff I ca n't get the pants down . What do you think of that ? " " They 're going to hang looser on you before long , " Shar said . He looked from Ponzi to Mitch and laughed . Ponzi , who had not heard or had not understood , lunged forward and brought his face close to Shar . " Where is she ? " he said . " What did you do with her ? Is her head sheared off too ? Where is she ? " Mitch pulled Ponzi back and , grinning tightly at Shar , said , " Ponzi been hitchhiking out in the sun . He been trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never ate much , drank his supper instead  --  you know . He come down specially to watch you win . " " You come with him too , honey ? " Marian said to the girl . The girl brightened . Now , recognized , she cleared her throat and said softly , " No , I live nearby here . On a farm . " " What the hell , ai n't I just explained how I 'm their chaperon ? " Ponzi said . " Are you thick-skulled ? What happened to the other one ? " " This Ponzi just had too much to drink , " Mitch said . " Maybe I better take him down to the beach  --  put his head in the wa-ter . " " No nigger is going to do that to me , " Ponzi said angrily . Then he laughed and turned affectionately to Mitch . " Except Mitchie , who do n't count . I explained to him how niggers are  --  how they come to be all brown , and white folks mostly white . Because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the freckles converged and went togetherand overlapped , sometimes making the area darker  --  you know  --  so it turned out all brown ; one freckle . " The girl and Marian turned to stare at Mitch , as if seeing him differently . Shar said to Ponzi , " Maybe you better go back home . " " Why should I go back home ? Why ca n't I stay here ? Ai n't this a free picnic up and down here ? Girls in bathing suits  --  barefoot ! And ladies of forty giving me the eye ! The very dogs run along the boardwalk shaken with excitement , all a world of legs for them  --  brown legs , white legs , thin legs , fat legs , bare legs ! Why should I go home ? " " You ai n't going home till after the race , for sure , " Marian said . " That 's the big thing . " " How long you known him ? " Ponzi said suddenly to Marian , indicating Shar with his chin as if Shar were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life , " Marian said with a loud laugh , putting her hand on Shar 's head . " Are n't you a nosy bastard ? " Everyone except Shar laughed , Ponzi loudly , Mitchie rather nervously . The girls were grateful for the moment . " I 'll tell you what , " Marian said , standing , self-conscious of her body  --  she wore a red dress with heavy white beads  --  and smiling warmly at Ponzi , " since you ai n't seen anything around here I 'll show you through . They got a new show down at the other end I ai n't seen yet  --  nor Shar neither  --  he ai n't seen anythinghimself . The most he does is go down to the beach . Do n't you ? How come you do n't care about the boardwalk ? " " He does n't like the people there ! " Ponzi said accusingly . His words came out so fast he must have been astonished at what they said . " He does n't like the way they smell , maybe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in a grandstand ; hep212likes to hear them clap . He likes them set up for a target , ready to get spun off the track ! But nobody to get too near , and girls to last him one  --  " For some reason Shar looked at him in alarm . He felt an odd rush of pity , as he had felt pity for Marian earlier that day . " What did she say to you the other night ? " Shar said . He stood and took hold of Ponzi 's arm . " I heard her say something . What was it ? " Ponzi drew back . His face became mottled  --  white and red . His sunburned nose began to glow . Seeing their concern and feeling shame for his own obvious cowardice , he shrugged his shoulders . " A hell of a lot of difference it makes , " he said . " This is Cherry River , ai n't it ? Synderdale is back there  --  a goddam hick town . " " What did she say ? " said Shar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulling at Shar 's arm . " Tell him what she said , " Mitchie murmured . " He ai n't goingto hurt you . " " I 'm not afraid , for Christ 's sake , " Ponzi said . His face had begun to relax ; the blood returned . " She said  --  she said  --  " He made an effort to straighten his shoulders and looked fiercely at them . " She said that I . . . I suffered . " For a moment no one spoke . The redheaded girl stared earnestlyat Ponzi , waiting for him to continue . Mitch , who had heard this before  --  who had heard it many times  --  sucked at a tooth and stole a look up at Shar . Marian , her red dress tighteningaround her as she breathed , had a bright , vague , amused smile  --  she turned to Shar as if he might explain this . Shar , who had been lighting a cigarette , stood without moving and stared at Ponzi 's wet face . It was the first time anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Easily , gratefully , the others laughed with him  --  Ponzi giggled hysterically . He poked his chest withp213his thumb . " Me ! Me ! " he said . " How the hell do you like that ? I am bedazzled by such illumination ! A martyr ! I see myself  --  I see my destiny . " When they stopped laughing Marian said , " So now we 'll go through the boardwalk . There 's lots of things there . Honey , I did n't get your name  --  Kathie ? Well , Kathie . I 'm Marian . Funny I never saw you . Well , even if you seen it before it 's all right , ai n't it ? I mean , I saw it a hundred times  --  a million times . I never get sick of it . Should we go through ? " " Maybe we ought to go over to the garage , " Mitch said to Shar . " The hell with the garage ! " Ponzi said . " You like people , do n't you ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people , " Shar said . Walking in the sunlight , fending his way against the crowd , Shar felt that he had been drinking too much . He felt tired , and not even the effortless vitality of the others  --  especially Marian  --  could touch him . About them people pushed in a great sweat of excitement : there were young couples in bathing suits carrying wet , dirt-smeared towels , and groups of boys with hard round bellies wearing swimming trunks , and men in T-shirts and shorts , gaudily dressed , wearing sunglasses , and women of all ages  --  in sun suits and wearing earrings , in high heels , in low-cut dresses , in overalls . Many carried red balloons . They stopped at a shooting gallery . Ponzi insisted on paying for everyone . The man inside the booth was fat , dark , Italian , and nodded a surly hello to Marian . Shar said to Mitchie , " Jerry ought to try this . " Mitchie , glad to hear anything Shar might say , turned to him with a grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitchie said . Marian crowded them and wanted to know who they were talking about , and when they shrugged and looked away she seemed hurt . " You always do that , " she said.  |p214Someone  shouted to the man in the booth , speaking Italian in a rapid , excited way . " This-here is America , you bastards , " Marian said . She had been drinking too much ; she stood swayingon the boardwalk and shaking her fists at the men . " They do n't talk that here ! You greaseballs ! " They got her away with some difficulty . Around on the boardwalk tourists stopped to stare with interest . A woman with blue-dyed hair approached Shar , who looked the most respectable , and said , " Is it trouble ? I know a little Italian . Is there some trouble ? " Hot wind blew dust up against their faces . " That across the way is the best place , " Marian was saying , pointing out a motel of beige and aqua . She spoke particularly to Ponzi and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a new one . There 's s'post to be some gangsters own it . " " You 're absolutely right , " Ponzi said . " I believe you . This place is run by those bastardly gangsters . " " Well , I do n't know , " Marian said , " I mean , if they 're so bad and all . . . . What would this place be without the boardwalk ? A crummy hick town . What would it be ? I would n't be living down here , you would n't of come , Shar would n't have no race  --  none of us would of met here ! They ai n't so bad . " " Max owns half of that place , " Mitch could not help saying . Ponzi stared across the busy street as if fascinated . " He told us we could stay there if we wanted  --  me too . We decided not to , it was too fancy . " " Too fancy for me too , " Marian agreed . They went on . The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could smell the ocean , past the odors of hot dogs and beer and tobacco . They passed taverns with crowded doorwaysand restaurants blaring with music ; someone sang to ap215guitar , sitting out on the boardwalk with his back against a wall , a young man with pale , curly hair : " I know I ai n't the only one of yours But I 'll be a man just as long as I can , ' Cause that 's the way love is . " They bought beer in one of the little taverns , standing noisily at the bar . The bartender put it into paper cups for them and they trooped out . At the doorway they had to wait for a woman with a baby carriage who was coming in  --  slowly and with dignity . She met all eyes with a fierce , calm stare . When Shar was outside again , squinting against the dusty wind , he felt enlivened ; he felt almost excited . Ahead of him and Marian the other three walked quickly , looking around ; Ponzi pointed and exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto his shirt but did not seem to notice . They idled at a small shop . " Look here , " Ponzi cried with pleasure , turning immediately to Shar . He pointed at some of the souvenirs on the counter . " What would you like but a plastic baby , a black baby like this ? Hanging on a gold chain , with some feathers around its bottom ! To put keys on , " The young girl turned it about in her fingers . " It 's a key chain , " she said softly . " All kinds of things here , " Ponzi said . There were little felt hats in bright colors , red and blue and yellow , and giant pencilswith feathers on them , and spiders with yellow eyes on littlesprings , and sunglasses with dark green lenses and frames of white plastic with great plume-like red feathers on the sides . There were neckties with naked women painted in coarse detailon them , and a dozen sets of false teeth , bright and pink , waiting to be rattled ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean and of Ferris wheels and of auto racing on them ; there were beads of gold andp216silver , and friendship rings , and wigs of all colors , and post cards with cartoons . Ponzi bought one of the little felt hats , a yellow one with a long black feather , put it on his round head , and pulled the rubber strap under his chin . The young girl was given the little black baby , which she seemed to have becomeattached to . Passing by an alleyway they were surprised by a gang of small boys who ran out onto the boardwalk waving sticks . The boys wore bathing trunks and had thin , insect-bitten chests . Ponzi made a drunken lunge at one of them , frightening him away , and as the boys ducked past , one of them  --  a boy with a large black head and a dirty neck  --  yelled to Marian , " Do n't you bring no nigger home ! Dirty bastard ! " Marian stood staring after him . Her big broad face showed a look of sorrow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My kid Harry . Did I tell you about Harry ? " Shar finished the beer and threw away his paper cup . " He 's a smart kid , he thinks up all kinds of things , " Marian said . She took Shar 's arm and pressed against him . He could smell her hot breath against his neck . " His father was a no-good son of a bitch . I mean , I do n't want to give you the wrong idea . He was sweet as anything when we met . And took me out and treated me real nice , like they do . I would n't of married him if he did n't . I had a lot of them to choose from . I was only seventeen then  --  a while ago  --  " She thought of something and giggled suddenly . " I never wanted anybody like my old man , I made sure of that . He paraded around in his underwear and went to the bathroom  --  you know  --  right outside , where people could see him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one got us to come down here , moved us down himself , and then never got used to it . He worked in a steel mill up north and could n't get settled here  --  he said he missed wherep217we used to live . A real sty , that was ! And he said he missed it ! " Children sat at an outdoor counter , their flushed legs curled around the stools . They watched Shar and the others pass sulkily , sucking on straws . Shar thought it odd that there were no adults with them . Marian went on , pleased with what she felt to be Shar 's interest . " You see that kid there ? On the motorcycle ? " A young man balanced himself on a motorcycle on the street below , talking to a group of teen-agers who hung down from the boardwalk . He had black sideburns and smoked a cigar . " He lives upstairs from us . And a sick bastard he is , too , only you would n't know it to look at him . They used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs throwing around , and things out the window , and things knocked rattlingdown the stairs . He started fights all the time . Only I heard the other day from a friend of mine  --  it was Veronica ! Yes  --  Veronica  --  ai n't that a surprise now , and Veronica dead like she is  --  Well , she told me he had this stomachache all the time and would n't do nothing about it , and finally went to a doctor or something  --  I do n't know where  --  and found out it was real bad ; something bad . " They had passed the boy and Marian looked around , pursing her lips at him . " A kid like that ! A kid his age ! And all the while he 's got that thing growing down there , down there in his gut ! The little bas-tard ! " They stopped for a while at another tavern , then went down to the beach . Ponzi ran ahead , kicking up sand , waving his arms . He ran all the way down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter . " He sure is funny , ai n't he ? " the girl said to Marian . " I do n't know when I met anybody so funny before . " Late afternoon on the beach bodies lay outstretched onp218blankets , offering themselves to the sun , beneath a din of music and voices . There was an air of merriment that Shar could not ignore . " I wisht I had my bathing suit on , " Marian said , grippinghis arm . " You never seen me in a bathing suit , did you ? " Someone shouted behind them . A fat man in bathing trunks stood with his legs apart , shouting to someone in the crowded area behind Shar and the woman . His voice was bellowing and seemed to jerk and electrify his body  --  he shouted with rage in a foreign language . " Those bastards do n't know how to speak English , " Marian said . " I do n't like to hear that , do you ? " " No , " said Shar . The yelling in another language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was cavorting in the surf , flapping his arms up and down . Though Marian and Kathie and even Mitch had to laugh at him , Shar stared at him with interest and did not smile . Suddenly Ponzi fell , sitting down in the water . He bellowed with surprise . Shar looked around , shading his eyes . The sun and the constanthot wind , lifting dust up into his face , made him dizzy and uncertain . The heat made him feel excited , as if something were going to happen that he did not yet know about but his body sensed : a violence it craved and strained for . Nearby on a frayed olive-green blanket a woman in a flowered bathing suit sat plumply , rubbing lotion on her pinkened shoulders . She was perhaps thirty  --  young-looking , made-up , with red lips  --  and Shar thought about her . He wondered what it would be like to tear at her clothes , to attack her . . . . In the next instanthis thoughts puzzled him ; he felt nothing for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as attractive as Marian . Then he saw at the edge of her blanket two children , boys of six or seven , fighting viciously  --  sometimes with their fists , sometimes shifting their balances rapidly and somehow ex/pertly , sitting down and slashing out with their feet at each other . They threw fistfuls of sand at each other 's faces with terrible hatred . The woman looked around and began shouting at them . Her body was stiff and inert and cords in her neck stood out as she yelled . Shar said suddenly to Marian : " I wonder if I have any childrenanywhere . " She thought this was funny and repeated it to Kathie , who pretended to be embarrassed , and to Mitchie  --  who looked at Shar with alarm . Then Ponzi came back , sputtering and kickingsand over people who glared up at him ; he presented himself to Shar and the others as if he had accomplished something . " Sat down in the water , " he said . " Got my pants wet . How the hell do I look ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get the pants off to change them . I told you how stiff they got with dirt . Filthy , dirty things  --  I could n't go home with them on . I had to telephone them at home . How could I go home ? What if they looked at my face and saw something there ? My mother has heart attacks , minor ones , all the time . She ca n't go upstairs . She stays downstairs  --  my father goes upstairs . I think they found me in a woodpile one morning . My father scratches himself  --  you know  --  but he 's a good man , a goddam good man , and I  --  " He stared flatly at them . " I love him , " he said . He adjusted the yellow felt hat on his head and made the girls giggle . Shar saw , here and there on the beach , police squatting and looking around . " That 's on account of the trouble last night , " Marian said . " Those cops there . " When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swaying with excitement . Ponzi listened intently ; Mitchie cracked his knuckles , glancing around nervously . " But they would n't be anywhere around here . Not now . Not after what they did , " Marian said . She was satisfied by the look of fascination and horror she had evokedp220in the girl 's face . Both looked to Mitchie as if waiting for a confirmation of what Marian had said . After leaving the beach they stopped at another bar for a while where Ponzi greedily ate a hot dog and the rest had beer . They then went over to the amusement park . They passed a roller rink and a number of squat , dingy hot-dog stands insidetents . There were rides for children  --  merry-go-rounds , boat rides , something called a caterpillar , a small roller coaster . Children screamed in ecstasy , lifted and hurled through the air . There was a bingo tent at which fat women sat , weary , with flabby arms , listening to the bright announcements of numbers . An array of prizes wrapped in cellophane had lured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , urgent clash of music and voices and screams and the metallic clash of machinery  --  it enlivenedpeople , even tired adults , who shared some of their children 's excitement , allowing themselves to be pulled along . At a pony ride Shetland ponies trod miserably around a small track , their long , matted hair dirty ; they looked down at their hoofs . Shar , dizzy with sunlight , found himself staring at one of the ponies  --  a skinny white and brown thing with a limp tail . Seeing the animal , Shar felt a wave of strong emotion course through him  --  but what it was , whether anger or excitement or joy , he could not tell . Farther down the midway there were shows advertised . Dancing girls from exotic lands : the posters promised women with veils , with fans , with an array of feathers , with long cascading hair . Marian and the girl giggled as they passed . " You do n't want to go in here , " Marian said , tugging at Shar 's arm . Shar ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal shows that were crowded mostly with children ; they passed a show of Negro dancers , men and women , who could be heard screamingand cavorting inside the tent . Strips of red , white , andp221blue crepe paper decorated this tent . " There 's the new one . Just got in this week , to be in for the Fourth of July , " Marian said , pointing to a tent . It was decorated gaily with many posters , some of them brand new  --  the freak show . " The freak show ! " Ponzi cried . " A goddam good thing to go to ! Why did n't I know about this before ? I ought to of come here first off . " Advertised on the outside of the tent were mighty midgets , and a half-woman-half-gorilla , and crocodile people , and a vampire-like woman who was seen to be tearing flesh out of a man with her bare teeth . There was a great fat man and a fat woman , with several fat children dressed in baby clothes  --  blue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Turkish hat and purple trousers , and armless and leglesspeople , and people that were eating chickens alive . " I do n't know if I much want to go in here , " Mitch said as they started up the ramp . The girl pouted and looked significantly at Marian , who forced Mitch into going . " Why , she ai n't seen this before , " she said confidentially to Mitch . " She ai n't been down here since it came . " The show was fairly crowded . At one end a man talked loudly through a megaphone ; Shar heard a string of medical terms . The man was holding aloft a jar with something dark in it  --  embryos , probably . Ponzi and Marian went down to look , the girl followed hesitantly after . " Christ , it smells in here , " Mitchie said . He glanced around at the stalls . " This is a hell of a place to go to . " Marian and the others came back , raving about the embryos . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The man showed how they were joined . You could see the backbone there  --  it was white . Think if that happened to you ! " She laughed and took Shar 's arm . Half the stalls were closed . " Where the hell is the fire-eater ? " Ponzi said . " All my life I been wanting to see a fire-eater. "  |p222For  an audience of small children the midgets went through a dance routine , then a sword-fighting routine . The fat man , who looked as if his gigantic flesh had begun to melt in the heat , sat on a creaking stool and watched them , clapping his hands . If he had a wife or children they were nowhere in sight . The midgets had coarse , wrinkled faces , and seemed to be winking and leering down at the children and at Kathie . They raised and kicked their legs suggestively , arching their eyebrows . There was one woman with a white , painted face , elaborate eyes , and a frilly pink dress , and three men dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-buttoned shoes . An odor of stale unwashed flesh hung about them . Ponzi went up as close as he could get , cheering the midgets , stumbling and apologizing profusely to the children he stepped on . " Are n't they cute ? " Marian said . " They 're so little . Why are they so little ? That one of them  --  there  --  looks like an old man , his face is so wrinkled ! " They strolled past . Shar had begun to feel nauseous , but the sensation did not weaken him  --  it excited him , strangely ; he was itching for violence . He gripped Marian 's arm . They glanced at each other and a shock of understanding passed through each of them . Ponzi and the others stood gaping at the crocodile people , who were protected from their audience by thick wire . They had rough , greenish skin and odd Oriental eyes , and stared back sorrowfully at the spectators . " Holy Christ , " Ponzi cried , " are those things real ? " Mitchie dragged him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no vampire woman out just now  --  she must have been temperamental , for her stall was empty . But there was a creature of gigantic size that looked like an ape but was dressed like a woman and seemed to have , beneath its fur , a woman 's face and body . Shar laughed aloud . The creature sat back in a corner , looking out , with itsp223paws folded politely on its lap . " What a lot of crap this is , " Mitchie said . " Do they think anybody believes this ? " They had neared the entrance again . The man up on the platform had put aside his embryos now and was announcing something else : a race . He had attracted a large crowd , and Shar and the others could not get very close . The smell of flesh was in the air , and food , and filth . The man shouted sensationallythe names of the contestants in the race  --  " Bo-Bo , Terry , and Little Jo  --  here they are , just as they were born . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't interested in it , they take their fate as it is , they accept their condition . They do n't question the ways of our Maker and so why should we ? Look at them , folks , and let 's have a little hand . " The contestants were without arms or legs , and lay on their sides , professionally , to show their faces . They were to race one another through sawdust to a red , white , and blue decoratedfinish line . The master of ceremonies was about to shoot his cap-gun pistol when the flare of excitement reached its peak in Shar and he pulled Marian toward the exit . " Let 's get the hell out of here , " he said . " But the race ! The race ! " Marian cried . They struggled at the doorway ; the cap gun went off . " Let me watch it , Shar . Shar  --  " He waited outside until the race was over , smoking a cigarette . The desire for violence had grown so strong in him that tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . When the others came out they looked a little subdued ; even Ponzi looked quiet , and his wet lips were moving . But Marian laughed sharply and took hold of Shar 's arm . " I knew you 'd wait , " she said . " I knew it ! " " We 're going over to my room , " Shar said to Mitch . " You come along . "  |p224As  the afternoon had waned , the crowd had grown larger . Down on the street two automobiles had crashed , without much fuss , and a ring of spectators stood around . Horns blared . The smell of food was strong now , and the wind , rising at sundown , picked up dust and scraps of paper and flung it against faces . Shar looked at the young girl , Kathie , whom he had hardly noticed until now . She walked beside Ponzi as beforeand kept glancing back to him  --  she looked feverish . He saw her pale , smooth throat and the anxious movements of her jaw . At Shar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go down by the beach , " Mitch said . " Hell . What do you want ? We been listening to you all day . " " What are you going to do ? " Ponzi demanded . " You filthy bastards ! Filthy ! Four of you ! " " Get him out of here , " said Shar . " Now , you go on down , " Mitch said , standing face to face with Ponzi and tapping his chest . " Why , ai n't you said you was chaperoning for us ? Ai n't you ? Now , why you want to go and spoil everything ? You go on down now , and leave us be . Shar 's been nice to you all day . " " You filthy bastards ! " Ponzi cried in dismay . There was a scuffle inside the room . Marian cried out ; the girl answered her . " You go on ! You go on ! He likes me ! " she said . Ponzi pushed his way in to see Shar on his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her loins . His fingerswere outstretched on her back , closing into fists in her clothing . " He likes me ! He does ! " the girl cried , hiccuping in her proud hysteria . " He liked me best all along ! " Shar , his eyes wet , his face distorted , pulled the girl over to his unmade bed . " She was up in that son of a bitchen barn , " he said , " but I had to go back after her . She was bleeding  --  shep225was ugly , dirt on her face , on her mouth  --  she was ugly , ugly , but I  --  I said , Am I too big for you ? Am I ? ' and she did n't feel it  --  she was unconscious  --  Why did n't I leave her there ? " He gave up on his tearing of the girl 's clothes and collapsed onto her suddenly , burying his face against her throat . They could hear him sob . " A bitch  --  a filthy bitch , a whore  --  If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitch was able to get Shar away from the girl , though the girl , confused , wanted to hold Shar in her arms " until he makes sense again . " Mitch knelt on the bed with his hands on Shar 's back , as if trying to brace Shar 's anguish . For a few minutes , sweating profusely , Mitch could not decide what to do . He looked around  --  Marian stood , crying pitifully , betrayed , back against the wall ; Ponzi stood in the doorway with his hat askew and the black feather curled up tight with his astonishment . His face had gone pale except for his nose . " Max will know what to do with him , " Mitch said . Hearing Shar sob brought tears to his own eyes . He turned away and put his arms around Shar 's wet , heaving back , as if he wanted to shield Shar from the others.  |p226Because  of the excitement , Max had his supper late that evening , around eight o'clock . He had been in a conversation with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his door . He opened it to see , with great surprise , the clownish figure of that man he had had fired several days before  --  a grotesque young man with filthy clothes and an imbecilestare , who had reminded Max , uncomfortably , of a whimsical projection of himself . Jerry had begged for permission to do something to him , first luring him into the laundryp227room of the motel , out of the sight and hearing of the guests  --  but Max had rebuked him angrily . " For you it 's a job  --  for us with responsibility it 's a life ! A man 's life ! " His defense of Ponzi irritated him , since it placed him on Ponzi 's side and seemed to establish a peculiar relationship between them . " I am growing weary of this life , " Max said . " There are few things that delight me . Shar  --  he is a delight . But what is happening to Shar ? " When they arrived at Shar 's room everything was quiet . InsideShar sat on the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ferocious wind had tunneled through it briefly and disappeared . Mitchie came out of the bathroom with a wet towel , which Shar accepted and held against his forehead . " What the hell are you doing here ? " said Shar . " Is something wrong ? " Max sat down shakily beside Shar . His heart was pounding , his breathing came with difficulty . He met Shar 's cold stare with compassion . The flurry of his thoughts  --  his fears  --  was quieted by the admiration he felt for Shar 's inhuman control of himself . Max could smell Shar 's breath , and he could see the strain in his face . " You will never let me help you , " Max said , putting a hand on Shar 's arm . It was a curiously kind gesture . " There 's nothing to help , " Shar said . He smoked his cigarette . " What the hell do you want , you runty bastard ? " he said to Jerry . " Are you going to wave that pistol around here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Bastardly little coward ! I knew you would n't . You ca n't do everything with a pistol . " Jerry laughed shortly and went out into the hall . " A man should never make enemies , " Max said . " No man is protected from his enemies . " " What the hell do I want protection from ? " Shar said . " What can hurt me ? What can they do to me that I would n't wantp228done ? Enemies ! " He put the towel to his eyes and sucked a long , shuddering breath . " I do n't know what the hell you 're worried about . I 'll do the race for you . If you do n't want me you can put Mitch in . Mitch is good  --  I 'd stake my life on him . He 's a good man . But I want to do the race . I ca n't stand it until the race . This is the worst waiting time I 've had  --  the time wo n't move , it drags along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in there . " " That 's very good to hear , " Max said happily . " Vanilla Jones , " Shar said . He looked at Max . They smiled together . " I 'll run it straight this time . No accidents . I 'd run it backwards if I could do it today  --  I 've got a hell of a long time yet to wait . " " Tomorrow you can take it easy . Do n't go out tomorrow and do n't drink . Let me take care of you . You are not imprisoned in a body like mine , you do n't feel the weight of your own guts pulling at your heart  --  you do n't understand that I need you . You will take care of yourself ? " Shar stared at him . There was a clumsy silence , as if Shar did not want to answer . " Yes , " he said finally . Max leaned forward in his seriousness . " You will do it for me ? You will live it for me ? You wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " Shar said . Max sighed and got to his feet . He wiped his pale forehead with a handkerchief . " Shar , I know the price you pay for your self-control , I am sensitive of your skill . I am sensitive of your being . I understand you . You can rely on me to understand you . " As if he had finished a prepared speech and was pleased with the response it got , his manner changed . He laughed , invitingMitchie to join in with him . He said confidentially , " And here I was led to believe  --  I thought  --  A breakdown of some sort  --  But you have never broken down before a race ,  |p229never  ; sometimes after a hard race , and in the winter  --  But never before . I have faith in you . " Shar exhaled smoke slowly . He watched Max with a tight , perplexed smile . Except for his eyes , which were discolored by tiny threads of blood , his emotional breakdown of a short time before was adequately disguised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitchie said in an agreeable voice . To show his concern for Shar , Max introduced him to a girl who had Max 's approval . She was a tall , slender girl whose age was a mystery  --  she might have been anything between seventeenand twenty-seven . She had fine , clear , tanned skin , an elaborate , professional-looking beauty with detailed eyes shaded with silver and cheeks touched with pink , more becoming than a contrivance of natural health . The blended pink on her cheeks made her cheekbones prominent and gave her an artificial look that seemed to please her , since she glanced often in the mirror with a satisfied expression . Her hair was silver and glowed with cleanliness ; she could not resist touchingit occasionally and Shar , entranced by her beauty , wanted to touch it too . It lifted elaborately up away from her face , caught at the back of her head in a full twist that gave her a stately appearance . Walking about the room , she was **26;4834;TOOLONG , a self-consciousness that had long ago lost concern for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was alone . " Mr. Golyrod has talked often of you , " she said . Golyrod was Max 's partner in a number of businesses . " He is very pleased with you  --  he won quite a lot of money on some race of yours , just last week ; I ca n't remember where . I am very happy to meet you . "  |p230She  had a high , confident voice . She smiled at Shar . " I am very honored to meet you too and to be told that you are interested in me , " she said . She lowered her eyes ; the silvery film on her eyelids sparkled . Shar , who was lying with his hands behind his head , watched her with a fascination that had nothing to do with his own feelings . " You are a handsome man , " she said . Her tone had no calculation or flattery in it ; she spoke very politely . " My acquaintance with Mr. Golyrod and your friend began only a few months ago and so I have never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River who did see you last year . They are very interested in you . " " Is there much money put across ? " " A great deal of money , " the girl said . She glanced in the mirror and touched her hair . " Mr. Golyrod is very interested in the race . He talks of it constantly . " She wore a summer dress of black cotton that revealed most of her smooth , carefully tanned back , and silver jewelry , and very high heels that seemed to stick slightly in the rug now and then . Shar could smell her perfume . " Of course , I have never been acquainted with an auto racer before , " she said . If there was any snobbery here Shar could not detect it . " I have known quite a large number of people in various professions and trades , but I have never known anyone connected with racing . I hope you will excuse my ignorance . " Her facial expression belied her concern : she looked perfectlycontent , modestly pleased by her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her caught her silver hair and illuminated it , so that it looked like a halo about her face . " Mr. Golyrod became very interested in a person with ash-colored hair . Do you know what that is ? A very light blond , almost with no color at all . " She spoke slowly and clearly , gazing at herself in the mirror . " When I appeared to him the next day with this color of hair he forgot about her.  |p231My  hair before this was red , but a light red , not dark ; a blondred . I think it was too bright a color for me , because with my face I like to wear full hair , and red would make that too much  --  a distraction from me . I am very pleased with this . " She turned her gaze from the mirror and looked at Shar . Her eyes were dark brown , black . She waited for Shar to say somethingand when he did not she was not discomforted , but went on easily as if she were reciting dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motel ? Do you think it compares with Mr. Golyrod 's hotel in Jasper ? Of course , this is much newer . We are very pleased with the response from the tourists  --  they seem to prefer the swimming pool to the ocean ; I think they 're absolutely right . There are strange things down on the beach , dead fish , little white fish like fingers , and jellyfish too  --  though I 've never seen any . And crabs of all kinds . In the surf little pebbles are picked up and thrown against you , and of course the water ca n't be regulated , it can be very cold even when the sun is hot . I do n't go swimming very much , though I have to sun-bathe for my skin ; I prefer to do that . Have you seen their swimming pool ? And the courtyard in the back ? The pool is shaped like a four-leaf clover and has five sections to it ; one of the sections , someone told me , is for the stem  --  the stem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend Max thought of a fountain in the middle , and of course lights are very common , beneath the water and above , for night swimming  --  it'svery beautiful . You have n't seen it at night ? This door opens out onto a little balcony and you can see the courtyardfrom there . " She indicated a door with shaded Venetian blinds , but did not offer to open it . " We are very pleased with it . The patio tables are always crowded , even in the morning . My hours are from eleven to one and there are always a great many people there , and many of the same ones . I recognize them from day to day . Of course , the most ingenious idea isp232the big glass dome so the whole courtyard can be air-conditioned . So far as we know no one else in the motel business has thought of this . " Shar sighed . The girl and her quiet , assured voice seemed to be presenting themselves in a dream . " I may have forgotten , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I know you have only been in Cherry River for a few days . My hours are from eleven to one , that 's not a good time generally , but there is competition here and favoritism , of course , and since I 'm new I ca n't expect to be put on at night ; though at night there is more to do for me in town , and I am grateful to have the opportunity to go out . But the lights in the evening are more becoming than during the day  --  I mean than the sunlight ; and so the older girls are probably better suited for that time . It 's hard to hide anything from sunlight . " Since she stood in a crisscross of sunlight from the window , she evidently meant Shar to comment on this . Shar , staring at her flawless skin , her perfect lips , felt nothing but a sense of depression . Deep in his mind , in his bowels , the familiar itching for violence began , knotted and secret . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide anything from sunlight , any kind of imperfection , " she said . " I wear two-piece bathing suits down there and of course the light is very intense and I have trouble with my back sometimes  --  not right now , but sometimes , a horrible thing  --  and wear my hair down then , loose on my shoulders ; though I ca n't do it with this color of hair and will have to have it changed back again if that should happen . It 's nothing much  --  little outbreaks , pimples , and I have been told that no one can see them , but still  --  still  --  I would not want to cheat Mr. Golyrod . " Shar lit a cigarette . " What do you do down there ? " he said . " We walk by the pool , sometimes lie by the pool , and sit at the tables , " the girl said.  | " I heard that Golyrod was a bastard , " said Shar . " And what else do you do for him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . Shar laughed , though he thought nothing was funny . The girl waited without giving the appearance of being patient , . without even seeming aware of him , except that her gaze was directed toward him . In an instant  --  it electrified him  --  Shar felt that the girl was a parody of Karen , a sinister , bloodless mockery of her beauty . " Is something wrong ? " the girl said . Shar shook his head . He smoked nervously , flicking ashes onto the thick white bedspread . " I 'm afraid I have heard that some men in your profession are susceptible to narcotics , " she said . " I think Mr. Golyrod told me . I hope that has not happened to you and that it has not troubled you in any way . " " A shot a week at the most , " said Shar . " Sometimes in the winter . It never bothered me . " " You 're very fortunate , " she said . Shar thought she was about to continue  --  her expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath and reassumed her polite half-smile . As if there were an understanding between them now , she came to Shar and sat beside him on the bed . " I am happy it has not troubled you in any way , " she said . At this close range her face was no less perfect : her skin looked poreless , smooth , a fine light gold . Shar could see that her eyes were outlined in black and shadowed with silver that was inclined to look a little greasy ; but this took nothing away from her elegance . He understood her meaning and felt oddly shocked at it , puritanically shocked , and resentful . But he was not sure he would be able to make love to her , and he could not entice himself into it . He could not translate her beauty into physical terms or into anything personal  --  he was not able to feel anything for her . What dull , throbbing unrest he felt was not for her but for someone else.  | " Sleep with me , " said Shar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . " She did not look puzzled . Her smile remained the same . " I understand , " she said . She began unbuttoning his shirt ; her hands were slender , her nails long , oval , and painted silver . She wore a ring with a jade stone on her right hand . " As I said , you are the first auto racer I 've ever met . But I am very pleased to meet you and very honored , and I hope that our acquaintancewill last . You are an important man to us . " When they were both undressed they lay in bed with a blanketover them , since the room was chilled by air conditioning . Shar put out his cigarette and turned his head away from the girl . As he fell asleep thoughts of Karen were loosed in his mind . He moaned softly  --  he could hear himself , as if from a distance  --  then he could hear only the forced silence of the air conditioner and the girl 's soft breathing . A gentle aura of perfumefollowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was throbbing . The girl was coming out of the bathroom ; she wore a white robe made of many layers of thin material . Her face was not so golden as before  --  she looked younger  --  and she walked stealthily , though she saw Shar watching her . Her hair , still drawn up about her head , was loosened and lay on her forehead and neck in tiny damp tendrils . " I 'll answer it , " she said . She went to the door and opened it slightly . Shar had not heard anyone knock . She talked briefly and closed the door again ; she smiled at Shar . " Your friend and Mr. Golyrod would like us to join them downstairs in a while . I said to tell them we would be there . I hope I said the right thing ? " Shar 's eyes were sore from the short sleep he had had . He rubbed them viciously . " Sure , " he said . Upon waking , he was assaulted by the same uneasiness and dismay that had botheredp235him before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a few minutes , but in this time had been drained of his energy . His tone did not discomfort the girl , who spoke in a high , polite voice : " I have had the pleasure of meeting your friend Max "  --  here she hesitated a little , not liking to use the man 's first name , though she did not know his last name . " I met him several months ago but since then he has been away . He is a very pleasant man and is very fond of you . He spoke then of someone  --  oneof his employees  --  and I have forgotten it now ; but I suppose he meant you . " " One of his employees ! " Shar laughed . He went into the bathroom and took a shower . The bathroomwas a marvel of white and pale , icy green : its cleanliness assaulted the eye . Shar could not see where the lighting came from ; it seemed to glow out of the ceiling , hidden behind a metal strip of hard white lace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in days he had the sense of peering anxiouslybut sanely out of a dream  --  the sense of penetrating through the haze that surrounded him . But the vision lasted only a second and it had no object  --  he saw nothing . Then the uneasy fog resettled about him . Shar heard the girl come into the bathroom and open the giganticmedicine cabinet door  --  it was a mirror that looked about nine feet square . She spoke in an even , interested voice , loud enough for him to hear : " I hope you feel rested . I think I heard from one of your friends that you were tired and anxious for the race ; I can understand how that might be . I was in some theatrical productions "  --  she lingered over the syllables of these words "  --  in high school and found myself apprehensive about them . " The effortless calm of her voice seemed to belie any apprehension , any emotion , she might claim . " I was going to be in a play in college but the role was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened about that ; I do n't ex/actly remember . You can use that white towel there if you want to . " She went out . Shar turned off the shower . When he had dried himself  --  the towel was inches thick , a dazzling , hard white  --  he looked at the steamy cabinet mirror and saw that the girl had drawn two large exotic eyes on it , complete with thick lashes , so that she could look through them at herself . When he went out the girl was sitting before the bureau , a polished , pine bureau that had the neat and impersonal look that accompanies an expensive hotel , which she had converted into a dressing table with a profusion of bottles and tubes and boxes . Everything was arranged neatly : there were no startling colors , no grotesque shapes . The girl had let down her hair , which fell below her shoulders , and was brushing it gently . Her nails gleamed silver , the same color as her hair . " I hope you can excuse me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understandthe difficulty of . . . the difficulty . . . the trouble it is when something remains between people . " Shar did not understand , but said nothing . He looked with dislike on his clothes : they were not clean , they were soiled , he did not want to put them on . The girl brushed her hair as if she were counting the strokes . " I can never be comfortable with an acquaintance when something is unsettled between us , " she went on , turning her face to one side so that she could peer critically at her throat . " You are still a stranger to me . You and I have not been close . When I was young I was warned a great deal about taking care with boys , about not being too close to them . I went to a girls ' school : the Holy Angels . Before our confirmationmy class was instructed about these things  --  about boys  --  but it was only lately , I mean only in the last two or three years , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been doing . I ca n't remember the first boy I knew that way , but I am sure we came together to get rid of thep237feeling that we were n't close  --  the way it is with you and me . " She had finished brushing her hair now and put down the brush . She lifted her hair from her shoulders and began to arrange it , slowly and carefully . Shar saw how lovingly her fingersworked the thick gleaming mass . " I can never be at ease with a man when there is something unsettled between us , " she said . " Afterward everything is all right  --  we can forget each other , or be friends , or continue that way ; what relief that is  --  It was the same when I was young . There are some people who do n't feel that way . Did you know that ? " Shar had been staring at her image in the mirror . Something about her depressed him , pricked at the secret dark swelling of his outrage . He felt no danger that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take offense at his impertinent concern ; he understood that the mirror was opaque for her , that her sight could not go past herself in it . " There are some people who do n't want to be close to everyone . They want just the opposite . I ca n't understand that . I think it would bother me to be that way . " She fastened her hair with silver pins . It balloonedup over her head in a swelling gleam , as if her head were distorted at the back ; it gave her a brittle , regal appearance . The splendor of her hair obviously pleased her , for she sat ? " she said politely . She did not look around at him . " Yes , " said Shar . " I know what you mean . " He said after a moment , " Did you ever see a man without arms or legs ? " The girl did not reply at first . When she did , she said thoughtfully , " I do n't think so . " Her expression was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white jar with a gold top and was opening it . Shar , half dressed , sat on the edge of the bed and lit a cigarette . The girl went on : " I had a dream once that a great crowd of people came to me , not only men butp238women too . I was told that it was the whole world , but they looked like Americans only  --  I mean , no foreign people or Negroes . They were all crying to me and waving their hands and I cried because I could n't get close to them ; I would never know them . Did you ever feel that way ? " " Yes , " said Shar . " Even if you do know them , one by one , you might forget some of them at the end  --  you could n't have them all at once . My best friend in high school  --  I do n't know where he is now , he got married and went in with his brother-in-law , a shoe store , I think  --  made love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean any one person , and I remember him the best , though that was a while ago . Then I got pregnant and had a very wonderful baby , but it was thought best for me to give it away and I agreed ; though it was a beautiful baby , a girl like myself . I worried at first that I would think about it , since I read in a pamphlet the organization gave me that that sometimes happened , but I did n't worry about it and it was all right . Then I thought I would get married  --  I was in college then , just a freshman , I was doing well in most of my classes but I did n't like them very much . I mean , I liked the professors , " she said , almost quickly , " they were very nice men . They were intelligent . I got married and we went to live where he was in the army and I was there for two or three months . Then I thought I would go somewhere else and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had some trouble with the army  --  some kind of trouble . I had been living in jasper about a year when I met Mr. Golyrod through a mutual acquaintance of ours . Do you know Allen Norwood in Jasper ? The Norwood Real Estate Agency ? " When Shar said no the girl did not go on , as if she had exhaustedher conversation . Shar finished dressing , sucking at his cigarette . The drone of the air conditioner was getting onp239his nerves . The girl suddenly got up , her white robe billowing around her , and went to a television set in the corner . She turned it on and went back to the dressing table . While the girl finished with her make-up and got dressed they listened to a static-marred program at which neither of them glanced . Shar lay back on the rumpled bed , smoking , while the harsh , urgentvoices from the television set mingled together , separated , were joined by music , interrupted by other voices , by bells and chimes , by flurries of static . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten about it , and they left without turning it off . They walked together down a long , carpeted hall . The girl took Shar 's arm and smiled at him . She wore a black cocktail dress that fitted her tightly about the waist and breasts , though not vulgarly , and eased out to a short , full skirt . She wore very high black heels and stockings that were tinted black , and heavy gold jewelry , several bracelets on each arm , and gold earrings that climbed up in an elaborate pattern about her ear , like tiny cobwebs . Her eyelids were tinted gold , her lashes were thick and black ; a beauty mark Shar had not noticed , near her eye , was accentuated . Her lips were outlined carefully and sharply and were full , orange-tinted , and set in a companionablesmile . Catching sight of the girl and himself in a mirror , Shar was startled to see himself with a stranger  --  he would have been perplexed to say what he was doing with her . They had dinner with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patting Shar 's arm , and with Mr. Golyrod , a small man with gold-framed glasses and a quick , nervoussmile , who was evidently pleased with the girl and with Shar , for he turned often to them and nodded . Mr. Golyrod had white hair . Also at the table were Jerry and another man , probably Mr. Golyrod 's parallel of Jerry , a fair-skinned young man with sensitive manners and very short pale-red hair . Sharp240saw that his nails were polished . Perhaps out of consideration for Shar , the talk was about motor racing : about the newest cars , about Max 's plans for a new car that winter , about Shar 's record , about the young Negro 's record , about the attendance at the new stadium , about some newspaper stories  --  Max turned to Shar and said he would show him the stories later . There was a familiar argument about the relative merits of good motors and good drivers , the conservative arguing for the driver and his experience , the liberal for the quality of the motor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shar chewed his food without tasting it . A dull , hateful pounding had begun in his head and he wanted to upset the table , to smash at the faces that surrounded him . Mr. Golyrod was in the middle of a long sentimental speech about the motel and the room they were in  --  a low-ceilinged , amber-lighted , thick-carpeted lounge in the center of which a gigantic oak tree grew unimpeded up through the glass ceiling  --  when Shar said suddenly : " If I smash up in the race and get my legs and arms amputated , I can still do racing of another kind . " They looked at him politely . Max laughed a short , wheezinglaugh , patting Shar 's arm . " He is apprehensive about his work . He shows no nerves  --  you see ? " He took hold of Shar 's hand and lifted it into the air and let go of it . " He is perfectly calm  --  a miracle . A magician , to keep himself so !  --  when any of us would turn cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such control of his heart . " Mr. Golyrod agreed . He looked at Shar with respect . A slight , paternal man with kindly eyes behind his glasses . He wore a heavy gold ring on one finger , probably connected with a secret fraternal order to which he belonged . Shar could see , as Mr. Golyrod lifted his arms and his cuffs were revealed , that he wore cuff links of small , opaque eyes , mock human eyes ,  |p241made  out of glass . Shar felt the hard knot in his bowels tighten . Max was talking on , something about " magic , " about Shar 's skill , Max 's enthusiasm and pride making him charming  --  making him seem loving , and refined by his love . Shar got to his feet . " I 'm going after some cigarettes , " he said . " Jerry will get them for you , " said Max . " Jerry knows what he can do to himself , " said Shar , and walked away . He went through to the foyer and out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights were on , playing gaudily on the boardwalk . Shar clenched his fists . He felt tears coming into his eyes . When he went outside he was startled at the difference in temperature . It was still warm outside , and humid ; he felt betrayed . Crowds passed idly , looking at the motel . Some people still wore sunglasses . Music from the boardwalk rose giddily into the air and mixed with the hot dusty wind and the smell of food and beer and salt and perspiration . Shar stared into the crowd . A few days before he had thought he had seen Karen in the crowd  --  a girl with blond hair , walking away from him ; but he had had enough sense not to go after her . His insides had burned , watching the girl . Now the crowd passed along , some turning into the motel , moving slowly , easily , sun-tanned , and evidently pleased with themselves . A few children carried red balloons that had been given away that day : they advertised one of the night clubs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appeared out of nowhere and began picking up scraps of paper and refuse that had been blown against the front of the motel . Shar saw her coming as soon as she appeared . His face went hot with blood , his ears pounded . She was half a block away  --  now hidden by some people , now in sight again  --  coming right toward him . She looked at the gigantic building as if deliberat/ing about it ; then she seemed to decide that she was in the right place . She came up the broad stone steps and was about to go into the lobby when Shar said angrily : " Karen ! " She looked around at him . Her hair was wind-blown and loose , a pale , soft gold . Her eyes took him in and absorbed him , her jaw tightened , her lips parted as if she were going to speak ; but she said nothing . They stared at each other . Shar was blinded by a wave of emotion  --  he could not tell what it was , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took hold of her arm and pulled her , clattering in her high heels , down to the walk . " I 've been waiting for you , " he said , " I 've been waiting for you , I 've been wanting this  --  I 've planned this  --  I 'll show you  --  I 'll finish it for you this time  --  this is the last time ! "  |p243As  soon as they were inside the front door of the rooming house , Shar could no longer control himself and seized Karen . They struggled together going up the steps , Shar with his arms around her and jerking her from side to side , Karen with her neck arched back , her lips tightly closed . They fell heavily against the railing and Shar heard it splinter . He was shouting at Karen : " Why did you follow me ! What do you want ! " A door opened at the foot of the steps but no one called after them.  |p244Inside  the room , Shar pushed her before him . His jaws had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen did not back away but faced him quietly , calmly ; his bitter rage seemed absorbed and defeated by her , mocked by her . " Do you want me ? " Shar said . " Is that why you followed me ? " Down on the street a horn began to blare . Shar and Karen stared at each other . Their faces were wet with perspiration : in the dim light Shar could see Karen 's eyes freeze in their serenity , as if she felt a terror too deep to acknowledge . " Karen  --  " Shar said . " Karen ! " she said . " Do you think that 's my name ? Do you think you know me ? " It was the look with which she said this , Shar remembered later , that pushed him past the brink of sanity . Her child 's face seemed to him to mock his anguish , his rage , his pride in himself , his humanity  --  his soul  --  and he understood that they were locked together , hopelessly entangled , and lost  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be free of each other . Never be free ! He heard his voice shout this at her as he took hold of her . When Shar woke it was dark in the room . He got to his feet and stumbled backward against something . There was something on the floor  --  an overturned chair . Shar went to the wall and snapped on the light . " Karen ? " he said . She was lying on the floor near the window and seemed to be looking at him ; her eyes were thin blue crescents , almost coyly turned toward him . Shar , rubbing his eyes , squatted beside her . He touched her forehead . Leaning to her , he could see that she was not looking at him . For a while Shar squatted by her , his elbows on his knees . Everything was quiet except for sounds from the boardwalk and the midway , and Shar found the silencerestful and strengthening ; his body was quieted , it sensedp245a completeness it had not known before . Shar thought back over his life  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual passage of time , claiming significance  --  and could not remember ever having felt like this . It was as if he had finished now with action  --  his life , never anything more than an accumulation of actions , was now fulfilled . But he could not understand why he felt this way . Shar caressed her shoulders and arms . Pale flesh  --  such weak flesh  --  the hint of white bones beneath it , delicate as ivory . The first time he had seen her , Shar thought , standing stiffly poised out in the road , self-conscious , petulant , spoiled , he had felt something for her , and his peace had been worried by anger . But he thought with surprise that that had not been the first time : he had known her as a child , pale-haired , with fat cheeks and dirty fingers , something to pick up and swing idly through the air . Yet her soul had peered out at him , dimpled , sly , it had calculated the distance between them  --  it had conqueredhim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bony arms , a nose that was always damp , running out to the road one night with the money his father had hidden under the pump floor boards  --  laughing at the night air , at the smell of the creek , at the stagnant world he was leaving . He had dreamed of lighting a gigantic torch and turning it upon those people  --  burning them down , burning all civilization down , all faces , eyes , upraised hands , souls of babies waiting to grow into womanhood and devour him . It was not a life dominated by fathers Shar had fled , but a life of order , of meticulous , heart-straining order !  --  in imitation of man , Shar 's father had arranged a chaos of junk into selections of junk , cardboard in one pile , metal in another , wood in still another  --  The great torch of Shar 's rage would have flared up all careful piles of junk , blended them in a single holocaust of flame . Burn down everything ! Fire everything , as the Herzes fired theirp246fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drunk with the idea of destruction as a child , until the night he ran away ; then , leaving that world of a father 's insanity and long , bone-freezing winters and mornings in school and a life of prepared poverty , he had gradually lost his rage . He had grown out of it . As an adult he was proud of his self-control : he prided himself on his lack of emotions , his failure to involvehimself seriously with anyone , his refusal to accept anything as permanent . Karen had ruined him ; she had destroyed his faith in himself . With her descent from the cold world of their childhood had come Shar 's old anger , his old desire for destruction  --  but he had felt , once alone with Karen in this room , that his passion would be ended . The insane fragments of his life would be made whole  --  cleansed through violence , a communion of pain . Under his hands Karen began to shiver . Shar went to the bed and straightened the mattress , which had slipped halfway onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her eyes open ; for an instant she seemed to see nothing , though she was looking straight at him ; then her eyes narrowed as if in fear . Shar picked her up  --  she cried out sharply , surprised with pain  --  and carried her over to the bed . " What 's wrong ? " he said . He looked at her face : it was white and a little distorted , very subtly distorted . " Are you hurt ? " He looked back to where they had been lying with a pang of guilt . He saw blood there  --  yet it was impossible that it should be blood . He went back and looked ; he bent and touched it . Wet . It was blood . " Did I hurt you ? " Shar said . He felt angry and betrayed . Karen lay very carefully on her back . She had begun to claw at the mattress covering . Shar leaned over her . " Where are you bleeding ? " he said . He saw a pitiless absorption of pain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a statue , a muted ecstasy of pain . In Karen 's look there was confusion ,  |p247shame  , fear . As he watched , she began to turn into a child again , features softening with fear , eyes filled with tears  --  a tear on her cheek , a child 's trick ! Shar wanted to seize her and shake her violently . There had always been something between them , a secrecy that kept them from each other  --  when Shar surrendered , Karen would have withdrawn ; when Karen surrendered , the nature of her surrender , mindless and even withoutpain , would have ruined Shar 's delight in her . They had moved through their months together in an elaborate dance , alwaysavoiding each other , at the same time luring and entrappingeach other , and it was with disgust that Shar realized this mockery of love had not yet come to an end . He had not yet violated Karen 's secrecy ; she had eluded him . The communionof pain to which he had forced her brutally had given Shar to her but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you bleeding ? " said Shar . No more than forty minutes later , when Max 's doctor came out to where Shar was sitting on the stairs , Shar had figured out the trouble . " A miscarriage , " said Max 's doctor , whispering ; he bent to Shar with his hands clasped together . Shar , smoking , sucked on his stub of a cigarette . Max 's doctor had been enlivened by the occasion . He had been easily available , propped up in bed in the room next to Max 's , drinking and apparently staring at the wall . When they came in Shar had noticed his toes twitching inside his brown socks , but nothing else  --  hardly a change of expression . " Not me this time , " Max had said , waving his flabby arms in a parody of despair . " You must come . Shar says  --  there is some trouble , the girl that I  --  that Shar  --  Some complications , " Max had said . " Get up , get up ! What am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? Will you lie there drinking while someoneis dying ? "  |p248Max  , white-faced , had remained at his motel . He awaited a telephone call that the doctor now went to give him . Shar flicked what was left of his cigarette down the dark stairway . " Son of a bitch , " he said . Speaking to Max , the doctor was concernedand urgent , professional , clean  --  human  --  Just as Max was refined by his love for Shar , so was the doctor refined by involvement with pain , involvement with suffering . Shar , too , was refined by love and suffering , and he understood now the strange sense of fulfillment he had felt earlier . Fulfilled ! He had been betrayed . A warning from Karen would have avoided this , but Karen had not wanted it avoided . She had demanded it ; probably it had been her own death she wanted  --  she would have pulled Shar into death with her . " Do you think you know me ? " she had said . What contempt , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , he would never know her . " Max wants to talk to you , " the doctor said quietly . He stood by the pay telephone , waiting for Shar . When Shar went to take the phone from him , he saw the man 's intelligent , nervous sympathy  --  hisdark eyes , his forehead crossed with tiny wrinkles , his sagging flesh . Until now Shar had never really looked at him . " A miscarriage is not dangerous , " he said , touching Shar 's arm . Shar turned away.  |p249The  day before the Fourth of July was bright and clear and the influx of visitors to Cherry River was so great that business was predicted to be more successful than anyone had yet imagined . Though most of the crowd would not arrive until the next day , many of the motels and boardinghouses were already filling up  --  by noon the roominghouses on a side street by the shabby part of the boardwalk were crowded , with carloads of young men and boys and occasionally high school girls and other young women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleased eyes showed they were ready to enjoy themselves . There was some trouble early in the afternoon when a group of boys battered down a wall in one of the roominghouses , stomping through to a big , disorderlyroom that five or six girls were sharing : in the goodnaturedscuffle , furniture was thrown through windows , smashing the glass and bounding to the sidewalk , someone was trapped up on the roof , and the entire length of the stairwayrailing was knocked down . Police intervened and establishedorder . Another incident took place on the beach , which was very crowded , involving some six or eight young men vacationingfrom factory jobs and some Negro beach attendants , but the cause of this scuffle was a mystery . Police , who had been alerted to look for racial trouble , were able to stop the fist fights before they involved too many people . The more luxurious side of the boardwalk was preparing itselffor the national holiday . A team of workers struggled to put up a large crepe-paper flag , accurate down to the last fivepointedstar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one side of the building to the other . Banners were strung across the busy street , flags appeared out of nowhere to decorateplate-glass windows and doors . The front of the gigantic racing stadium was a marvel of crisscrossed red , white , and blue banners that waved gaily in the breeze . On the big marquee before the central entrance a Negro was as far as the last word in INDEPENDENCE DAY RACE . Shar spent the day in his room with Karen . He had gone over to the track for a while in the morning , but had taken no interest in the car and had stared at people who spoke to him as if he did not understand their language . The mechanics muttered of his breaking down , but only to one another ; everyoneexcept Mitch avoided Shar . " Do n't you listen to none ofp251that talk they 're going to put me in instead of you , " Mitch said . " That 's crazy talk . I ai n't ready for it yet and ai n't good enough anyway , not when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it around , do n't you ? " Shar had been staring at the young man 's smooth , polite face , but he did not seem to have heard Mitch 's question . Mitch took out a folded tissue and wiped his forehead . " I ai n't slept the last two nights for thinking of it , " he confessed . " It ai n't the car that scares me , nor the track , it 's something else  --  I ai n't so sure what it is . I got to talking to Vanilla  --  youknow  --  was down at a nigger tavern last night , and he says he ai n't scairt at all ; he 's all in a sweat to get going . The last man they had at their garage got in a crash-up and lost his nerve  --  why they let Vanilla drive it , and him that young . ' Course he 's been in the pit with them for four-five years . I told him you was the same  --  I told him you knew the car frontwardsand back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it apart and put it together better than the guys that built it . I told him  --  " " I 'm going back now , " Shar said . He touched Mitch on the shoulder and turned away . Mitch , his breath ready for a long , appeasing talk , an effort to draw Shar out of his silence , stared after him . He thought secretly that Shar looked sick or shocked , that something had happened to change him inside ; but no one knew about it yet and had better not know . The difference between the Shar who had driven so skillfully a few days before in the qualifying heat and the Shar who now walked away , unaware of eyes following him , was so great that Mitch did not like to think about it . " Love always gets a man into trouble sooner or later , " one of the mechanics told him . Shar sat in an old straight-backed chair by the open window , smoking as if in a trance ; Karen lay in bed with a blanket overp252her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her something to make her sleep and she had been sleeping for some time . One arm lay outside the cover ; loose about her wrist was Shar 's wristwatch . She had awakened and in a petulant deliriumhad demanded something of Shar 's to hold so that she could sleep , and they had given her the watch , though the crystal was already cracked and the doctor was afraid she might hurt herself with it . Sometimes Karen murmured , " God , my God , " or " Shar  --  , " but she did not seem to be in pain . While Shar sat by the window and watched her , Karen was having a dream . She was running through grass , up the slope before her home to join her father ; his face when he embraced her was always rough , sometimes his arms hurt her . She was going to cry to him that it was done , everything was finished , clean , she had come home , but when he gripped her she shrank suddenly in size and the air turned hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waving her short arms and only after a minute was she given , still running in terror , to her father . She was seized by him  --  how young he was !  --  and she realized then that someone else had held her , had lifted her through the air  --  Shar  --  it must have been Shar  --  and she turned at once to see him , to see Shar as a child again . But when she turned , the dream ended ; she saw nothing . She grated her teeth in anger and dismay . " Shar ! " she whispered . She woke . She saw him sitting a few feet away . They looked at each other . Shar took his cigarette from his mouth ; his face was clean , clear in the vivid sunlight , his dark , secretive eyes were clear , turned directly upon her . He did not say anything for a while . They could hear the roaring of motors from the stadium and the clamor of sounds from the boardwalk . Finally Shar cleared his throat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a baby . We 'll have one . "  |p253He  looked at Karen , but she did not reply . They fell into silence again . Shar lit another cigarette and turned to stare out the window into the street . Some time later , when the doctor knocked and entered the room , they still had not spoken . Karen fingered the crack on the watch face , and Shar sat and smoked . The room was flooded with sunlight . The doctor 's face was freshly shaven ; he looked younger than Karen had supposed him . He smelled of soap . Shar only looked around when the doctor was closing the door behind him . He got up and stretched his legs . A lean , hard-looking man : if Karen had seen him in a crowd her instinct would have protectedher against him , turned her eyes safely away . " A hell of a world , " Shar said suddenly and self-consciously , " but at least it 's my own fault . " He laughed and looked at Karen , who stared at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed knowledge of betrayal . He went back to the corner and sat heavily in his chair . They did not speak again for hours . Karen slept a little , but her sleep was transparent ; in the corner of her mind Shar kept his forlorn vigil . He got up and went out once , and Karen heard voices in the hall . He talked there with someone for a while , then he came back , and footsteps  --  it sounded as if there were two people  --  sounded on the stairway . He went to the window and leaned out , sniffing at the wind . Karen saw how his fine black hair was touched and burned by sunlight . When the doctor brought food for Karen to eat she withdrewinto herself and did not answer . The man 's face bobbed before her , he spoke earnestly , he touched her limp arm . Karen shrank away . When she opened her eyes he had left . Shar wanderedaround the room , still smoking , eating a candy bar . The wrapper was a waxy blue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through her lashes . She sawp254him with wonder . Her heart went out to him , she felt shame for her emotion . I ca n't help it if I have fallen in love , she thought defensively . But the warm dark wall of sleep protected her from Shar 's eyes , and he could not know what she felt . The afternoon sun shrank away from them ; shadows touched the wall . Karen saw at the top of the old-fashioned window behind Shar a row of flowerlike designs , delicate and crystalline , tinted pink . There were thin petals , lined with veins , and tiny stems and leaves . In the waning light they were rigid , cold , as though frozen in astonishment , in regret , at never having lived . She woke when the door opened and someone came into the room . One of the men was Shar , she thought , and the other  --  maybe  --  Max ; but she did not look up . She feigned sleep . After a few minutes of whispering , the other man went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen heard the stairs sag and creak and supposed that it had been Max . It was dark now , and the only light came from the window : the sky was a vivid , glaring blue . Shar walked restlessly around the room for a while , then he went to sit again in the chair . Karen could hear him breathe . He looked toward her . " Are you awake ? " he said . When she did not answer , he settled back again and lit another cigarette . He tossed the match out the window . " I want to marry you , " he said . His voice was cold and angry . " I do n't want you to go back there . You 're not going back there . You 're staying with me . " He did not move for a while . Karen must have slept again , for when she woke  --  her body was throbbing with pain now  --  Shar had come to the bed and was kicking off his shoes . He lay down beside her , his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all right , " Shar said . " Go back to sleep . " When she woke again , it was close to sunrise . The window was glaring with a cold , restrained light ; the tiny flowersp255etched in the glass bordering the top were frigid . Against the white sky their pinkness seemed touched by blood . Beside her , Shar slept with his head turned toward her , his mouth open . He had not shaven for some time and his face looked rough . He was still dressed and had taken off only his shoes  --  he had on white , soiled socks . His toes twitched now and then as he slept . Near his left eye was a small white scar she had noticed many times before . " A stone one of your goddambrothers threw , " Shar had said , touching the mark and rubbing it . His forehead was touched by faint lines . His nose was straight and slender . His eyes , beneath the thin lids , seemed trembling , blinking . Once he moaned softly and seemed about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved hesitantly against nothing . When he did wake , hours later , he got up and went into the bathroom . Karen heard the shower . He came out and squatted to take something out of his suitcase , which was set on the floor . Straightening , he got dressed . The room was still cold from the night before ; Karen , watching Shar , began to shiver . He turned as if she had called him . " Are you awake already ? " he said . " How do you feel ? " He did not seem to expect any answer . His fingers slowed and fumbled with the buttons of his shirt . While the doctor was with Karen for an hour or so that morning , Shar went out . He and the doctor did not speak , nor did he speak to Karen . Karen drank something the doctor gave her and accepted some pills . " I do n't have any pain , " she said . " It 's all over . " " It 's all over , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic outside . Horns sounded from a distance , and there were voices , music , firecrackers . The boardinghousemust have been emptied and rented by Max , because there were no sounds in it anywhere . When Shar came back , he found Karen sitting up in bed against the pillows Max 's doctorp256had arranged for her . " How do you feel ? " Shar said . Karen nodded slightly . " He wanted to send a girl over here to stay with you while the race was on , but I told him no . I said you 'd be all right . The house is taken care of and he 's got a guy downstairs watching it  --  You 'll be all right . Or would you rather have someone to stay with you ? " " No , " said Karen . He was encouraged by her answer . He sat on the bed beside her . " It was a hell of a long day , " he said . He touched her shoulderbut seemed to forget what he was going to say . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretending to yawn , he stretched his arms , made his arms go hard with muscle , and said suddenly : " After the race we 'll pull out of here . You 'll be all right if we drive slow . I 'll take care of you . Then when you get strong we can  --  we can  --  " Karen 's silence slowed his words . She saw his mind racing behind his eyes , racing to rearrange itself , to understand what was happening to him . " I want you with me , " Shar said . He fumbled for a cigarette and matches . " I do n't want you to go back . You are n't going to go back ? " He lit his cigarette and shook out the match . Karen saw that his face was clean , savagely pale about his nose , and that he had nicked himself shaving by his ear . Tiny ridges of blood had hardened there . " You are n't going to go back , " he said . " What do you want me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the window . Behind them the sky glared , vivid with heat , but they were poised in the same brittle tense designs : staring at them Karen felt her heart begin to pound , slowly and gravely and yet with a pleasant nervous anticipation , as if her entire life had led her irreparably to this moment . " What do you want me to do ? " Shar said . With the knowledge of his love , she faced him as if in thatp257instant she had somehow forgotten about him  --  Shar with his suspicious narrowing eyes , the tiny lines on his forehead that would soon turn to creases if he lived to be as old as her father . He had been a stranger and now he was familiar to her ; she could not have said precisely when this had happened . The finicking nervous strength suggested in his fingers had been transmitted to her . She felt , gazing at him with the mild unhurriedlook of the possessor , that her tingling fingers would have been capable of touching him , fumbling against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pumping heart . Yet she wanted at the same time to embrace him , simply and utterly , as she had imagined she would someday . . . . But she said in the calm , ordinary voice she had despised so in her sister , " You make me sick . " Shar 's eyes narrowed . Perhaps he did not believe what he had heard . He exhaled smoke and cleared his throat ; for an instant he looked very young . Karen saw his boy 's face in that moment  --  a face within this face , something summoned up out of her own shadowy childhood to appeal to her . Shar 's gaze dropped . " Then what do you want the to do ? " he said . For a minute at least he seemed not to know . His mind must have flinched before the idea  --  his lips curled up suddenly in a grimace , showing his teeth , as they had from time to time when the knife he carried inside him lurched against his delicate organs . Then he relaxed . His shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he hid against the side of her head , the exhausted , betrayed look he had always kept from her . He was old and yet he was a face from her childhood  --  strange , fragile man , who had disguised for so long his secret wound ! She leaned forward , as if to penetrate his flesh , to see the stubborn hard skull beneath it . But if he dies , she thought , then I will die too . If he dies , everyone will die . No one will survive . As if prodded by her thoughts , embarrassed by them , Shar began top258speak . His words seemed to come from nowhere . He might have felt the necessity of violating their silence without knowing how to do it . " Well , " he said , " I 've done a lot of driving . I 've been at it a long time . " He turned away and picked tobacco off his tongue . " I 've been a lot of places . . . . There were other ones I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . I measure out how old I am on the beginning of each year , " he said with the slow , modest air of one admitting a secret , " since he never told me when my birthday was . Each January there 's one more . And here I am , almost thirty-one , a half year from thirty-one , and I always said I would never live to be thirty , even ; I would never want to . And I knew I would never live to be thirty-one . " After he had left the room and was on the stairs , Karen put her hands to her burning face . She heard his footsteps . Without him there to keep her still she felt suddenly wild , lost , terrified  --  she did not know what she would do . She started to get out of bed , then stopped . " Shar , " she said . Was it possible that he would really leave her here , sick as she was , so far from home ? She wanted him back , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of bed , swaying , and went to the door . He was at the bottom of the stairs . She opened the door , her blood pounding so furiously that she could not see , and listened to his footsteps as if fascinated by them . Her vision cleared . She was staring across the corridor at something  --  it drew her gaze to it like a magnet . A fat cockroach crawling precariously up the wall , its delicate little legs visible at even that distance . Karen 's lips parted as if in awe . Her mind was emptied , her thoughts were sucked out from her . She did nothing . She did not call after Shar , nor did she look down the stairway after him . After a moment she realized that she was listening to nothing , that he had left.
