Some three or four years ago , the city of Newburgh , New York , put welfare programs in the headlines . Since then there has been considerable discussion of the spiritual , social , and moral condition of welfare clients . But I have seen no reports on the more mundane aspects of the welfare life ? or at least none that supplied me with a satisfactory answer to a simple , fundamental question : How much does a hungry family need in order to eat decently ? I decided to find out for myself by living for thirty-one days on what the District of Columbia gives a single adult in surplus food and relief money each month . My experiment was not designed to prove anyone right or wrong , but merely to test for myself how a relief recipient eats on what he is given . ( Incidentally , I happened to pick a season when fruits and vegetables were at their most expensive . ) From the start , I had a great many advantages which the average adult on welfare can not claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to eat any kind of food . I have no children at home pleading for ice cream and candy , and I do not have to borrow from the food money when the landlord hammers on the door for the rent . My kitchen is equipped with a variety of modern utensils and a good stove with an oven that works . I have all the recipes I need , plus a Fannie Farmer cookbook ? which costs $5.95 ? and a fair understandingof proper nutrition . Also , I 've been cooking for a long time . Tn Washington , D. C. , a single adult on relief gets 35.8 pounds of surplus food the first month , nothing the second month , and 27.8 pounds the third month ; then the cycle repeats . For my one-month experiment , I halved the first allotment . This meant I could use : Because it was often rejected , cornmeal is no longer distributed by Washington 's Department of Public Welfare . I included it , however , because I wished to show its many uses and its value in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broome , Jr . of the Surplus Food Division of the Department of Public Welfare gave invaluable assistance in figuring out how best to approximate the surplus food allotment . ( Obviously , I was n't eligible to receive the food from the government , and of course it is not for sale . ) The only item / could not quite match was dried milk ; the Department of Agriculture 's kind , which is processed rapidly and cheaply over high heat , is much harder to dissolve than the retail product , which I used . My cash budget for the month was the $25 that a single adult on welfare gets in Was 140 EATING LOW ON THE HOG ington , D. C. , and I did not buy anything but food with this money , although relief recipients must spend some for cigarettes , paper napkins , toothpaste , and so on . What follows is my day-by-day record of the experiment . March 4 : Starting with a bare cupboard , I went shopping . Besides the surplus-food equivalents , I bought the following : Total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread and , thank heaven , it turned out well . Using the recipe from the Department of Agriculture 's Family Meals at Low Cost ( using lard and dried milk ) and leaning heavily on Fannie Farmer 's instructions . I kneaded and " rested " the dough . and raised it and punched it down and used just about every bowl and spoon in the kitchen , but it was quite worth it ? the bread emerged golden brown and crusty and tasted delicious . March 6 : This morning and throughout the thirty-one days , I breakfasted as usual on coffee and orange juice but after a few days I needed to add toast with honey , jelly , or marmalade . The orange juice was the only frozen product that I bought , thinking that anyone with a refrigerator could store it on top of the ice cubes . Went to market again ? found Friday 's prices lower . ( Is this always so ? ) Bought : and paid $1.64 , bringing the total up to $6.69 spent and leaving me with $18.31 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a friend who commented on my purchases , particularly the bag of bones . Made a terrific kettle of soup with said bones , a good starter for the project . March 7 : Made Boston baked beans and also cornmeal mix , which can be stored for as long Mrs. Spalding , a transplanted Bostonian , has done volunteer work since the age of sixteen , with children , in hospitals , settlement houses , and community organizations . Now in Washington . D.C. , she is chairman of the Welfare Department 's Public Welfare Advisory Council . as a month . By adding a beaten egg and wati I will be able to make corn bread quickly .

March 11 : The extra pound is gone . Made salad dressing ? excellent , as did not economize on oil ( imported olive oil , small bottle ) and used red wine vinegar . A little goes a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . March 12 : By saving tiny leftovers , I find I can add great variety to my meals ; baked beans gave an entirely different flavor to the soup ( originally made a week ago , and used many times ) . Have been using a blender too ? though this is hardly available to a family on relief ; obviously you can get more mileage out of soup this way . Made corn bread ? rather indifferent , and very inferior to the wheat bread . This marks the end of the first week . Have 818 left until the end of the month . Tomorrow I go shopping again ? exciting . The surplus-food supplies are all holding out well , and of the rest , only the orange juice is nearly finished . March 13 ( Friday ) : Instead of shopping around , I go to a nearby branch of a big supermarket chain ; thus I buy foods which are available to all throughout the city . Since last Friday , have spent only 31 cents , on three apples , one egg , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's purchases even 144 EATING LOW ON THE HOG longer . This is bad , in a way , since I will miss the weekend specials . A week is a good planning interval ; you save time and money , and guard against spoilage . This is what I bought today : Then , at the fishmarket , bought a little sea bass for 45 cents ; had it filleted , but took head , tail , bones , and all home . Now have $14.16 left out of $25 . Dinner tonight was really good : fried bass , sweet potato , and raw spinach salad . March 14 : I make only half of the frozen orange juice at a time . It lasts four days and keeps fresh . Tonight I had fish chowder , but without potatoes . It was really gourmet . Here is the recipe : Fry small amount of diced salt pork ; remove pork bits and fry onions in fat until golden , with salt , pepper , and pinch of oregano . Boil fish ( bones , head , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then fish water . When the mixture thickens , add milk and any pieces of fish you can find ( in this case , few ) . Sprinkle the bits of salt pork on top of the chowder . The oregano is making all the difference now . It is " leaf " oregano , by the way , with more flavor than ground . March 1.5 ( Sunday ) : I am still losing weight . Will start eating toast and honey with my afternoon tea , as I do get abnormally hungry , and earlier than usual , for dinner . The score is now minus 21/2 pounds . The prunes are good and have a bit of lemon in them . March 16 : Carrots at 15 cents for two bunches are a wonderful buy and they go a long way . Today , made carrot soup for a change . Recipe : Boil carrots , celery plus leaves , few cabbage leaves in water with two consomme " cubes . Fry onion golden with pinch of oregano , salt , and pepper ; dredge with flour ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables in blender and add milk to taste . March 17 : Weight leveling off . Feel satisfied and not either stuffed or starved . Lunch is always simple and very quickly got ? usually a toasted sandwich and fruit , or soup made from leftovers . With all my welfare work , I am rushed in the middle of the day , and T have n't much time to get dinner either . I tryto make preparations aheld of time and set aside one whole morning or afternoon a week to do some real cooking , usually on Saturday or Sunday . Making bread , for instance , takes almost five hours . March 18 : Constructed a meat loaf out of leftovers , binding it with the last of the corn bread and using both hamburger and pork ( surplus meat ) as well as some very finely diced celery and carrots . Catsup helped ! Have spent $10.94 , and have , therefore , $14.06 left . I miss cream hi my coffee and also lettuce and watercress and a piece of good meat . March 20 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Weight is still going down . I 've lost five pounds now . This is not because I do n't have plenty to eat . Shopping day ! How I look forward to Friday and the excitement of going marketing . I plot and plan for hours and read the food ads in Thursday 's paper . Today 's list included : Total ( with tax ) : $2.83 . Heavy on vegetables , but I get raw things , greens with the soup kettle . Am now left with $11.23 but with food enough for at least a week , My affluence has led me to purchase a small bottle of Blonde Dubonnet , worth 69 cents ! March 21 : Made Boston brown bread ( Fannie Farmer ) . Here is a recipe that every low-income family should have . Easy to put together , it is steamed ( I used a tin can ) on top of the stove . Another argument for distribution of surplus cornmeal . March 22 : What luck ! There is enough liver in my chicken to make a meal of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meals are beginning to look up . Roast stuffed chicken with gravy , for instance . The stuffing was made with bread , crackers , onions , oregano , and prunes . And beet salad , which I love . Today , the nutritionist from the Department of Public Welfare spent two hours going over my books . She says that my diet is very well balanced , but shakes her head at the idea of getting relief recipients to eat raw spinach . It is a great problem trying to wean people away from 146 EATING LOW ON THE HOG their usual diet , and particularly from sugar and starches ? which fill the belly but lead to obesity and lack of energy . Immigrants have a doubly hard time , since their traditional dishes often can not be made from surplus and bargain-priced American foods . The nutritionist made me throw away the last of my hamburger , which had gone bad . This is the first thing that I have thrown out . March 24 : Ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch . Survived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have too much in the house which might spoil . Have bought some eggs and a quarter of a pound of tea . $9.18 left for the remaining ten days . I drink a great deal of tea between meals ? also accept both tea and coffee ( plain ) ? and only these ? outside . As I offer same to guests here , it cancels out on the books . I now find this project getting on my nerves , especially using the stove at the same time the family 's dinner is being prepared . Many families on relief share kitchen privileges and must find it as trying as I do . To be fair to the experiment , I feel constrained to eat at regular hours and also to serve myself plausible meals and not give way to temperament ! March 27 ( beginning of fourth week ) : I regret very few purchases . There is quite a bit of repetition , particularly for lunch , but I 've also concocted many different dishes from the same ingredients . I will have had at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones ? all of them ? for the soup pot . March 28 : Went shopping and bought one half-pint cream , cabbage , two pounds apples , split peas . Total ( with tax one cent ) : 92 cents . Subtracting 8 cents for a cake of yeast , I 'm left with $8.18 . March 29 ( Easter Sunday ) : Today we had a very special birthday at our house . In honor of it , I polished off my Dubonnet , and accepted a piece of birthday cake , a mocha layer . Spent the whole afternoon in the kitchen , alone , thank God , and without the usual weekday interruptions . Made what is by far my most beautiful loaf of bread , soup from the chicken carcass and vegetables , applesauce , salad dressing , and tole slaw . Having all this ready gives me a good leg up on the week ahead . My surplus supplies are now getting very low . Have almost no flour left ( five pounds is not enough when all breadstuffs depend on it ) . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more than a cup of dried milk to make a quart of liquid . Catsup , oil , and molasses are all running low , and only two or three crackers are left . These are very important for a quick snack . Also think I should be drinking more milk with meals . Doing very well with the butter , to my surprise , and with the lard , the cheese , the beans , and , God knows , the peanut butter ! March 510 : Cold cornmeal mush , dipped in flour , and fried in lard , is very good indeed . The cornmeal continues to be invaluable . I have also used it for corn bread , corn crisps , Boston brown bread , and fried fish . Both Indian pudding and pancakes can be made from it too . April 1 : Today I bought one small box baking soda , two oranges , one can cinnamon , one can tuna fish . Total ( with tax ) : 65 cents . Also spent 15 cents for 3 eggs . Now have $7.38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Made orange marmalade , using one orange . Got almost half a jar ? turned out beautifully . Went shopping again , and came home with : stew beef at 65 ( ' , cost 9W : Total ( with tax ) : $2.41 . This leaves a balance of $4.97 but I shall not have to buy anything more and , moreover , expect to have quite a bit of food left . My weight is now at four pounds under correct . Having no ham bone , I used a piece of Spam to make split pea soup . A wonderfully welcome change in soups , and very tilling . Good to eat lettuce again , even though it 's romaine . April 4 ( the next to last day of the experi-ment ) : So far , I have thrown out nothing except the spoiled hamburger . Today , this frugality led to two dishes , one of them good . From the orange peel of the second orange ( juice used to make Jello ) , I made candied orange peel . This , I recollect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using a quarter of a cup of sugar and the undiscarded peel , I made a nice amount for a few cents . The second dish was a soup made from the last of the chicken stock , the vegetable juice , and the leftover spaghetti . It was vile . The stew , though , was another matter . This I must describe at length because , for very little money , it is a dish for kings . Dredge the stew beef in flour seasoned with salt , pepper , 147 EATING LOW ON THE HOG oregano , and sear it properly in a little lard over high heat . Now is the time to add sliced onion , and then add , not water , but stock ( made out of bouillon cubes if necessary ) ? it makes a difference in the richness . Add carrots , celery with leaves , and go a little mad with seasonings such as catsup and soy sauce . Reduce heat and cook slowly for from two to three hours , adding water if you must . The meat should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch the number of meals ? serve with rice , potatoes , etc . April 5 ( Sunday ) : Made dumplings and cooked them on top of the stew . They are easy ? a little flour , baking powder , salt , sugar , milk . Flavor of stew even better on second day . I had no appetite for the last meal in the project ; just applesauce and tea for supper . Taking stock , I find I have enough food left for about two days , plus a good many staples and seasonings . These remaining supplies , obviously , would have made the following weeks less difficult for me . Probably , for one thing , I could have bought more meat ; I do n't think I got nearly enough during the first month . And , of course , I could have drawn on new first-hand knowledge of food planning , buying , cooking , and conserving . My kitchen facilities and utensils , as well as my understanding of the principles of nutrition , would have continued , I 'm sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Departments of Public Welfare offer adequate instruction on nutritional requirements and see to it that families on relief have the equipment necessary to fulfill them ? ) But if living on relief would have been easier the second month , it would still not have been easy . I know now that it involves painstaking figuring and probably great persuasive force as well ( getting my family to eat peculiar leftovers for lunch and dinner would have been quite a job ) . The United States seems hardly to be guilty of pampering its relief recipients , and although I survived my r onth on welfare rations , I was delighted when it ended . For me , it was an experiment and it 's over . For too many others , it . is a continuing way of life .
