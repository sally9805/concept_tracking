PLOESTI ( 407 pp. ) - James Dugan &; Carroll Stewart - Random House ( $6.95 ) . <P> <P> A naked woman flashed on a motion-picture screen set up at an Army Air Forces base in the Libyan desert near Bengasi one baking July day in 1943 . The assembled pilots , navigators , bombardiers and gunners roared their approval . Offscreen an announcer 's voice intoned that the assembled airmen were about to strike a virgin target . Its name : Ploesti . <P> Set in the foothills of Rumania 's Transylvanian Alps 35 miles from Bucharest , Ploesti was called by Winston Churchill " the taproot of German might . " From its oil refineries came one-third of the aviation gasoline , benzine and lubricants that kept Adolf Hitler 's military machine running . To protect Ploesti from air at tack , the Germans had made it into a colossal land battleship . A ring of heavy antiaircraft guns formed a perimeter around the refineries that circled the city ; lighter flak guns were concealed in hay stacks and groves , mounted on factories , bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crack Luftwaffe squadrons , aided by Rumanian and Bulgarian air force units , gave Ploesti an aerial umbrella . <P> Heroic Snafu . To smash Festung Ploesti , U.S. air planners came up with a novel plan : a daring low-level attack that completely violated the high-level strategic bombing canons of most top Air Forces brass . The planners reasoned that a rooftop raid would give the striking B-24 Liberators an element of surprise , limit the effectiveness of the Luftwaffe , and throw off the accuracy of flak gunners primed for high-level raiders . How they miscalculated is the core of Authors Dugan and Stewart 's taut and gripping tale of a disastrous yet heroic snafu - pieced together from letters , diaries , interviews and correspondence with U.S. , German , and Rumanian survivors of the Aug. 1 , 1943 raid . <P> Many of the crewmen were nowhere near so sanguine as their leaders that they would make the full 2,300-mile , 16-hour round trip . Passed from hand to hand were a flood of paperback books about British escapes from World War I German prison camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his foot ; he was convinced that there would be enough shot-down U.S. flyers wandering around the Rumanian countryside " to call a general election , vote the Germans out , and make peace with the Allies . " <P> Almost from takeoff . Operation Tidal Wave lost the necessary ingredient of surprise ; the Germans had cracked the Allied code and tracked the planes all the way to the target . Over the Mediterranean , the lead Liberator carrying the mission navigator suddenly staggered out of formation and crashed into the ocean . It was a disastrous mishap : hours later the lead wave took a wrong heading just short of the target , and Operation Tidal Wave began to disintegrate into chaos .
