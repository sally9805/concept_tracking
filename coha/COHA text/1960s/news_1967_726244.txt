txt Maims Tribune Press twice Washington , April 9.  - -  A panel of experts today said that the probable cause of the fire which killed three Apollo astronauts last Jan. 27 was a spark from an electric wire . The eight man panel added , however , that the exact cause of the fire " most likely will never be positively identified . " The panel also strongly criticized the organizations responsible for running the test which resulted in the fire " for failing to identify it as being hazardous " and not making contingency preparations for " escape or rescue of the crew . " Die in Ground Test The three astronauts , Virgil Gus Grissom , Edward H. White , and Roger B. Chaffee , died during a ground test at Cape Kennedy of the Apollo capsule they were scheduled to ride into space the following month . It would have been the first manned flight of the Apollo ship which is designed to put Americans on the moon . The panel said the fire probably started in the lower left equipment bay of the spacecraft from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rubbed bare , coming into contact with , or near , a metal surface . Rules Out Static The panel ruled out static , spontaneous combustion , heat caused by friction , or a spark caused by metal ' striking meta as probable causes of the fire . It also said it found no evidence to suggest sabotage . In criticizing the organizations running the test , the National Aeronautics and Space ? administration and the North ' American , Aviation company , builder of the spacecraft , the panel said no procedures had ' been laid down for getting the astronauts out of the spacecraft in a hurry . It also scored them for fairing to have emergency fire , rescue , and medical teams in attendance during t h e test , which was a simulated ' countdown for the upcoming launch . It also said the fact that the spacecraft contained " many types and classes of combustible material in areas contiguous to possible ignition sources , combined with the 100 per cent oxygen atmosphere within the spacecraft , " made the test conditions " extremely hazardous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future the amount and location of combustible material in the spacecraft " must be seriously restricted and controled , " It also recommended ' that : The time required for crew members to get out of an Apollo capsule be reduced and " operations necessary for egress be simplified . " Studies be made of using a two-gas system in the spacecraft instead of a pure oxygen system . A review be made of the design of soldered joints used- in the spacecraft 's cooling system . Finds- Pipes Ruptured ! Coolant leaking from ruptured pipes fed the fire and added to its intensity , the nom found . In summarizing its findings , the board said the conditions which led to the fire were : " A sealed cabin pressurized with an oxygen atmosphere ; an extensive distribution of combustible materials in the cabin ; vulnerable wiring carrying spacecraft power ; vulnerable plumbing carrying a combustible and corrosive coolant ; inadequate provisions for the crew to escape , and inadequate provisions for rescue or medical assistance . " Release Official Transcript The board also made public for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled unsuccessfully to get out of the blazing spacecraft . It said the first sign that something was wrong came at 5:31:04 p. m . Chicago time when one of the astronauts said either " Hey " or " Fire . " It added that the transmission was garbled and that the investigators disagreed on just what the exclamation was . About two seconds later one of the astronauts , believed to have been Chaffee , said , " . . . got a fire in the cockpit . " The beginning of the transmission was garbled , but the investigators believe it was either " I " or " we . " Another six seconds passed before anything more was heard from the astronauts . Then came what the board said appeared to be three separate phrases . They were : " They 're fighting a bad fire . Let 's get out , .. . Open ' er up . " " We 've got a bad fire . Let 's get out . . . We 're burning up . " " I 'm reporting a bad fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that came a cry of pain , the board said . It was the last thing heard from the astronauts.
