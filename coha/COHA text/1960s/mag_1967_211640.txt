With a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonino , spring with all its fads , fancies and general nuttiness arrives , and of general folly there is no end . <P> All over the world , for instance , the new bestseller is suddenly Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung , which JAMES F. COYNE comes encased in red plastic with a red-ribbon marker . At Berke ley , it is treated like an amulet by the Black Muslims ; at Columbia , it is outselling everything since Henry Miller ; and Bren-tano 's at the Pentagon has already unloaded 1,000 copies at $1 each . A few of the buyers may be genuine sinologists , but for the vast majority it is the new camp classic . <P> Harvard students are now exhorting one another with such Maoisms as " What we need is an enthusiastic but calm state of mind and intense but orderly work , " in Great Britain , sassy teenagers have taken to Maothing retorts to teachers who rebuke them , and Carnaby Street regulars have begun wearing $22.40 Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as popular as old Confucius-say .

" Getting the Message . Women , after years of going hatless , are now covering up again . At the moment , the vogue for hats is running strongest in Paris , where the noctambules show up at La Coupole in Montparnasse wearing floppy Garbo-style fedoras , gaucho hats with chin straps , and overgrown newsboy caps . One reason that hats are back on top is that there is suddenly much less hair underneath . Short hair cuts , among them what Parisians call le Farrow and I'Artichaut , are replacing the elaborate bouffant hairdos that made hats hard to wear . Paris ' Alexandre has already shorn Elizabeth Taylor , Queen Sirikit of Thailand , Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine . And while Elsa Martinelli , Sophia Loren and Jean Shrimpton have so far resisted the shears , they are all tucking their hair under short wigs to achieve a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the architect of Jackie Kennedy 's bouffant extravaganzas , has switched to the short crop .
