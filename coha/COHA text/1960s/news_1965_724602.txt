txt Governor Rockefeller 's proposal that the state buy the financially distressed Long Island Rail Road if a " reasonable price " could be agreed on drew considerable support yesterday . But some officials balked at important aspects of the plan . Among the issues that gen- ' erated debate were what might be a " reasonable price , " the method of payment and provisions for significant annual contributions by Nassau and Suffolk Counties . Comihuters using another line , the New York Central Railroad , were informed yesterday that the management had asked the Public Service Commission to approve fare increases that would average 4.4 Iper cent of monthly tickets . The increases would be applied from New York to Poughkeepsie on the Hudson Division and to Pawling on the Harlem Division . They would go into effect on tickets put on sale April 21 for May commutations , unless blocked by the Public Service Commission . Zatetakl Backs Plan The railroad said that recent wage increases were the cause of the petition to raise fares . The Central estimates the new fares would add $1.398 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the Democratic-controlled State Senate , strongly approved the broad outlines of the Governor 's plans for the Long Island , He questioned , however , the need to pay for the commuter line from tax dollars , suggesting instead that it be financed from opertti revenues . Senator Earl W. Brydges , minority leader of the State Senate , said : " We 've got to do almost any . thing within reason to keep the Long Island operating . And it begins to look as though this is the only thing we can do . " Nickerson Opposes Increase Mr. Zaretzki , who is from Manhattan , seemed to be more worried about the willingness of upstate taxpayers to help pay for Long Island commuting than the Republican leader , who is from Niagara Falls . The Democratic County Executive of Nassau , Eugene N. Nickerson , strongly opposed the provision that his county increase its contribution to maintain rail stations . His counterpart in Suffolk County , H. Lee Dennison , also a Democrat , said he was against any subsidies from either county because he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also would be asked to increase its annual contribution to the Long Island . Reaction from city officials was not immediately available . The blueprint for taking over the Long Island , the largest commuter railroad in the country , was worked out by a special five-man committee named by the Governor last fall . Its chairman was William J. Ro- nan , the , ' Governor 's secretary .. The plan vas made public Thursday and the Governor announced he would embody it in a special message to the Legislature . ? In addition to calling for purchase of the- Long Island from the Pennsylvania Railroad , which does not operate it , the scheme proposes that a metropolitan commuter transportation authority be set up to Operate the railroad or contract to have It run by a private company and that the authority undertake a $200-million program of modernization . The five-man committee expressed the view that , the authority " could assume other commuter activities throughout the New . York State portion of the metropolitan area ! ' That might include " arrangements with transportation authorities in neighboring states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronan was asked how that might affect the New Haven Railroad , which has announced plans for harp curtailment of commuter service . He said it certainly left the door . open to participating in any rescue operations for the New Haven . He explained , how- , ever , ? that the committee had not " addressed itself to the New Haven problem . " Mr. Zaretzki expressed deep concern about the New Haven . He forecast that the Senate would vote approval on Monday of a deficiency appropriation of $5 million for . purchase of new railroad cars . He said the original bill would be amended to make the sum contingent on an equal amount from Connecticut and $10 million in matching funds from the Federal Government . As for the Long Island plan , Mr. Zaretzki 's main objection seemed to be over the proposal to buy the road , outright with tax money . Mr. Rockefeller had said in announcing the plan that the ' funds could be appropriated in the state 's expense budget without a bond issue , whereas the proposed authority would issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds would be paid for out of operating income . " If fares will meet the $200-million figure , " Mr. , Zaretzki asked , " I do not see why ' they would not meet a figure , of $225 million . " That assumed a purchase price of about $25 million , although Mr. Dennison said he understood the Pennsylvania 's asking price was about $116 million . Most observers thought that was far too high to be classed as a " reasonable price , " but few could suggest. ? what standards might be applied . The Long Island , which ' carries 260,000 ? passengers daily , was set up . by legislation in August , 1954 , as a Railroad Redevelopment Corporation for a 12-year period . Up to then , it had gone through a five-and-ahalf year period of bankruptcy ' and deterioration that involved it in two wrecks killing 109 persons . During the redevelopment period , which ends in August , 1966 , the Pennsylvania agreed to waive any return on its $120-million investment and annual payments of $2,092,000 on funded debt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by state , county and local governments . The railroad also was given authority to raise fares if necessary , and it has done so six times .
