txt Arrangements for a billion-dollar line of credit for Italy were completed today by the United States and a number of European banks . The credit was provided to help Italy cope with a huge deficit in her balance of international payments . It was also aimed at stopping a heavy attack on the lira that had developed in the foreign exchange markets in the last ; few days . The existence of the credal should provide reassurance that the lira can be held and will note be devalued . This would stop ; the speculative attack . A similar credit to Canada in 19621 stopped an attack on the Ca-I nadian dollar . Reserves Dwindling Italy still has sizable reserves of gold and dollars , above $2.5 billion , but they have been dwindling rapidly in the last few months . The loss in February was $180 million . This loss was a key factor in bringing on the selling ? wave against the lira , which in turn increases the foreign exchange losses . The main elements in the billion-dollar credit involve the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States officials and Guido Carli , 1 Governor of the Bank of Italy . ' About $550 million of the new credit will be in the form of " swap " agreements between the Bank of Italy on the one hand and the United States Treasury and European central banks on the other . These al- low the Italians to draw dollar ; marks , francs and other currencies as needed , with repayment normally due in six months . The new swap line of credit with the United States Treasury , whose exact amount was not announced , supplements an existing swap line with the Federal Reserve of $250 million . There were two other main items in the United States part of the package . The Export-Import Bank Opened a stand-by credit of $200 million that Italy can draw upon at any time to bolster her reserves . Terms on Food Imports The Agriculture Department , through the Commodity Credit Corporation , authorized Italy to pay on three-year terms for her imports of farm products from the United States this year . This credit could run as high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can draw at any time up to $225 million from the International Monetary Fund with no questions asked . This is Italy 's automatic drawing right , represented by one-fourth of her quota , the so-called gold tranche , plug the amount of lira previously drawn from the fund by other borrowers . Besides the credits announced today , Italy can expect further help from the United States , essentially in the form of repayment of previous United States borrowings from Italy . These took the form of the sale to Italy by the United States Treasury of short-term bonds denominated in lira , about 150 million of which are still outstanding . The Treasury can be expected to purchase lira for dollars from time to time in order to repay these bonds at maturity . Rome Attacks Inflation The whole package , as was announced today in Rome , was designed to handle Italy 's problem for 1964 , while a series of measures recently adopted by the Government take effect . These are mainly designed to check Italy 's internal inflation , the main cause of her balanceof-payments deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , restrictions on installment credit and a general tight-money policy by the Bank of Italy . While checking inflation , the measures will probably also slow down the economic boom , but this is a price the Government is prepared to pay . The purpose of the United States and the other countries that granted credit to Italy is twofold . They all want to preserve the stability of the major currencies and avoid devaluation , which can set off pressures against other currencies . And they want to help Italy to avoid putting restrictions on imports , which would have the effect of harming other nation 's exports and slowing down world trade .
