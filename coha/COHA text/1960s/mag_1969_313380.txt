Virginia Woolf once wrote that after reading certain novels she felt as if she were expected to write out a check . Such sermonettes , with their demand for moral reparations for evil deeds of the past , infest the modern theater . If one were really to believe Hochhuth ( The Deputy ) , Weiss ( The Investigation ) and Arthur Miller ( Incident at Vichy ) , one would conclude that the playgoer is responsible for every human crime and flaw since Adam ate the apple . The latest playwright to join this tiresome mea culpa crew is Arthur Kopit . His play Indians argues that Americans were once beastly to the redskins , a heady bit of information . <P> In Oh Dad , Poor Dad , Kopit displayed a minor gift for surrealistic comedy , and in Indians he has attempted to entertain when not pulpiteering . The format is that of a Buffalo Bill Wild West show . In London , where the work originally opened , the parody-circus scenes came first , including the last-minute rescue of the innocent maiden from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliation and decimation of the Indians followed , together with the pleas of their chiefs . <P> At Washington 's Arena Stage , where the revamped play is now running , Kopit has interspersed the two elements without gaining any visible harmony of mood or purpose . One redeeming element is the staging by Director Gene Frankel : the menacing beat of tom-toms , eerie flickering lights , harsh ritual dances and the brooding presence of totemic animal masks give the play a body that the text lacks . Stacy Keach 's Buffalo Bill is pistol-bright as the showman , but the man within remains tantalizingly masked .
