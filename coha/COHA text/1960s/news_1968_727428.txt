txt With a new and probably final burst of political ehergy , Hubert H. Humphrey set out today to prove that his campaign was " coming alive " at last and that Richard M. Nixon could still be overtaken in a tight . race over the next three weeks . . Implicitly contradicting the opinion polls , buoyed by an apparent increase in campaign contributions and still convinced that Mr. Nixon is vulnerable on some key issues , Mr. Humphrey let fly some of his sharpest attacks of the campaign . He demanded that Mr. Nixon join him and George C. Wallace in a tqlevised debate , next Sunday and promised al further announcement tomorrow night if they continued to ignore the invitation . Mr. Wallace said later in California that he would accept Mr. Humphrey 's offer to de-1 bate if Mr. Nixon agreed to appear , too . Mr. Nixon has said repeatedly , however , that he will not take part in a threesided debate . The Vice President also issued a statement on anti-inflation policy calling for a new attempt to bring management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual wage increases , , thus keeping prices stable without slowing the economy . The Democratic candidate denounced the platform of Mr. Wallace 's American Independent party as " radical , revolutionary and incredible . " He vowed that if none of the three candidates won a majority in the Electoral College he would refuse to bargain with Mr. Wallace and would try to maneuver Mr. Nixon into letting the House of Representatives choose among them . Urges All to Do ' Duty ' And though still solicitous of Senator Eugene J. McCarthy , who has refused to support the Vice President since he lost the nomination to him , Mr. Humphrey implored all who might be tempted to sit out the election to do their " duty " lest they yield power to " unhealthy . and dangerous forces . " The crucial choice on Nov. 1 Mr. Humphrey said at a news conference , will be between the continuation of " sensible , progressive liberalism " and a return to reaction . " Mr. Nixon 's election , he said , would serve special moneyed interests , would raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court and would stimulate a legislative " conservative-reactionary coalition the likes of which you have n't seen since , the 80th Congress " 20 years ago . It is because the choice is so clear , Mr. Humphrey said . that he relishes the combat of the next three weeks . - He said he planned to work harder , rejecting staff advice that he rest regularly along the way . He also said he would demonstrate that he was just coming out of the " retirement " that the constraints of the Vice Presidency had imposed . He spoke to reporters in the second formal news conference since his nomination six weeks ago in the Executive Office Building , adjoining the White House . Hectic Week Ahead It was the prelude to a hectic schedule of campaign activities this week in Indiana , Missouri , Connecticut , Michigan and New York City . Tentative plans call for a journey to California and Texas among other places , next week and a further effort in the Northeastern quarter of the country during the final week . Mrs. Humphrey will campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and President Johnson is expected to take up some " suggestions " of ways in which he can still help . Aides to Mr. Humphrey said funds had become available for a respectable television advertising campaign for the final push  --  nothing like Mr. Nixon 's , they emphasized , but enough for a fair showing . " We 're going down to the wire , " Mr. Humphrey insisted , pointing . to the come-from-behind wizardry of the Detfoit Tigers 's star world series pitcher : " My name is not Mickey Lolich , but I can pitch . " Lashes Out at Nixon And pitch he did , high and wide and low and inside . ' Mr. Humphrey said it was time for Mr. Nixon to come out from " behind the bushes " or , if he preferred , from " under the covers " where he has been sleeping with Senator Strom Thurmond , the segregationist Republican of South Carolina . Mr. Thurmond is the " lifeline " between the Nixon and Wallace forces , the Vice President contended , suggesting that the Carolinian would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case no one achieved the required majority of 270 electoral votes t here . Pointing to statements by Mr. ! Wallace that he would not in . that event let the decision pass to the House of Representative as stipulated in the Constitution , Mr. Humphrey said this implied a move to " bargain " for the Presidency with one of the major-party contenders . He would make no deal with Mr. Wallace , Mr. Humphrey said , and he called upon Mr. Nixon to make a similar pledge . The Vice President 's apparent preference for a decision in the House suggested that he and his aides had thought a little more about post-election tactics since he last commented on the subject on Friday . Asked then whether he might ' instruct his electors to support Mr. Nixon if the Republican ' candidate led in popular votes but lacked electoral votes , Humphrey said that would depend on his own showing in the bigger states . But he was " prone to think . " he added , that whoever obtained the most popular votes should be chosen President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that precept , then he rather than Mr. Wallace could be the " kingmaker " in the Electoral College . The Vice Presidents said he would not let selfish interests lead to a " constitu- , tional crisis " and paralysis . In today 's news conference . Mr. Humphrey implored the nation to study Mr. Wallace 's platform . He said it threatened Ito destroy the independence of ' the judiciary , the " most danIgerous kind of escalation " of the Vietnam war and other ! radical and menacing departures from traditional procedures and policies . Mr. Humphrey tried at one point to take comfort from the ' fact that Senator McCarthy was " out campaigning for DemoIcrats " and had at least indirectly backed the Vice Presidentby endorsing his running mate , Senator Edmund S. Muskie . Then , relaxing the pretense of satisfaction with Mr. McCarthy 's stand , Mr. Humphrey described him as a " refreshing spirit " in American life who ' " keeps you guessing . " He was satisfied , nonethe. : less , that many McCarthy supporters were active in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we are now putting together the kind of strength ! that can edge us through tol victory in November .
