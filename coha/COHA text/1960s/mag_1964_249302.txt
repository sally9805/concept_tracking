The Guest . Into a junk-filled room atop an otherwise empty house in West London totters an old derelict named Davies . Clothes flap on his bony frame like weather-beaten posters on a board fence . A bristling compendium of social evils , he is dirty , mephitic , bigoted , violent , treacherous . " I been left for dead more than once , " he rasps . For 15 years he has been trying to make a trip down to Sidcup " to get my papers . They prove who I am , I ca n't move without them papers . " <P> While waiting for a break in the weather , as he puts it , Davies-played with uncluttered perception by Donald Pleasence-burrows into the refuge offered by a former mental patient ( Robert Shaw ) , the elder of two misfit brothers . Shaw collects things-bales of newspapers , a disconnected faucet , a kitchen sink , a bud vase full of screws-and he speaks and moves with the stony detachment of a man who will never again disturb the balance of his uneasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workshed out back : " Then I 'll be able to do a bit more with the house . " The younger brother ( Alan Bates ) retains some link to the workaday world but expresses his frustration in bursts of sadistic mockery . Davies sets the brothers one against the other in order to hold onto his job as caretaker . Finally they turn him out , and all three men are thrust back into the nightmare isolation whence they came . <P> With only a smidgen of a plot to drive them , this unholy trio thrashes out a sometimes funny , sometimes corrosive drama based on Harold Pinter 's London and Broadway stage success , The Caretaker . It is still morbidly fascinating to watch . And what made the play important remains perfectly clear : dialogue so richly human that every vile syllable sounds like a cry for help , plus superb acting of their original roles by Pleasence , Shaw and Bates . <P> But if the playwright 's bleak study of mankind may be an allegory subject to highly colorful interpretations , it may only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , because the flaws of filmed theater become obvious when ever Director Clive Donner and Scenarist Pinter try most earnestly to " open up " the play in cinema terms . A room sealed against the real and imagined terrors of the outside world is the natural hell of Pinter 's characters , and a legitimate theater is an intimate place to share them . To set them roaming into the street or off to a neighborhood cafe for breakfast , arbitrarily adds action but dissipates the mood so brilliantly sustained onstage . Though this screen adaptation leaves gaps that an ambitious camera must try to fill , popping out for a bit of fresh air is not necessarily the answer .
