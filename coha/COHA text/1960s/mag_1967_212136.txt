Who should set policy for the nation 's public schools ? Traditionally , this power has been invested in nonprofessional school boards and professional superintendents . In the wake of several bitter strikes , teachers ' organizations are demanding a bigger voice in the establishment of educational goals . <P> There is some justice in the teachers ' claim to power . Those now in charge of the schools , particularly in the big cities , have failed miserably-and teachers can not be blamed for overcrowded classes , inept texts , pre-Sputnik curriculums . Even the injection of billions of dollars in federal funds , designed specifically to spur innovation , has largely bypassed the classroom teacher . Of some 700 federal grants awarded last year in Michigan , teachers were not consulted in 80% of the cases . <P> Kicked on the Floor . In practice , school boards have relied mainly on top school administrators and superintendents to decide which new pilot projects , textbooks and course changes to try out . But as teachers insist on having a larger share in setting policy , notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superintendent has been kicked on the floor-teachers are dealing directly with the school board . " <P> In theory , a superintendent or principal is a top teacher who has earned promotion ; shoving him aside seems self-defeating , even from the teachers ' viewpoint . Yet the best teachers tend to shun administrative chores , particularly detest the humdrum courses in educational administration that many states require in order to qualify for supervisory posts . One result , concedes B. Frank Brown , the innovation-minded superintendent of Florida 's Brevard County , is that many administrators are " former coaches , who get by with a pitch , a smile and flimflam . " Others become mere paper-shufflers . <P> Potential Pedants . But if school boards lack technical knowledge and administrators get buried in bureaucracy , are teachers ' organizations the best hope ? Not necessarily . The trouble with many union groups is that they are dominated not by the best teachers but by mediocre timeservers primarily worried about job security and self-benefits . And as many supervisors point out , teachers do not fully exercise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classroom . Although there are signs that more bright , open-minded students are taking up teaching as a career , the majority of new teachers are still potential pedants who have been trained in old-fashioned " methods " courses at second-rate schools . <P> Too Divisive . The biggest danger in the drive for teacher power is its divisiveness , setting teacher against school board , teacher against administrator . The obvious answer is cooperation and a spirit of partnership . One approach is that of the Pittsburgh schools , where a teacher-dominated professional advisory commission consults with the superintendent on all matters relevant to the education of students . Pittsburgh teachers even get extra pay to develop new ideas on curriculums and texts . In Chicago , union representatives meet monthly with the school superintendent to discuss educational policy and sit on curriculum committees .
