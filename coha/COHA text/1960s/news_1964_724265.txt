txt The New York civil rights movement , which earlier this year was moving energetically in several directions , has entered a period of repose and self-examination . Some observers say that this is a ' reaction to The rioting of the summer . On the other hand , some say the leaders of the movement feel privately that organized , nonviolent demonstrations are no longer potent weapons against discrimination . Many of the young people who formed . the ' backbone of demonstrations only a few months ago have moved from organization to organization , seeking a better way to use their energies . They no longer plan picket lines and sit-ins on the same grand scale ; instead , they talk about working on long-range political reforms . A. Need  --  Then No Need Some of the young activists got together recently and planned a demonstration in New York aimed at what they believed was the Federal Government 's lack of interest in racial violence in McComb , Miss . Then the young people read the papers and found that President Johnson had started an investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the group acknowledged that " in the old days " of civil rights activity here , the demonstration probably would have been held anyway . Now , this person said , there is no need to demonstrate . One dramatic example of the change may be seen at the Brooklyn office of the Congress of Racial Equality . Five months ago Brooklyn CORE was at odds with the national CORE office . Isiah Brunson , the chapter chairman , proposed an automobile stall-in for the opening day of the World 's Fair . This caused considerable embarrassment to James Farmer , the national director of CORE . Mr. Farmer organized his own demonstration inside the fairgrounds . The stall-in failed to materialize , the Brooklyn chapter was called on the carpet for its actions . Now , Brooklyn CORE is functioning along more traditional lines . About 30 members gathered in its store-front office . one night last week and made plans to call on Brooklyn members of the City Council . " We want to state our position on police brutality and school pairing , " explained Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership secretary . He was asked about the change from picket lines to political lobbying. : : " You 're not likely to see a repeat of the big wave of demonstrations right away , " he replied . Mr. Brunson has resigned as chairman Of the chapter . He drops in the Brooklyn CORE office.from time to time , but he no longer ? takes part in the chapter 's policy deliberations . How One Has Changed In the office of another civil rights organization , a young woman reflected on the change . &eves; one ( if the CORE members who sat in the middle of the Triborough Bridge ? last spring , causing a massive traffic tieup . She also participated in demonstrations at the World 's Fair . At the beginning of the summer , however , she went to Mississippi and helped to enroll Negro voters . In August she went to Atlantic City , to help arrange the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party 's appearance at the Democratic National Convention . On ' her return , she said : " I am against demonstrations per se @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new era , and those of us who do n't realize that are just wrong . " When we went to Atlantic City , I learned that we had been relying on the conscience of the white people . That wo n't work any more . " I learned that we have a choice to make . I learned that this . is no longer a protest movement : The choice we must make is to make this a political movement . If they can run candidates for office on the Freedom ticket in Mississippi , they can certainly run candidates in New . York . " Another reason . for the change in the pattern ' of the movement may be attributed to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , which helped to . put a moratorium on demonstrations until after the November elections . Wilkins for : Moratorium Roy Wilkins , the executive secretary of the - first thought of the moratorium in July , after Senator Barry Goldwater was nominated as the Republican candidate for President and after Negro rioting had erupted in Harlem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ; Whitney M. Young Jr. , ' executive director of the National Urban League , and A. Philip Randolph , chairman of The Negro American Labor Council , joined Mr. Wilkins in ' calling for the moratorium on July 29 . Since then , none of their organizations has participated in demonstrations . Instead , they have concentrated their efforts behind voter registration campaigns designed to increase the numbers of those who might be expected to vote for President Johnson . The Congress of Racial Equality did not sign the agreement , partly because CORE is an organization that has exerted most of its efforts in the field of nonviolent demonstrations . But even CORE changed its attitude during the summer . Mr. Farmer said the other day that he had been " tightening up the structure " of the CORE chapters in the . New York area . He said a regional office soon would be established in Harlem . Galamison Dismayed Another element of the New York movement is represented by the Rev. Milton A. Galamison , a Brooklyn minister- who conducted last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not the national leaders , represents the interests of the " little people " in the city 's Negro ghettoes . Even Mr. Galamison is dismayed by the turn the movement took during the summer . " The people are momentarily at a loss for a workable strategy , " he said . Mr. Galamison is not discard . ing demonstrations as a weapon , He says he is now casting , about for an even more ' effective demonstration ? of Negro grievances . He has one in " mind , he said last week a dembiestratiown that would ahnost immohMie the city ? and /ie . Is discussing its feasibility with friends . He would , not say what he had in mind . At the same time , Mr. Galam'son " does not hide his uncertainties . " The riots have demonstrated ' that even a riot wo n't get some things done , " he said . " I 'm not sure what will do it . " A. young Negro , who has demonstrated , sat in , and walked the picket line , echoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ' for a. long time , " he said , " and it did n't do any goed . I hope we can get something accomplished this fall and winter . If we do n't , I 'm afraid it 's going to be a long , hot winter . "
