In Geneva during his recent European tour , Indonesia 's President Sukarno slipped into an out-of-the-way cinema for an evening 's relaxation after a hard day of negotiations with pretty shopgirls and Swiss arms manufacturers . No doubt the " Bung " ( Brother ) , an old movie buff , needed a bit of tranquilizing , but the feature film proved to be The Fall of the Roman Empire . In light of what has been happening in Indonesia of late , it must have scanned like a sneak preview . <P> Rats &; Sweet Potatoes . Most disastrous of Sukarno 's programs has been his attempt to " crush Malaysia . " The neighboring nation has proved as undentable as armor plate : of 256 Indonesian-trained saboteurs , terrorists and guerrillas landed over the past three months , 47 were killed and 187 captured . Last week , when Sukarno issued his customary order to " intensify " the campaign , 20 more guerrillas sailed off by sampan to Malaya and Singapore - and were soon being hotly pursued by alert British-led troops and citizens , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indonesia 's flourishing Communist Party ( 3,000,000 members ) insists that Malaysia must be crushed and last week added to Sukarno 's troubles by inaugurating an equally absurd " crush American imperialism " drive on the pretext that the U.S. had sent a military-aid mission to the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur . <P> Economically , Indonesia 's course has been almost as disastrous . With the country 's current eight-year plan at the halfway mark , the government announced that fully 200 of its 335 economic projects had not yet been begun , added morosely that none of the programs aimed at earning foreign exchange had worked . Indonesia 's flashily colored currency , the rupiah , last week skidded to a hundredth of its official value : 4,500 to the U.S. dollar on the free market v. a government-controlled rate of 45 . At the annual congress of the Civil Servants Union , government clerks demanded a raise . They had cause ; a bachelor clerk today earns only 450 rupiah , or one thin dime , a month . <P> Even with more money , there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sukarno urged his people to cultivate a taste for corn and sweet potatoes . That could help to balance the diet of rat meat recommended by Communist Party Chairman D. N. Aidit , executive chairman of Indonesia 's antirodent drive . " If the peasants start eating rats eagerly , " said Aidit , " the rats will be wiped out , and there will even be a shortage of rats . " <P> Rockets &; Euphoria . None of this hardship seemed to affect the leaders of Sukarno 's swollen ( 412,000-man ) armed forces , which this year will receive half of Indonesia 's $2 billion budget . Gold-braided and grinning , the army chief of staff recently pressed a button on a Djakarta beach to lob an Indonesia-built rocket a full 21 miles into the Java Sea . Immediately the army began boasting that it would have intercontinental ballistic missiles in no time at all . <P>
