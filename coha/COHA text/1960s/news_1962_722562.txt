txt A vigorous campaign by the Canadian government to lure back frightened foreign investors is showing its first signs of success . The campaign was born last spring of a sudden financial crisis brought on by a massive flight of the foreign capital Canada relies on for money to pay many of its international debts . How and why that flight developed is still being disputed by Canadian politicians . But its essential cause is clear : Fear induced initially by a government campaign to prevent foreign " domination " of the Canadian economy . The effects of the campaign got out of hand when it was followed by a purposely engineered drop in the value of the Canadian dollar and by expropriation of a private utility , party foreign-owned , by British Columbia province . Prime Minister Diefenbaker 's Progressive Conservative Party government started throwing its policy into reverse in May . It began by supporting the price of the Canadian dollar at 92.5 cents in U.S. funds . In June it swung a $1 billion loan from international monetary agencies to continue the dollar-propping , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Canadian finances ; it slashed its budget , tightened bank credits and discouraged imports . Some U.S. Dollars Return Now , talks with financial executives and government officials in Ottawa , Toronto and Montreal indicate many foreign investors are indeed getting over their scare . In particular , these officials say , the U.S. citizens who usually supply about 75% of Canada 's foreign capital have begun moving some funds back north of the border again in recent weeks . " One U.S. bank that had n't placed any orders for Canadian treasury bills in the last two months just came back with a $5 million order , " reports William Hutchison , bond trading manager in Montreal for Greenshields , Inc. , a brokerage house . Heavy selling of Canadian stocks by U.S. and ' European investors " has pretty nearly dried . up , " . adds a Toronto official of Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Smith , U.S.-based , investment firm. ? Some4.1.S. investors ate buying Canddlait gdld. mining shares again . On world money markets , the Canadian dollar is trading close to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't make purchases to keep it there . Indeed , Mr. Diefenbaker 's money managers recently resumed buying foreign currencies , with Canadian dollars , to rebuild the reserves they had to cut In half last spring during the support program . " Over The Hump " And while no one can be certain yet that the trend will hold , government officials are beginning to relax a bit . " With a bit of luck , we 're over the hump , " says one official of the finance ministry . This comeback has important- ? - though mixed ? implications for U.S. citizens even apart from its impact on those who invest directly in Canada . Politically , the U.S. counts on Canada as a friend , neighbor and NATO ally for important international diplomatic support ; but Canada , of course , ca n't spare much time for such support while caught in a financial bind . Economically .. some U.S. businessmen have been hurt by parts of the Canadian austerity program and would benefit from any success that allowed its easing . The program included temporary raises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts in the amount of duty-free purchases Canadian tourists are allowed to make in the U.S. and other lands . But since no much of Canada 's foreign capital comes from the U.S. , any big resumption of the flow of foreign funds into Canada could widen the gap in the U.S. balance of payments . For many years the U.S. has been sending out of the country , in gifts , purchases , loans and investments , much more money than foreigners have been sending into the U.S. Cold Threat Unlikely Canada , however , is unlikely to use any U.S. dollars it might accumulate in this process to buy from the U.S. the gold on which the value of the American dollar is based . Though many other nations have been doing just that . Canada is a major gold producer itself ' and usually sells gold to the U.S. rather than buying it . While the flow of U.S. money to Canada is of something less than vital consequence to the American economy , the flow of foreign capital is extremely important to Canada . Canada usually sells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad many essential services , such as advertising , shipping and insurance , that it ca n't pay for through exports . For the last dozen years or so . it has relied on heavy injections of foreign capital to close this gap in Its international accounts . The inflow of foreign capital has also been a major contributor to Canada 's internal economic growth . In the latter part of 1960 , the Conservative government felt the flow of foreign capital was getting rather too large . To slow the growth of foreign ownership in Canadian inriustry. it extended the 15% Canadian income withholding tax to Canadian Investment in:ome of foreign corporations . To impel Caiadians to make more job-producing investments in their own country . the government announced an official program of lowering the value of the Canadian dollar so the dollar : ould n't buy so many imported goods . Why did these measures end in a seemingly panic flight of foreign capital ? Conservative Trade Minister George Hees blames 3ritish Columbia Premier W.A.C. Bennett and his Social Credit Party , with their expropriation last August of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk by a Quebec official of the advantages such moves might have for his province . Mr Bennett blames investor unease over the Conservatives ' five straight budget deficits ( the latest of $791 million , in a total budget of $6.5 billion , for the fiscal year ended March 31 ) . Financial men blame both , and also grumble about gloomy economic talk by politicians campaigning in last spring 's elections . At any rate , the program worked far more drastically than the government intended . From a value of $1.02 in U.S. money early in 1961 , the Canadian dollar dropped to 9L75 cents in late June . As it tell , Canadians began joining foreigners in sending money out of the country . Many individuals started feverishly investing their money in the U.S. and elsewhere before it lost more value , while some Canadian companies kept their export sales income abroad in short-term securities rather than bringing it home . A $400 Million Loss ? The result was a capital flight whose full dimensions are n't yet known . In 1961 , Canada had a net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in the first quarter . In the first quarter of 1962 , that changed to a net outflow o $1 Million . Second quarter figures are n't due until next month , but some financial sources figure they 'll show a capital loss as high as $400 million ; the government , however , indicates it expects a lower figure . The quarterly figures are before changes in the Canadian government 's holding of gold and foreign exchange , which through the complexities of international bookkeeping would show up as an inflow and thus mask the true dimensions of the capital flight . In the past , such changes were negligible , and they are included in the annual figures for capital movements illustrated by the preceding chart . Whether the austerity program will provide more than stop-gap relief is in some dispute . There 's widespread anxiety in Canadian financial circles that the tough measures may throttle the expansion of the Canadian economy , which would scarcely be reassuring to foreign investors . " More Evidence " Needed ? Financial men say much of the money that has returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by persons willing to switch them rapidly from one nation to another as investment conditions change  --  though they figure longerterm stock and bond investors abroad will soon come back into the market , too . And Canadian plant recruiters report some U.S. firms still tell them they want to see " a bit more evidence " that they 're welcome before starting new Canadian factories . The government itself concedes it ca n't count on a complete comeback of foreign capital this year . " I just do n't think we could go from zero to $1.2 billion in a year , " says one official , referring to the annual net rate at which foreign capital was corning in a year ago . Government officials and many financial men feel the main thing needed was simply to reassure foreigners that the nation intended to do something about the ! squeeze . " Fundamentally , the crisis was over the moment Diefenbaker said on that Friday ( June 22 ) that he was going to have an announcement on that Sunday ( the start of the austerity program ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " After all , we 're a pretty sober people , and we 're not going Latin American on you all at once . " " Champing at the Bit " Financial men see signs much more foreign capital is on the verge of coming back , too . Mr. Hutchison of the Greenshields brokerage firm says some U.S. life insurance firms a few months ago banned further buying of Canadian bonds , but reports these firms ' investment technicians are now " champing at the hit " for the green light from management . Merrill Lynch 's Toronto office says it has sighted " a lot of money on the edge of coining back " to the Canadian stock market . High interest rates here under the austerity program should accelerate this move , Canadian financiers figure . Canadian provincial governments , attracted both by the now lower cost of U.S. borrowing and the friendlier reception they figure they 'll get with the easing of the crisis , are talking again about selling sizable bond issues in the U.S. ; Ottawa financial men expect Quebec soon to float a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's higher tariffs already have had an effect on one U.S. capital source . The day after they were announced , Hammond Organ Co. told its stockholders ' meeting in Chicago that the prospective higher costs of exporting to " make it more important than ever that the company seeks ways of assembling organs In Canada . " Some Canadians expect more U.S. companies to adopt this attitude . " The cheaper Canadian dollar and the higher duties are some of those things that precipitate companies who 've been considering it a long time to finally come in , " says William A. Willson , general manager of the Metropolitan Industrial Commission . Keeping Money Home Spurring such investment , however , is only one aim of the tariff boost , which consists of a temporary surcharge of 5% to 15% on " luxury " products such as automobiles and cameras , and also on industrial goods . Directly , officials figure the new tariffs will funnel an extra $200 million of needed foreign exchange into the government 's reserves . Equally important , thb tariffs are calculated to keep at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spent nn the now costlier foreign goods . The combination of the lower value of the Canadian dollar and the extra tariff makes a Volkswagen auto about 20% more expensive to Canadian Sayers than a year ago , one government official computes . " I think we 'll soon start seeing fewer of them on the streets , " he add with a smile . The $250 million budget cut Mr. Diefenbake has promised for the fiscal year that starte April 1 also should save Canada some foreig exchange . That 's because the Canadian gm ernment , like Canadian businesses and indivic uals , does much of its spending abroad . " Abet one-sixth of that budget cut will come out c foreign trade " and narrow the gap betwee Canada 's international payments and interns tional receipts , a government official est mates . " No Volkswagens Needed " If these measures prove insufficient , th government hints it has stronger medicine i. reserve . " We could play a little rough if w , had to , " says one key policymaker . " For in stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloni without any Volkswagens at all " ? recalling somewhat similar 1947 crisis when Canada di , put a flat ban on hundreds of categories o imports . However , he stresses , the govern ment at present is confident it will not need t , take this drastic step , nor such other possibly measures as putting direct controls on foreign exchange and raising domestic takes . Anxious as it is to revive the inflow e foreign capital in the immediate future , how ever , the Canadian government also is pon dering ways to reduce the nation 's dependence on it for the longer pull . " Of course we wet come foreign capital , especially direct invest ment ( such as that in new factories ) whirl often brings technical know-how with it , " say : one official . " But in the long run , we mils find a way to get significant export surpluses so we do n't rely on it so much . " The most promising approach , the govern ment feels , is to make Canadian manufactur ing industries more efficient so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have beer pleasantly surprised at what we 've been able to accomplish with some exports , " a govern ment trade official reports . " We 've found cm : modern kitchen ranges , for instance , have a very nice market in England and Europe , We know we 're not going to offset a $1 Minor a year trade deficit with ranges , but it shows what can be done . " Auto Plans A possible subject for such efforts is Canada 's auto industry , which consists mostly of subsidiaries of U.S. auto companies . Canada 's auto plants in most respects are as efficient as their 11.9. counterparts , one gov. ernment official says , but their costs are higher because they turn out a greater num ? ber of models on the same assembly line . The government , consequently , is showing fresh interest in an old study-commission port that recommended it urge the auto corn . panlea to cut down the number of models they turn out in Canada . If this were done , officials reason , prices could be cut on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially eager to increase exports of manufactured goods because it sees little chance for a sharp Upturn in commodity exports . Commodities such as wheat , newsprint and iron ore account for most of Canada 's foreign sales . But world commodity markets are generally sluggish and , economists believe , likely to remain so for a while . Officials do hope the lower value of the Canadian dollar will help commodity exporters maintain their international competitive position , Export prices for some major Canadian commodities are calculated in U.S. dollars ; since these are now worth more in Canadian money , the exporters now earn more Canadian dollars on each foreign sale . Government officials figure this gives the exporters an extra profit margin that will help them resist price boosts which might antagonize foreign customers .
