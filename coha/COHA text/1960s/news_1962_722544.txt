txt WE HAD two great players at Cleveland , Bob Feller , the best pitcher in baseball , and Lou Boudreau , the best shortstop . Problems we had aplenty . My first problem was that the best shortstop in baseball was , in my opinion , not the best manager , an opinion that was not greatly altered by a close , intimate and ? as it turned ' out ? unbreakable association in Cleveland . There were never any personal difficulties between Lou and me , to set that matter straight . I liked Louie . I still like Louie . Louie was a nice , amiable boy who had walked into the Cleveland front office at the age of 24 and asked if he could become their new manager . At 28 , he was still a faintly bewildered boy manager . The team I inherited was in sixth place ; I thought Lou should- have had them higher . My main objection to Lou was that he managed by hunch and desperation . You ask Casey Stengel why he made a certain move and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1919 who had demonstrated some principle Casey was now putting " If you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em , " Veeck decided , so he cheerfully signed Lou Boudreau ( right ) to two year managerial contract . into effect . You ask Lou and he will say , " The way we 're going , we had to do something . " His Choice as Manager : Stengel I particularly wanted to get Louie out of the manager 's office because I had Casey Stengel ready to sign . The night after I took over the Indians , Lou had dinner with Harry Grabiner and me at our suite in the Cleveland hotel . In those 24 hours , I had already managed to lose all the initiative by letting the writers know that we were thinking about a new manager . Harry had a candidate of his own , Jimmy Dykes . It was made clear to me , in short order , that Lou was so popular in Cleveland that if I traded him away , I would have the whole city down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have found , as an untouchable player . When you trade a long time favorite , the writers find kind words for such forgotten virtues as sentiment and loyalty and speak most darkly about front office ingratitude . The next time the Yankees are in town for a Sunday double header , they 're all there pleading for two tickets behind first base . But trading as popular a player as Boudreau as my first move in a new town would be something else again . Ill-will , created at the very beginning of any operation , is ruinous . The only thing we could hope to do was to get Louie to step down voluntarily . Fat chance . Louie was holding all the cards and he knew it . He knew that if I came right out and said , " You can play for us but not manage , " I 'd be running the risk of his answering , " If I 'm not going to manage , I wo n't play for you . " He knew as well as I did that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that position . On a High Philosophical Plane Let me put one story to rest . I never offered him more money if he would step down ; that would have been the ultimate insult . I must admit , however , that Lou could have made me very happy by coming up with that kind of proposition himself . It was funny , in a bumbling sort of way . I somehow managed to swing the dinner conversation to the mixed feelings baseball men seemed to have about how great a strain was placed upon a player-manager , pitching the whole discussion , needless to say , on a high philosophical plane . Most experts , I felt called upon to point out , seemed to feel that a fellow could n't really play his best when he was managing . Harry , out of his long experience in the league , observed  --  purely in the spirit of scientific inquiry  --  that , yes , he had to go along with the majority on that one . I , citing my own meager experience in the minors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell . " And you 're the greatest shortstop I 've ever seen , " I told Lou , as if the thought had just occurred to me . " It would be a shame , you know , if your duties as a manager diminished that . " The last thing in the world I wanted , you know , was to sea his playing hurt . Veeck Accepts His Loss Gracefully And all the time I was chattering away , all of us knew that Louie was making incredible plays at shortstop every day . The trouble , as far as I was concerned , was that his incredible playing was n't doing a thing for his managing . Lou was willing enough to play it our way . If philosophy was what we wanted , philosophy was what we would get . Lou observed thoughtfully . that while he himself had n't found managing to be any great strain  --  had in fact found it to be quite stimulating  --  yes , he could see where there were some playing managers who might be affected . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose , it is just as well to lose gracefully . About the time dessert was being served , I was saying , " Well , I want you to know that we certainly want you to stay on as our manager . We 've got all the confidence in the world in you , Louie old boy . "
