txt Senator Barry Goldwater received a deafening 28 ? minute ovation at Madison Square Garden last night and then went on to predict he would win the Presidency next week in " the major political upset of the century . " More than 18,000 persons jammed the arena , and 5,000 others who were unable to get in listened as loudspeakers brought the program out to 49th Street west of Eighth Avenue . The Republican Presidential nominee was interrupted with applause and cheers at almost every phrase of a speech that took him 35 minutes . Some of his points appeared to be directed at his New York City audience as he made his only appearance here in the campaign . For Neighborhood Schools He set the crowd to roaring when he declared : " If you ever hear me quoted as promising to make you free by forcibly busing your children from your chosen neighborhood school to some other one just to meet an arbitrary racial quota  --  look again because somebody is kidding you ! " I believe in our system of neighborhood schools , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to see them destroyed or be sacrificed by a futile exercise in sociology which will accomplish nothing ? but lose much . " He added , " My friends , these are not matters of civil rights ? they are matters of common sense , common concern and common decency . " A moment earlier , he had said : " If you ever hear me quoted as favoring the right to associate  --  without favoring the equally vital right not to associate  --  look again , because somebody will be kidding you . " On another tack , he asserted : " The Nazi and the Fascist types  --  the bigots  --  they 're not going to vote for me ? because my grandfather was a Polish Jew . " Hurrahs broke out , and he went on : " But do we want these votes ? " " No ! " roared the crowd . The rally was organized by New Yorkers for Goldwater and Miller , a citizen group , rather than by the regular Republican state organization , and in enthusiasm it far surpassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same arena Oct. 15 . For 28 minutes 15 seconds after his introduction , the Arizona Senator stood in the glare of spotlights , with the applause , the cheers , the hurrahs enveloping . When he was nominated by the Republican national convention last July 15 in San Francisco , the ovation lasted 29 minutes . When he finished last night , at 10:02 P.M. , he was hailed for 3 minutes 15 seconds . Scores Federal Power The candidate delivered a ripping , lashing , slugging speech . Once again he struck at expanding Federal power , this time charging President Johnson with " political daddyism " ? seeking votes by promising the Federal Government will take care of everything without cost . That , he argued , is what is wild and irresponsible in this campaign . That , he said , is " basic dishonesty " and " transparent vote-grabbing demagoguery . " The Johnson Administration , he asserted , is in " a state of moratorium until after the election " ? although Americans were dying in Vietnam . Its policies , he said , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He ended by evoking a specter of a Federal Government that would make all sorts of decisions and declared : " I hate to say this , but I 'm talking about America ! " With God 's blessing , let 's get it back ! " It was a rally that shook the rafters repeatedly . It started as Leonard W. Hall , former Republican national chairman , as master of ceremonies , askedi " Is everybody happy ? " The audience joined Joan Roberts , the singer , in the third verse of " The Star-Spangled Banner , " promising triumph in the home of the free and the land of the brave . Almost the only lull came when Mr. Hall called for a mo-1 ment of silent prayer for the late former President Herbert Hoover . A woman bugler sounded Taps . Someone yelled , " Let 's have one now for Doug MaclArthur . " The band played " The Battle Hymn of the Republic , " a theme song for the Goldwater campaign , and the crowd joined in chanting " His truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberts sang " God Bless America , " and Mr. Goldwater joined in . The program began at 8:09 . Senator Goldwater had been scheduled to appear at 9:15 , with 10 minutes set aside for " standing ovation . " But the other speakers were cut short to reschedule him for 9 o'clock . Forty-five seconds ahead of that moment , he came on to the platform , a plain bespectacled figure in gray , and the ovation began . Earlier anti-Goldwater pickets from the New York Congress of Racial Equality , about 300 at the peak , paraded opposite the Garden . Where red heart-shaped signs inside proclaimed , " In your heart , you know he 's right , " the CORE pickets chanted , " In your guts you know he 's nuts . " Three hundred uniformed policemen , including 25 mounted men , were on hand , but rumors of projected disturbances proved unfounded . The one-night stand here followed two other appearances by Senator Goldwater in thik state ? on Sept. 5 in Lockport , home town of his running mate , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Rockefeller . Virtually all politicians and poll-takers have predicted that New York , With its 43 electoral votes , is a lost cause for the Goldwater candidacy , and Mr. Goldwater has campaigned only perfunctorily in the state . Normally the state is a battleground down to the last minute for the national candidates . Rockefeller Absent Governor Rockefeller , whose endorsements of Mr. Goldwater 's candidacy have been cool , and Senator Kenneth B. Keating , waging a difficult campaign for re-election , were in Albany ? at another Republican affair . The Republican state organization was represented at the rally by Michael N. Scelsi , campaign director , who announced that others attending were Fred A. Young , state chairman ; Mrs. Wilma S. Rogalin , vice chairman ; George L. Hinman , national committeeman , and Miss Jean , co-director of the campaign committee . Mr. Scelsi said yesterday the Republicans hoped to " do much better in New York City than in 1960 , and if we can do that and hold our traditional vote upstate , we 've got a real fighting chance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davie , chairman of New Yorkers for Goldwater and Miller , contended that Senator Goldwater had " an excellent chance to carry the state , " based on reports from her group 's county chairmen . Mrs. Davie said surveys showed street riots here , forced busing of schoolchildren out of their neighborhoods and the arrest of President Johnson 's special assistant , Walter Jenkins , on a morals charge had helped to swell a " silent vote " that professional pollsters seemed to have missed . Paul Windels Jr. , the citizens ' group 's New York County chairman , commented that his ima rpression was that in Manhattan " Republican defections for the the part are moving back Into h straight Republican Icolumn . " " There is actually a poll backlash , " he said , " many people who are resentful of predetermination of the national election by polltakers . " Nixon Sends Message Former Vice President Richard M. Nixon , chairman of the rally , campaigned in Nevada , Oregon and Washington yesterday , but he sent a message . " Everywhere I have been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that the Johnson campaign has run out of gas and that our campaign is moving up fast . " Let us make an all-out effort to get our message across to the millions of undecided voters who will make their , choice this week and thereby make sure that the next president of the United States will be your guest of honor , Barry Goldwater . " The Goldwater rally also heard a telegram to Mrs. Davie from former President Dwight D. Eisenhower . It said in part : " Liberty is our most precious possession . To keep it , we must have a firm foreign policy , a powerful military defense , a free economy  --  and , most important , we must preserve our moral ands spiritual heritage . Barry Gold-1 water shares these views and is dedicated to keeping the peace and providing the moral ) leadership we need . " When Senator Goldwater arrived at La Guardia Airport at 2:25 P.M. on a chartered DC-3 after campaigning in Maryland and Delaware , he was met by , 14 spectators and the airport 's manager , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spent the afternoon in staff conferences at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . Sponsors of the Garden rally had sought to surpass the turnout for President Johnson at a Liberal party rally Oct. 15 , when the crowd was estimated at 20,000 . President Johnson 's appearance at the Garden had , followed tumultuous welcomes front huge crowds on a. 22-mile tour of Brooklyn . One volunteer Goldwater worker , Miss Mary Kennedy , said at rally headquarters , 79 Madison Avenue , that 30,000 general admissions could rave been sold . Three-fourths of the seats put on sale Oct. 6 were sold out in four days , she said . The demand soared as soon as newspapers announced the event , Miss Kennedy said , and it was further spurred by mailings to lists of early Goldwater supporters and Republicans in general . Tickets sold for $2 , $5 and $25 , with $1,000 paid for 18-seat " sponsors ' boxes . " On the speaking program were Dean Burch , current national chairman ; Mrs. Patricia Hutar , co-chairman ; F.
