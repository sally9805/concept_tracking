txt Ranger 9 sent home a dramatic space " first " for all who were watching their television sets as the picture-taking craft neared the moon . From 8:52 a.m. e.s.t . Wednesday until just before impact 16 minutes later , every man , woman , and child among the viewers saw the spacecraft fall into the moon . They shared the thrill that , on previous Ranger shots , was known only to a small group of experts . As narrator Dr. Raymond L. Heacock explaMed , it was " the first chance even the Ranger experimenters have to see these pictures . " Even a layman could notice some of the features that puzzle the lunar scientists . As the spacecraft closed in on the crater Alphonsus , lines that looked like cracks or depressions in a mud flat came ever more sharply into view . One of the most prominent of them is shown in one of the accompanying pictures taken off the television screen as impact neared . Lunar scientists call such lines " rills . " They remind geologists of features on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But no one knows whether or not the rills indicate volcanic or moon-quake activity on the moon . Thd lunar rills are often marked by small craters along part of their length . Dr. Heacock noted that experts wonder whether such craters are formed by meteor impacts like so many other lunar craters . They seem so closely associated with the rills that they may be in some way connected with rill formation . The general television audience could see the more obvious elements of the puzzle as Ranger 9 moved in ever more closely . Alphonsus is of special interest partly because some observers have reported seeing from earth signs that gases may be emitted in the crater . There was no sign of this in the views on the TV screen . But as Dr. Heacock explained , the pictures were de-'graded by the process that made them available in the living room . At the Goldstone , Calif. , tracking station of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , the views were much sharper . And many thousands of them have been recorded , in addition to the hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps within another four years , the pictures flashed earthward will show men standing on the enigmatic moon surface .
