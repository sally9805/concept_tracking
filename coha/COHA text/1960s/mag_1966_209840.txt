At Pittsburgh 's Duquesne Club , where steelmen gather for grub and gossip , few names have stoked tempers faster than that of Norton Simon . The California industrialist , who uses his Hunt Foods &; Industries , Inc. as a corporate base for buying into other companies <P> ( TIME cover , June 4 ) , heated up the industry 15 months ago by moving into Wheeling Steel , the nation 's twelfth largest steel company . In abrupt Simon fashion , he forced five directors off the board , tossed out the chairman-president , charging mismanagement , installed his own chief executive . Wheeling has since rubbed the steel establishment the wrong way by dropping out of industrywide wage negotiations and by giving customers when-they-order guarantees against price increases before delivery . <P> Last week , however , Simon was the toast of Pittsburgh . Reason : he had moved to head off a takeover by somebody else . For two weeks , Crucible Steel , a specialty company with $300 million annual sales in alloys , stainless , tool and carbon steels , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stock fluctuated over a ten-point range . Then the reason came clear . Headed by Chicago Industrialist Morris J. Rubin , who helped engineer a takeover 21 months ago of the U.S. Smelting , Refining &; Mining Co. , a Crucible-minded " Stockholders Committee for Better Management " was buying Crucible stock . Rubin and his committee said they were angry over low earnings and dividends . <P> <P> Bunch of " Raiders . " Crucible 's management , struggling with outdated equipment and strong competition in specialty steels from front-running Allegheny Ludlum , was understandably alarmed and apparently willing to seek help from anyone-even including Norton Simon . Blasting the dissident stockholders ' committee as a bunch of " raiders , " President Joel Hunter caught a plane for California . Impressed by the way in which Simon had moved in to improve Wheeling , Canada Dry and McCall Corp. , Hunter proposed that Simon-who knows the corporate-acquisition route better than he knows the way home from his own office-help block the invaders . Simon , on advice of friends at Pittsburgh 's influential Mellon National Bank , accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for Simon men . Simon himself became Crucible 's finance com mittee chairman . <P> <P> At week 's end , the outcome of the Crucible conflict was still officially undetermined . Much of the company 's common stock , totaling 3,879,180 shares , is held in small blocs , many of which are listed only under " street names " in banks and brokerage houses . Neither side would state its share totals . Simon announced that Hunt Foods held a substantial bloc , may increase it by another 200,000 shares . Crucible 's board voted to redeem 99,880 convertible preferred shares ; since the preferred can be exchanged on the basis of 3.45 common shares for each one of preferred , the move would raise Crucible 's outstanding shares to 4,223,760 and dilute the strength of the Rubin group .
