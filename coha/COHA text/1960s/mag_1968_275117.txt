Ever since his first appearances with Chicago 's improvisational Second City troupe , Alan Arkin has been doing a series of disappearing acts . The authentic Arkin vanishes into a part , never to be seen again . Like Peter Sellers , he has ample physical credentials for a cab driver but rather odd ones for a star . His blunt , anonymous face was born to grouse behind a steering wheel . His voice - often hidden behind a Puerto Rican or Mittel-European accent - is a grainy urban product , like soot . His hair is rapidly disappearing ; his walk is a series of slumps . <P> Nevertheless , at 34 , Arkin has established himself as a major theatrical talent . In his Broadway debut in Enter Laughing , he played an acting student , crippled with a plethora of fright sweat and a dearth of talent . The performance earned him a Tony Award . As the suicidal intellectual in Luv , Arkin was so explosively funny that his director , Mike Nichols , called him " the best actor in America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film role : the resignedly subversive Soviet officer in The Russians Are Coming . His first straight picture , Wait Until Dark , was a Guinness-like tour de force in which Arkin offered portraits of a father , his son and a psychopathic killer . <P> But there are disadvantages to being Alan Arkin , the submersible actor . Without a dominant personality that remains a constant in each performance , he is the victim as well as the beneficiary of his material . In his two most recent films , his vast comic abilities tick away in a bomb that never goes off , and his gift for pathos and poignancy soars so far above the surrounding melodrama that the film becomes virtually a one-man show . <P> In A Shot in the Dark and The Pink Panther , Gallic gumshoe Jacques Clouseau was played by Peter Sellers with his overfamiliar banana-peel approach to comedy . In Inspector Clouseau , Arkin follows meticulously in his predecessor 's flatfootsteps , but the result is only a parody of a parody . <P> There is the elaborate sight gag : Clouseau exits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with the luggage . The Malapropism : " You are pushing my leg . " The convoluted scheme : a gang of thieves disguise themselves in Clouseau masks to enter Swiss banks . The third time round , however , the mixture is flat and tasteless . Bud Yorkin 's slovenly direction makes the film look as if every expense had been spared , trapping Arkin in a farce of habit that will probably retire Clouseau to oblivion - one picture too late . <P> Fractured French . From Inspector Clouseau to Carson McCullers ' The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is a journey from comedy to tragedy , from fractured French to utter silence . As John Singer , a deaf-mute silverware engraver living in a small Dixie town , Arkin moves through a gallery of Southern gothic tragedy . A fellow mute ( Chuck McCann ) does violence to a store window , and is committed to a mental institution , where he dies . A Negro doctor who befriends Singer is racked with cancer , and has a hostile , hate-drugged daughter ( Cicely Tyson ) .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
