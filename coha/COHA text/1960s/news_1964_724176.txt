txt Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon came out today for a thoroughgoing reduction in excise tax rates next year . He told Democratic platform writers that many excised no longer served their purpose and were " an unnecessary nuisance to taxpayers and Government alike . " And he said " next year is the time " for over-all excise revision and repeal . This was a distinct shift of position for the Treasury and the Administration . They resisted Republican efforts in this session of Congress to repeal some excise levies , saying that the whole matter needed more study and that relief should come in perhaps 1966 . Too Much Fuel ' Mr. Dillon told the Platform Committee that this year 's Republican drive to eliminate some excises altogether was premature . " It would have provided too much fuel to the fire , he said . Federal excises are in a number of categories . The bestknown are the retail taxes on cosmetics , furs , luggage and similar items . Others are on alcohol , tobacco , automobiles , television sets and telebhone calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War II . Mr. Dillon called them a " hodgepodge " and said they needed a " thorough overhaul , " not just repeal of some of those best known to the public . The House Ways and Means Committee has just held hearings on the excise-tax problem . Mr. Dillon said the Treasury was making a study of its own and would have specific recom- ' mendations to give to Congress next year . Budget Balance Discounted This promise of further tax relief was related , in the Secre-1 Mary 's prepared statement , toy ; the phrase " as warranted by ' our economic and budgetary po ; sition . " But inquiry at the ; Treasury made clear that the excise reduction would not be conditioned on the next budget 's being in balance . Mr. Dillon was one of several i'witnesses from the Government , labor and business who testified on economic subjects be ' fore the Platform Committee to'day . Those from the Government pointed with pride to the last four years and with alarm ito the eight previous , Republi- can years . Secretary Dillon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration took over in 1961 , " our economy was bogged down in its fourth postwar recession . " " Today , " he continued , " we are in the middle of our fourth year of continued economic advance ? the best period of peacetime prosperity in our entire modern history . " His testimony emphasized prudence and moderation as the Democratic Administration 's watchwords in the economic sphere . This continued the steady theme , at the hearings , of implied attack on the Re- , publican nominee , Senator ! Barry Goldwater , as immoder-I ate . " We have rejected extremes , " Mr. Dillon said . He put special ; stress on the cost-consciousness ' of the Administration , saying ) it was " frugal . " And he said ' the debt had been managed " prudently . " Administrations Contrasted For the first time since World War II , he said , the national debt was as low as 50 per cent ' of the gross national product , ' the sum of all goods and services produced by the nation 's economy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the smallest portion of the national output of any year since 1951 . Walter 1V . Heller , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , said the Kennedy-Johnson Administration would be ; the " first in over a century ; unmarred by recession or de-I pression . ' , He contrasted that ' with what he termed the , " alarming economic trend from 1953 to 1960 . " In four Democratic years , Mr. A35ociatea Press Wire-hoto FOR TAX REVISIONS : Douglas Dillon , Treasury Secretary , before Democratic Platform Committee . Heller added , the rise in actual output of the economy was more than in the eight previoue Republican years , and the annual growth rate nearly double . And he said prices had remained stable to a degree that " no other industrial country has been able to match , " Mr. Heller hinted at a plan to give to the states some of the increase in Federal tax revenues that would occur with ' continuing prosperity . He said that increase would amount to , about $6 billion a year and . might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps some means could , be found , " he said , " for declaring a large dividend to our hard-pressed states and local ; units . " He had a new figure on the dimensions of the present boom . He predicted that the gross national product would hit an annual rate Of $640 to $650 billion in the first quarter of 1965 , a gain of $15 billion in four years . The Secretary of Commerce , Luther H. Hodges , spoke of " a greater national understanding on economic issues " these days . He said the Democratic Administration was largely responsible . Secretary of Labor W. Willard , Wirtz said that strike losses in the economy had been cut sharply during the last four ; years . The man-hours lost were down to less than half what they were in the five ; previous years , he said . Mr. Wirtz had some legisla- ; tive suggestions for the platform . He said it should broaden ! collective bargaining rights to ; unions on " corporate-type farms " and reiterate past ; Democratic calls for repeal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Administration spokes- ; men all called for further action ; to remove remaining dark spots , in the economy , such as unem- ' eloyment , which is just below ; 5 per cent .

Sargent Shriver , who is to head the new antipoverty pro-I gram , jabbed at Senator Gold- ; water 's suggestion that the poor , have only themselves to blamed " Just because so many of us , are lucky to be well off , " Mr. ' Shriver said , " there are some , who say the poor deserve to be ' poor because they are lazy or stupid . " " It is impossible to believe that 35 million Americans are no good  --  that one-fifth of our . country is made up of drunk- , , ards , idlers , dope addicts and , , wastrels , " he declared .

Mr. suggested that much of what is called " racial unrest " in the country really results from unemployment and other economic pressures . George Meany , president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations , called for an increase in the minimum wage from $1.25 to $2 an hour and , reduction in the standard work- , week to 35 hours . He called , ? for much wider Federal aid on ' housing , education and other public needs . A statement from the National Association of Manufacturers emphasized the need to curtail " excessive Federal spending . " It called for further Itax cuts , putting the priority , : as did Mr. Dillon , on excise ; rate reductions .
