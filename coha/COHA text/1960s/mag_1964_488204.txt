When the New York Herald Tribune started off its editorial , " We Choose Johnson , " with the avowal , " Travail and torment go into these simple words . . . " it was not indulging in mock heroics . The Trib says truly that as a newspaper it was Republican before there was a Republican Party , has been Republican ever since , and intends to remain Republican . But it findS Goldwater impossible and it is a testament to the paper 's integrity that this one time it had to bolt . In stating its support for the Johnson-Humphrey ticket , The Nation will surprise no one . Its choice has been made with the greatest equanimity and borders on tautology . Not that The Nation is a Democratic organ . We are supporting Kenneth B. Keating for re-election to the Senate from New York , and there was no inner struggle about that either . Nor have we experienced any travail or torment in reaching the decision that Republican John V. Lindsay should be re-elected as Representative from the 17th Congressional District in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not merely a matter of choosing the lesser evil Johnson has faults and they are not slight , especially for a magazine that tries to . ? . . 1%.0 UplILLUI1 .111 ? LVLIGL . AC:VGA ? 1-1 IA I , J.1 virtues are impressive ( see Stuart Long 's assessment , based on close observation over a period of many years , p. 235 ) An adroit practical politician , the President is an acknowledged master of legislative techniqUes ; his skill and experience in the arts of , Congressionalleadership have not been matched in our time . The Executive-Congressional interplay is one of immense intricacy , requiring technical and professional competence which some men , otherwise brilliant , can never attain . In this field alone  --  and it is a vital one  --  the President 's credentials would be impressive against any nominee the Republicans might have named , not to mention the ineffable Goldwater . In our view the record of the 88th Congress under President Johnson 's leader : ship warrants endorsement of his candidacy . In general political orientation , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has always been about as progressive as a Texan can be and still keep on getting re-elected . His political values may not be ours but we certainly espouse many of his objectives . The President is no ascetic and he has accumulated a personal fortune , employing to his own advantage the same mixture of financial acumen , political influence and general know-how that have made him such an effective legislator . At the same time , the glaring Contrasts of wealth and poverty in American society are not to his liking . ' He ' understands the responsibilities of leadership , accepts them gladly , and is probably the hardest-working President who has occupied the office in this century . No one questions hisdedication or his determination to make a great record as President . " In supporting Johnson , " the Herald Tribune warns , " we do so with our eyes open and our fingers crossed . " The Nation makes the same reservation . It supported Kennedy and then belabored him on Vietnam and Cuba Given the same circumstances , it will criticize Johnson as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so it now seems  --  will present ' a special problem Kennedy Just squeezed through , but present indications are that Johnson will win by a landslide . The Nation would like to see the Goldwater-Miller ticket receive the worst defeat it is in the power of the American people to bestow . If that makes the Democrats complacent , progressives will have their work cut out for them the next four years . So will Johnson . It is one thing to talk of the Great Society , quite another to create it . But to try is both in his interest and consistent with his personality . The Change The article by Drs . Jerome B. ' Wiesner and Herbert F. York in the October Scientific American marks a significant transition in U S. military thinking . In J.11e -I . . Di3.1.1.5 1 VIA ell/t/ VVieblle. / 1.1rJ 41/11.11-41 111ULC assess the usefulness of that agreement . And it is not only what they say that is significant but the fact that it is they who are saying it . York was chief scientist of the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson . Actually both men are scientists-engineers , ' as is Dr. George Kistiakowsky , who was science adviser to President Eisenhower and who has stated his agreenient with the Wiesner-York observations . These observations add up to a pr  --  cis of the present state of the nuclear missile race , based on ' unclassified information which appears in the article , and the classified information which both ' men possess in un- , excelled amplitude and depth . Of course , when he writes about matters ' of this sort , a scientist can not help using both kinds of information ; he has only one brain and it is not , divided , into classified and unclassified compartments . It is a novelty , however , for recently retired participants in high-level discussions to assure the reader that the arguments would not be modified if the authors were able to cite the classified information . One can remember when such a declaration would have been regarded as indiscreet , or worse , and the avowal in this case is itself important . Summed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us is that , i't is ' hopeless to try to defend against a massive nuclear attack . Peace is the only defense and the nuclear test ban has worked to the benefit of peace , and hence to the benefit of the U.S. As the U.S. military position gets stronger , the opponent takes appropriate counteraction and U S. military security declines . The same is true for the USSR , more so in fact Hence : " The clearly predictable course of the arms race-is a steady open spiral downward into oblivion . " And . " It is our considered professional judgment that this dilemma has no technical solution " ( Italics in original ) Only step-by-step disarmament will avail . A few years ago the unthinkable was being thought for the public by Herman Kahn . Though most of the scientific- brass never subscribed to Kahn 's views , they were not in a position to challenge the traditional military doctrine , rendered meaningless in the nuclear age , that the greater America 's " might , " the greater her security . Things are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so have the parameters of discussion . York and Wiesner can now say publicly what they know because ( although the public has not yet been told ) the groups of scientists and engineers they represent ( perhaps including some in uniform ) have won the behind-the-scenes battle in the Pentagon . In itself , the test ban represents only a modest retardation of the arms race , but after a year ' of it York and Wiesner can speak out . One may surmise that they are doing so , in this joint fashion , to give the word to the scientific ' community and thus lend further impulsion to the move toward sanity . Tiger in Your Tank In a single Saturday and Sunday recently , twenty-one young Americans died in automobile smashups . This was not one of the big holiday weekends ; it was pretty much routine Of course the youngsters do n't kill only themselves , often they take older folk with them , or the older folk manage without help from the young . In some states new records for fatalities and injuries are likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death toll may be the highest inalmost a quarter of a century . The national totals are little short of appalling , and a reaction is beginning to build up against the automobile industry which , with its long-established aversion to regulation of any kind , has exposed itself to the very criticism it resents . At the American Automobile Association convention an industry representative contended that the suggestions of independent safety experts were put forward " without proof that they were effective , acceptable to the public or economically justified " The industry stands pat on the contention that it is the best judge of car safety standards . If it sells , it is as safe as it needs to be ; the rest is up ' to the ' drivers and the police . With 44,000 people dead on the highways last year , it is doubtful that this laissez faire attitude can be maintained , Can not cars be made safer , so that catastrophic crashes will be fewer ? The Charleston ( W. Va . ) Gazette-Mail contends editorially that if Detroit were more safety-conscious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantially reduced . Collapsible steering assemblies , automatic fire-Protection systems , rollbars , shock-absorbing bumpers and the like certainly should ' be considered , even if the - 234 cars are less elegant and not as many buyers succumb to the enticing shapes of each year 's new models . In a sense , Detroit practically invites the more aggressive members of the community to go out and kill or ' be killed . The names of some of the cars are a clue to the psychology of the Detroit sales departments and a segment of the driving population . Nor is Detroit alone : you are invited to put a tiger into the gasoline tank of your Mustang , Barracuda , Sting Ray , Wildcat , Fury , Thunderbird , etc . Some of the most skilled operators drive sports cars , but these hot little vehicles also tempt some of the most harebrained . As Ogden Nash said , " Now every one horsepower mind has bought/a hundred horsepower juggernaut " ? or was it two hun-dred ? The Mustang is a case in point . By September 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) had been sold , corresponding to an annual rate of between 350,000 and 400,000 . The young particularly go for the Mustang . Says Ford 's marketing research manager , Seymour Marshak : " Nowadays a guy looks for a symbol of his youth . He wants to be . . . a live wire . Me , -I even get concerned when one of my four daughters looks at me and says , ' Daddy , you 're strictly from . Squaresville . ' " Ford . it seems , has a " gut feeling " about the Mustang ? which is fine if too many of the buyers do n't leave their guts on the pavement . Makes , of tires- are on the market which ; by their price alone , must be , suspected of being unsafe . Why shoUld there not be safety standards for tires , as well as for cars ? The federal government protects travelers by steamship , air and rail . Ninety per cent of interstate travel is now by automobile . It looks like a field in which federal regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Libel You are a public official and your constituents begin telling you that they have heard you have a " 100 per cent pro-Communist , America-last voting record , " and similar pleasant things . You check into the reports . Slander is nothing new in politics , but at least you would like to know who said it . You discover that by dialing a number anyone can listen to a tape-recorded tirade in which these statements are made by a voice not identified from a source not known . Then you try to find out in whose name the telephone is listed , and usually you encounter a blank wall . So , whom do you sue9 This has happened to Sen. Jacob Javits and to others , he tells about it at length in the October 2 Congressional Record . It is nothing new . Some time ago Sen. Thomas H. Kuchel complained of this anonymous slander technique , and The Nation commented editorially ( " For Whom the Bell Rings , " March 30 , 1964 , p. 310 ) . In this case the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ring " , Senator Javits suggests it should be called , " Let Hate be Heard " This outfit , based in Florida , is operating in that state , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania and Colorado . It has been organized nationally for some The NATION twenty Months and in that relatively brief period , according to Senator Javits , has preached that the higher echelons of the Defense establishment are working to deliver the country into the hands of the enemy , that American aid to Yugoslavia goes directly to the Soviet Union , and that the United Nations Children 's Emergency Fund , which feeds thousands of hungry children in various countries , " is one of the best examples of ' subversion . " With innuendo and outright lies , it has attacked , among others , Presidents Kennedy and Eisenhower , Chief Justice Warren , UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson and Eleanor Roosevelt . This wickedness continues without letup and is spreading Political pathology may be no worse in the United States than elsewhere  --  but we have far more telephones than any other nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure who is being knifed manages to ' find out in whose name the phone was installed There might still be a serious question of liability , because in theory a telephone con -- venation is in the realm of private communication . If that difficulty can be overcome , as it probably can , not only the persons who obtained the tapes locally may have to be identified , but also those who prepared them originally  --  who may be in another state . In any case there must be a test suit , with complicated and ' costly appellate litigation . ' ? - Aside ' from ' legal action , various measures may be taken to curb this spreading plague . The telephone companies can ' be made to take cognizance ' of abuses of this kind , which potentially can do more harm than bookmaking . This use of the telephone is a form of broadcasting , and the Federal Communications Cornmission may have jurisdiction . Then there is ' the weapon Senator Javits used  --  counterattack . The private citizen may also note that those who are slandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public interest and his own , deserve his vote . Barry and the Pilots An aviator in Los Angeles has formed a Pilots for Goldwater Club , named himself president and begun ' putting out releases , one of which asserts that 77 per cent of all commercial pilots support the Republican candidate . This is patent nonsense  --  no survey of the political beliefs of all pilots has ever been made , and none is likely ; pilots are highly individualistic , mobile to the extreme , and poor subjects for polling . Private conversations would seem to indicate that fliers are much like other voters ; some are for Johnson , some for Goldwater , , and a good many are still making up their minds . This last , group has a special , profes-sional interest in Goldwater 's dedication to States ' rights If the Republican candidate means what he says , he would give control of the airways and of the landing , fields , development of navigational and other safety devices , subsidy of small connecting lines back to the fifty states . Pilots who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day 's work know that States ' rights for aviation would mean chaos and disaster for the industry . Imagine 50 ' CABs ' controlling the planes in the air . If Goldwater means what he says , he can not expect many votes from the fliers ( or from anyone else in commercial aviation ) . And if he does n't mean what he says . . . ?
