txt ; trong indications of an early weak in the long-stalled grain iegotiations prompted the Cornnerce Department today to ? ap ) rove two licenses for the ex- ' sort of $40,640,000 worth of cheat to the Soviet Union . Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. , Jnder Secretary of Commerce , ; aid that no firm contracts had , 7et been signed , but that ? one seal was now " strongly anticipated . " The purchases would be for cash and would not require Government-backed credits - of the type that have aroused bitter and partisan debate in Congress . The compromise aid bill passed by the House and awaiting Senate approval gives President Johnson authority to approve such credit backing when he considers it in the national interest . Each of the two licenses approved is for $20,320,000 worth of wheat , or 350,000 tons . Could Add to Costs Presumably , Mr. Roosevelt said , the Soviet Union is prepared , at least in the contemplated deals , to meet the Administration 's requirement that half the , wheat be carried in American ships , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that condition because , rigidly applied , it could make the wheat up to $10 a ton more expensive than if it were shipped in foreign vessels . When President Kennedy . approved the sale of grains - , : to Communist countries last month , Moscow had been showing an interest in as much as 11 , i million tons , or $250 million worth of wheat . The stipulation at that time that all the grain be carried in American ships was rejected by Soviet negotiators . Later they seemed interested in a compronise to ship half in American ) ottoms  --  when available-and ialf in the less expensivei foraign carriers . Issue of Cash or Credit . Recently , in arranging for , the sale of 100,000 tons of wheat to Hungary , the Maritime ; Administration demonstrated that the " availability " clause , too , could lead to further compromise . It was found that the careful planning of shipments to coincide with the lack of the desired cargo ships could yield Administration rulings that no American shipping was available at a particular time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowing that they would male no purchases at " discriminatory " rates . The issuance of two licenses today was the first public indication that other Soviet representatives had entered contract talks with . American exporters . The Commerce Department refused to disclose the names of the negotiators on either side , or the place of negotiations . Each of the licenses- would become valid only after additional information is supplied to the department . That information would have to indicate compliance with the shipping rules . The issue of cash or credit has become important because of a Republican , move in the House of Representatives in recent weeks seeking to forbid Government guarantees for loans to Communist countries . The Administration believes that present law permits the backing of normal short-term commercial credits . Three votes were needed in the House in the last week to defeat the Republican move and to allow the President to guarantee credits if he deems it in the national interest . , The foreign aid bill containing this rider is expected to be approved by the Senate Monday . A Soviet interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Moscow had concluded a $500 million grain deal with Canada . 4uthorities in Canada said they could not supply all that the Russians needed after an extremely poor harvest . By early October* , ' Soviet diplomats confirmed their interest to American officials . The Administration encouraged private exporters to talk to Moscow 's representatives and on Oct. 9 formally signaled its willingness to license wheat exports . In diplomatic exchanges , the Russians had expressed fear that the wheat cargoes headed for the Soviet ports might not be loaded by American longshoremen . They readily agreed ; therefore , to an American promise that all ' the wheat would be taken in , United States ships and discovered only later ' that this would raise the delivery price . With the Administration committed to this bonanza . for American shippers and with . the Russians adamant about paying no more than world ' prices for shipping , the deal seemed in jeopardy . The search for a way out has been the purpose of most a the maneuvering by each side since then .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
