The question is no longer whether stereo sound is here to stay , but how long monaural sound can last . Today , three out of five phonographs sold are stereo , as are about half of all new LP records . Even the new monaural phonographs are now equipped to play stereo records without damaging them . So it seemed a natural step last week when Columbia , RCA Victor and Capitol Records announced they were eliminating the only competitive advantage that mono LPs have by raising their price $1 , making them as costly as stereo . <P> The move will undoubtedly spark some static in the pop LP market , where the biggest buyers are teenagers , who care more about money than modulation . But it will hardly ruffle classical buffs , who have long ago switched to dual channels . The long-term trend is unmistakable : like the 78-r.p.m. disk and the 10-in . LP before it , the mono LP appears to be headed for its final spin .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
