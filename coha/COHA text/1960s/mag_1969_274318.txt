Next to being in each other 's company , nothing appeals to young singles like doing something really different . Three Louisville real estate developers have announced a project that offers both attractions . In a neighborhood on the fringe of the downtown area , they will convert 24 huge , interconnected silos and a grain elevator into apartments for single people between the ages of 20 and 30 . <P> The three businessmen bought a big milling plant from the Pillsbury Co. for $550,000 , and the deserted 98-ft. - high silos , which once stored a million bushels of wheat , were part of the deal . At first they seemed a problem . " We thought of uses for all the buildings but - the silos , " recalls Joseph D. Travis Jr. , 48 , " and we knew they would be expensive to pull down . " Then Travis , remembering reports of California 's flourishing singles colonies , suggested to his partners , William C. Erwin Jr . and James E. Kavanaugh , that they could turn the silos into apartments for the young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Travis . <P> Circular Beds . Nonetheless , he brought in Architect Jasper D. Ward , who has a reputation for imaginative renovation . Two years ago , Ward transformed Louisville 's abandoned Illinois Central Railroad station into the nostalgically appointed Actors Theater . Ward concluded that the silos could in deed be converted into twelve-story apartment buildings for an estimated cost of $2,000,000 . Work will begin next January , and the first tenants are expected to move in in early 1971 . Plans call for installing floors either by pour ing cement into forms at every level or by affixing prefabricated circles . Jackhammers will cut windows and outside balcony spaces in the battleship-gray walls , which are eight inches thick , and elevators will be installed inside . On completion , the silos will have 132 circular apartments , including 84 split-levels , each 23 feet in diameter . In addition , there will be 24 rectangular apartments in the adjoining grain elevator . Rents , including utilities and furnishings ( even the beds will be circular ) , will range from $150 to $175 . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusions about the project 's appearance . " It will look like a bunch of silos with windows and balconies cut out every here and there , " he says . " We will do as little as possible to destroy the natural form of the silos . That 's the whole charm of the apartments . " <P> Though the neighborhood is undistinguished , it has the attraction of being close to the center of town . A number of prospective tenants have already sent in cash deposits for apartments . Inevitably , the local newspaper has produced a name for the singles who will move into the silos : " flour children . "
