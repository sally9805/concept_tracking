Have you made up your mind yet regarding my offer ? " " Yes , Madeleine , " said Sam , " and did anyone ever tell you how lovely you are when you 're angry ? " Brahma sprang forward off the throne . " How could you ? How could you tell ? " screamed the god . " I could n't , really , " said Sam . " Until now . It was just a guess , based upon some of your mannerisms of speech and gesture which I remembered . So you 've finally achieved your lifelong ambition , eh ? I 'll bet you 've got a harem , too .

The throne was a flame at his back . The veena thrummed on , dispassionately . He raised his scepter then and spoke : " Prepare yourself to receive the curse of Brahma . . . " he began . " Whatever for ? " asked Sam . " Because I guessed your secret ? If I am to be a god , what difference does it make ? Others must know of it . Are you angry because the only way I could learn your true identity was by baiting you a little ? I had assumed you would appreciate me the more if I demonstrated my worth by displaying my wit in this manner . If I have offended you , I do apologize . " " It is not because you guessed  --  or even because of the manner in which you guessed  --  but because you mocked me , that I curse you . " " Mocked you ? " said Sam . " I do not understand . I intended no disrespect . I was always on good terms with you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them , you will recall that this is true . Why should I jeopardize my position by mocking you now ?

I am sorry if you took it amiss . I 'll warrant you 've a harem I 'd envy , and which I 'll doubtless try to sneak into some night . If you 'd curse me for being surprised , then curse away . " He drew upon his pipe and wreathed his grin in smoke . Finally , Brahma chuckled . " I 'm a bit quick-tempered , ' t is true , "  | he explained , " and perhaps too touchy about my past . Of course , I 've often jested so with other men . You are forgiven . I withdraw my beginning curse . " And your decision , I take it , is to accept my offer ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam . " Good . I 've always felt a brotherly affection for you . Go now and summon my priest , that I may instruct him concerning your incarnation . I 'll see you soon . " " Sure thing , Lord Brahma . " Sam nodded and raised his pipe . Then he pushed back the row of shelves and sought the priest in the hall without . Various thoughts passed through his mind , but this time he let them remain unspoken . That evening , the prince held council with those of his retainers who had visited kinsmen and friends within Mahartha , and with those who had gone about through the town obtaining news and gossip . From these he learned that there were only ten Masters of Karma in Mahartha and that they kept their lodgings in a palace on the southeastern slopes above the city . They made scheduled visits to the clinics , or reading rooms , of the Temples , where the citizens presented themselves for judgment when they applied for renewal . The Hall of Karma itself was a massive black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person applied shortly after judgment to have his transfer made into his new body . Strake , along with two of his advisers , departed while daylight yet remained to make sketches of the palace fortifications . Two of the prince 's courtiers were dispatched across town to deliver an invitation to late dining and revelry to the Shan of Irabek , an old man and distant neighbor of Siddhartha 's with whom he had fought three bloody border skirmishes and occasionally hunted tiger . The Shan was visiting with relatives while waiting his appointment with the Masters of Karma . Another man was sent to the Street of the Smiths , where he requested of the metal workers that they double the prince 's order and have it ready by early morning . He took along additional money to ensure their cooperation . Later , the Shan of Irabek arrived at the Hostel of Hawkana , accompanied by six of his relatives , who were of the merchant caste but came armed as if they were warriors . Seeing that the hostel was a peaceable abode , however , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , they put aside their weapons and seated themselves near the head of the table , beside the prince . The Shan was a tall man , but his posture was considerably hunched . He wore maroon robes and a dark turban reaching down almost to his great , caterpillar-like eyebrows , which were the color of milk . His beard was a snowy bush , his teeth shown as dark stumps when he laughed and his lower eyelids jutted redly , as though sore and weary after so many years of holding back his bloodshot orbs in their obvious attempt to push themselves forward out of their sockets . He laughed a phlegmy laugh and pounded the table , repeating , " Elephants are too expensive these days , and no damn good at all in mud ! " for the sixth time ; this being in reference to their conversation as to the best time of year to fight a war . Only one very new in the business would be so boorish as to insult a neighbor 's ambassador during the rainy season , it was decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nouveau roi . As the evening wore on , the prince 's physician excused himself so as to superintend the preparation of the dessert and introduce a narcotic into the sweetcakes being served up to the Shan . As the evening wore further on , subsequent to the dessert , the Shan grew more and more inclined to close his eyes and let his head slump forward for longer and longer periods of time . " Good party , " he muttered , between snores , and finally , " Elephants are no damn good at all . . . " and so passed to sleep and could not be awakened . His kinsmen did not see fit to escort him home at this time , because of the fact that the prince 's physician had added chloral hydrate to their wine , and they were at that moment sprawled upon the floor , snoring . The prince 's chief courtier arranged with Hawkana for their accommodation , and the Shan himself was taken to Siddhartha 's suite , where he was shortly visited by the physician , who loosened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice : " Tomorrow afternoon , " he was saying , " you will be Prince Siddhartha and these will be your retainers . You will report to the Hall of Karma in their company , to claim there the body which Brahma has promised you without the necessity of prior judgment . You will remain Siddhartha throughout the transfer , and you will return here in the company of your retainers , to be examined by me . Do you understand ? " " Yes , " whispered the Shan.  | " Then repeat what I have told you . " " Tomorrow afternoon , " said the Shan , " I will be Siddhartha , commanding these retainers . . . " Bright bloomed the morning , and debts were settled beneath it . Half of the prince 's men rode out of the city , heading north . When they were out of sight of Mahartha they began circling to the southeast , working their way through the hills , stopping only to don their battle gear . Half a dozen men were dispatched to the Street of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the contents of which were divided into the pouches of three dozen men who departed after breakfast into the city . The prince took counsel with his physician , Narada , saying , " If I have misjudged the clemency of Heaven , then am I cursed indeed . " But the doctor smiled and replied , " I doubt you misjudged . " And so they passed from morning into the still center of day , the Ridge of the Gods golden above them . When their charges awakened , they ministered to their hangovers . The Shan was given a posthypnotic and sent with six of Siddhartha 's retainers to the Palace of the Masters . His kinsmen were assured that he remained sleeping in the prince 's quarters . " Our major risk at this point , " said the physician , " is the Shan . Will he be recognized ? The factors in our favor are that he is a minor potentate from a distant kingdom , he has only been in town for a short period of time , has spent most of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself for judgment . The Masters should still be unaware of your own physical appearance ? " " Unless I have been described to them by Brahma or his priest , " said the prince . " For all I know , my communication may have been taped and the tape relayed to them for identification purposes . " " Why , though , should this have been done ? " inquired Narada . " They should hardly expect stealth and elaborate precautions of one for whom they are doing a favor . No , I think we should be able to pull it off . The Shan would not be able to pass a probe , of course , hut he should pass surface scrutiny , accompanied as he is by your retainers . At the moment , he does believe he is Siddhartha , and he could pass any simple lie-detection test in that regard  --  which I feel is the most serious obstacle he might encounter . "  | So they waited , and the three dozen men returned with empty pouches , gathered their belongings , mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , as though in search of revelry , but actually drifting slowly in a southeasterly direction . " Good-bye , good Hawkana , " said the prince , as the remainder of his men packed and mounted . " I shall bear , as always , good report of your lodgings to all whom I meet about the land . I regret that my stay here must be so unexpectedly terminated , but I must ride to put down an uprising in the provinces as soon as I leave the Hall of Karma . You are aware of how these things spring up the moment a ruler 's back is turned . So , while I should have liked to spend another week beneath your roof , I fear that this pleasure must be postponed until another time . If any ask after me , tell them to seek me in Hades . " " Hades , my Lord ? " " It is the southernmost province of my kingdom , noted for its excessively warm weather . Be sure to phrase it just so , especially to the priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereabouts in days to come . " " I 'll do that , my Lord . " " And take especial care of the boy Dele . I expect to hear him play again on my next visit . " Hawkana bowed low and was about to begin a speech , so the prince decided upon that moment to toss him the final bag of coins and make an additional comment as to the wines of Urath  --  before mounting quickly and shouting orders to his men , in such a manner as to drown out any further conversation . Then they rode through the gateway and were gone , leaving behind only the physician and three warriors , whom he was to treat an additional day for an obscure condition having to do with the change of climate , before they rode on to catch up with the others . They passed through the town , using side streets , and came after a time to the roadway that led up toward the Palace of the Masters of Karma . As they passed along its length , Siddhartha exchanged secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hiding at various points off in the woods . When they had gone half the distance to the palace , the prince and the eight men who accompanied him drew rein and made as if to rest , waiting the while for the others to move abreast of them , passing carefully among the trees .  | Before long , however , they saw movement on the trail ahead . Seven riders were advancing on horseback , and the prince guessed them to be his six lancers and the Shan . When they came within hailing distance , they advanced to meet them . " Who are you ? " inquired the tall , sharp-eyed rider mounted upon the white mare . " Who are you that dares block the passage of Prince Siddhartha , Binder of Demons ? " The prince looked upon him  --  muscular and tanned , in his mid-twenties , possessed of hawklike features and a powerful bearing  --  and he felt suddenly that his doubts had been unfounded and that he had betrayed himself by his suspicion and mistrust . It appeared from the lithe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargained in good faith , authorizing for his use an excellent and sturdy body , which was now possessed by the ancient Shan . " Lord Siddhartha , " said his man , who had ridden at the side of the Lord of Irabek , " it appears that they dealt fairly . I see naught amiss about him . " " Siddhartha ! " cried the Shan . " Who is this one you dare address with the name of your master ? I am Siddhartha , Binder of ? " With that he threw his head back and his words gurgled in his throat . Then the fit hit the Shan . He stiffened , lost his seating and fell from the saddle . Siddhartha ran to his side . There were little flecks of foam at the corners of his mouth , and his eyes were rolled upward . " Epileptic ! " cried the prince . " They meant me to have a brain which had been damaged . " The others gathered around and helped the prince minister to the Shan until the seizure passed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened ? " he asked . " Treachery , " said Siddhartha . " Treachery , oh Shan of Irabek ! One of my men will convey you now to my personal physician , for an examination . After you have rested , I suggest you lodge a protest at Brahma 's reading room . My physician will treat you at Hawkana 's , and then you will be released . I am sorry this thing happened . It will probably be set aright . But if not , remember the last siege of Kapil and consider us even on all scores . Good afternoon , brother prince . " He bowed to the other , and his men helped the Shan to mount Hawkana 's bay , which Siddhartha had borrowed earlier . Mounting the mare , the prince observed their departure , then  | turned to the men who stood about him , and he spoke in a voice sufficiently loud to be heard by those who waited off the road : " The nine of us will enter . Two blasts upon the horn , and you others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been more prudent , for three more blasts upon the horn will bring the fifty lancers down from the hills , if they be needed . It is a palace of ease , and not a fort where battles would be fought . Take the Masters prisoner . Do not harm their machineries or allow others to do so . If they do not resist us , all well and good . If they do , we shall walk through the Palace and Hall of the Masters of Karma like a small boy across an extensive and excessively elaborate ant hill . Good luck . No gods be with you ! " And turning his horse , he headed on up the road , the eight lancers singing softly at his back . The prince rode through the wide double gate , which stood open and unguarded . He set immediately to wondering concerning secret defenses that Strake might have missed . The courtyard was landscaped and partly paved . In a large garden area , servants were at work pruning , trimming and cultivating . The prince sought after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he entered , but did not halt their labors . At the far end of the courtyard was the black stone Hall . He advanced in that direction , his horsemen following , until he was hailed from the steps of the palace itself , which lay to his right . He drew rein and turned to look in that direction . The man wore black livery , a yellow circle on his breast , and he carried an ebony staff . He was tall , heavy and muffled to the eyes . He did not repeat his salutation , but stood waiting . The prince guided his mount to the foot of the wide stairway . " I must speak to the Masters of Karma , " he stated . " Have you an appointment ? " inquired the man . " No , " said the prince , " but it is a matter of importance . " " Then I regret that you have made this trip for nothing , " replied the other . " An appointment is necessary . You may make arrangements at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stair with his staff , turned his back and began to move away . " Uproot that garden , " said the prince to his men , " cut down yonder trees , heap everything together and set a torch to it . "  | The man in black halted , turned again . Only the prince waited at the foot of the stair . His men were already moving off in the direction of the garden . " You ca n't do that , " said the man . The prince smiled . His men dismounted and began hacking at the shrubbery , kicking their way through the flower beds . " Tell them to stop ! " " Why should I ? I have come to speak with the Masters of Karma , and you tell me that I can not . I tell you that I can , and will . Let us see which of us is correct . " " Order them to stop , " said the other , " and I will bear your message to the Masters . " " Halt ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " The man in black mounted the stairs , vanished into the palace . The prince fingered the horn that hung on a cord about his neck . In a short while there was movement , and armed men began to emerge from the doorway . The prince raised his horn and gave wind to it twice . The men wore leather armor  --  some still buckling it hastily into place  --  and caps of the same material . Their sword arms were padded to the elbow , and they wore small , oval-shaped metal shields , bearing as device a yellow wheel upon a black field . They carried long , curved blades . They filled the stairway completely and stood as if waiting orders . The man in black emerged again , and he stood at the head of the stair . " Very well , " he stated , " if you have a message for the Masters , say it ! " " Are you a Master ? " inquired the prince . " I am . " " Then must your rank be lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as doorman . Let me speak to the Master in charge here . " " Your insolence will be repaid both now and in a life yet to come , " observed the Master . Then three dozen lancers rode through the gate and arrayed themselves at the sides of the prince . The eight who had begun the deflowering of the garden remounted their horses and moved to join the formation , blades laid bare across their laps . " Must we enter your palace on horseback ? " inquired the prince .  | " Or will you now summon the other Masters , with whom I wish to hold conversation ? " Close to eighty men stood upon the stair facing them , blades in hand . The Master seemed to weigh the balance of forces . He decided in favor of maintaining things as they were . " Do nothing rash , " he stated , " for my men will defend themselves in a particularly vicious fashion . Wait upon my return . I shall summon the others . " The prince filled his pipe and lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perspiration was most evident upon the faces of the foot soldiers who held the first rank on the stairway . The prince , to pass the time , observed to his lancers , " Do not think to display your skill as you did at the last siege of Kapil . Make target of the breast , rather than the head . " Also , " he continued , " think not to engage in the customary mutilation of the wounded and the slain  --  for this is a holy place and should not be profaned in such a manner . " On the other hand , " he added , " I shall take it as a personal affront if there are not ten prisoners for sacrifice to Nirriti the Black , my personal patron  --  outside these walls , of course , where observance of the Dark Feast will not be held so heavily against us There was a clatter to the right , as a foot soldier who had been staring up the length of Strake 's lance passed out and fell from the bottom stair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who emerged with six others ? similarly garbed  --  at the head of the stairway . " Do not profane the Palace of Karma with bloodshed . Already that fallen warrior 's blood is ? " " Rising to his cheeks , " finished the prince , " if he be conscious ? for he is not slain . " " What is it you want ? " The figure in black who was addressing him was of medium height , but of enormous girth . He stood like a huge , dark barrel , his staff a sable thunderbolt . " I count seven , " replied the prince . " I understand that ten Masters reside here . Where are the other three ? " " Those others are presently in attendance at three reading rooms in Mahartha . What is it you want of us ? " " You are in charge here ? " " Only the Great Wheel of the Law is in charge here . "  | " Are you the senior representative of the Great Wheel within these walls ? " " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you in private  --  over there , " said the prince , gesturing toward the black Hall . " Impossible ! " The prince knocked his pipe empty against his heel , scraped its bowl with the point of his dagger , replaced it in his pouch . Then he sat very erect upon the white mare and clasped the horn in his left hand . He met the Master 's eyes . " Are you absolutely certain of that ? " he asked . The Master 's mouth , small and bright , twisted around words he did not speak . Then : " As you say , " he finally acknowledged . " Make way for me here ! " and he passed down through the ranks of the warriors and stood before the white mare . The prince guided the horse with his knees , turning her in the direction of the dark Hall . " Hold ranks , for now ! " called out the Master . " The same applies , " said the prince to his men . The two of them crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You owe me a body , " he said in a soft voice . " What talk is this ? " said the Master . " I am Prince Siddhartha of Kapil , Binder of Demons . " " Siddhartha has already been served , " said the other . " So you think , " said the prince , " served up as an epileptic , by order of Brahma . This is not so , however . The man you treated earlier today was an unwilling impostor . I am the real Siddhartha , oh nameless priest , and I have come to claim my body  --  one that is whole and strong , and without hidden disease . You will serve me in this matter . You will serve inc willingly or unwillingly , but you will serve me . " " You think so ? " " I think so , " replied the prince . " Attack ! " cried the Master , and he swung his dark staff at the prince 's head . The prince ducked the blow and retreated , drawing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fell upon his shoulder , a glancing blow , but sufficient to stagger him . He circled around the  | white mare , pursued by the Master . Dodging , keeping the horse between himself and his opponent , he raised the horn to his lips and sounded it three times . Its notes rose above the fierce noises of the combat on the palace stair . Panting , he turned and raised his guard in time to ward off a temple blow that would surely have slain him had it landed . " It is written , " said the Master , almost sobbing out the words , " that he who gives orders without having the power to enforce them , that man is a fool . " " Even ten years ago , " panted the prince , " you 'd never have laid that staff on me . " He hacked at it , hoping to split the wood , but the other always managed to turn the edge of his blade , so that while he nicked it and shaved it in places , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using it as a singlestick , the Master laid a solid blow across the prince 's left side , and he felt his ribs break within him . . . . He fell . It was not by design that it happened , for the blade spun from out his hands as he collapsed ; but the weapon caught the Master across the shins and he dropped to his knees , howling . " We 're evenly matched , at that , " gasped the prince . " My age against your fat . . . " He drew his dagger as he lay there , but could not hold it steady . He rested his elbow on the ground . The Master , tears in his eyes , attempted to rise and fell again to his knees . There came the sound of many hooves . " I am not a fool , " said the prince , " and now I have the power to enforce my orders . " " What is happening ? " " The rest of my lancers are arrived . Had I entered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gekk in a woodpile , and it might have taken days to pull your palace apart and fetch you out . Now I have you in the palm of my hand . " The Master raised his staff . The prince drew back his arm . " Lower it , " he said , " or I 'll throw the dagger . I do n't know myself whether I 'll miss or hit , but I may hit . You 're not anxious to gamble against the real death , are you ? " The Master lowered his staff .  | " You will know the real death , " said the Master , " when the wardens of Karma have made dog meat of your horse soldiers . " The prince coughed , stared disinterestedly at his bloody spittle . " In the meantime , let 's discuss politics , " he suggested . After the sounds of battle had ended , it was Strake  --  tall , dusty , his hair near matching the gore that dried on his blade  --  Strake , who was nuzzled by the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is over . " " Do you hear that , Master of Karma ? " asked the prince . " Your wardens are dog meat . " The Master did not answer . " Serve me now and you may have your life , " said the prince . " Refuse , and I 'll have it . " " I will serve you , " said the Master . " Strake , " ordered the prince , " send two men down into the town ? one to fetch back Narada , my physician , and the other to go to the Street of the Weavers and bring here Jannaveg the sailmaker . Of the three lancers who remain at Hawkana 's , leave but one to hold the Shan of Irabek till sundown . He is then to bind him and leave him , joining us here himself . " Strake smiled and saluted . " Now bring men to bear me within the Hall , and to keep an eye on this Master . " He burned his old body , along with all the others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed in battle . Of the seven nameless Masters , only the one who had been fat survived . While the banks of sperm and ova , the growth tanks and the body lockers could not be transported , the transfer equipment itself was dismantled under the direction of Dr. Narada , and its components were loaded onto the horses of those who had fallen in the battle . The young prince sat upon the white mare and watched the jaws of flame close upon the bodies . Eight pyres blazed against the predawn sky . The one who had been a sailmaker turned his eyes to the pyre nearest the gate ? the last to be ignited , its flames were only just now reaching the top , where lay the gross bulk of one who wore a robe of black , a circle of yellow on the breast . When the flames touched it and the robe began to smoulder , the dog who cowered in the ruined garden raised his head in a howl that was near to a sob .  | " This day your sin account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But , ah , my prayer account ! " replied the prince . " I 'll stand on that for the time being . Future theologians will have to make the final decision , though , as to the acceptability of all those slugs in the pray-o-mats .

Into the mountains for a while , and then our separate ways , for safety 's sake . I am not sure as to the road I will follow , save that it leads to Heaven 's gate and I must go armed . " " Binder of Demons , " said the other , and he smiled . The lancer chief approached . The prince nodded to him . Orders were shouted . The columns of mounted men moved forward , passed out through the gates of the Palace of Karma , turned off the roadway and headed up the slope that lay to the southeast of the city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | It is said that , when the Teacher appeared , those of all castes went to hear his teachings , as well as animals , gods and an occasional saint , to come away improved and uplifted . It was generally conceded that he had received enlightenment , except by those who believed him to be a fraud , sinner , criminal or practical joker . These latter ones were not all to be numbered as his enemies ; but , on the other hand , not all of those improved and uplifted could be counted as his friends and supporters . His followers called him Mahasamatman and some said he was a god . So , after it was seen that he had been accepted as a teacher , was looked upon with respect , had many of the wealthy numbered as his supporters and had gained a reputation reaching far across the land , he was referred to as Tathagatha , meaning He Who Has Achieved . It must be noted that while the goddess Kali ( sometimes known as Durga in her softer moments ) never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did render him the singular honor of dispatching her holy executioner to pay him her tribute , rather than a mere hired assassin . . . . There is no disappearing of the true Dhamma until a false Dhamma arises in the world . When the false Dhamma arises , he makes the true Dhamma to disappear . Samyutta-nikaya ( II , 224 ) NEAR the city of Alundil there was a rich grove of blue-barked trees , having purple foliage like feathers . It was famous for its beauty and the shrinelike peace of its shade . It had been the property of the merchant Vasu until his conversion , at which time he had presented it to the teacher variously known as Mahasamatman , Tathagatha and the Enlightened One . In that wood did this teacher abide with his followers , and when they walked forth into the town at midday their begging bowls never went unfilled .  | There was always a large number of pilgrims about the grove . The believers , the curious and those who preyed upon the others were constantly passing through it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came on foot . Alundil was not an overly large city . It had its share of thatched huts , as well as wooden bungalows ; its main roadway was unpaved and rutted ; it had two large bazaars and many small ones ; there were wide fields of grain , owned by the Vaisyas , tended by the Sudras , which flowed and rippled , blue-green , about the city ; it had many hostels ( though none so fine as the legendary hostel of Hawkana , in far Mahartha ) , because of the constant passage of travelers ; it had its holy men and its storytellers ; and it had its Temple . The Temple was located on a low hill near the center of town , enormous gates on each of its four sides.These gates , and the walls about them , were filled with layer upon layer of decorative carvings , showing musicians and dancers , warriors and demons , gods and goddesses , animals and artists , lovemakers and half-people , guardians and devas . These gates led into the first courtyard , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the second courtyard . The first courtyard contained a little bazaar , where offerings to the gods were sold . It also housed numerous small shrines dedicated to the lesser deities . There were begging beggars , meditating holy men , laughing children , gossiping women , burning incenses , singing birds , gurgling purification tanks and humming pray-o-mats to be found in this courtyard at any hour of the day . The inner courtyard , though , with its massive shrines dedicated to the major deities , was a focal point of religious intensity . People chanted or shouted prayers , mumbled verses from the Vedas , or stood , or knelt , or lay prostrate before huge stone images , which often were so heavily garlanded with flowers , smeared with red kumkum paste and surrounded by heaps of offerings that it was impossible to tell which deity was so immersed in tangible adoration . Periodically , the horns of the Temple were blown , there was a moment 's hushed appraisal of their echo and the clamor began again . And none would dispute the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white-stone statue , within its gigantic shrine , dominated the inner courtyard . Her faint smile , perhaps contemptuous of the other gods and their worshipers , was , in its way , as arresting as the chained grins of the skulls she wore for a necklace . She held daggers in her hands ; and poised in mid-step she stood , as  | though deciding whether to dance before or slay those who came to her shrine . Her lips were full , her eyes were wide . Seen by torchlight , she seemed to move . It was fitting , therefore , that her shrine faced upon that of Yama , god of Death . It had been decided , logically enough , by the priests and architects , that he was best suited of all the deities to spend every minute of the day facing her , matching his unfaltering deathgaze against her own , returning her half smile with his twisted one . Even the most devout generally made a detour rather than pass between the two shrines ; and after dark their section of the courtyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untroubled by late worshipers . From out of the north , as the winds of spring blew across the land , there came the one called Rild . A small man , whose hair was white , though his years were few  --  Rild , who wore the dark trappings of a pilgrim , but about whose forearm , when they found him lying in a ditch with the fever , was wound the crimson strangling cord of his true profession : Rild . Rild came in the spring , at festival-time , to Alundil of the bluegreen fields , of the thatched huts and the bungalows of wood , of unpaved roadways and many hostels , of bazaars and holy men and storytellers , of the great religious revival and its Teacher , whose reputation had spread far across the land  --  to Alundil of the Temple , where his patron goddess was queen . Festival-time . Twenty years earlier , Alundil 's small festival had been an almost exclusively local affair . Now , though , with the passage of countless travelers , caused by the presence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Path , the Festival of Alundil attracted so many pilgrims that local accommodations were filled to overflowing . Those who possessed tents could charge a high fee for their rental . Stables were rented out for human occupancy . Even bare pieces of land were let as camping sites . Alundil loved its Buddha . Many other towns had tried to entice him away from his purple grove : Shengodu , Flower of the Mountains , had offered him a palace and harem to come bring his teaching to the slopes . But the Enlightened One did not go to the mountain . Kannaka , of the Serpent River , had offered him elephants and ships , a town house and a country villa , horses and servants , to  | come and preach from its wharves . But the Enlightened One did not go to the river . The Buddha remained in his grove and all things came to him . With the passage of years the festival grew larger and longer and more elaborate , like a well-fed dragon , scales all a-shimmer . The local Brahmins did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his presence filled their coffers to overflowing ; so they learned to live in his squat shadow , never voicing the word tirthika  --  heretic . So the Buddha remained in his grove and all things came to him , including Rild . Festival-time . The drums began in the evening on the third day . On the third day , the massive drums of the kathakali began their rapid thunder . The miles-striding staccato of the drums carried across the fields to the town , across the town , across the purple grove and across the wastes of marshland that lay behind it . The drummers , wearing white mundus , bare to the waist , their dark flesh glistening with perspiration , worked in shifts , so strenuous was the mighty beating they set up ; and never was the flow of sound broken , even as the new relay of drummers moved into position before the tightly stretched heads of the instruments . As darkness arrived in the world , the travelers and townsmen who had begun walking as soon as they heard the chatter of the drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battlefield of old . There they found places and waited for the night to deepen and the drama to begin , sipping the sweet-smelling tea that they purchased at the stalls beneath the trees . A great brass bowl of oil , tall as a man , wicks hanging down over its edges , stood in the center of the field . These wicks were lighted , and torches flickered beside the tents of the actors . The drumming , at close range , was deafening and hypnotic , the rhythms complicated , syncopated , insidious . As midnight approached , the devotional chanting began , rising and falling with the drumbeat , working a net about the senses . There was a brief lull as the Enlightened One and his monks arrived , their yellow robes near-orange in the flamelight . But they threw back their cowls and seated themselves cross-legged upon the  | ground . After a time , it was only the chanting and the voices of the drums that filled the minds of the spectators . When the actors appeared , gigantic in their makeup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no applause , only rapt attention . The kathakali dancers were famous , trained from their youth in acrobatics as well as the ages-old patterns of the classical dance , knowing the nine distinct movements of the neck and of the eyeballs and the hundreds of hand positions required to re-enact the ancient epics of love and battle , of the encounters of gods and demons , of the valiant fights and bloody treacheries of tradition . The musicians shouted out the words of the stories as the actors , who never spoke , portrayed the awesome exploits of Rama and of the Pandava brothers . Wearing makeup of green and red , or black and stark white , they stalked across the field , skirts billowing , their mirror-sprinkled halos glittering in the light of the lamp . Occasionally , the lamp would flare or sputter , and it was as if a nimbus of holy or unholy light played about their heads , erasing entirely the sense of the event , causing the spectators to feel for a moment that they themselves were the illusion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only real things in the world . The dance would continue until daybreak , to end with the rising of the sun . Before daybreak , however , one of the wearers of the saffron robe arrived from the direction of town , made his way through the crowd and spoke into the ear of the Enlightened One . The Buddha began to rise , appeared to think better of it and reseated himself . He gave a message to the monk , who nodded and departed from the field of the festival . The Buddha , looking imperturbable , returned his attention to the drama . A monk seated nearby noted that he was tapping his fingers upon the ground , and he decided that the Enlightened One must be keeping time with the drumbeats , for it was common knowledge that he was above such things as impatience . When the drama had ended and Surya the sun pinked the skirts of Heaven above the eastern rim of the world , it was as if the night just passed had held the crowd prisoner within a tense and frightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary , to wander this day . The Buddha and his followers set off walking immediately , in the direction of the town . They did not pause to rest along the way , but passed through Alundil at a rapid but dignified gait .  | When they came again to the purple grove , the Enlightened One instructed his monks to take rest , and he moved off in the direction of a small pavilion located deep within the wood . The monk who had brought the message during the drama sat within the pavilion . There he tended the fever of the traveler he had come upon in the marshes , where he walked often to better meditate upon the putrid condition his body would assume after death . Tathagatha studied the man who lay upon the sleeping mat . His lips were thin and pale ; he had a high forehead , high cheekbones , frosty eyebrows , pointed ears ; and Tathagatha guessed that when those eyelids rose , the eyes revealed would be of a faded blue or gray . There was a quality of  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which might have been caused partly by the fevers that racked his body , but which could not be attributed entirely to them . The small man did not give the impression of being one who would bear the thing that Tathagatha now raised in his hands . Rather , on first viewing , he might seem to be a very old man . If one granted him a second look , and realized then that his colorless hair and his slight frame did not signify advanced age , one might then be struck by something childlike about his appearance . From the condition of his complexion , Tathagatha doubted that he need shave very often . Perhaps a slightly mischievous pucker was now hidden somewhere between his cheeks and the corners of his mouth . Perhaps not , also . The Buddha raised the crimson strangling cord , which was a thing borne only by the holy executioners of the goddess Kali . He fingered its silken length , and it passed like a serpent through his hand , clinging slightly . He did not doubt but that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . Almost unconsciously , he held it and twisted his hands through the necessary movements . Then he looked up at the wide-eyed monk who had watched him , smiled his imperturable smile and laid the cord aside . With a damp cloth , the monk wiped the perspiration from the pale brow . The man on the sleeping mat shuddered at the contact , and his eyes snapped open . The madness of the fever was in them and they did not truly see , but Tathagatha felt a sudden jolt at their contact . Dark , so dark they were almost jet , and it was impossible to tell where the pupil ended and the iris began . There was something ex-  | tremely unsettling about eyes of such power in a body so frail and effete . He reached out and stroked the man 's hands , and it was like touching steel , cold and impervious . He drew his fingernail sharply across the back of the right hand . No scratch or indentation marked its passage , and his nail fairly slid , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thumbnail and released it . There was no sudden change of color . It was as though these hands were dead or mechanical things . He continued his examination . The phenomenon ended somewhat above the wrists , occurred again in other places . His hands , breast , abdomen , neck and portions of his back had soaked within the death bath , which gave this special unyielding power . Total immersion would , of course , have proved fatal ; but as it was , the man had traded some of his tactile sensitivity for the equivalent of invisible gauntlets , breastplate , neckpiece and back armor of steel . He was indeed one of the select assassins of the terrible goddess . " Who else knows of this man ? " asked the Buddha . " The monk Simha , " replied the other , " who helped me bear him here . " " Did he see " ? Tathagatha gestured with his eyes toward the crimson cord ? " that ? " he inquired . The monk nodded . " Then go fetch him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything of this to anyone , other than that a pilgrim was taken ill and we are tending him here . I will personally take over his care and minister to his illness . " " Yes , Illustrious One . " The monk hurried forth from the pavilion . Tathagatha seated himself beside the sleeping mat and waited . It was two days before the fever broke and intelligence returned to those dark eyes . But during those two days , anyone who passed by the pavilion might have heard the voice of the Enlightened One droning on and on , as though he addressed his sleeping charge . Occasionally , the man himself mumbled and spoke loudly , as those in a fever often do . On the second day , the man opened his eyes suddenly and stared upward . Then he frowned and turned his head . " Good morning , Rild , " said Tathagatha.  | " You are . . . ? " asked the other , in an unexpected baritone . " One who teaches the way of liberation , " he replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such . " " Tathagatha ? " " This name , too , have I been given . " The other attempted to rise , failed , settled back . His eyes never left the placid countenance . " How is it that you know my name ? " he finally asked . " In your fever you spoke considerably . " " Yes , I was very sick , and doubtless babbling . It was in that cursed swamp that I took the chill . " Tathagatha smiled . " One of the disadvantages of traveling alone is that when you fall there is none to assist you . " " True , " acknowledged the other , and his eyes closed once more and his breathing deepened . Tathagatha remained in the lotus posture , waiting . When Rild awakened again , it was evening . " Thirsty , " he said . Tathagatha gave him water . " Hungry ? " he asked . " No , not yet . My stomach would rebel . " He raised himself up onto his elbows and stared at his attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are the one , " he announced . " Yes , " replied the other . " What are you going to do ? " " Feed you , when you say you are hungry . " " I mean , after that . " " Watch as you sleep , lest you lapse again into the fever . " " That is not what I meant . " " I know . " " After I have eaten and rested and recovered my strength  --  what then ? " Tathagatha smiled as he drew the silken cord from somewhere beneath his robe . " Nothing , " he replied , " nothing at all , " and he draped the cord across Rild 's shoulder and withdrew his hand . The other shook his head and leaned back . He reached up and fingered the length of crimson . He twined it about his fingers and then about his wrist . He stroked it . " It is holy , " he said , after a time .  | " So it would seem . " " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . " " Why then will you do nothing at all ? " " I have no need to move or to act All things come to me . If anything is to be done , it is you who will do it . " " I do not understand . " " I know that , too . " The man stared into the shadows overhead . " I will attempt to eat now , " he announced . Tathagatha gave him broth and bread , which he managed to keep down . Then he drank more water , and when he had finished he was breathing heavily . " You have offended Heaven , " he stated . " Of that , I am aware . " " And you have detracted from the glory of a goddess , whose supremacy here has always been undisputed . " " I know . " " But I owe you my life , and I have eaten your bread . . . " There was no reply . " Because of this , I must break a most holy vow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Tathagatha . " " Then I owe my life to the fact that you owe me yours . Let us consider the life-owing balanced . " Rild uttered a short chuckle . " So be it , " he said . " What will you do , now that you have abandoned your mission ? " " I do not know . My sin is too great to permit me to return . Now I , too , have offended against Heaven , and the goddess will turn away her face from my prayers . I have failed her . " " Such being the case , remain here . You will at least have company in damnation . " " Very well , " agreed Rild . " There is nothing else left to me . " He slept once again , and the Buddha smiled . In the days that followed , as the festival wore on , the Enlightened One preached to the crowds who passed through the purple grove . He spoke of the unity of all things , great and small , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illusion of the world , of the spark of the atman , of the way of salvation through renunciation of the self and union with the whole ; he spoke of realization and en-  | lightenment , of the meaninglessness of the Brahmins ' rituals , comparing their forms to vessels empty of content . Many listened , a few heard and some remained in the purple grove to take up the saffron robe of the seeker . And each time he taught , the man Rild sat nearby , wearing his black garments and leather harness , his strange dark eyes ever upon the Enlightened One . Two weeks after his recovery , Rild came upon the teacher as he walked through the grove in meditation . He fell into step beside him , and after a time he spoke . " Enlightened One , I have listened to your teachings , and I have listened well . Much have I thought upon your words . " The other nodded . " I have always been a religious man , " he stated , " or I would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After it became impossible for me to fulfill my mission , I felt a great emptiness . I had failed my goddess , and life was without meaning for me . " The other listened , silently . " But I have heard your words , " he said , " and they have filled me with a kind of joy . They have shown me another way to salvation , a way which I feel to be superior to the one I previously followed . " The Buddha studied his face as he spoke . " Your way of renunciation is a strict one , which I feel to be good . It suits my needs . Therefore , I request permission to be taken into your community of seekers , and to follow your path . " " Are you certain , " asked the Enlightened One , " that you do not seek merely to punish yourself for what has been weighing upon your conscience as a failure , or a sin ? " " Of that I am certain , " said Rild . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they contain . In the service of the goddess have I slain more men than purple fronds upon yonder bough . I am not even counting women and children . So I am not easily taken in by words , having heard too many , voiced in all tones of speech  --  words pleading , arguing , cursing . But your words move me , and they are superior to the teachings of the Brahmins . Gladly would I become your executioner , dispatching for you your enemies with a saffron cord  --  or with a blade , or pike , or with my hands , for I am proficient with all weapons , having spent three lifetimes learning their use  --  but I know that such is not your way . Death and life are  | as one to you , and you do not seek the destruction of your enemies . So I request entrance to your Order . For me , it is not so difficult a thing as it would be for another . One must renounce home and family , origin and property . I lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I have already done . All I need now is the yellow robe . " " It is yours , " said Tathagatha , " with my blessing . " Rild donned the robe of a buddhist monk and took to fasting and meditating . After a week , when the festival was near to its close , he departed into the town with his begging bowl , in the company of the other monks . He did not return with them , however . The day wore on into evening , the evening into darkness . The horns of the Temple had already sounded the last notes of the nagaswaram , and many of the travelers had since departed the festival . For a long while , the Enlightened One walked the woods , meditating . Then he , too , vanished . Down from the grove , with the marshes at its back , toward the town of Alundil , above which lurked the hills of rock and around which lay the blue-green fields , into the town of Alundil , still astir with travelers , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets of Alundil toward the hill with its Temple , walked the Buddha . He entered the first courtyard , and it was quiet there . The dogs and children and beggars had gone away . The priests slept . One drowsing attendant sat behind a bench at the bazaar . Many of the shrines were now empty , the statues having been borne within . Before several of the others , worshipers knelt in late prayer . He entered the inner courtyard . An ascetic was seated on a prayer mat before the statue of Ganesha . He , too , seemed ' to qualify as a statue , making no visible movements . Four oil lamps flickered about the yard , their dancing light serving primarily to accentuate the shadows that lay upon most of the shrines . Small votive lights cast a faint illumination upon some of the statues . Tathagatha crossed the yard and stood facing the towering figure of Kali , at whose feet a tiny lamp blinked . Her smile seemed a plastic and moving thing , as she regarded the man before her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of her dagger , lay a crimson strangling cord . Tathagatha smiled back at her , and she seemed almost to frown at that moment .  | " It is a resignation , my dear , " he stated . " You have lost this round . " She seemed to nod in agreement . " I am pleased to have achieved such a height of recognition in so short a period of time , " he continued . " But even if you had succeeded , old girl , it would have done you little good . It is too late now . I have started something which you can not undo . Too many have heard the ancient words . You had thought they were lost , and so did I. But we were both wrong . The religion by which you rule is very ancient , goddess , but my protest is also that of a venerable tradition . So call me a protestant , and remember  --  now I am more than a man . Good night . " He left the Temple and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been fixed upon his back . It was many months before the miracle occurred , and when it did , it did not seem a miracle , for it had grown up slowly about them . Rild , who had come out of the north as the winds of spring blew across the land , wearing death upon his arm and the black fire within his eyes  --  Rild , of the white brows and pointed ears  --  spoke one afternoon , after the spring had passed , when the long days of summer hung warm beneath the Bridge of the Gods . He spoke , in that unexpected baritone , to answer a question asked him by a traveler . The man asked him a second question , and then a third . He continued to speak , and some of the other monks and several pilgrims gathered about him . The answers following the questions , which now came from all of them , grew longer and longer , for they became parables , examples , allegories . Then they were seated at his feet , and his dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as from Heaven , clear and soft , melodic and persuasive . They listened , and then the travelers went their way . But they met and spoke with other travelers upon the road , so that , before the summer had passed , pilgrims coming to the purple grove were asking to meet this disciple of the Buddha 's , and to hear his words also . Tathagatha shared the preaching with him . Together , they taught of the Way of the Eightfold Path , the glory of Nirvana , the illusion of the world and the chains that the world lays upon a man . And then there were times when even the soft-spoken Tathagatha  | listened to the words of his disciple , who had digested all of the things he had preached , had meditated long and fully upon them and now , as though he had found entrance to a secret sea , dipped with his steel-hard hand into places of hidden waters , and then sprinkled a thing of truth and beauty upon the heads of the hearers . Summer passed . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightenment : Tathagatha and his small disciple , whom they called Sugata . It was even said that Sugata was a healer , and that when his eyes shone strangely and the icy touch of his hands came upon a twisted limb , that limb grew straight again . It was said that a blind man 's vision had suddenly returned to him during one of Sugata 's sermons . There were two things in which Sugata believed : the Way of Salvation and Tathagatha , the Buddha . " Illustrious One , " he said to him one day , " my life was empty until you revealed to me the True Path . When you received your enlightenment , before you began your teaching , was it like a rush of fire and the roaring of water and you everywhere and a part of everything  --  the clouds and the trees , the animals in the forest , all people , the snow on the mountaintop and the bones in the field ? " " Yes , " said Tathagatha . " I , also , know the joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know , " said Tathagatha . " I see now why once you said that all things come to you . To have brought such a doctrine into the world  --  I can see why the gods were envious . Poor gods ! They are to be pitied . But you know . You know all things . " Tathagatha did not reply . When the winds of spring blew again across the land , the year having gone full cycle since the arrival of the second Buddha , there came one day from out of the heavens a fearful shrieking . The citizens of Alundil turned out into their streets to stare up at the sky . The Sudras in the fields put by their work and looked upward . In the great Temple on the hill there was a sudden silence . In the purple grove beyond the town , the monks turned their heads . It paced the heavens , the one who was born to rule the wind . . . . From out of the north it came  --  green and red , yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance , its way was the air . . . .  | There came another shriek , and then the beating of mighty pinions as it climbed past clouds to become a tiny dot of black . And then it fell , like a meteor , bursting into flame , all of its colors blazing and burning bright , as it grew and grew , beyond all belief that anything could live at that size , that pace , that magnificence . . . . Half spirit , half bird , legend darkening the sky . Mount of Vishnu , whose beak smashes chariots . The Garuda Bird circled above Alundil . Circled , and passed beyond the hills of rock that stood behind the city . " Garuda ! " The word ran through the town , the fields , the Temple , the grove . If he did not fly alone ; it was known that only a god could use the Garuda Bird for a mount . There was silence . After those shrieks and that thunder of pinions , voices seemed naturally to drop to a whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grove , his monks moving about him , facing in the direction of the hills of rock . Sugata came to his side and stood there . " It was but a spring ago . . . " he said . Tathagatha nodded . " Rild failed , " said Sugata . " What new thing comes from Heaven ? " The Buddha shrugged . " I fear for you , my teacher , " he said . " In all my lifetimes , you have been my only friend . Your teaching has given me peace . Why can they not leave you alone ? You are the most harmless of men , and your doctrine the gentlest . What ill could you possibly bear them ? " The other turned away . At that moment , with a mighty beating of the air and a jagged cry from its opened beak , the Garuda Bird rose once more above the hills . This time , it did not circle over the town , but climbed to a great height in the heavens and swept off to the north . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone in a matter of moments . " Its passenger has dismounted and remains behind , " suggested Sugata . The Buddha walked within the purple grove . He came from beyond the hills of stone , walking . He came to a passing place through stone , and he followed this trail , his red leather boots silent on the rocky path .  | Ahead , there was a sound of running water , from where a small stream cut across his way . Shrugging his blood-bright cloak back over his shoulders , he advanced upon a bend in the trail , the ruby head of his scimitar gleaming in his crimson sash . Rounding a corner of stone , he came to a halt . One waited ahead , standing beside the log that led across the stream . His eyes narrowed for an instant , then he moved forward again . It was a small man who stood there , wearing the dark garments of a pilgrim , caught about with a leather harness from which was suspended a short , curved blade of bright steel . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small lock of white hair . His eyebrows were white above eyes that were dark , and his skin was pale ; his ears appeared to be pointed . The traveler raised his hand and spoke to this man , saying , " Good afternoon , pilgrim . " The man did not reply , but moved to bar his way , positioning himself before the log that led across the stream . " Pardon me , good pilgrim , but I am about to cross here and you are making my passage difficult , " he stated . " You are mistaken , Lord Yama , if you think you are about to pass here , " replied the other . The One in Red smiled , showing a long row of even , white teeth . " It is always a pleasure to be recognized , " he acknowledged , " even by one who conveys misinformation concerning other matters . " " I do not fence with words , " said the man in black . " Oh ? " The other raised his eyebrows in an expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence , sir ? Surely not that piece of bent metal you bear . " " None other . " " I took it for some barbarous prayer-stick at first . I understand that this is a region fraught with strange cults and primitive sects . For a moment , I took you to be a devotee of some such superstition . But if , as you say , it is indeed a weapon , then I trust you are familiar with its use ? " " Somewhat , " replied the man in black . " Good , then , " said Yama , " for I dislike having to kill a man who does not know what he is about . I feel obligated to point out to you , however , that when you stand before the Highest for judgment , you will be accounted a suicide . "  | The other smiled faintly . " Any time that you are ready , deathgod , I will facilitate the passage of your spirit from out its fleshy envelope . " " One more item only , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick end to conversation . Give me a name to tell the priests , so that they shall know for whom they offer the rites . " " I renounced my final name but a short while back , " answered the other . " For this reason , Kali 's consort must take his death of one who is nameless . " " Rild , you are a fool , " said Yama , and drew his blade . The man in black drew his . " And it is fitting that you go unnamed to your doom . You betrayed your goddess . " " Life is full of betrayals , " replied the other , before he struck . " By opposing you now and in this manner , I also betray the teachings of my new master . But I must follow the dictates of my heart . Neither my old name nor my new do therefore fit me , nor are they deserved  --  so call me by no name ! " Then his blade was fire , leaping everywhere , clicking , blazing . Yama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot , moving only his wrist as he parried the blows that fell about him . Then , after he had retreated ten paces , he stood his ground and would not be moved . His parries widened slightly , but his ripostes became more sudden now , and were interspersed with feints and unexpected attacks . They swaggered blades till their perspiration fell upon the ground in showers ; and then Yama began to press the attack , slowly , forcing his opponent into a retreat . Step by step , he recovered the ten paces he had given . When they stood again upon the ground where the first blow had been struck , Yama acknowledged , over the clashing of steel , " Well have you learned your lessons , Rild ! Better even than I had thought ! Congratulations ! " As he spoke , his opponent wove his blade through an elaborate double feint and scored a light touch that cut his shoulder , drawing blood that immediately merged with the color of his garment . At this , Yama sprang forward , beating down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of his neck that might have decapitated him .  | The man in black raised his guard , shaking his head , parried another attack and thrust forward , to be parried again himself . " So , the death bath collars your throat , " said Yama . " I 'll seek entrance elsewhere , then , " and his blade sang a faster song , as he tried for a low-line thrust . Yama unleashed the full fury of that blade , backed by the centuries and the masters of many ages . Yet , the other met his attacks , parrying wider and wider , retreating faster and faster now , but still managing to hold him off as he backed away , counterthrusting as he went . He retreated until his back was to the stream . Then Yama slowed and made comment : " Half a century ago , " he stated , " when you were my pupil for a brief time , I said to myself , This one has within him the makings of a master . ' Nor was I wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in all the ages I can remember . I can almost forgive apostasy when I witness your skill . It is indeed a pity . He feinted then a chest cut , and at the last instant moved around the parry so that he lay the edge of his weapon high upon the other 's wrist . Leaping backward , parrying wildly and cutting at Yama 's head , the man in black came into a position at the head of the log that lay above the crevice that led down to the stream . " Your hand , too , Rild ! Indeed , the goddess is lavish with her protection . Try this ! " The steel screeched as he caught it in a bind , nicking the other 's bicep as he passed about the blade . " Aha ! There 's a place she missed ! " he cried . " Let 's try for an-other ! " Their blades bound and disengaged , feinted , thrust , parried , riposted . Yama met an elaborate attack with a stop-thrust , his longer blade again drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black stepped up upon the log , swinging a vicious head cut , which Yama beat away . Pressing the attack then even harder , Yama forced him to back out upon the log and then he kicked at its side . The other jumped backward , landing upon the opposite bank . As  | soon as his feet touched ground , he , too , kicked out , causing the log to move . It rolled , before Yama could mount it , slipping free of the banks , crashing down into the stream , bobbing about for a moment , and then following the water trail westward . " I 'd say it is only a seven- or eight-foot jump , Yama ! Come on across ! " cried the other . The deathgod smiled . " Catch your breath quickly now , while you may , " he stated . " Breath is the least appreciated gift of the gods . None sing hymns to it , praising the good air , breathed by king and beggar , master and dog alike . But , oh to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though it were your last  --  for that one , too , is near at hand ! " " You are said to be wise in these matters , Yama , " said the one who had been called Rild and Sugata . " You are said to be a god , whose kingdom is death and whose knowledge extends beyond the ken of mortals . I would question you , therefore , while we are standing idle . " Yama did not smile his mocking smile , as he had to all his opponent 's previous statements . This one had a touch of ritual about it . " What is it that you wish to know ? I grant you the death-boon of a question . " Then , in the ancient words of the Katha Upanishad , the one who had been called Rild and Sugata chanted : " There is doubt concerning a man when he is dead . Some say he still exists . Others say he does not . This thing I should like to know , taught by you . " Yama replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gods have their doubts . It is not easy to understand , for the nature of the atman is a subtle thing . Ask me another question . Release me from this boon ! ' " " Forgive me if it is foremost in my mind , oh Death , but another teacher such as yourself can not be found , and surely there is no other boon which I crave more at this moment . ' " " Keep your life and go your way , ' " said Yama , plunging his blade again into his sash . " I release you from your doom . Choose sons and grandsons ; choose elephants , horses , herds of cattle and gold . Choose any other boon  --  fair maidens , chariots , musical instruments . I shall give them unto you and they shall wait upon you . But ask me not of death . ' "  | " Oh Death , ' " sang the other , " ' these endure only till tomorrow . Keep your maidens , horses , dances and songs for yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have asked  --  tell me , oh Death , of that which lies beyond life , of which men and the gods have their doubts . ' " Yama stood very still and he did not continue the poem . " Very well , Rild , " he said , his eyes locking with the other 's , " but it is not a kingdom subject to words . I must show you . " They stood , so , for a moment ; and then the man in black swayed . He threw his arm across his face , covering his eyes , and a single sob escaped his throat . When this occurred , Yama drew his cloak from his shoulders and cast it like a net across the stream . Weighted at the hems for such a maneuver , it fell , netlike , upon his opponent . As he struggled to free himself , the man in black heard rapid footfalls and then a crash , as Yama 's blood-red boots struck upon his side of the stream . Casting aside the cloak and raising his guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him sloped upward , and he backed farther and farther , to where it steepened , so that Yama 's head was no higher than his belt . He then struck down at his opponent . Yama slowly fought his way uphill . " Deathgod , deathgod , " he chanted , " forgive my presumptuous question , and tell . me you did not lie . " " Soon you shall know , " said Yama , cutting at his legs . Yama struck a blow that would have run another man through , cleaving his heart . But it glanced off his opponent 's breast . When he came to a place where the ground was broken , the small man kicked , again and again , sending showers of dirt and gravel down upon his opponent . Yama shielded his eyes with his left hand , but then larger pieces of stone began to rain down upon him . These rolled on the ground , and , as several came beneath his boots , he lost his footing and fell , slipping backward down the slope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boulder and following it downhill , his blade held high . Unable to gain his footing in time to meet the attack , Yama rolled and slid back toward the stream . He managed to brake himself at the edge of the crevice , but he saw the boulder coming and tried to draw back out of its way . As he pushed at the ground with both hands , his blade fell into the waters below .  | With his dagger , which he drew as he sprang into a stumbling crouch , he managed to parry the high cut of the other 's blade . The boulder splashed into the stream . Then his left hand shot forward , seizing the wrist that had guided the blade . He slashed upward with the dagger and felt his own wrist taken . They stood then , locking their strength , until Yama sat down and rolled to his side , thrusting the other from him . Still , both locks held , and they continued to roll from the force of that thrust . Then the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt the blade go out of his hand as it struck the stream bed . When they came again above the surface of the water , gasping for breath , each held only water in his hands . " Time for the final baptism , " said Yama , and he lashed out with his left hand . The other blocked the punch , throwing one of his own . They moved to the left with the waters , until their feet struck upon rock and they fought , wading , along the length of the stream . It widened and grew more shallow as they moved , until the waters swirled about their waists . In places , the banks began to fall nearer the surface of the water . Yama landed blow after blow , both with his fists and the edges of his hands ; but it was as if he assailed a statue , for the one who had been Kali 's holy executioner took each blow without changing his expression , and he returned them with twisting punches of bone-breaking force . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yama 's guard , but one landed between his rib cage and hipbone and another glanced off his left shoulder and rebounded from his cheek . Yama cast himself into a backstroke and made for shallower water . The other followed and sprang upon him , to be caught in his impervious midsection by a red boot , as the front of his garment was jerked forward and down . He continued on , passing over Yama 's head , to land upon his back on a section of shale . Yama rose to his knees and turned , as the other found his footing and drew a dagger from his belt . His face was still impassive as he dropped into a crouch .  | For a moment their eyes met , but the other did not waver this time . " Now can I meet your death-gaze , Yama , " he stated , " and not be stopped by it . You have taught me too well ! " And as he lunged , Yama 's hands came away from his waist , snapping his wet sash like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and locked him to him as he fell forward , dropping the blade ; and with a kick he bore them both back into deeper water . " None sing hymns to breath , " said Yama . " But , oh to be without it ! " Then he plunged downward , bearing the other with him , his arms like steel loops about his body . Later , much later , as the wet figure stood beside the stream , he spoke softly and his breath came in gasps : " You were  --  the greatest  --  to be raised up against me  --  in all the ages I can remember . . . . It is indeed a pity . . . " Then , having crossed the stream , he continued on his way through the hills of stone , walking . Entering the town of Alundil , the traveler stopped at the first inn he came to . He took a room and ordered a tub of water . He bathed while a servant cleaned his garments . Before he had his dinner , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The smell of slizzard was strong upon the air , and the babble of many voices arose from below . People were leaving the town . In the courtyard at his back , preparations for the departure of a morning caravan were being made . This night marked the end of the spring festival . Below him in the street , businessmen were still trading , mothers were soothing tired children and a local prince was returning with his men from the hunt , two fire-roosters strapped to the back of a skittering slizzard . He watched a tired prostitute discussing something with a priest , who appeared to be even more tired , as he kept shaking his head and finally walked away . One moon was already high in the heavens ? seen as golden through the Bridge of the Gods  --  and a second , smaller moon had just appeared above the horizon . There was a cool tingle in the evening air , bearing to him , above the smells of the city , the scents of the growing things of spring : the small shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-green spring  | wheat , the moist ground , the roiling freshet . Leaning forward , he could see the Temple that stood upon the hill . He summoned a servant to bring his dinner in his chamber and to send for a local merchant . He ate slowly , not paying especial attention to his food , and when he had finished , the merchant was shown in . The man bore a cloak full of samples , and of these he finally decided upon a long , curved blade and a short , straight dagger , both of which he thrust into his sash . Then he went out into the evening and walked along the rutted main street of the town . Lovers embraced in doorways . He passed a house where mourners were wailing for one dead . A beggar limped after him for half a block , until he turned and glanced into his eyes , saying , " You are not lame , " and then the man hurried away , losing himself in a crowd that was passing . Overhead , the fireworks began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamers down toward the ground . From the Temple came the sound of the gourd horns playing the nagaswaram music . A man stumbled from out a doorway , brushing against him , and he broke the man 's wrist as he felt his hand fall upon his purse . The man uttered a curse and called for help , but he pushed him into the drainage ditch and walked on , turning away his two companions with one dark look . At last , he came to the Temple , hesitated a moment and passed within . He entered the inner courtyard behind a priest who was carrying in a small statue from an outer niche . He surveyed the courtyard , then quickly moved to the place occupied by the statue of the goddess Kali . He studied her for a long while , drawing his blade and placing it at her feet . When he picked it up and turned away , he saw that the priest was watching him . He nodded to the man , who immediately approached and bade him a good evening . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May Kali sanctify your blade , warrior . " " Thank you . She has . " The priest smiled . " You speak as if you knew that for certain . " " And that is presumptuous of me , eh ? " " Well , it may not be in the best of taste . " " Nevertheless , I felt her power come over me as I gazed upon her shrine . "  | The priest shuddered . " Despite my office , " he stated , " that is a feeling of power I can do without . " " You fear her power ? " " Let us say , " said the priest , " that despite its magnificence , the shrine of Kali is not so frequently visited as are those of Lakshmi , Sarasvati , Shakti , Sitala , Ratri and the other less awesome goddesses . " " But she is greater than any of these . " " And more terrible . " " So ? Despite her strength , she is not an unjust goddess . " The priest smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a score of years desires justice , warrior ? For my part , I find mercy infinitely more attractive . Give me a forgiving deity any day . " " Well taken , " said the other , " but I am , as you say , a warrior . My own nature is close to hers . We think alike , the goddess and I. We generally agree on most matters . When we do not , I remember that she is also a woman . " " I live here , " said the priest , " and I do not speak that intimately of my charges , the gods . " " In public , that is , " said the other . " Tell me not of priests . I have drunk with many of you , and know you to be as blasphemous as the rest of mankind . " " There is a time and place for everything , " said the priest , glancing back at Kali 's statue . " Aye , aye . Now tell me why the base of Yama 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It was cleaned but yesterday , but so many have passed before it since then that it has felt considerable usage . " The other smiled . " Why then are there no offerings laid at his feet , no remains of sacrifices ? " " No one gives flowers to Death , " said the priest . " They just come to look and go away . We priests have always felt the two statues to be well situated . They make a terrible pair , do they not ? Death , and the mistress of destruction ? " " A mighty team , " said the other . " But do you mean to tell me that no one makes sacrifice to Yama ? No one at all ? " " Other than we priests , when the calendar of devotions requires it , and an occasional townsman , when a loved one is upon the deathbed and has been refused direct incarnation  --  other than these , no , 1 have never seen sacrifice made to Yama , simply , sincerely , with good will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not so , warrior . For are not all living things , in themselves , sacrifices to Death ? " " Indeed , you speak truly . What need has he for their good will or affection ? Gifts are unnecessary , for he takes what he wants . " " Like Kali , " acknowledged the priest . " And in the cases of both deities have I often sought justification for atheism . Unfortunately , they manifest themselves too strongly in the world for their existence to be denied effectively . Pity . " The warrior laughed . " A priest who is an unwilling believer ! I like that . It tickles my funny bone ! Here , buy yourself a barrel of soma ? for sacrificial purposes . " " Thank you , warrior . I shall . Join me in a small libation now ? on the Temple ? " " By Kali , I will ! " said the other . " But a small one only . " He accompanied the priest into the central building and down a flight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tapped and two beakers drawn . " To your health and long life , " he said , raising it . " To your morbid patrons  --  Yama and Kali , " said the priest . " Thank you . " They gulped the potent brew , and the priest drew two more . " To warm your throat against the night . " " Very good . " " It is a good thing to see some of these travelers depart , " said the priest . " Their devotions have enriched the Temple , but they have also tired the staff considerably . " " To the departure of the pilgrims ! " " To the departure of the pilgrims ! " They drank again . " I thought that most of them came to see the Buddha , " said Yama . " That is true , " replied the priest , " but on the other hand , they are not anxious to antagonize the gods by this . So , before they visit the purple grove , they generally make sacrifice or donate to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the one called Tathagatha , and of his teach-ings ? " The other looked away . " I am a priest of the gods and a Brahmin , warrior . I do not wish to speak of this one . " " So , he has gotten to you , too ? "  | " Enough ! I have made my wishes known to you . It is not a subject on which I will discourse . " " It matters not  --  and will matter less shortly . Thank you for the soma . Good evening , priest . " " Good evening , warrior . May the gods smile upon your path . " " And yours also . " Mounting the stairs , he departed the Temple and continued on his way through the city , walking . When he came to the purple grove , there were three moons in the heavens , small camplights behind the trees , pale blossoms of fire in the sky above the town , and a breeze with a certain dampness in it stirring the growth about him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the lighted area , he was faced with row upon row of motionless , seated figures . Each wore a yellow robe with a yellow cowl drawn over the head . Hundreds of them were seated so , and not one uttered a sound . He approached the one nearest him . " I have come to see Tathagatha , the Buddha , " he said . The man did not seem to hear him . " Where is he ? " The man did not reply . He bent forward and stared into the monk 's half-closed eyes . For a moment , he glared into them , but it was as though the other was asleep , for the eyes did not even meet with his . Then he raised his voice , so that all within the grove might hear him " I have come to see Tathagatha , the Buddha , " he said . " Where is he ? " It was as though he addressed a field of stones . " Do you think to hide him in this manner ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many , and all dressed alike , and because you will not answer me , that for these reasons I can not find him among you ? " There was only the sighing of the wind , passing through from the back of the grove . The light flickered and the purple fronds stirred . He laughed . " In this , you may be right , " he admitted . " But you must move sometime , if you intend to go on living ? and I can wait as long as any man . "  | Then he seated himself upon the ground , his back against the blue bark of a tall tree , his blade across his knees . Immediately , he was seized with drowsiness . His head nodded and jerked upward several times . Then his chin came to rest upon his breast and he snored . Was walking , across a blue-green plain , the grasses bending down to form a pathway before him . At the end of this pathway was a massive tree , a tree such as did not grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its roots , and with its branches reached up to utter leaves among the stars . At its base sat a man , cross-legged , a faint smile upon his lips . He knew this man to be the Buddha , and he approached and stood before him . " Greetings , oh Death , " said the seated one , crowned with a rosehued aureole that was bright in the shadow of the tree . Yama did not reply , but drew his blade . The Buddha continued to smile , and as Yama moved forward he heard a sound like distant music . He halted and looked about him , his blade still upraised . They came from all quarters , the four Regents of the world , come down from Mount Sumernu : the Master of the North advanced , followed by his Yakshas , all in gold , mounted on yellow horses , bearing shields that blazed with golden light ; the Angel of the South came on , followed by his hosts , the Kumbhandas , mounted upon blue steeds and bearing sapphire shields ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pearl , and who are clad all in silver ; and from the West there came the One whose Nagas mounted blood-red horses , were clad all in red and held before them shields of coral . Their hooves did not appear to touch the grasses , and the only sound in the air was the music , which grew louder . " Why do the Regents of the world approach ? " Yama found himself saying . " They come to bear my bones away , " replied the Buddha , still smiling . The four Regents drew rein , their hordes at their backs , and Yama faced them . " You come to bear his bones away , " said Yama , " but who will come for yours ? " The Regents dismounted . " You may not have this man , oh Death , " said the Master of the  | North , " for he belongs to the world , and we of the world will defend him . " " Hear me , Regents who dwell upon Sumernu , " said Yama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is given the keeping of the world , but Death takes whom he will from out the world , and whenever he chooses . It is not given to you to dispute my Attributes , or the ways of their working . " The four Regents moved to a position between Yama and Tatha-gatha " We do dispute your way with this one , Lord Yama . For in his hands he holds the destiny of our world . You may touch him only after having overthrown the four Powers . " " So be it , " said Yama . " Which among you will be first to oppose me ? " " I will , " said the speaker , drawing his golden blade . Yama , his Aspect upon him , sheared through the soft metal like butter and laid the flat of his scimitar along the Regent 's head , sending him sprawling upon the ground . A great cry came up from the ranks of the Yakshas , and two of the golden horsemen came forward to bear away their leader . Then they turned their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is next ? " The Regent of the East came before him , bearing a straight blade of silver and a net woven of moonbeams . " I , " he said , and he cast with the net . Yama set his foot upon it , caught it in his fingers , jerked the other off balance . As the Regent stumbled forward , he reversed his blade and struck him in the jaw with its pommel . Two silver warriors glared at him , then dropped their eyes , as they bore their Master away to the East , a discordant music trailing in their wake . " Next ! " said Yama . Then there came before him the burly leader of the Nagas , who threw down his weapons and stripped off his tunic , saying , " I will wrestle with you , deathgod . " Yama laid his weapons aside and removed his upper garments . All the while this was happening , the Buddha sat in the shade of the great tree , smiling , as though the passage of arms meant nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neck with his  | left hand , pulling his head forward . Yama did the same to him ; and the other did then twist his body , casting his right arm over Yama 's left shoulder and behind his neck , locking it then tight about his head , which he now drew down hard against his hip , turning his body as he dragged the other forward . Reaching up behind the Naga Chief 's back , Yama caught his left shoulder in his left hand and then moved his right hand behind the Regent 's knees , so that he lifted both his legs off the ground while drawing back upon his shoulder . For a moment he held this one cradled in his arms like a child , then raised him up to shoulder level and dropped away his arms . When the Regent struck the ground , Yama fell upon him with his knees and rose again . The other did not . When the riders of the West had departed , only the Angel of the South , clad all in blue , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deathgod , raising his weapons again . " I will not take up weapons of steel or leather or stone , as a child takes up toys , to face you , god of death . Nor will I match the strength of my body against yours , " said the Angel . " I know I will be bested if I do these things , for none may dispute you with arms . " " Then climb back upon your blue stallion and ride away , " said Yama , " if you will not fight . " The Angel did not answer , but cast his blue shield into the air , so that it spun like a wheel of sapphire , growing larger and larger as it hung above them . Then it fell to the ground and began to sink into it , without a sound , still growing as it vanished from sight , the grasses coming together again above the spot where it had struck . " And what does that signify ? " asked Yama . " I do not actively contest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition . Mine is the power of life , as yours is the power of death . While you can destroy anything I send against you , you can not destroy everything , oh Death . Mine is the power of the shield , but not the sword . Life will oppose you , Lord Yama , to defend your victim . " The Blue One turned then , mounted his blue steed and rode into the South , the Kumbhandas at his back . The sound of the music did not go with him , but remained in the air he had occupied . Yama advanced once more , his blade in his hand . " Their efforts came to naught , " he said . " Your time is come . "  | He struck forward with his blade . The blow did not land , however , as a branch from the great tree fell between them and struck the scimitar from his grasp . He reached for it and the grasses bent to cover it over , weaving themselves into a tight , unbreakable net . Cursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty branch bent down , came swaying before his target , so that his blade was imbedded deeply in its fibers . Then the branch lashed again skyward , carrying the weapon with it , high out of reach . The Buddha 's eyes were closed in meditation and his halo glowed in the shadows . Yama took a step forward , raising his hands , and the grasses knotted themselves about his ankles , holding him where he stood . He struggled for a moment , tugging at their unyielding roots . Then he stopped and raised both hands high , throwing his head far back , death leaping from his eyes . " Hear me , oh Powers ! " he cried . " From this moment forward , this spot shall bear the curse of Yama ! No living thing shall ever stir again upon this ground ! No bird shall sing , nor snake slither here ! It shall be barren and stark , a place of rocks and shifting sand ! Not a spear of grass shall ever be upraised from here against the sky ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenders of my enemy ! " The grasses began to wither , but before they had released him there came a great splintering , cracking noise , as the tree whose roots held together the world and in whose branches the stars were caught , as fish in a net , swayed forward , splitting down its middle , its uppermost limbs tearing apart the sky , its roots opening chasms in the ground , its leaves falling like blue-green rain about him . A massive section of its trunk toppled toward him , casting before it a shadow dark as night . In the distance , he still saw the Buddha , seated in meditation , as though unaware of the chaos that erupted about him . Then there was only blackness and a sound like the crashing of thunder . Yama jerked his head , his eyes springing open . He sat in the purple grove , his back against the bole of a blue tree , his blade across his knees . Nothing seemed to have changed .  | The rows of monks were seated , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moist and the lights still flickered as it passed . Yama stood , knowing then , somehow , where he must go to find that which he sought . He moved past the monks , following a well-beaten path that led far into the interior of the wood . He came upon a purple pavilion , but it was empty . He moved on , tracing the path back to where the wood became a wilderness . Here , the ground was damp and a faint mist sprang up about him . But the way was still clear before him , illuminated by the light of the three moons . The trail led downward , the blue and purple trees growing shorter and more twisted here than they did above . Small pools of water , with floating patches of leprous , silver scum , began to appear at the sides of the trail . A marshland smell came to his nostrils , and the wheezing of strange creatures came out of clumps of brush . He heard the sound of singing , coming from far up behind him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now awake and stirring about the grove . They had finished with the task of combining their thoughts to force upon him the vision of their leader 's invincibility . Their chanting was probably a signal , reaching out to There ! He was seated upon a rock in the middle of a field , the moonlight falling full upon him . Yama drew his blade and advanced . When he was about twenty paces away , the other turned his head . " Greetings , oh Death , " he said . " Greetings , Tathagatha . " " Tell me why you are here . " " It has been decided that the Buddha must die . " " That does not answer my question , however . Why have you come here ? " " Are you not the Buddha ? " " I have been called Buddha , and Tathagatha , and the Enlightened One , and many other things . But , in answer to your question , no , I am not the Buddha . You have already succeeded in what you set out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " My memory must indeed be growing weak , for I confess that I do not remember doing this thing . "  | " The real Buddha was named by us Sugata , " replied the other . " Before that , he was known as Rild . " " Rild ! " Yama chuckled . " You are trying to tell me that he was more than an executioner whom you talked out of doing his job ? " " Many people are executioners who have been talked out of doing their jobs , " replied the one on the rock . " Rild gave up his mission willingly and became a follower of the Way . He was the only man I ever knew to really achieve enlightenment . " " Is this not a pacifistic religion , this thing you have been spreading ? " " Yes . " Yama threw back his head and laughed . " Gods ! Then it is well you are not preaching a militant one ! Your foremost disciple , enlightenment and all , near had my head this afternoon ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countenance . " Do you think he could actually have beaten you ? " Yama was silent a moment , then , " No , " he said . " Do you think he knew this ? " " Perhaps , " Yama replied . " Did you not know one another prior to this day 's meeting ? Have you not seen one another at practice ? " " Yes , " said Yama . " We were acquainted . " " Then he knew your skill and realized the outcome of the encounter . " Yama was silent . " He went willingly to his martyrdom , unknown to me at the time . I do not feel that he went with real hope of beating you . " " Why , then ? " " To prove a point . " " What point could he hope to prove in such a manner ? " " I do not know . I only know that it must be as I have said , for I knew him . I have listened too often to his sermons , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing such as this without a purpose . You have slain the true Buddha , deathgod . You know what I am . " " Siddhartha , " said Yama , " I know that you are a fraud . I know that you are not an Enlightened One . I realize that your doctrine is a thing which could have been remembered by any among the First . You chose to resurrect it , pretending to be its originator . You decided to spread it , in hopes of raising an opposition to the religion  | by which the true gods rule . I admire the effort . It was cleverly planned and executed . But your biggest mistake , I feel , is that you picked a pacifistic creed with which to oppose an active one . I am curious why you did this thing , when there were so many more appropriate religions from which to choose . " " Perhaps I was just curious to see how such a countercurrent would flow , " replied the other . " No , Sam , that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only part of a larger plan you have laid , and that for all these years  --  while you pretended to be a saint and preached sermons in which you did not truly believe yourself  --  you have been making other plans . An army , great in space , may offer opposition in a brief span of time . One man , brief in space , must spread his opposition across a period of many years if he is to have a chance of succeeding . You are aware of this , and now that you have sown the seeds of this stolen creed , you are planning to move on to another phase of opposition . You are trying to be a one-man antithesis to Heaven , opposing the will of the gods across the years , in many ways and from behind many masks . But it will end here and now , false Buddha . " " Why , Yama ? " he asked . " It was considered quite carefully , " said Yama . " We did not want to make you a martyr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have been teaching . On the other hand , if you were not stopped , it would still continue to grow . It was decided , therefore , that you must meet your end at the hands of an agent of Heaven ? thus showing which religion is the stronger . So , martyr or no , Buddhism will be a second-rate religion henceforth . That is why you must now die the real death . " " When I asked Why ? ' I meant something different . You have answered the wrong question . I meant , why have you come to do this thing , Yama ? Why have you , master of arms , master of sciences , come as lackey to a crew of drunken body-changers , who are not qualified to polish your blade or wash out your test tubes ? Why do you , who might be the freest spirit of us all , demean yourself by serving your inferiors ? " " For that , your death shall not be a clean one . " " Why ? I did but ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more minds than my own . I did not take offense when you called me a false Buddha . I know what I am . Who are you , deathgod ? "  | Yama placed his blade within his sash and withdrew a pipe , which he had purchased at the inn earlier in the day . He filled its bowl with tobacco , lit it , and smoked . " It is obvious that we must talk a little longer , if only to clear both our minds of questions , " he stated , " so I may as well be comfortable . " He seated himself upon a low rock . " First , a man may in some ways be superior to his fellows and still serve them , if together they serve a common cause which is greater than any one man . I believe that I serve such a cause , or I would not be doing it . I take it that you feel the same way concerning what you do , or you would not put up with this life of miserable asceticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as your followers . You were offered godhood some years ago in Mahartha , as I recall , and you mocked Brahma , raided the Palace of Karma , and filled all the praymachines of the city with slugs . . . " The Buddha chuckled . Yama joined him briefly and continued , " There are no Accelerationists remaining in the world , other than yourself . It is a dead issue , which should never have become an issue in the first place . I do have a certain respect for the manner in which you have acquitted yourself over the years . It has even occurred to me that if you could be made to realize the hopelessness of your present position , you might still be persuaded to join the hosts of Heaven . While . I did come here to kill you , if you can be convinced of this now and give me your word upon it , promising to end your foolish fight , I will take it upon myself to vouch for you . I will take you back to the Celestial City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you once refused . They will harken to me , because they need me . " " No , " said Sam , " for I am not convinced of the futility of my position , and I fully intend to continue the show . " The chanting came down from the camp in the purple grove . One of the moons disappeared beyond the treetops . " Why are your followers not beating the bushes , seeking to save you ? " " They would come if I called , but I will not call . I do not need to . " " Why did they cause me to dream that foolish dream ? " The Buddha shrugged . " Why did they not arise and slay me as I slept ? " " It is not their way . "  | " You might have , though , eh ? If you could get away with it ? If none would know the Buddha did it ? " " Perhaps , " said the other . " As you know , the personal strengths and weaknesses of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . " Yama drew upon his pipe . The smoke wreathed his head and eddied away to join the fogs , which were now becoming more heavy upon the land . " I know we are alone here , and you are unarmed , " said Yama . " We are alone here . My traveling gear is hidden farther along my route . " " Your traveling gear ? " " I have finished here . You guessed correctly . I have begun what I set out to begin . After we have finished our conversation , I will depart . " Yama chuckled . " The optimism of a revolutionary always gives rise to a sense of wonder . How do you propose to depart ? On a magic carpet ? " " I shall go as other men go . " " That is rather condescending of you . Will the powers of the world rise up to defend you ? I see no great tree to shelter you with its branches . There is no clever grass to seize at my feet . Tell me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather surprise you . " " What say we fight ? I do not like to slaughter an unarmed man . If you actually do have supplies cached somewhere nearby , go fetch your blade . It is better than no chance at all . I 've even heard it said that Lord Siddhartha was , in his day , a formidable swordsman . " " Thank you , no . Another time , perhaps . But not this time . " Yama drew once more upon his pipe , stretched , and yawned . " I can think of no more questions then , which I wish to ask you . It is futile to argue with you . I have nothing more to say . Is there anything else that you would care to add to the conversation ? " " Yes , " said Sam . " What 's she like , that bitch Kali ? There are so many different reports that I 'm beginning to believe she is all things to all men ? " Yama hurled the pipe , which struck him upon the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His scimitar was a bright flash about his head as he leapt forward . When he struck the sandy stretch before the rock , his motion was  | arrested . He almost fell , twisted himself perpendicularly and remained standing . He struggled , but could not move . " Some quicksand , " said Sam , " is quicker than other quicksand . Fortunately , you are settling into that of the slower sort . So you have considerable time yet remaining at your disposal . I would like to prolong the conversation , if I thought I had a chance of persuading you to join with me . But I know that I do not  --  no more than you could persuade me to go to Heaven . " " I will get free , " said Yama softly , not struggling . " I will get free somehow , and I will come after you again . " " Yes , " said Sam , " I feel this to be true . In fact , in a short while I will instruct you how to go about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something every preacher longs for  --  a captive audience , representing the opposition . So , I have a brief sermon for you , Lord Yama . " Yama hefted his blade , decided against throwing it , thrust it again into his sash . " Preach on , " he said , and he succeeded in catching the other 's eyes . Sam swayed where he sat , but he spoke again : " It is amazing , " he said , " how that mutant brain of yours generated a mind capable of transferring its powers to any new brain you choose to occupy . It has been years since I last exercised my one ability , as I am at this moment  --  but it , too , behaves in a similar manner . No matter what body I inhabit , it appears that my power follows me into it also . I understand it is still that way with most of us . Sitala , I hear , can control temperatures for a great distance about her . When she assumes a new body , the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes only weakly at first . Agni , I know , can set fire to objects by staring at them for a period of time and willing that they burn . Now , take for example the death-gaze you are at this moment turning upon me . Is it not amazing how you keep this gift about you in all times and places , over the centuries ? I have often wondered as to the physiological basis for the phenomenon . Have you ever researched the area ? " " Yes , " said Yama , his eyes burning beneath his dark brows . " And what is the explanation ? A person is born with an abnormal brain , his psyche is later transferred to a normal one and yet his abnormal abilities are not destroyed in the transfer . Why does this thing happen ? " " Because you really have only one body-image , which is electrical  | as well as chemical in nature . It begins immediately to modify its new physiological environment . The new body has much about it which it treats rather like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . If the body which you now inhabit were to be made physically immortal , it would someday come to resemble your original body . " " How interesting . " " That is why the transferred power is weak at first , but grows stronger as you continue occupancy . That is why it is best to cultivate an Attribute , and perhaps to employ mechanical aids , also . " " Well . That is something I have often wondered about . Thank you . By the way , keep trying with your death-gaze  --  it is painful , you know . So that is something , anyway . Now , as to the sermon  --  a proud and arrogant man , such as yourself  --  with an admittedly admirable quality of didacticism about him  --  was given to doing research in the area of a certain disfiguring and degenerative disease . One day he contracted it himself . Since he had not yet developed a cure for the condition , he did take time out to regard himself in a mirror and say , But on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , Yama . You will not attempt to fight your condition . Rather , you are proud of it . You betrayed yourself in your fury , so I know that I speak the truth when I say that the name of your disease is Kali . You would not give power into the hands of the unworthy if that woman did not bid you do it . I knew her of old , and I am certain that she has not changed . She can not love a man . She cares only for those who bring her gifts of chaos . If ever you cease to suit her purposes , she will put you aside , deathgod . I do not say this because we are enemies , but rather as one man to another . I know . Believe me , I do . Perhaps it is unfortunate that you were never really young , Yama , and did not know your first love in the days of spring . . . . The moral , therefore , of my sermon on this small mount is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do not wish to see . Cross her once to try the truth of my words , even in a small matter , and see how quickly she responds , and in what fashion . What will you do if your own weapons are turned against you , Death ? " " You have finished speaking now ? " asked Yama . " That 's about it . A sermon is a warning , and you have been warned . " " Whatever your power , Sam , I see that it is at this moment proof  | against my death-gaze . Consider yourself fortunate that I am weak-ened ? " " I do indeed , for my head is about to split . Damn your eyes ! " " One day I will try your power again , and even if it should still be proof against my own , you will fall on that day . If not by my Attribute , then by my blade . " " If that is a challenge , I choose to defer acceptance . I suggest that you do try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At this point , the sand was halfway up Yama 's thighs . Sam sighed and climbed down from his perch . " There is only one clear path to this rock , and I am about to follow it away from here . Now , I will tell you how to gain your life , if you are not too proud . I have instructed the monks to come to my aid , here at this place , if they hear a cry for help . I told you earlier that I was not going to call for help , and that is true . If , however , you begin calling out for aid with that powerful voice of yours , they shall be here before you sink too much farther . They will bring you safely to firm ground and will not try to harm you , for such is their way . I like the thought of the god of death being saved by the monks of Buddha . Good night , Yama , I 'm going to leave you now . " Yama smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he stated . " I can wait for it . Flee now as far and as fast as you can . The world is not large enough to hide you from my wrath . I will follow you , and I will teach you of the enlightenment that is pure hellfire . " " In the meantime , " said Sam , " I suggest you solicit aid of my followers or learn the difficult art of mud-breathing . " He picked his way across the field , Yama 's eyes burning into his back . When he reached the trail , he turned . " And you may want to mention in Heaven , " he said , " that I was called out of town on a business deal . " Yama did not reply . " I think I am going to make a deal for some weapons , " he finished , " some rather special weapons . So when you come after me , bring your girl friend along . If she likes what she sees , she may persuade you to switch sides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , whistling , beneath a moon that was white and a moon that was golden .  | It is told how the Lord of Light descended into the Well of the Demons , to make there a bargain with the chief of the Rakasha . He dealt in good faith , but the Rakasha are the Rakasha . That is to say , they are malefic creatures , possessed of great powers , lifespan and the ability to assume nearly any shape . The Rakasha are almost indestructible . Their chief est lack is a true body ; their chiefest virtue , their honor toward their gambling debts . That the Lord of Light went to Hellwell at all serves to show that perhaps he was somewhat distraught concerning the state of the world . . . . When the gods and the demons , both offspring of Prajapati , did battle with one another , the gods seized upon the lifeprinciple of the Udgitha , thinking that with this would they vanquish the demons . They meditated upon the Udgitha which functions through the nose , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breath one smells both that which is pleasant and that which is foul . Thus the breath is touched by evil . They meditated upon the Udgitha as words , but the demons pierced it through with evil . Therefore , one speaks both truth and falsehood . Thus words are touched by evil . They meditated upon the Udgitha which functions through the eye , but the demons pierced it through with evil . Therefore , one sees both what is pleasing and what is ugly . Thus the eye is touched by evil . They meditated upon the Udgitha as hearing , but the demons pierced it through with evil . Therefore , one hears both good things and bad . Thus the ear is touched by evil . Then did they meditate upon the Udgitha as the mind , but the demons pierced it through with evil . Therefore , one thinks what is proper , true , and good , and what is improper , false , and depraved . Thus the mind is touched by evil . Chhandogya Upanishad ( I , ii , 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world and it leads down to its roots . It is probably as old as the world itself ; and if it is not , it should be , because it looks as if it were . It begins with a doorway . There is a huge , burnished metal door , erected by the First , that is heavy as sin , three times the height of a man and half that distance in width . It is a full cubit thick and bears a head-sized ring of brass , a complicated pressure-plate lock and an inscription that reads , roughly , " Go away . This is not a place to be . If you do try to enter here , you will fail and also be cursed . If somehow you succeed , then do not complain that you entered unwarned , nor bother us with your deathbed prayers . " Signed , " The Gods . " It is set near the peak of a very high mountain named Channa , in the midst of a region of very high mountains called the Ratnagaris . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rainbows ride like fur on the backs of icicles , which sprout about the frozen caps of cliffs . The air is sharp as a sword . The sky is bright as the eye of a cat . Very few feet have ever trod the trail that leads to Hellwell . Of those who visited , most came only to look , to see whether the great door really existed ; and when they returned home and told of having seen it , they were generally mocked . Telltale scratches about the lock plate testify that some have actually sought entrance . Equipment sufficient to force the great door could not be transported or properly positioned , however . The trail that leads to Hellwell is less than ten inches in width for the final three hundred feet of its ascent ; and perhaps six men could stand , with crowding , upon what remains of the once wide ledge that faces that door . It is told that Pannalal the Sage , having sharpened his mind with meditation and divers asceticisms , had divined the operation of the lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the mountain . He was thereafter known as Pannalal the Mad . The peak known as Channa , which holds the great door , is removed by five days ' journey from a small village . This is within the far northern kingdom of Malwa . This mountain village nearest to Channa has no name itself , being filled with a fierce and independent people who have no special desire that their town appear ' on the maps of the rajah 's tax collectors . Of the rajah , it is sufficient to tell that he is of middle height and middle years , shrewd , slightly stout , neither pious nor more than usually notorious and fabulously  | wealthy . He is wealthy because he levies high taxes upon his subjects . When his subjects begin to complain , and murmurs of revolt run through the realm , he declares war upon a neighboring kingdom and doubles the taxes . If the war does not go well , he executes several generals and has his Minister of Peace negotiate a treaty . If , by some chance , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has caused the entire affair . Usually , though , it ends in a truce , souring his subjects on fighting and reconciling them to the high tax rate . His name is Videgha and he has many children . He is fond of grak-birds , which can be taught to sing bawdy songs , of snakes , to which he occasionally feeds grak-birds who can not carry a tune , and of gaming with dice . He does not especially like children . Hellwell begins with the great doorway high in the mountains at the northernmost corner of Videgha 's kingdom , beyond which there are no other kingdoms of men . It begins there , and it corkscrews down through the heart of the mountain Channa , breaking , like a corkscrew , into vast cavernways uncharted by men , extending far beneath the Ratnagari range , the deepest passageways pushing down toward the roots of the world . To this door came the traveler . He was simply dressed , and he traveled alone , and he seemed to know exactly where he was going and what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edging his way across its gaunt face . It took him the better part of the morning to reach his destination , the door . When he stood before it , he rested a moment , took a drink from his water bottle , wiped his mouth on the back of his hand , smiled . Then he sat down with his back against the door and ate his lunch . When he had finished , he threw the leaf wrappings over the edge and watched them fall , drifting from side to side on the air currents , until they were out of sight . He lit his pipe then and smoked . After he had rested , he stood and faced the door once again . His hand fell upon the pressure plate , moved slowly through a series of gestures . There was a musical sound from within the door as his hand left the plate . Then he seized upon the ring and drew back , his shoulder muscles straining . The door moved , slowly at first , then more rapidly . He stepped aside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was another ring , twin to the first , on the inner surface of the door . He caught at it as it passed him , dragging his heels to keep it from swinging so far as to place it beyond his reach . A rush of warm air emerged from the opening at his back . Drawing the door closed again behind him , he paused only to light one of the many torches he bore . Then he advanced along a corridor that widened as he moved ahead . The floor slanted abruptly , and after a hundred paces the ceiling was so high as to be invisible . After two hundred paces , he stood upon the lip of the well . He was now in the midst of a vast blackness shot through with the flames of his torch . The walls had vanished , save for the one behind him and to the right . The floor ended a short distance before him . Beyond that edge was what appeared to be a bottomless pit . He could not see across it , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew , too , that it widened in circumference as it descended . He made his way down along the trail that wound about the well wall , and he could feel the rush of warm air rising from out of the depths . This trail was artificial . One could feel this , despite its steepness . It was precarious and it was narrow ; it was cracked in many places , and in spots rubble had accumulated upon it . But its steady , winding slant bespoke the fact that there was purpose and pattern to its existence . He moved along this trail , carefully . To his left was the wall . To his right there was nothing . After what seemed an age and a half , he sighted a tiny flicker of light far below him , hanging in midair . The curvature of the wall , however , gradually bent his way so that this light no longer hung in the distance , but lay below and slightly to his right . Another twisting of the trail set it directly ahead of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flame was cached , he heard a voice within his mind cry out : " Free me , master , and I will lay the world at thy feet ! " But he hurried by , not even glancing at the almost-face within the opening . Floating upon the ocean of black that lay beneath his feet , there were more lights now visible .  | The well continued to widen . It was filled with brightening glimmers , like flame , but not flame ; filled with shapes , faces , halfremembered images . From each there rose up a cry as he passed : " Free me ! Free me ! " But he did not halt . He came to the bottom of the well and moved across it , passing among broken stones and over fissures in the rocky floor . At last he reached the opposite wall , wherein a great orange fire danced . It became cherry-red as he approached , and when he stood before it , it was the blue of a sapphire 's heart . It stood to twice his height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licked out toward him , but they drew back as if they fell against an invisible barrier . During his descent he had passed so many flames that he had lost count of their number . He knew , too , that more lay hidden within the caverns that open into the well bottom . Each flame he had passed on the way down had addressed him , using its own species of communication , so that the words had sounded drumlike within his head : threatening words , and pleading , promising words . But no message came to him from this great blue blaze , larger than any of the others . No forms turned or twisted , tantalizing , within its bright heart . Flame it was , and flame it remained . He kindled a fresh torch and wedged it between two rocks . " So , Hated One , you have returned ! " The words fell upon him like whiplashes . Steadying himself , he faced the blue flame then and replied : " You are called Taraka ? " " He who bound me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words . " Think not , oh Siddhartha , that because you wear a different body you go now unrecognized . I look upon the flows of energy which are your real being  --  not the flesh that masks them . " " I see , " replied the other . " Do you come to mock me in my prison ? " " Did I mock you in the days of the Binding ? " " No , you did not . " " I did that which had to be done , to preserve my own species . Men were weak and few in number . Your kind fell upon them and would have destroyed them . "  | " You stole our world , Siddhartha . You chained us here . What new indignity would you lay upon us ? " " Perhaps there is a way in which some reparation may be made . " " What is it that you want ? " " Allies . " " You want us to take your part in a struggle ? " " That is correct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek to bind us again . " " Not if we can work out some sort of agreement beforehand . " " Speak to me your terms , " said the flame . " In the old days your people walked , visible and invisible , in the streets of the Celestial City . " " That is true . " " It is better fortified now . " " In what ways ? " " Vishnu the Preserver and Yama Dharma , Lord of Death , have covered the whole of Heaven , rather than just the City  --  as it was in days of old  --  with what is said to be an impenetrable dome . " " There is no such thing as an impenetrable dome . " " I say only what I have heard . " " There are many ways into a city , Lord Siddhartha . " " You will find them all for me ? " " That is to be the price of my freedom ? " " Of your own freedom  --  yes . " " What of the others of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be freed , you must all agree to help me lay siege to that City and take it . " " Free us , and Heaven shall fall ! " " You speak for the others ? " " I ain Taraka . I speak for all . " " What assurance do you give , Taraka , that this bargain will be kept ? " " My word ? I shall be happy to swear by anything you care to name ? " " A facility with oaths is not the most reassuring quality in a bargainer . And your strength is also your weakness in any bargaining at all . You are so strong as to be unable to grant to another the power to control you . You have no gods to swear by . The only thing you will honor is a gambling debt , and there are no grounds for gaining here . "  | " You possess the power to control us . " " Individually , perhaps . But not collectively . " " It is a difficult problem , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be free  --  but then , all that I have is power  --  pure power , in essence uncommittable . A greater force might subdue it , but that is not the answer . I do not really know how to give you satisfactory assurance that my promise will be kept . If I were you , I certainly would not trust me . " " It is something of a dilemma . So I will free you now  --  you alone ? to visit the Pole and scout out the defenses of Heaven . In your absence , I will consider the problem further . Do you likewise , and perhaps upon your return an equitable arrangement can be made . " " Accepted ! Release me from this doom ! " " Know then my power , Taraka , " he said . " As I bind , so can I loose  --  thus ! " The flame boiled forward out of the wall . It rolled into a ball of fire and spun about the well like a comet ; it burned like a small sun , lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , so that the rocks shone both ghastly and pleasing . Then it hovered above the head of the one called Siddhartha , sending down its throbbing words upon him : " You can not know my pleasure to feel again my strength set free . I 've a mind to try your power once more . " The man beneath him shrugged . The ball of flame coalesced . Shrinking , it grew brighter , and it slowly settled to the floor . It lay there quivering , like a petal fallen from some titanic bloom ; then it drifted slowly across the floor of Hellwell and re-entered the niche . " Are you satisfied ? " asked Siddhartha . " Yes , " came the reply , after a time . " Your power is undimmed , Binder . Free me once more . " " I grow tired of this sport , Taraka . Perhaps I 'd best leave you as you are and seek assistance elsewhere . " " No ! I gave you my promise ! What more would you have ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will serve me now in this matter , or you will not . That is all . Choose , and abide by your choice  --  and your word . " " Very well . Free me , and I will visit Heaven upon its mountain of ice , and report back to you of its weaknesses . "  | " Then go ! " This time , the flame emerged more slowly . It swayed before him , took on a roughly human outline . " What is your power , Siddhartha ? How do you do what you do ? " it asked him . " Call it electrodirection , " said the other , " mind over energy . It is as good a term as any . But whatever you call it , do not seek to cross it again . I can kill you with it , though no weapon formed of matter may be laid upon you . Go now ! " Taraka vanished , like a firebrand plunged into a river , and Siddhartha stood among stones , his torch lighting the darkness about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled his mind  --  promising , tempting , pleading . Visions of wealth and of splendor flowed before his eyes . Wondrous harems were paraded before him , and banquets were laid at his feet . Essences of musk and champac , and the bluish haze of burning incenses drifted , soothing his soul , about him . He walked among flowers , followed by bright-eyed girls who bore his wine cups , smiling ; a silver voice sang to him , and creatures not human danced upon the surface of a nearby lake . " Free us , free us , " they chanted . But he smiled and watched and did nothing . Gradually , the prayers and the pleas and the promises turned to a chorus of curses and threats . Armored skeletons advanced upon him , babies impaled upon their blazing swords . There were pits all about him , from which fires leapt up , smelling of brimstone . A serpent dangled from a branch before his face , spitting venom . A rain of spiders and toads descended upon him . " Free us  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices . " If you persist , " he stated , " Siddhartha shall grow angry , and you will lose the one chance at freedom which you really do possess . " Then all was still about him , and he emptied his mind , drowsing . He had two meals , there in the cavern , and then he slept again . Later , Taraka returned in the form of a great-taloned bird and reported to him : " Those of my kind may enter through the air vents , " he said , " but men may not . There are also many elevator shafts within the mountain . Many men might ride up the larger ones with ease . Of  | course , these are guarded . But if the guards were slain and the alarms disconnected , this thing might be accomplished . Also , there are times when the dome itself is opened in various places , to permit flying craft to enter and to depart . " " Very well , " said Siddhartha . " I 've a kingdom , some weeks ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seated in my place for many years , but if I return there I can raise me an army . A new religion moves now across the land . Men may now think less of the gods than once they did . " " You wish to sack Heaven ? " " Yes , I wish to lay open its treasures to the world . " " This is to my liking . It will not be easily won , but with an army of men and an army of my kind we should be able to do it . Let us free my people now , that we may begin . " " I believe I will simply have to trust you , " said Siddhartha . " So yes , let us begin , " and he moved across the floor of Hellwell toward the first deep tunnel heading downward . That day he freed sixty-five of them , filling the caverns with their color and their movement and their light . The air sounded with mighty cries of joy and the noise of their passage as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their freedom . Without warning , then , one took upon itself the form of a flying serpent and swept down toward him , talons outstretched and slashing . For a moment , his full attention lay upon it . It uttered a brief , broken cry , and then it came apart , falling in a shower of blue-white sparks . Then these faded , and it was utterly vanished . There was silence in the caverns , and the lights pulsed and dipped about the walls . Siddhartha directed his attention toward the largest point of light , Taraka . " Did that one attack me in order to test my strength ? " he inquired . " To see whether I can also kill , in the manner I told you I could ? " Taraka approached , hovered before him . " It was not by my bidding that he attacked , " he stated . " I feel that he was half crazed from his confinement . " Siddhartha shrugged . " For a time now , disport yourselves as you  | would , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and he departed the smaller cavern . He returned to the bottom of the well , where he lay down upon his blanket and dozed . There came a dream . He was running . His shadow lay before him , and , as he ran upon it , it grew . It grew until it was no longer his shadow but a grotesque outline . Suddenly he knew that his shadow had been overrun by that of his pursuer : overrun , overwhelmed , submerged and surmounted . Then he knew a moment of terrible panic , there upon the blind plain over which he fled . He knew that it was now his own shadow . The doom which had pursued him no longer lay at his back . He knew that he was his own doom . Knowing that he had finally caught up with himself , he laughed aloud , wanting really to scream . When he awoke again , he was walking . He was walking up the twisted wall-trail of Hellwell . As he walked , he passed the imprisoned flames . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Free us , masters ! " And slowly , about the edges of the ice that was his mind , there was a thawing . Masters . Plural . Not singular . Masters , they had said . He knew then that he did not walk alone . None of the dancing , flickering shapes moved through the darkness about him , below him . The ones who had been imprisoned were still imprisoned . The ones he had freed were gone . Now he climbed the high wall of Hellwell , no torch lighting his way . But still , he saw . He saw every feature of the rocky trail , as though by moonlight . He knew that his eyes were incapable of this feat . And he had been addressed in the plural .  | And his body was moving , but was not under the direction of his will . He made an effort to halt , to stand still . He continued to advance up the trail , and it was then that his lips moved , forming the words : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A question formed itself in his mind , to be answered immediately through his own mouth : " Yes , and how does it feel to be bound yourself , Binder  --  in your own body ? " Siddhartha formed another thought : " I did not think any of your kind capable of taking control of me against my will  --  even as I slept . " " To give you an honest answer , " said the other , " neither did I. But then , I had at my disposal the combined powers of many of my kind . It seemed to be worth the attempt . " " And of the others ? Where are they ? " " Gone . To wander the world until I summon them . " " And what of these others who remain bound ? Had you waited , I would have freed them also . " " What care I of these others ? I am free now , and in a body again ! ' What else matters ? " " I take it , then , that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied the demon . " We shall return to this matter in , say , a lesser moon or so . The idea does appeal to me . I feel that a war with the gods would be a very excellent thing . But first I wish to enjoy the pleasures of the flesh for a time . Why should you begrudge me a little entertainment after the centuries of boredom and imprisonment you have wrought ? " " I must admit , however , that I do begrudge you this use of my person . " " Whatever the case , you must , for a time , put up with it . You , too , shall be in a position to enjoy what I enjoy , so why not make the best of it ? " " You state that you do intend to war against the gods ? " " Yes indeed . I wish I had thought of it myself in the old days . Perhaps , then , we should never have been bound . Perhaps there would no longer be men or gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , though . Independence of spirit naturally accompanies our independence of person . Each fought his own  | battles in the general conflict with mankind . I am a leader , true  --  by virtue of the fact that I am older and stronger and wiser than the others . They come to me for counsel , they serve me when I order them . But I have never ordered them all into battle . I shall , though , later . The novelty will do much to relieve the monotony . " " I suggest you do not wait , for there will be no later , ' Taraka . " " Why not ? " " I came to Hellwell , the wrath of the gods swarming and buzzing at my back . Now sixty-six demons are loose in the world . Very soon , your presence will be felt . The gods will know who has done this thing , and they will take steps against us . The element of surprise will be lost . " " We fought the gods in the days of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of old , Taraka . The gods are stronger now , much stronger . Long have you been bound , and their might has grown over the ages . Even if you command the first army of Rakasha in history , and backing them in battle I raise me up a mighty army of men  --  even then , will the final result be a thing uncertain . To delay now is to throw everything away . " " I wish you would not speak to me like this , Siddhartha , for you trouble me . " " I mean to . For all your powers , if you meet the One in Red he will drink your life with his eyes . He will come here to the Ratnagaris , for he follows me . The freedom of demons is as a signpost , directing him hither . He may bring others with him . You may find them more than a match for all of you . " The demon did not reply . They reached the top of the well , and Taraka advanced the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . He stepped out onto the ledge and looked downward . " You doubt the power of the Rakasha , eh , Binder ? " he asked . Then , " Behold ! " He stepped outward , over the edge . They did not fall . They drifted , like the leaves he had dropped  --  how long ago ? Downward . They landed upon the trail halfway down the mountain called Channa . " Not only do I contain your nervous system , " said Taraka , " but I have permeated your entire body and wrapped it all about with  | the energies of my being . So send me your One in Red , who drinks life with his eyes . I should like to meet him . " " Though you can walk on air , " said Siddhartha , " you speak rashly when you speak thus . " " The Prince Videgha holds his court not far from here , at Palamaidsu , " said Taraka , " for I visited there on my return from Heaven . I understand he is fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And if the God of Death should cone to join the game ? " " Let him ! " cried the other . " You cease to amuse me , Binder . Good night . Go back to sleep ! " There was a small darkness and a great silence , growing and shrinking . The days that followed were bright fragments . There would come to him snatches of conversation or song , colorful vistas of galleries , chambers , gardens . And once he looked upon a dungeon where men were hung upon racks , and he heard himself laughing . Between these fragments there came to him dreams and half dreams . They were lighted with fire , they ran with blood and tears . In a darkened , endless cathedral he rolled dice that were suns and planets . Meteors broke fire above his head , and comets inscribed blazing arcs upon a vault of black glass . There came to him a joy shot through with fear , and he knew it to be mainly that of another , but it was partly his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Taraka drank too much wine , or lay panting on his wide , low couch in the harem , then was his grip loosened somewhat , upon the body that he had stolen . But Siddhartha was still weak with the mind-bruise , and his body was drunk or fatigued ; and he knew that the time had not yet come to contest the mastery of the demonlord . There were times when he saw , not through the eyes of the body that had once been his , but saw as a demon saw , in all directions , and stripped flesh and bone from those among whom he passed , to behold the flames of their beings , colored with the hues and shades of their passions , flickering with avarice and lust and envy , darting with greed and hunger , smouldering with hate , waning with fear and pain . His hell was a many-colored place , somewhat mitigated only by the cold blue blaze of a scholar 's intellect , the white light of a dying  | monk , the rose halo of a noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple colors of children at play . He stalked the high halls and wide galleries of the royal palace at Palamaidsu , which were his winnings . The Prince Videgha lay in chains in his own dungeon . Throughout the kingdon , his subjects were not aware that a demon now sat upon the throne . Things seemed to be the same as they had always been . Siddhartha had visions of riding through the streets of the town on the back of an elephant . All the women of the town had been ordered to stand before the doors of their dwellings . Of these , he chose those who pleased him and had them taken back to his harem . Siddhartha realized , with a sudden shock , that he was assisting in the choosing , disputing with Taraka over the virtues of this or that matron , maid or lady . He had been touched by the lusts of the demon-lord , and they were becoming his own . With this realization , he came into a greater wakefulness , and it was not always the hand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or twitched the whip in the dungeon . He came to be conscious for greater periods of time , and with a certain horror he knew that , within himself , as within every man , there lies a demon capable of responding to his own kind . Then , one day , he fought the power that ruled his body and bent his mind . He had largely recovered , and he coexisted with Taraka in all his doings , both as silent watcher and active participant . They stood on the balcony above the garden , looking out across the day . Taraka had , with a single gesture , turned all the flowers black . Lizardlike creatures had come to dwell in the trees and the ponds , croaking and flitting among the shadows . The incenses and perfumes which filled the air were thick and cloying . Dark smokes coiled like serpents along the ground . There had been three attempts upon his life . The captain of the palace guard had been the last to try . But his blade had turned to a reptile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his eyes and filling his veins with a venom that had caused him to darken and swell , to die crying for a drink of water . Siddhartha considered the ways of the demon , and in that moment he struck . His power had grown again , slowly , since that day in Hellwell when last he had wielded it . Oddly independent of the brain of his body , as Yama had once told him , the power turned like a slow pinwheel at the center of the space that was himself .  | It spun again faster , and he hurled it against the force of the other . A cry escaped Taraka , and a counterthrust of pure energy came back at Siddhartha like a spear . Partly , he managed to deflect it , to absorb some of its force . Still , there was pain and turmoil within him as the brunt of the attack touched upon his being . He did not pause to consider the pain , but struck again , as a spearman strikes into the darkened burrow of a fearsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the demon was building black walls against his power . But one by one , these walls fell before his onslaught . And as they fought , they spoke : " Oh man of many bodies , " said Taraka , " why do you begrudge me a few days within this one ? It is not the body you were born into , and you , too , do but borrow it for a time . Why then , do you feel my touch to be a thing of defilement ? One day you may wear another body , untouched by me . So why do you consider my presence a pollution , a disease ? Is it because there is that within you which is like unto myself ? Is it because you , too , know delight in the ways of the Rakasha , tasting the pain you cause like a pleasure , working your will as you choose upon whatsoever you choose ? Is it because of this ? Because you , too , know and desire these things , but also bear that human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in your weakness , Binder . And I shall prevail against you . " " It is because I am what I am , demon , " said Siddhartha , hurling his energies back at him . " It is because I am a man who occasionally aspires to things beyond the belly and the phallus . I am not the saint the Buddhists think me to be , and I am not the hero out of legend . I am a man who knows much fear , and who occasionally feels guilt . Mainly , though , I am a man who has set out to do a thing , and you are now blocking my way . Thus you inherit my curse  --  whether I win or whether I lose now , Taraka , your destiny has already been altered . This is the curse of the Buddha  --  you will never again be the same as once you were . " And all that day they stood upon the balcony , garments drenched with perspiration . Like a statue they stood , until the sun had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark bowl of the night . A moon leapt up above the garden wall . Later , another joined it .  | " What is the curse of the Buddha ? " Taraka inquired , over and over again . But Siddhartha did not reply . He had beaten down the final wall , and they fenced now with energies like flights of blazing arrows . From a Temple in the distance there came the monotonous beating of a drum , and occasionally a garden creature croaked , a bird cried out or a swarm of insects settled upon them , fed , and swirled away . Then , like a shower of stars , they came , riding upon the night wind . . . the Freed of Hellwell , the other demons who had been loosed upon the world . They came in answer to Taraka 's summons , adding their powers to his own . He became as a whirlwind , a tidal wave , a storm of lightnings . Siddhartha felt himself swept over by a titanic avalanche , crushed , smothered , buried . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How long it was before he recovered , he did not know . It was a slow thing this time , and it was in a palace where demons walked as servants that he woke up . When the last anesthetic bonds of mental fatigue fell away , there was strangeness about him . The grotesque revelries continued . Parties were held in the dungeons , where the demons would animate corpses to pursue their victims and embrace them . Dark miracles were wrought , such as the grove of twisted trees which sprang from the marble flags of the throne room itself  --  a grove wherein men slept without awakening , crying out as old nightmares gave way to new . But a different strangeness had entered the palace . Taraka was no longer pleased . " What is the curse of the Buddha ? " he inquired again , as he felt Siddhartha 's presence pressing once more upon his own . Siddhartha did not reply at once . The other continued , " I feel that I will give you back your body one day soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I grow tired , and I think perhaps the day draws near when we should make war with Heaven . What say you to this , Binder ? I told you I would keep my word . " Siddhartha did not answer him .  | " My pleasures diminish by the day ! Do you know why this is , Siddhartha ? Can you tell me why strange feelings now come over me , dampening my strongest moments , weakening me and casting me down when I should be elated , when I should be filled with joy ? Is this the curse of the Buddha ? " " Yes , " said Siddhartha . " Then lift your curse , Binder , and I will depart this very day . I will give you back this cloak of flesh . I long again for the cold , clean winds of the heights ! Will you free me now ? " " It is too late , oh chief of the Rakasha . You have brought this thing upon yourself . " " What thing ? How have you bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we strove upon the balcony , you mocked me ? You told me that I , too , took pleasure in the ways of the pain which you work . You were correct , for all men have within them both that which is dark and that which is light . A man is a thing of many divisions , not a pure , clear flame such as you once were . His intellect often wars with his emotions , his will with his desires . . . his ideals are at odds with his environment , and if he follows them , he knows keenly the loss of that which was old  --  but if he does not follow them , he feels the pain of having forsaken a new and noble dream . Whatever he does represents both a gain and a loss , an arrival and a departure . Always he mourns that which is gone and fears some part of that which is new . Reason opposes tradition . Emotions oppose the restrictions his fellow men lay upon him . Always , from the friction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curse of man and mocked  --  guilt ! " Know then , that as we existed together in the same body and I partook of your ways , not always unwillingly , the road we followed was not one upon which all the traffic moved in a single direction . As you twisted my will to your workings , so was your will twisted , in turn , by my revulsion at some of your deeds . You have learned the thing called guilt , and it will ever fall as a shadow across your meat and your drink . This is why your pleasure has been broken . This is why you seek now to flee . But it will do you no good . It will follow you across the world . It will rise with you into the realms of the cold , clean winds . It will pursue you wherever you go . This is the curse of the Buddha . " Taraka covered his face with his hands . " So this is what it is like to weep , " he said , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curse you , Siddhartha , " he said . " You have bound me again , to an even more terrible prison than Hellwell . " " You have bound yourself . It is you who broke our pact . I kept it . " " Men suffer when they break pacts with demons , " said Taraka , " but no Rakasha has ever suffered so before . " Siddhartha did not reply . On the following morning , as he sat to breakfast , there came a banging upon the door of his chambers . " Who dares ? " he cried out , and the door burst inward , its hinges tearing free of the wall , its bar snapping like a dry stick . The head of a horned tiger upon the shoulders of an ape , great hooves for feet , talons for hands , the Rakasha fell forward into the room , smoke emerging from his mouth as he became transparent for a moment , returned to full visibility , faded once more , returned again . His talons were dripping something that was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The air was filled with the odor of singed hair and charred flesh . " Master ! " it cried . " A stranger has come , asking audience of thee ! " " And you did not succeed in convincing him that I was not available ? " " Lord , a score of human guardsmen fell upon him , and he gestured . . . . He waved his hand at them , and there was a flash of light so bright that even the Rakasha might not look upon it . For an instant only it lasted  --  and they were all of them vanished , as if they had never existed . . . . There was also a large hole in the wall behind where they had stood . . . . There was no rubble . Only a smooth , clean hole . " " And then you fell upon him ? " " Many of the Rakasha sprang for him  --  but there is that about him which repels us . He gestured again and three of our own kind were gone , vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not take the full force of it , but was only grazed by his power . He sent me , therefore , to deliver his message . . . . I can no longer hold myself to-gether ? " With that he vanished , and a globe of fire hung where the creature  | had lain . Now his words came into the mind , rather than being spoken across the air . " He bids you come to him without delay . Else , he says he will destroy this palace . " " Did the three whom he burnt also take on again their own forms ? " " No , " replied the Rakasha . " They are no more . . . " " Describe this stranger ! " ordered Siddhartha , forcing the words through his own lips . " He stands very tall , " said the demon , " and he wears black breeches and boots . Above the waist he has on him a strange garment . It is like a seamless white glove , upon his right hand only , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , wrapping his neck and rising tight and smooth about his entire head . Only the lower part of his face is visible , for he wears over his eyes large black lenses which extend half a span outward from his face . At his belt he wears a short sheath of the same white material as the garment  --  not containing a dagger , however , but a wand . Beneath the material of his garment , where it crosses his shoulders and comes up upon his neck , there is a hump , as if he wears there a small pack . " " Lord Agni ! " said Siddhartha . " You have described the god of Fire ! " " Aye , this must be , " said the Rakasha . " For as I looked beyond his flesh , to see the colors of his true being , I saw there a blaze like unto the heart of the sun . If there be a god of Fire , then this indeed is he . " " Now must we flee , " said Siddhartha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning . We can not fight with this one , so let us go quickly . " " I do not fear the gods , " said Taraka , " and I should like to try the power of this one . " " You can not prevail against the Lord of Flame , " said Siddhartha . " His fire wand is invincible . It was given him by the deathgod . " " Then I shall wrest it from him and turn it against him . " " None may wield it without being blinded and losing a hand in the process ! This is why he wears that strange garment . Let us waste no more time here ! " " I must see for myself , " said Taraka . " I must . " " Do not let your new found guilt force you into flirting with selfdestruction. "  | " Guilt ? " said Taraka . " That puny , gnawing mind-rat of which you taught me ? No , it is not guilt , Binder . It is that , where once I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . The gods were not this strong in the old days , and if they have indeed grown in power , then that power must be tested  --  by myself ! It is of my nature , which is power , to fight every new power which arises , and to either triumph over it or be bound by it . I must test the strength of Lord Agni , to win over him . " " But we are two within this body ! " " That is true . . . . If this body be destroyed , then will I bear you away with me , I promise . AIready have I strengthened your flames after the manner of my own kind . If this body dies , you will continue to live as a Rakasha . Our people once wore bodies , too , and I remember the art of strengthening the flames so that they may burn independent of the body . This has been done for you , so do not fear . " " Thanks a lot . " " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They left the royal chambers and descended the stair . Far below , prisoner in his own dungeon , Prince Videgha whimpered in his sleep . They emerged from the door that lay behind the hangings at the back of the throne . When they pushed aside these hangings , they saw that the great hall was empty , save for the sleepers within the dark grove and the one who stood in the middle of the floor , white arm folded over bare arm , a silver wand caught between the fingers of his gloved hand . " See how he stands ? " said Siddhartha . " He is confident of his power , and justly so . He is Agni of the Lokapalas . He can see to the farthest unobstructed horizon , as though it lies at his fingertips . And he can reach that far . He is said one night to have scored the moons themselves with that wand . If he but touch its base against a contact within his glove , the Universal Fire will leap forward with a blinding brilliance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is still not too late to withdraw ? " " Agni ! " he heard his mouth cry out . " You have requested audience with the one who rules here ? " The black lenses turned toward him . Agni 's lips curled back to vanish into a smile which dissolved into words :  | " I thought I 'd find you here , " he said , his voice nasal and penetrating . " All that holiness got to be too much and you had to cut loose , eh ? Shall I call you Siddhartha , or Tathagatha , or Mahasamatman  --  or just plain Sam ? " " You fool , " he replied . " The one who was known to you as the Binder of Demons  --  by all or any of those names  --  is bound now himSelf . You have the privilege of addressing Taraka of the Rakasha , Lord of Hellwell ! " There was a click , and the lenses became red . " Yes , I perceive the truth of what you say , " answered the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Interesting . Doubtless cramped , also . " He shrugged , and then added , " But I can destroy two as readily as one . " " Think you so ? " inquired Taraka , raising both arms before him . As he did , there was a rumbling and the black wood spread in an instant across the floor , engulfing the one who stood there , its dark branches writhing about him . The rumbling continued , and the floor moved several inches beneath their feet . From overhead , there came a creaking and the sound of snapping stone . Dust and gravel began to fall . Then there was a blinding flash of light and the trees were gone , leaving short stumps and blackened smudges upon the floor . With a groan and a mighty crash , the ceiling fell . As they stepped back through the door that lay behind the throne , they saw the figure , which still stood in the center of the hall , raise his wand directly above his head and move it in a tiny circle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched . A smile still lay upon Agni 's lips as the great stones rained down , none falling anywhere near him . The rumbling continued , and the floor cracked and the walls began to sway . They slammed the door and Sam felt a rushing giddiness as the window , which a moment before had lain at the far end of the corridor , flashed past him . They coursed upward and outward through the heavens , and a tingling , bubbling feeling filled his body , as though he were a being of liquid through whom an electrical current was passing . Looking back , with the sight of the demon who saw in all directions , he beheld Palamaidsu , already so distant that it could have been framed and hung upon the wall as a painting . On the high hill  | at the center of the town , the palace of Videgha was falling in upon itself , and great streaks of brilliance , like reversed lightning bolts , were leaping from the ruin into the heavens . " That is your answer , Taraka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try his power again ? " " I had to find out , " said the demon . " Now let me warn you further . I did not jest when I said that he can see to the farthest horizon . If he should free himself soon and turn his glance in this direction , he will detect us . I do not think you can move faster than light , so I suggest you fly lower and utilize the terrain for cover . " " I have rendered us invisible , Sam . " " The eyes of Agni can see deeper into the red and farther into the violet ranges than can those of a man . " They lost altitude then , rapidly . Before Palamaidsu , however , Sam saw that the only evidence which remained of the palace of Videgha was a cloud of dust upon a gray hillside . Moving like a whirlwind , they sped far into the north , until at last the Ratnagaris lay beneath them . When they came to the mountain called Channa , they drifted down past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the opened entrance to Hellwell . They stepped within and closed the door . " Pursuit will follow , " said Sam , " and even Hellwell will not stand against it . " " How confident they are of their power , " said Taraka , " to send only one ! " " Do you feel that confidence to be unwarranted ? " " No , " said Taraka . " But what of the One in Red of whom you spoke , who drinks life with his eyes ? Did you not think they would send Lord Yama , rather than Agni ? " " Yes , " said Sam , as they moved back toward the well , " I was sure that he would follow , and I still feel that he will . When last I saw him , I caused him some distress . I feel he would hunt me anywhere . Who knows , he may even now be lying in ambush at the bottom of Hellwell itself . " They came to the lip of the well and entered upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taraka announced . " I would even now be contacted by those who wait , bound , if any but the Rakasha had passed this way . "  | " He will come , " said Sam , " and when the Red One comes to Hellwell , he will not be stayed in his course . " " But many will try , " said Taraka . " There is the first . " The first flame came into view , in its niche beside the trail . As they passed by , Sam freed it , and it sprang into the air like a bright bird and spiraled down the well . Step by step they descended , and from each niche fire spilled forth and flowed outward . At Taraka 's bidding , some rose and vanished over the edge of the well , departing through the mighty door which bore the words of the gods upon its outer face . When they reached the bottom of the well , Taraka said , " Let us free those who lie locked in the caverns , also . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caverns , freeing the demons locked therein . Then , after a time  --  how much time , he could never tell  --  they had all been freed . The Rakasha assembled then about the cavern , standing in great phalanxes of flame , and their cries all came together into one steady , ringing note which rolled and rolled and beat within his head , until he realized , startled at the thought , that they were singing . " Yes , " said Taraka , " it is the first time in ages that they have done so . " Sam listened to the vibrations within his skull , catching something of the meaning behind the hiss and the blaze , the feelings that accompanied it falling into words and stresses that were more familiar to his own mind : We are the legions of Hellwell , damned , The banished ones of fallen flame . We are the race undone by man . So man we curse . Forget his name ! This world was ours before the gods , In clays before the race of men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world will then be ours again . The mountains fall , the seas dry out , The moons shall vanish from the sky . The Bridge of Gold will one day fall , And all that breathes must one day die .  | But we of Hellwell shall prevail , When fail the gods , when fail the men . The legions of the damned die not . We wait , we wait , to rise again ! Sam shuddered as they sang on and on , recounting their vanished glories , confident of their ability to outlast any circumstance , to meet any force with the cosmic judo of a push and a tug and a long wait , watching anything of which they disapproved turn its strength upon itself and pass . Almost , in that moment , he believed that what they sang was truth , and that one day there would be none but the Rakasha , flitting above the pocked landscape of a dead world . Then he turned his mind to other matters and forced the mood from him . But in the days that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it returned to plague his efforts and mock his joys , to make him wonder , know guilt , feel sadness and so be humbled . After a time , one of the Rakasha who had left earlier re-entered and descended the well . He hovered in the air and reported what he had seen . As he spoke , his fires flowed into the shape of a tau cross . " This is the form of that chariot , " he said , " which blazed through the sky and then fell , coming to rest in the valley beyond Southpeak . " " Binder , do you know this vessel ? " asked Taraka . " I have heard it described before , " said Sam . " It is the thunder chariot of Lord Shiva . " Describe its occupant , " he said to the demon . " There were four , Lord . " " Four ! " " Yes . There is the one you have described as Agri , Lord of the Fires . With him is one who wears the horns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows like aged bronze , but it is not bronze ; it is worked about with the forms of many serpents , and it does not seem to burden him as he moves . In his one hand he holds a gleaming trident , and he bears no shield before his body . " " This one is Shiva , " said Sam . " And walking with these two there comes one all in red , whose gaze is dark . This one does not speak , but occasionally his glances fall upon the woman who walks by his side , to his left . She is fair of hair and complexion , and her armor matches his red . Her eyes are like the sea , and she smiles often with lips the color of the blood of  | men . About her throat she wears a necklace of skulls . She bears a bow , and upon her belt is a short sword . She holds in her hands a strange instrument , like a black scepter ending in a silver skull that is also a wheel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Sam . " Now hear me , Taraka , mightiest of the Rakasha , while I tell you what moves against us . The power of Agni you know full well , and of the One in Red have I already spoken . Now , she who walks at the left hand of Death bears also the gaze that drinks the life it beholds . Her scepter-wheel screams like the trumpets that signalize the ending of the Yuga , and all who come before its wailing are cast down and confused . She is as much to be feared as her Lord , who is ruthless and invincible . But the one with the trident is the Lord of Destruction himself . It is true that Yama is King of the Dead and Agni Lord of the Flames , but the power of Shiva is the power of chaos . His is the force which separates atom from atom , breaking down the forms of all things upon which he turns it . Against these four , the freed might of Hellwell itself can not stand . Therefore , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuredly coming here . " " Did I not promise you , Binder , " said Taraka , " that I would help you to fight the gods ? " " Yes , but that of which I spoke was to be a surprise attack . These have taken upon themselves their Aspects now , and have raised up their Attributes . Had they chosen , without even landing the thunder chariot , Channa would no longer exist , but in the place of this mountain there would be a deep crater , here in the midst of the Ratnagaris . We must flee , to fight them another day . " " Do you remember the curse of the Buddha ? " asked Taraka . " Do you remember how you taught me of guilt , Siddhartha ? I remember , and I feel I owe you this victory . I owe you something for your pains , and I will give these gods into your hands in payment . " " No ! If you would serve me at all , do it at another time than this ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far and fast ! " " Are you afraid of this encounter , Lord Siddhartha ? " " Yes , yes I am ! For it is foolhardy ! What of your song  --  We wait , we wait , to rise again ! ' ? Where is the patience of the Rakasha ? You say you will wait for the seas to dry and the mountains to fall , for the moons to vanish from the sky  --  but you can not wait for me to name the time and the battlefield ! I know them far better than you ,  | these gods , for once I was one of them . Do not do this rash thing now . If you would serve me , save me from this meeting ! " " Very well . I hear you , Siddhartha . Your words move me , Sam . But I would try their strength . So I shall send some of the Rakasha against them . But we shall journey far , you and I , far down to the roots of the world . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow , the Rakasha should lose the encounter , then will I bear you far away from here and restore to you your body . I would wear it a few hours more , however , to savor your passions in this fighting . " Sam bowed his head . " Amen , " he said , and with a tingling , bubbling sensation , he felt himself lifted from the floor and borne along vast cavernways uncharted by men . As they sped from chamber to vaulted chamber , down tunnels and chasms and wells , through labyrinths and grottoes and corridors of stone , Sam set his mind adrift , to move down the ways of memory and back . He thought upon the days of his recent ministry , when he had sought to graft the teachings of Gotama upon the stock of the religion by which the world was ruled . He thought upon the strange one , Sugata , whose hands had held both death and benediction . Over the years , their names would merge and their deeds would be mingled . He had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legend . There had been a real Buddha , he knew that now . The teaching he had offered , no matter how spuriously , had attracted this true believer , this one who had somehow achieved enlightenment , marked men 's minds with his sainthood , and then gone willingly into the hands of Death himself . Tathagatha and Sugata would be part of a single legend , he knew , and Tathagatha would shine in the light shed by his disciple . Only the one Dhamma would survive . Then his mind went back to the battle at the Hall of Karma , and to the machinery still cached in a secret place . And he thought then upon the countless transfers he had undergone before that time , of the battles he had fought , of the women he had loved across the ages ; he thought upon what a world could be and what this world was , and why . Then he was taken again with his rage against the gods . He thought upon the days when a handful of them had fought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Kataputna demons and the Mothers of the Terrible  | Glow , the Dakshinis and the Pretas , the Skandas and the Pisakas , and had won , tearing a world loose from chaos and building its first city of men . He had seen that city pass through all the stages through which a city can pass , until now it was inhabited by those who could spin their minds for a moment and transform themselves into gods , taking upon them an Aspect that strengthened their bodies and intensified their wills and extended the power of their desires into Attributes , which fell with a force like magic upon those against whom they turned them . He thought upon this city and these gods , and he knew of its beauty and its rightness , its ugliness and its wrongness . He thought of its splendor and its color , in contrast to that of the rest of the world , and he wept as he raged , for he knew that he could never feel either wholly right or wholly wrong in opposing it . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing nothing . Now , whatever he did would result in both victory and defeat , a success and a failure ; and whether the outcome of all his actions would be the passing or the continuance of the dream of the city , the burden of the guilt would be his . They waited in darkness . For a long , silent while they waited . Time passed like an old man climbing a hill . They stood upon a ledge above a black pool , and waited . " Should we not have heard by now ? " " Perhaps . Perhaps not . " " What shall we do ? " " What do you mean ? " " If they do not come at all . How long shall we wait here ? " " They will come , singing . " " I hope so . " But there came no singing , or movement . About them was the stillness of time that had no objects upon which to wear . " How long have we waited ? " " I do not know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " " You may be right . Shall we rise a few levels and investigate , or shall I bear you to your freedom now ? " " Let us wait awhile longer . " " Very well . " Again , there was silence . They paced within it .  | " What was that ? " " What ? " " A sound . " " I heard nothing and we are using the same ears . " " Not with the ears of the body  --  there it is again ! " " I heard nothing , Taraka . " " It continues . It is like a scream , but it does not end . " " Far ? " " Yes , quite distant . Listen my way . " " Yes ! I believe it is the scepter of Kali . The battle , then , goes on . " " This long ? Then the gods are stronger than I had supposed . " " No , the Rakasha are stronger than I had supposed . " " Whether we win or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we can get by them , their vessel may be unattended . Do you want it ? " " Steal the thunder chariot ? That is a thought . . . . It is a mighty weapon , as well as transportation . What might our chances be ? " " I am certain the Rakasha can hold them for as long as is necessary  --  and it is a long climb up Hellwell . We need not use the trail ourself . I grow tired , but I can still bear us across the air . " " Let us rise a few levels and investigate . " They left their ledge by the black pool , and time beat again about them as they passed upward . As they advanced , a globe of light moved to meet them . It settled upon the floor of the cavern and grew into a tree of green fire . " How goes the battle ? " asked Taraka . " We hold them , " it reported , " but we can not close with them . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repels . I do not know how to call it , but we can not draw too near . " " How then do you fight ? " " A steady storm of rocks rages about them . We hurl fire and water and great spinning winds , also . " " And how do they respond to this ? " " The trident of Shiva cuts a path through everything . But no matter how much he destroys , we raise up more against him . So he stands like a statue , uncreating storms we will not let end . Occasionally , he swerves to kill , while the Lord of Fires holds back the attack .  | The scepter of the goddess slows those who face upon it . Once slowed , they meet the trident or the hand or the eyes of Death . " " And you have not succeeded in harming them ? " " No . " " Where do they stand ? " " Part way down the well wall . They are still near to the top . They descend slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eighteen . " " Then it was a mistake to end our waiting to begin this battle . The cost is too high and nothing is being gained . . . . Sam , do you want to try for the chariot ? " " It is worth a risk . . . . Yes , let us try . " " Go then , " he instructed the Rakasha who branched and swayed before him . " Go , and we shall follow more slowly . We will rise along the side of the wall opposite them . When we begin the ascent , redouble your attack . Occupy them entirely until we have passed . Hold them then to give us time in which to steal their chariot from the valley . When this has been accomplished , I will return to you in my true form and we can put an end to the fighting . " " I obey , " replied the other , and he fell upon the floor to become a green serpent of light , and slithered off ahead of them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conserve the strength of the demon for the final necessary thrust against gravitation . They had journeyed a great distance beneath the Ratnagaris , and the return trip seemed endless . Finally , though , they came upon the floor of the well ; and it was lighted sufficiently so that , even with the eyes of his body , Sam could see clearly about him . The noise was deafening . If he and Taraka had had to rely upon speech for communication , there would have been no communication . Like some fantastic orchid upon an ebon bough , the fire bloomed upon the wall of the well . As Agni waved his wand , it changed its shape , writhing . In the air , like bright insects , danced the Rakasha . The rushing of winds was one loudness , and the rattling of many stones was another . Above it all was the ululating cry of the silver skull-wheel , which Kali waved like a fan before her face ; and this was even more terrible when it rose beyond the range of hearing , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midair , their  | white-hot fragments leaping like sparks from a forge , out and downward . They bounced and rolled , and glowed redly in the shadows of Hellwell . The surrounding walls of the well were pocked and gouged and scored in the places where the flame and the chaos had touched . " Now , " said Taraka , " we go ! " They rose into the air and moved up the side of the well . The power of the Rakasha 's attack increased , to be answered with an intensified counterattack . Sam covered his ears with his hands , but it did no good against the burning needles behind his eyes , which stirred whenever the silver skull swept in his direction . A short distance to his left , a whole section of rock vanished abruptly . " They have not detected us , " said Taraka . " Yet , " answered Sam . " That accursed Fire god can look through a sea of ink to spot a shifting grain of sand . If he turns in this direction , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " asked Taraka , as they were suddenly forty feet higher and somewhat farther to the left . They sped upward now , and a line of melting rock pursued them . Then this was interrupted as the demons set up a wailing and tore loose gigantic boulders , which they hurled upon the gods , with the accompaniment of hurricanes and sheets of fire . They reached the lip of the well , passed above it and scurried back out of range . " We must go all the way around now , to reach the corridor which leads to the door . " A Rakasha rose from out of the well and sped to their side . " They retreat ! " he cried . " The goddess has fallen . The One in Red supports her as they flee ! " " They do not retreat , " said Taraka . " They move to cut us off . Block their way ! Destroy the trail ! Hurry ! " The Rakasha dropped like a meteor back into the well . " Binder , I grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from the ledge outside all the way to the ground below . " " Can you manage it part of the way ? " " Yes . " " That first three hundred feet or so where the trail is narrow ? " " I think so . " " Good ! " They ran .  | As they fled along the rim of Hellwell , another Rakasha rose up and kept pace with them . " I report ! " he cried . " We have destroyed the trail twice . Each time , the Lord of Flames has burnt a new one ! " " Then naught more can be done ! Stay with us now ! We need your assistance in another matter . " It sped on ahead of them , a crimson wedge lighting their way . They rounded the well and raced up the tunnel . When they reached its end , they hurled the door wide and stepped out onto the ledge . The Rakasha who had led the way slammed the door behind them , saying , " They pursue ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door glowed for an instant , then melted above him . With the help of the second Rakasha , they descended the entire distance to the base of Channa and moved up a trail and around a bend . The foot of a mountain now shielded them from the gods . But this rock was lashed with flame in an instant . The second Rakasha shot high into the air , wheeled and vanished . They ran along the trail , heading toward the valley that held the chariot . By the time they reached it , the Rakasha had returned . " Kali and Yama and Agni descend , " he stated . " Shiva stays behind , holding the corridor . Agni leads the pursuit . The One in Red helps the goddess , who is limping . " Before them , in the valley , lay the thunder chariot . Slim and unadorned , the color of bronze , though it was not bronze , it stood upon a wide , grassy plain . It looked like a fallen prayer tower or a giant 's house key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had slipped free of a starry constellation and dropped to the ground . It seemed to be somehow incomplete , although the eye could not fault its lines . It held that special beauty that belongs to the highest orders of weapons , requiring function to make it complete . Sam moved to its side , found the hatch , entered . " You can operate this chariot , Binder ? " asked Taraka . " Make it race through the heavens , spitting destruction across the land ? " " I 'm sure Yama would keep the controls as simple as possible . He streamlines whenever he can . I 've flown the jets of Heaven before , and I 'm banking that this is of the same order . " He ducked into the cabin , settled into the control seat and stared at the panel before him .  | " Damn ! " he announced , his hand starting forward and twitching back . The other Rakasha appeared suddenly , passing through the metal wall of the ship and hovering above the console . " The gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sam snapped a series of switches and pressed a button . Lights came on all over the instrument panel and a humming sound began within it . " How far is he ? " asked Taraka . " Almost halfway down . He widened the trail with his flames . He runs upon it now , as if it were a roadway . He burns obstacles . He makes a clear path . " Sam drew back on a lever and adjusted a dial , reading the indicators before him . A shudder ran through the ship . " Are you ready ? " asked Taraka . " I ca n't take off cold . It has to warm up . Also , this instrument board is trickier than I 'd thought . " " We run a close race . " " Yes . " From the distance , there came the sounds of several explosions rising above the growing growl of the chariot . Sam pulled the lever forward another notch , readjusted the dial . " I go to slow them , " said the Rakasha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lever two notches farther , and somewhere something sputtered and died . The ship stood silent once more . He pushed the lever back into its former position , spun the dial , pushed the button again . And again a shudder ran through the chariot , and somewhere a purring began . Sam drew the lever one notch forward , adjusted the dial . After a moment , he repeated it , and the purr became a soft growl . " Gone , " said Taraka . " Dead . " " Who ? What ? " " The one who went to stop the Lord of Flames . He failed . " There were more explosions . " Hellwell is being destroyed , " said Taraka . Perspiration upon his brow , Sam waited with his hand on the lever . " He comes now  --  Agni ! "  | Sam looked through the long , slanted shield plate . The Lord of Flames came into the valley . " Good-bye , Siddhartha . " " Not yet , " said Sam . Agni looked at the chariot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointing the wand ; and then he lowered it , shook it . He raised it once more . Again , no flame issued forth . He reached behind his neck with his left hand , performed some adjustment upon his pack . As he did this , light streamed from the wand , burning a huge pit in the ground at his side . He pointed the wand again . Nothing . Then he began running toward the ship . " Electrodirection ? " asked Taraka . " Yes . " Sam drew back upon the lever , adjusted the dial farther . A huge roaring grew about him . He pressed another button and there came a crackling sound from the rear of the vessel . He moved another dial as Agni reached the hatch . There was a flash of flame and a metallic clanging . He rose from his seat and moved out of the cabin and into the corridor . Agni had entered , and he pointed the wand . " Do not move  --  Sam ! Demon ! " he cried , above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lenses clicked red and he smiled . " Demon , " he stated . " Do not move , or you and your host will burn together ! " Sam sprang upon him . Agni fell easily when he struck , for he had not believed that the other would reach him . " Short circuit , eh ? " said Sam , and hit him across the throat . " Or sunspots ? " and he struck him in the temple . Agni fell to his side , and Sam hit him a final blow with the edge of his hand , just above the collarbone . He kicked the wand the length of the corridor , and as he moved to close the hatch he knew that it was too late .  | " Go now , Taraka , " he said . " This is my fight from here on . You can do nothing more . " " I promised my assistance . " " You have none to give , now . Get out while still you can . " " If such is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you ? " " Save it ! Next time I 'm in the neighborhood ? " " Binder , it is this thing I learned of you  --  I am sorry . I ? " There was a terrible twisting , wrenching sensation within his body and mind , as the death-gaze of Yama fell upon him and struck deeper than his own being . Kali , too , looked into his eyes ; and as she did so , she raised her screaming scepter . It was as the lifting of one shadow and the falling of another . " Good-bye , Binder , " came the words within his mind . Then the skull began its screaming . He felt himself falling . There was a throbbing . It was within his head . It was all about him . He was awakened by throbbing , and he felt himself covered with aches , as with bandages . There were chains upon his wrists and his ankles . He was half seated on the floor of a small compartment . Beside the doorway sat the One in Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why am I alive ? " Sam asked him . " You live for purposes of keeping an appointment made many years ago in Mahartha , " said Yama . " Brahma is particularly anxious to see you once again . " " But I am not especially anxious to see Brahma . " " Over the years , that has become somewhat apparent . " " I see you got out of the mud all right . " The other smiled . " You are a nasty man , " he said . " I know . I practice . " " I gather your business deal fell through ? " " Unfortunately , yes . " " Perhaps you can try recouping your losses . We 're halfway to Heaven . " " Think I 'd have a chance ? "  | " You just might . Times change . Brahma could be a merciful god this week . " " My occupational therapist told me to specialize in lost causes . " Yama shrugged . " What of the demon ? " Sam asked . " The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Yama , " hard . I do n't know whether I finished it or just drove it away . But you need n't worry about it again . I doused you with demon repellant . If the creature still lives , it will be a long time before it recovers from our contact . Maybe never . How did it happen in the first place ? I thought you were the one man immune to demonic possession . " " So did I. What 's demon repellant ? " " I found a chemical agent , harmless to us , which none of the energy beings can stand . " " Handy item . Could 've used it in the days of the binding . " " Yes . We wore it into Hellwell . " " That was quite a battle , from what I saw of it . " " Yes , " said Yama . " What is it like  --  demonic possession ? What does it feel like to have another will overriding your own ? " " It is strange , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . " " In what ways ? " " It was their world first , " said Sam . " We took it away from them . Why should n't they be everything we hate them for being ? To them , we are the demons . " " But what does it feel like ? " " To have one 's will overridden by that of another ? You should know . " Yama 's smile vanished , then returned . " You would like me to strike you , would n't you , Buddha ? It would make you feel superior . Unfortunately , I 'm a sadist and will not do it . " Sam laughed . " Touche , Death , " he said . They sat in silence for a time . " Can you spare me a cigarette ? " Yama passed him one , lit it . " What 's First Base like these days ? " " You 'll hardly recognize the place , " said Yama . " If everyone in it were to die at this moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The flowers would still bloom and the music would  | play and the fountains would ripple the length of the spectrum . Warm meals would still be laid within the garden pavilions . The City itself is immortal . " " A fitting abode , I suppose , for those who call themselves gods . " " Call themselves ? " asked Yama . " You are wrong , Sam . Godhood is more than a name . It is a condition of being . One does not achieve it merely by being immortal , for even the lowliest laborer in the fields may achieve continuity of existence . Is it then the conditioning of an Aspect ? No . Any competent hypnotist can play games with the self-image . Is it the raising up of an Attribute ? Of course not . I can design machines more powerful and more accurate than any faculty a man may cultivate . Being a god is the quality of being able to be yourself to such an extent that your passions correspond with the forces of the universe , so that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken . Some ancient poet said that the world is full of echoes and correspondences . Another wrote a long poem of an inferno , wherein each man suffered a torture which coincided in nature with those forces which had ruled his life . Being a god is being able to recognize within one 's self these things that are important , and then to strike the single note that brings them into alignment with everything else that exists . Then , beyond morals or logic or esthetics , one is wind or fire , the sea , the mountains , rain , the sun or the stars , the flight of an arrow , the end of a day , the clasp of love . One rules through one 's ruling passions . Those who look upon gods then say , without even knowing their names , He is Fire . She is Dance . He is Destruction . She is Love . ' So , to reply to your statement , they do not call themselves gods . Everyone else does , though , everyone who beholds them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh ? " " You choose the wrong adjective . " " You 've already used up all the others . " " It appears that our minds will never meet on this subject . " " If someone asks you why you 're oppressing a world and you reply with a lot of poetic crap , no . I guess there ca n't be a meeting of minds . " " Then let us choose another subject for conversation . " " I do look upon you , though , and say , He is Death . ' " Yama did not reply . " Odd ruling passion . I 've heard that you were old before you were young . . . "  | " You know that is true . " " You were a mechanical prodigy and a weapons master . You lost your boyhood in a burst of flame , and you became an old man that same day . Did death become your ruling passion in that moment ? Or was it earlier ? Or later ? " " It does not matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you believe what you have said to me  --  or because you hate the larger portion of humanity ? " " I did not lie to you . " " Then Death is an idealist . Amusing . " " Not so . " " Or could it be , Lord Yama , that neither guess is correct ? That your ruling passion ? " " You 've mentioned her name before , " said Yama , " in the same speech wherein you likened her to a disease . You were wrong then and you are still wrong . I do not care to hear that sermon over again , and since I am not at the moment sinking in quicksand , I will not . " " Peace , " said Sam . " But tell me , do the ruling passions of the gods ever change ? " Yama smiled . " The goddess of dance was once the god of war . So it would seem that anything can change . " " When I have died the real death , " said Sam , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will hate Heaven with every breath that I draw . If Brahma has me burnt , I will spit into the flames . If he has me strangled , I will attempt to bite the executioner 's hand . If my throat is cut , may my blood rust the blade that does it . Is that a ruling passion ? " " You are good god material , " said Yama . " Good god ! " said Sam . " Before whatever may happen happens , " said Yama , " I have been assured that you will be permitted to attend the wedding . " " Wedding ? You and Kali ? Soon ? " " At the full of the lesser moon , " Yama replied . " So , whatever Brahma decides , at least I can buy you a drink before it occurs . " " For that I thank you , deathgod . But it has always been my understanding that weddings are not made in Heaven . " " That tradition is about to be broken , " said Yama . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Sam .  | Yama nodded , yawned , lit another cigarette . " By the way , " said Sam , " what is the latest vogue in celestial executions ? I ask purely for informational purposes . " " Executions are not held in Heaven , " said Yama , opening a cabinet and removing a chessboard.  | From Hellwell to Heaven he went , there to commune with the gods . The Celestial City holds many mysteries , including some of the keys to his own past . Not all that transpired during the time he dwelled there is known . It is known , however , that he petitioned the gods on behalf of the world , obtaining the sympathy of some , the emnity of others . Had he chosen to betray humanity and accept the proffers of the gods , it is said by some that he might have dwelled forever as a Lord of the City and not have met his death beneath the claws of the phantom cats of Kaniburrha .

She walked where the lemon-colored grasses stirred . She walked a  | winding track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising to her right , veins of milk-white rock , shot through with orange streaks , open about her . Then , as so often before , she moved on the great cushions of her feet , the wind sleeking her fur , white as marble , and the ten thousand fragrances of the jungle and the plain stirring about her ; there , in the twilight of the place that only half existed . Alone , she followed the ageless trail through the jungle that was part illusion . The white tiger is a solitary hunter . If others moved along a similar course , none cared for company . Then , as so often before , she looked up at the smooth , gray shell of the sky and the stars that glistened there like shards of ice . Her crescent eyes widened , and she stopped and sat upon her haunches , staring upward . What was it she was hunting ? A deep sound , like a chuckle ending in a cough , came from her throat . She sprang then suddenly to the top of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a moon moved into view , she watched it . She seemed a figure molded of unmelting snow , topaz flames gleaming beneath her brows . Then , as before , she wondered whether this was the true jungle of Kaniburrha in which she sat . She felt that she was still within the confines of the actual forest . But she could not really know . What was it she was hunting ? Heaven exists upon a plateau that was once a range of mountains . These mountains were fused and smoothed to provide a level base . Topsoil was transported from the verdant south , to give it the growth that fleshed over this bony structure . Cupping the entire area is a transparent dome , protecting it against the polar cold and anything else unwanted within . Heaven stands high and temperate and enjoys a long twilight and long , lazy days . Fresh airs , warmed as they are drawn within , circulate through the City and the forest . Within the dome itself , clouds can be generated . From within the clouds rains can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A snowfall could even be brought down in this manner , although this thing has never been done . It has always been summer in Heaven . Within the summer of Heaven stands the Celestial City . The Celestial City did not grow up as the cities of men grow up , about a port or near to good farmland , pasturage , hunting country ,  | trade routes or a region rich in some natural resource that men desired and so settled beside . The Celestial City sprang from a conception in the minds of its first dwellers . Its growth was not slow and haphazard , a building added here , a thoroughfare rerouted there , one structure torn down to make way for another , and all parts coming together into an irregular and unseemly whole . No . Every demand of utility was considered and every inch of magnificence calculated by the first planners and the design-augmentation machines . These plans were coordinated and brought to fruition by an architectural artist without peer . Vishnu , the Preserver , held the entire Celestial City within his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the Garuda Bird , stared downward and the City was captured perfect in a drop of perspiration on his brow . So Heaven sprang from the mind of a god , its conception stimulated by the desires of his fellows . It was laid by choice , rather than necessity , in a wilderness of ice and snow and rock , at the timeless Pole of the world , where only the mighty might make their home . ( What was it she was hunting ? ) Beneath the dome of Heaven there stood , beside the Celestial City , the great forest of Kaniburrha . Vishnu , in his wisdom , had seen that there must be a balance between the metropolis and the wilderness . While wilderness can exist independent of cities , that which dwells within a city requires more than the tamed plants of a pleasance . If the world were all city , he had reasoned , the dwellers within it would turn a portion of it into a wilderness , for there is that within them all which desires that somewhere there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , within his mind there had grown up a forest , pumping forth streams and the smells of growth and decay , uttering the cries of the uncitied creatures who dwelled within its shadows , shrugging in the wind and glistening in the rain , falling down and growing up again . The wilderness came to the edge of the City and stopped . It was forbidden to enter there , just as the City kept to its bounds . But of the creatures who dwelled within the forest , some were predators ; these knew no boundaries of limits , coming and going as they chose . Chief among these were the albino tigers . So it was written by the gods that the phantom cats might not look upon the Celestial City ; and so it was laid upon their eyes , through the nervous systems that lay behind them , that there was no City . Within their white-cat brains , the world was only the forest of Kaniburrha . They  | walked the streets of Heaven , and it was a jungle trail they trod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by , it was as the wind laying hands upon them . Should they climb a broad stairway , it was a rocky slope they mounted . The buildings were cliffs and the statues were trees ; the passers-by were invisible . Should one from the City enter the true forest , however , cat and god then dwelled upon the same plane of existence  --  the wilderness , the balancer . She coughed again , as she had so often before , and her snowy fur was sleeked by the wind . She was a phantom cat , who for three days had stalked about the wilderness of Kaniburrha , slaying and eating the raw red flesh of her kill , crying out her great-throated catchallenge , licking her fur with her broad , pink tongue , feeling the rain fall down upon her back , dripping from off the high , hanging fronds , coming in torrents down from the clouds , which coalesced , miraculously , in the center of the sky ; moving with fire in her loins , having mated the night before with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , the smell of the blood driving them both into a great frenzy ; purring , as the cool twilight came over her , bringing with it the moons , like the changing crescents of her eyes , golden and silver and dun . She sat upon the rock , licking her paws and wondering what it was she had hunted . Lakshmi , in the Garden of the Lokapalas , lay with Kubera , fourth keeper of the world , upon a scented couch set beside the pool in which the Apsarases played . The other three of the Lokapalas were absent this evening . . . . Giggling , the Apsarases splashed the perfumed waters toward the couch . Lord Krishna the Dark , however , chose that moment to blow upon his pipes . The girls then turned away from Kubera the Fat and Lakshmi the Lovely , to rest their elbows upon the edges of the pool and stare at him , there beneath the flowering tree where he lay sprawled amid wineskins and the remains of several meals . He ran up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goatlike bleats . Guari the Fair , whom he had spent an hour undressing and then had apparently forgotten , rose up from his side , dove into the pool and vanished into one of the many subaquaean caves . He hiccupped , began a tune , stopped , began another . " Is it true what they say about Kali ? " asked Lakshmi .  | " What do they say ? " grunted Kubera , reaching for a bowl of soma . She took the bowl from his hands , sipped at it , returned it to him . He quaffed it , and a servant refilled it as he placed it back upon the tray . " That she wants a human sacrifice , to celebrate her wedding ? " " Probably , " said Kubera . " Would n't put it past her . Bloodthirsty bitch , that one . Always transmigrating into some vicious animal for a holiday . Became a fire-hen once and clawed Sitala 's face over something she 'd said . " " When ? " " Oh , ten  --  eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time , till her new body was ready . " " A strange pair , " said Lakshmi into his ear , which she was biting . " Your friend Yama is probably the only one would live with her . Supposing she grew angry with a lover and cast her deadly look upon him ? Who else could bear that gaze ? " " Jest not , " said Kubera . " Thus did we lose Kartikeya , Lord of the Battles . " " Oh ? " " Aye . She 's a strange one . Like Yama , yet not like him . He is deathgod , true . But his is the way of the quick , clean kill . Kali is rather like a cat . " " Does Yama ever speak of this fascination she holds for him ? " " Did you come here to gather gossip or to become some ? " " Both , " she replied . At that moment , Krishna took his Aspect upon him , raising up the Attribute of divine drunkenness . From his pipes there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him expanded across the garden , in alternating waves of joy and sadness . He rose upon his lithe , dark legs and began to dance . His flat features were expressionless . His wet , dark hair lay in tight rings , like wire ; even his beard was so curled . As he moved , the Apsarases came forth from the pool to follow him . His pipes wandered along the trails of the ancient melodies , growing more and more frenzied as he moved faster and faster , until finally he broke into the Rasa-lila , the Dance of Lust , and his retinue , hands on their hips , followed him with increasing speed through its gyrating movements .  | Kubera 's grip upon Lakshmi tightened . " Now there is an Attribute , " she said . Rudra the Grim bent his bow and sent an arrow flying . The arrow sped on and on and finally came to rest in the center of a distant target . At his side , Lord Murugan chuckled and lowered his bow . " You win again , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They unbraced their bows and moved toward the target after the arrows . " Have you met him yet ? " asked Murugan. " 1 knew him a long time ago , " said Rudra . " Accelerationist ? " " He was n't then . Was n't much of anything , politically . He was one of the First , though , one of those who had looked upon Urath . " " Oh ? " " He distinguished himself in the wars against the People-of-theSea and against the Mothers of the Terrible Glow . " Here , Rudra made a sign in the air . " Later , " he continued , " this was remembered , and he was given charge of the northern marches in the wars against the demons . He was known as Kalkin in those days , and it was there that he came to be called Binder . He developed an Attribute which he could use against the demons . With it , he destroyed most of the Yakshas and bound the Rakasha . When Yama and Kali captured him at Hellwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter . Thus , the Rakasha are again abroad in the world . " " Why did he do this thing ? " " Yama and Agni say that he had made a pact with their leader . They suspect he offered this one a lease on his body in return for the promise of demon troops to war against us . " " May we be attacked ? " " I doubt it . The demons are not stupid . If they could not defeat four of us in Hellwell , I doubt they would attack us all here in Heaven . And even now , Yama is in the Vasty Hall of Death designing special weapons . " " And where is his bride-to-be ? " " Who knows ? " said Rudra . " And who cares ? " Murugan smiled . " I once thought you more than passing fond of her yourself . " " Too cold , too mocking , " said Rudra.  | " She repulsed you ? " Rudra turned his dark face , which never smiled , upon the fair god of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " You think that 's all that goes on between people . We were just friends for a time , but she is too hard on her friends and so loses them . " " She did repulse you ? " " I suppose so . " " And when she took Morgan , the poet of the plains , as her lover ? he who one day incarnated as a jackbird and flew away  --  you then hunted jackbirds , until inside a month with your arrows you had slain near every one in Heaven . " " And I still hunt jackbirds . " " Why is that ? " " I do not care for their singing . " " She is too cold , too mocking , " agreed Murugan . " I do not like being mocked by anyone , youthgod . Could you outrun the arrows of Rudra ? " Murugan smiled again . " No , " said he , " nor could my friends the Lokapalas  --  nor would they need to . " " When I assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my great bow , which was given me by Death himself , then can I send a heattracking arrow whistling down the miles to pursue a moving target and strike it like a thunderbolt , dead . " " Let us then talk of other matters , " said Murugan , suddenly interested in the target . " I gather that our guest mocked Brahma some years ago in Mahartha and did violence in holy places . I understand , though , that he is the same one who founded the religion of peace and enlightenment . " " The same . " " Interesting . " " An understatement . " " What will Brahma do . " Rudra shrugged . " Brahma only knows , " he replied . At the place called Worldsend , where there is nothing beyond the edge of Heaven but the distant flicker of the dome and , far below , the blank ground , hidden beneath a smoke-white mist , there stands the open-sided Pavilion of Silence , upon whose round , gray roof the rains never fall , and across whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the winds walk at twilight , and within whose airy chambers , seated upon the stark , dark furniture , or pacing among the gray columns , are sometimes to be found the gods contemplative , the broken warriors or those injured in love , who come to consider there all things hurtful or futile , beneath a sky that is beyond the Bridge of the Gods , in the midst of a place of stone where the colors are few and the only sound is the wind  --  there , since slightly after the days of the First , have sat the philosopher and the sorceress , the sage and the magus , the suicide , and the ascetic freed from the desire for rebirth or renewal ; there , in the center of renunciation and abandonment , withdrawal and departure , are the five rooms named Memory , Fear , Heartbreak , Dust and Despair ; and this place was built by Kubera the Fat , who cared not a tittle for any of these sentiments , but who , as a friend of Lord Kalkin , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes known as Durga and as Kali , for he alone of all the gods possessed the Attribute of inanimate correspondence , whereby he could invest the works of his hands with feelings and passions to be experienced by those who dwelled among them . They sat in the room called Heartbreak , and they drank of the soma but they were never drunken . It was twilight all about the Pavilion of Silence , and the winds that circled through Heaven flowed past them . They sat within black robes upon the dark seats , and his hand lay atop hers , there on the table that stood between them ; and the horoscopes of all their days moved past them on the wall that separated Heaven from the heavens ; and they were silent as they considered the pages of their centuries . " Sam , " she finally said , " were they not good ? " " Yes , " he replied . " And in those ancient days , before you left Heaven to dwell among men  --  did you love me then ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was so very long ago . We were both different people then  --  different minds , different bodies . Probably those two , whoever they were , loved one another . I can not remember . " " But I recall the springtime of the world as though it were yesterday  --  those days when we rode together to battle , and those nights when we shook the stars loose from the fresh-painted skies ! The world was so new and different then , with a menace lurking within  | every flower and a bomb behind every sunrise . Together we beat a world , you and I , for nothing really wanted us here and everything disputed our coming . We cut and burnt our way across the land and over the seas , and we fought under the seas and in the skies , until there was nothing left to oppose us . Then cities were built , and kingdoms , and we raised up those whom we chose to rule over them , until they ceased to amuse us and we cast them down again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How can they understand the power we knew , who were First ? " " They can not , " he replied . " When we held court in our palace by the sea and I gave you many sons , and our fleets swept out to conquer the islands , were those days not fair and full of grace ? And the nights things of fire and perfume and wine ? . . . Did you not love me then ? " " I believe those two loved one another , yes . " " Those two ? We are not that different . We are not that changed . Though ages slip away , there are some things within one 's being which do not change , which do not alter , no matter how many bodies one puts upon oneself , no matter how many lovers one takes , no matter how many things of beauty and ugliness one looks upon or does , no matter how many thoughts one thinks or feelings one feels . One 's self stands at the center of all this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seed within it . Is that the center ? Open the seed and there is nothing within it . Is that the center ? We are two different persons from the master and the mistress of battles . It was good to have known those two , but that is all . " " Did you go to dwell outside of Heaven because you were tired of me ? " " I wanted a change of perspective . " " There have been long years over which I have hated you for departing . Then there have been times when I sat in the room called Despair , but was too much of a coward to walk beyond Worldsend . Then again , there have been times when I have forgiven you and invoked the seven Rishi to bring your image before me , so that I looked upon you as you went about your day , and it was almost as though we walked together once again . Other times I have desired your death , but you turned my executioner into a friend as you turn my wrath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel nothing for me ? " " I mean to say that I no longer love you . It would be nice if there  | were some one thing constant and unchanging in the universe . If there is such a thing , then it is a thing which would have to be stronger than love , and it is a thing which I do not know . " " I have not changed , Sam . " " Think carefully , Lady , over all that you have said , over all that you have recalled for me this day . It is not really the man whom you have been remembering . It is the days of carnage through which the two of you rode together . The world is come into a tamer age now . You long for the fire and the steel of old . You think it is the man , but it is the destiny the two of you shared for a time , the destiny which is past , that stirs your mind , and you call it love . " " Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days are not past . It is a constant thing within the universe , and I call you to come share it with me once again ! " " What of Lord Yama ? " " What of him ? You have dealt with those who would be numbered as his peers , did they still live . " " I take it , then , that it is his Aspect for which you care ? " She smiled , within the shadows and the wind . " Of course . " " Lady , Lady , Lady , forget me ! Go live with Yama and be his love . Our days are past , and I do not wish to recall them . They were good , but they are past . As there is a time for everything , there is a time also for the end of anything . This is an age for the consolidation of man 's gains upon this world . This is a time for the sharing of knowledge , not the crossing of blades . " " Would you fight Heaven for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , to open its vaults to the world ? " " You know that I would . " " Then we may yet have a common cause . " " No , Lady , do not deceive yourself . Your allegiance lies with Heaven , not with the world . You know that . If I won my freedom and you joined with me and we fought , perhaps you would be happy for a time . But win or lose , in the end I fear you would be unhappier than before . " " Hear me , soft-hearted saint of the purple grove . It is quite kind of you to anticipate my feelings , but Kali casts her allegiances where she will , owing nothing to anyone , but as she chooses . She is the mercenary goddess , remember that ! Perhaps all that you have said is true , and she lies when she tells you she loves you still .  | Being ruthless and full of the battle lust , however , she follows the smell of blood . I feel that she may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say , goddess . Who knows what may be listening ? " " None listens , " said she , " for seldom are words spoken within this place . " " All the more reason for someone to be curious when they are . " She sat for a time in silence , then , " None listens , " she said . " Your powers have grown . " " Yes . What of yours ? " " About the same , I think . " " Then will you accept my sword , my wheel , my bow , in the name of Accelerationism ? " " No . " " Why not ? " " You give your promises too easily . You break them as readily as you make them , and because of this I can never trust you . If we fight and we win in the name of Accelerationism , it may also be the last great battle of this world . This is a thing you could not desire , nor permit to occur . " " You are a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last great battle is always the next one . Shall I come to you in a more comely shape to convince you that I speak the truth ? Shall I embrace you in a body with the seal of virginity set upon it ? Will this make you to trust my word ? " " Doubt , Lady , is the chastity of the mind , and I bear its seal upon my own . " " Then know that I did but bring you here to this place to torment you , and that you are correct  --  I spit upon your Accelerationism , and I have already numbered your days . I sought to give you false hopes , that you may be cast down from a greater height . It is only your stupidity and your weakness that have saved you from this . " " I am sorry , Kali ? " " I do not want your apology ! I would have liked your love , though , so that I might have used it against you at the end of your days , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , we have changed too much  --  and you are no longer worth the trouble . Do not think that I could not have made you love me again , either , with smiles and with caresses as of old . For I feel the heat within you , and it is an easy thing for me to fan it in a man . You are not worth a mighty  | death , however , falling from the heights of passion to the depths of despair . I do not have the time to give you more than my contempt . " The stars wheeled about them , frictionless and fiery , and her hand was gone from beneath his own , as she poured two more cups of soma to warm them against the night . " Kali ? " " Yes ? " " If it will give you any satisfaction in the end , I still care for you . Either there is no such thing as love , or the word does not mean what I have thought it to mean on many different occasions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to leave it at that . So take it and go away and have your fun with it . You know that we would both be at one another 's throats again one day , as soon as we had run out of common enemies . We had many fine reconciliations , but were they ever worth the pain that preceded them ? Know that you have won and that you are the goddess I worship  --  for are not worship and religious awe a combination of love and hate , desire and fear ? " They drank their soma in the room called Heartbreak , and the spell of Kubera lay about them . Kali spoke : " Shall I fall upon you and kiss you now , saying that I lied when I said I lied  --  so that you may laugh and say you lied , to achieve a final revenge ? Go to , Lord Siddhartha ! Better one of us died in Hellwell , for great is the pride of the First . We should not have come here  --  to this place . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " " In this , I agree . Let us sit here and worship one another for a time . " Her hand fell upon his own , caressed it . " Sam ? " " Yes ? " " Would you like to make love to me ? " " And so seal my doom ? Of course . " " Then let us go into the room called Despair , where the winds stand stilled and where there is a couch . . . " He followed her from Heartbreak to Despair , his pulse quickening in his throat , and when he had laid her bare on the couch and placed his hand upon the soft whiteness of her belly , he knew that  | Kubera was indeed the mightiest of the Lokapalas  --  for the feeling to which that room had been dedicated filled him , even as his desires mounted within him and he upon her  --  there came a loosening , a tightening , a sigh , and the ultimate tears burning to be shed . " What is it you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accelerationism , Tak of the Archives . " Tak stretched his great lean frame and his chair adjusted backward with a creak . Behind him , the data banks were still , and certain rare records filled the long , high bookshelves with their colorful bindings and the air with their musty smells . He handled the lady before him with his eyes , smiled and shook his head . She wore green , tightly , and an impatient look ; her hair was an insolent red , and faint freckles flecked her nose and the hemispheres of her cheeks . Her hips and shoulders were wide , and her narrow waist tightly disciplined against this tendency . " Why do you shake your head ? Everyone comes to you for information . " " You are young , mistress . Three avatars , if I am not mistaken , lie behind you . At this point in your career , I am certain that you do not really wish to have your name placed upon the special list of those younger ones who seek this knowledge . " " List @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a list of such inquirers ? " Tak shrugged . " Gods collect the strangest things , and certain among them save lists . " " I have always heard Accelerationism mentioned as a completely dead issue . " " So why this sudden interest in the dead ? " She laughed , and her green eyes bored into his gray ones . The Archives exploded around him , and he stood in the ballroom halfway up Milehigh Spire . It was night , so late that it would soon be morning . A party had obviously been going on for a long while ; but now the crowd in which he stood had come together in the corner of the room . They were leaning , and they were sitting and reclining , and all of them listening to the short , dark , husky man who stood beside the goddess Kali and talked . This was GreatSouled Sam the Buddha , who , with his warden , had just arrived . He  | was talking of Buddhism and Accelerationism , and of the days of the binding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of Mahartha by the sea . He was talking , and his voice went on and on , hypnotic , and he radiated power and confidence and warmth , hypnotic , and his words went on and on and on , as the crowd slowly passed out and fell down around him . All of the women were quite ugly , except for Maya , who tittered then and clapped her hands , bringing back the Archives about them , and Tak again to his chair , his smile still upon his lips . " So why this sudden interest in the dead ? " he repeated . " He is not dead , that one ! " " No ? " said Tak . " He is n't ? . . . Mistress Maya , he was dead the moment he set foot within the Celestial City . Forget him . Forget his words . Let it be as if he never existed . Leave no trace of him within your mind . One day you will seek renewal  --  so know that the Masters of Karma will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their halls . The Buddha and his words are an abomination in the eyes of the gods . " " But why ? " " He is a bomb-throwing anarchist , a hairy-eyed revolutionary . He seeks to pull down Heaven itself . If you want more specific information , I 'll have to use the machines to retrieve the data . Would you care to sign an authorization for this ? " " No ... " " Then put him out of your mind and lock the door . " " He is really that bad ? " " He 's worse . " " Then why do you smile as you say these things ? " " Because I 'm not a very serious person . Character has nothing to do with my message , however . So heed it . " " You seem to know all about it . Are archivists themselves immune to these lists ? " " Hardly . My name is first upon it . But this is not because I am an archivist . He is my father . " " That one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one quite young , however . I doubt that he is even aware that he fathered me . What is paternity to the gods , who inhabit a succession of bodies , begetting scores of offspring by others who also change bodies four or five times a century ? I am the son of a body he once inhabited , born of another who also  | passed through many , and I myself no longer live in the same body I was born into . The relationship , therefore , is quite intangible , and interesting primarily on levels of speculative metaphysics . What is the true father of a man ? The circumstances which brought together the two bodies which begat him ? Was it the fact that , for some reason , at one moment in time , these two pleased one another beyond any possible alternatives ? If so , why ? Was it the simple hunger of the flesh , or was it curiosity , or the will ? Or was it something else ? Pity ? Loneliness ? The desire to dominate ? What feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I first came into consciousness ? I know that the man who inhabited that particular father-body at that particular instant of time is a complicated and powerful personality . Chromosomes mean nothing to us , not really . If we live , we do not carry these hallmarks down through the ages . We really inherit nothing at all , save for occasional endowments of property and cash . The bodies mean so little in the long run that it is far more interesting to speculate as to the mental processes which plucked us forth from chaos . I am pleased that it was he who called me to life , and I often conjecture as to the reasons . I see that your face is suddenly lacking in color , mistress . I did not mean to upset you with this talk , simply to satisfy your curiosity somewhat , and to lay upon your mind some of the thinking we old ones do upon these matters . One day you , too , will look upon it in this light , I am certain . But I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Forgive my prattle . You are the Mistress of Illusion . Are not the things of which I have spoken akin to the very stuff with which you work ? I am certain that you can tell from the manner in which I speak why my name is first upon the list I mentioned . It is a case of hero worship , I suppose . My creator is quite distinguished . . . . Now you are looking somewhat flushed . Would you care for a cool drink ? Wait here a moment . . . . There . Sip this . Now then , about Accelerationism  --  it is a simple doctrine of sharing . It proposes that we of Heaven give unto those who dwell below of our knowledge and powers and substance . This act of charity would be directed to the end of raising their condition of existence to a higher level , akin to that which we ourselves occupy . Then every man would be as a god , you see . The result of this , of course , would be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We would give them knowledge of the sciences and the arts , which we possess , and in so doing we would destroy their simple faith and remove all basis for their  | hoping that things will be better  --  for the best way to destroy faith or hope is to let it be realized . Why should we permit men to suffer this burden of godhood collectively , as the Accelerationists wished , when we do grant it to them individually when they come to deserve it ? In his sixtieth year a man passes through the Halls of Karma . He is judged , and if he has done well , observing the rules and restrictions of his caste , paying the proper observances to Heaven , advancing himself intellectually and morally , then this man will be incarnated into a higher caste , eventually achieving godhood itself and coming to dwell here in the City . Each man eventually receives his just desserts  --  barring unfortunate accidents , of course  --  and so each man , rather than society as a sudden whole , may come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale before everyone , even those who were unready . You can see that this attitude was dreadfully unfair and proletarianoriented . What they really wanted to do was to lower the requirements for godhood . These requirements are necessarily strict . Would you give the power of Shiva , of Yama , or of Agni into the hands of an infant ? Not unless you are a fool , you would n't . Not unless you wished to wake up one morning and see that the world no longer existed . This is what the Accelerationists would have wrought , though , and this is why they were stopped . Now you know all about Accelerationism . . . . My , you look awfully warm . May I hang your garment while I get you another drink ? . . . Very good . . . . Now , where were we , Maya ? Oh yes  --  the beetles in the pudding . . . . Well , the Accelerationists claimed that everything I have just said would be true , excepting for the fact that the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who authorized incarnation . Some even dared claim that Heaven was comprised of an immortal aristocracy of wilful hedonists who played games with the world . Others dared to say that the best of men never achieve godhood , but meet ultimately with the real death or incarnation into a lower life form . Some others would even say that one such as yourself had been chosen for deification only because your original form and attitude struck the fancy of some lustful divinity , rather than for your other obvious virtues , my dear . . . . My , you 're full of freckles , are n't you ? . . . Yes , these are the things those thricedamned Accelerationists preached . These are the things , the accusations , that the father of my spirit stands for , I am ashamed to say . What can one do with such a heritage but wonder at it ? He  | rides a cycle of mighty days , and he represents the last great schism among the gods . Evil though he obviously is , he is a mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect him as the sons of old did the fathers of their bodies . . . . Are you cold now ? Here , let me . . . . There . . . . There . . . . There . . . . Come , now weave us an illusion , my lovely , where we walk in a world that is free of such foolishness . . . . This way now . Turn here . . . . Now let there be a new Eden within this bunker , my moist-lipped one of the green green eyes . . . . What is that ? . . . What is it that is paramount within me at this instant of time ? . . . Truth , my love  --  and sincerity  --  and the desire to share . . . " Ganesha the god-maker walked with Shiva in the forest of Kahiburrha . " Lord of Destruction , " he said , " I understand that you already seek reprisal against those here in the City who mark the words of Siddhartha with more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Shiva . " By so doing , you destroy his effectiveness . " " Effectiveness ' ? Explain what you mean . " " Kill me that green bird on yonder limb . " Shiva gestured with his trident and the bird fell . " Now kill me its mate . " " I do not see her . " " Then kill me any other from among its flock . " " I see none . " " And now that it lies dead , you will not . So , if you wish , strike at the first who harken to the words of Siddhartha . " " I gather your meaning , Ganesha . He shall walk free , for a time . He shall . " Ganesha the god-maker regarded the jungle about him . Though he walked through the realm of the phantom cats , he feared no evil . For the Lord of Chaos walked by his side , and the Trident of Destruction comforted him . Vishnu Vishnu Vishnu regarded regarded regarded Brahma Brahma Brahma . . . They sat in the Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the glory that is Nirvana.  | After the space of three cigarettes , Vishnu cleared his throat . " Yes , Lord ? " asked Brahma . " Why , may I inquire , this Buddhist tract ? " " Do you not find it fascinating ? " " Not particularly . " " That is indeed hypocritical of you . " " What do you mean ? " " A teacher should display at least a modicum of interest in his own lessons . " " Teacher ? Lessons ? " " Of course , Tathagatha . Why else in recent years would the god Vishnu be moved to incarnate among men , other than to teach them the Way of Enlightenment ? " " I . . ? ? " Hail , reformer , who has removed the fear of the real death from men 's minds . Those who are not born again among men have now gone on to Nirvana . " Vishnu smiled . " Better to incorporate than struggle to extirpate ? " " Almost an epigram . " Brahma have been the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I have not yet decided , but I am open to suggestions . " " Might I suggest that he be incarnated as a jackbird ? " " You might . But then , someone else might desire that the jackbird be reincarnated as a man . I feel that he is not without some supporters . " " Well , we do have time to consider the problem . There is no hurry now that he is in the custody of Heaven . I shall give you my thoughts on the matter as soon as I have some . " " That is sufficient , then , for now . " They they they walked walked walked from the from the Hall , then . Vishnu passed from the Garden of Brahma 's Joys ; and as he departed , the Mistress of Death entered there . She addressed the eightarmed statue with the veena and it began to play upon it . Hearing the music , Brahma approached . " Kali ! Lovely Lady . . . " he announced . " Mighty is Brahma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
