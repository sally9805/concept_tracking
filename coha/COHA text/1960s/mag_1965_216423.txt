Christmas comes three times a year at the Young Men 's Christian Association in the Israeli sector of Jerusalem . With hundreds of Jews attending , the Y put on a carol sing to mark the Christmas of Protestants and Roman Catholics . On Jan. 6 it will hold another celebration of the birth of Christ for Orthodox Christians , and on Jan. 18 still a third for Israel 's Armenian Christians , who follow the old Julian calendar . <P> No modern Y.M.C.A. any longer limits its membership to people who are young , male and Christian , but Jerusalem 's Y is the only one in which 95% of the 3,300 members are Jewish , one-third of them women . The organization is so popular that some prominent Israeli families have unsuccessfully tried to use pull to move their children ahead on the long waiting list at its gym . But it started out to be something much more traditional . <P> <P> " I Am the Way . " Financed by a $1,000,000 gift from the late James Newbegin Jarvie , a New Jersey coffee-and-sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loomis Harmon , architect of Manhattan 's famed Empire State Building . One of Israel 's tallest structures , the pink , ocher and brown marble building consists of two domed wings connected by cloisters to a Jesus Tower , symbolizing the Trinity and the Y 's threefold function-developing man 's body , mind and spirit . Twelve cypress trees in the eight acres of gardens represent the twelve Apostles , and on the tower are carved , in Aramaic , Jesus ' words from John : " I am the way . " <P> There were plenty of protests when the Y first opened . Orthodox rabbis complained that the building would be a center for Christian missions , and veiled Moslem women paraded the streets protesting against " this proselytizing organization . " Jerusalem 's Latin-rite Roman Catholic patriarch denounced the Y in a pastoral letter . Since most of the members in the early days were British civil servants and Arab Christians , Palestinian Jews regarded it as a center for Arab espionage during Israel 's war for independence . After the city was partitioned in 1948 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950 when Herbert Leslie Minard , 56 , a Disciples of Christ minister from Fresno , Calif. , took charge of programming and membership for the Y. " We are not a proselytizing organization , " Minard ruled ; he halted Bible classes and refused to let Christian missionaries distribute convert-seeking literature . Minard , who is now the Y 's general secretary , persuaded both Christians and Jews to join its community council , set up adult education courses to help in the acculturation of Jews from 50 countries who had gone to the new land . The Y now teaches 15 subjects , all in Hebrew , ranging from judo to dress cutting . <P> Certificates for Christians . The Y goes out of its way to respect Jewish customs . Its restaurant is closed only one day a year , Yom Kippur , and bar mitzvahs are regularly reported in the monthly bulletin . Although the Moslem chef does not keep a kosher kitchen , bacon , purchased from a Jewish butcher , is served only on request . Orthodox rabbis are pleased that there are separate hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool , which is the only one in Jerusalem that observes the rigid Halakah prohibition against mixed bathing .
