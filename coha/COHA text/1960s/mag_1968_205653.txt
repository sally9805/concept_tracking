Airlines flying to Florida offer all kinds of gimmicks to attract the customers , but their advertising has so far failed to note an increasing phenomenon : the free , hijack trip to Cuba . In recent months , seven planes have been hijacked and forced to fly to Havana . Last week , for the third time in a month , it happened again . Five minutes after National Airlines Flight 28 left Tampa Airport bound for Miami , two tipsy Cuban exiles pulled out pistols , forced a stewardess to unlock the pilot 's cabin and began shouting at Captain Clarence Delk : " Havana ! Havana ! <P> Havana ! " Captain Delk changed course and went to Havana . <P> <P> The latest hijacking was the work of two homesick Cuban exiles who ar rived in Miami last August aboard one of several commercial undercover boats operating out of Florida . A third exile on the plane got cold feet when his companions pulled their guns , but finally accompanied them off the plane when it landed at Havana 's Jose Marti Air port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to get to Cuba , most have been either criminals or emotional misfits . " If a guy has a gun , " says Paul Boatman , manager of the Miami office of the Federal Avi ation Agency , " the safest thing in the public interest is to go ahead and take him where he wants to go . " As a result , no one has been hurt in any of the hijackings . <P> Roast Beef &; Polite Tours . The Cubans have become so used to the hi jacking that they have worked out a reception for the passengers . They usually photograph them , politely take them on a tour of the air-conditioned airport and shopping area , and offer to let them buy Cuban rum and cigars ( which U.S. customs invariably confiscates , since all imports from Cuba are unlawful ) . If there is time , the passengers may be treated to a free meal ; last week 's passengers got a roast-beef dinner while waiting nearly seven hours for their plane to take off . Miami Herald Columnist Charles Whited suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , install a couple of slot machines at the airport and cash in on a good thing . As it is , the airport charges a hefty landing and fueling fee ; National had to promise to pay nearly $1,000 before its plane was allowed to take off . <P> <P> Fidel Castro last week paused in the midst of a speech in which he declared the end of all small private industry in <P> Cuba to take note of the growing little industry of hijacking . " There almost exists , " he cracked , " a regular air route for those who take over planes . " In a less comic vein , however , he accused the U.S. of keeping Cuban ships and planes used by fleeing refugees , threatened to keep any U.S. planes that are hijacked in the future .
