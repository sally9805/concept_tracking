Even in this hungry age of corporate mergers , Chairman-President Harold S. Geneen of International Telephone &; Telegraph Corp . is remarkable for his appetite . Since 1959 , when he took charge of ITT with the intent of making it " one of the most important companies of the next decade , " Geneen has swallowed up 44 smaller firms ; they stretch across such diverse fields as auto rental ( Avis ) , mutual-fund management ( Hamilton ) , consumer finance ( Aetna ) , book publishing ( Bobbs-Merrill ) and even airport parking . Though blocked so far by Justice Department antitrust litigation in his most ambitious effort-to acquire American Broadcasting Cos. - Geneen is still stalking new corporate game . <P> Last week , in one of the year 's more unusual mergers , Geneen agreed to buy Levitt &; Sons , Inc. , the world 's largest home builder , for $92 million worth of ITT stock . The building company , which showed a whole industry how to change the face of postwar suburbia , would operate as an autonomous subsidiary under President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a notable landmark in the gradual transformation of the tradition-bound house building industry . Last year , amid housing 's worst slump since World War II , one out of five home builders went out of business . As small firms vanish , giant combines rich enough to build on a huge scale are taking over . Big corporations such as ITT are increasingly joining forces with builders-often by merger , sometimes through joint ventures . Last year , for example , Westinghouse Electric acquired Florida 's Coral Ridge Properties and is now busy building a city for 60,000 residents near Fort Lauderdale . Pennsylvania Railroad 's Macco Realty Co. is developing an 87,500-acre Rancho California community near Los Angeles with Kaiser Industries and Kaiser Aluminum &; Chemical Corp . American Standard Inc. , the nation 's biggest plumbing manufacturer , this year joined a 4,500-house venture in California 's Ventura County . <P> Such changes already sweeping the industry must have been in Geneen 's mind last week when he called Levitt &; Sons " the ideal vehicle for ITT to participate in the U.S. and abroad in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits into ITT 's spreading empire ( 204,000 employees , 400 offices and plants in 57 countries ) in other ways as well . <P> Through mergers , ITT has been striving to reduce its historic dependence on overseas manufacturing of telephone and electronic equipment and services for the bulk of its income . Thanks chiefly to his relentless pursuit of diversification , Geneen last year achieved his goal of balancing the company 's foreign and domestic earnings . ITT 's total profits reached a record $89.9 million in 1966 as its sales rose 14% , to $2.1 billion . Levitt 's sales , as they have on the average for five years in a row , climbed by 25% , to $94 million . And the building company , which also retails furniture and appliances , makes an obvious outlet for such ITT consumer products as radios , TV sets , refrigerators and freezers .
