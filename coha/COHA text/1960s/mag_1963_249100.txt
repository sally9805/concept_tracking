THE ELEPHANT by Slawomir Mrozek. 176 pages . Grove . $3.95 . <P> <P> A prudent lion refuses to rend Christians in the arena-not because he cares about them but because he senses that they may soon take political power in Rome and he wants his act of neutrality to be on record . <P> A well-heeled small-town matron , thinking a canary too common a pet , keeps a live revolutionary caged in her drawing room instead . <P> A Communist radio announcer de scribes the tag end of a May Day parade : " We can already hear the noise of stamping and shuffling , " he says with enthusiasm . " Yes , here they come . Our glorious incomparable rehabilitated invalids . A spirited detachment of legless men who are swinging their crutches with gusto . Wooden legs reflect the sun . Two men who have lost an arm each get together so they can clap . " <P> Slawomir Mrozek , author of these and scores of other weird vignettes , is a brilliant young Polish satirist . His brief mixtures of fey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humor the howling gap that exists between the world as it is depicted by Communist rhetoricians and the world as it really is . <P> In one story , Mrozek zeroes in on the absurdity of Communist hortatory jargon that often lends heroic titles to mundane party functionaries , hoping to inspire them . A group of civil servants is likened to eagles , and Mrozek takes the elevation literally . Warsaw clerks suddenly begin flying around their offices . They soar away from their desks , take to the mountains in southern Po land , and even begin carrying off lambs . Lead weights , which authorities cagily attached to their shoes , did no good , Mrozek records with relish- " they escaped in their socks . " <P> Journeying in the country , one of Mrozek 's imaginary commentators comes on a much vaunted new telegraph line . But it turns out that the poles have been stolen and the wires were never delivered . Officials , however , have replaced them with a " more modern " system-men stationed every 100 yards to shout the messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a local man proudly explains . " And the postmaster has gone to Warsaw to ask for megaphones . " ' Then comes a shouted message . " Father dead . Funeral Wednesday . " <P> Mrozek 's fantasies , not always political , are often enigmatic , and frequently most haunting when most bizarre . A housewife has trouble talking about marriage troubles to a priest confessor because he can think only of adultery , and her secret is that she has just discovered her handsome spouse is made entirely of plasticene . " An annulment , Father ? " she says , when he finally offers advice . " But we have three children . "
