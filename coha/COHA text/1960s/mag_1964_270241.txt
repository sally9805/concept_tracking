The Brazilian centavo is the monetary equivalent of a gnat 's noggin . Officially the world 's most minuscule denomination , it was-until last week - worth $.0000065 , sixty-five one-hundred thousandths of a U.S. cent . Valued at one twentieth of a cent ( $.0005 ) when it was first issued in 1944 , the centavo became a victim of Brazil 's roaring inflation , and last week the government finally declared it extinct . So is the one-cruzeiro note ( worth 100 centavos ) , which cost four cruzeiros to print . From now on , cruzeiros up to the 500 denomination ( value : 33 ) will be issued as coins . As for the centavo , it immediately became worth more dead than alive . Last week an early ten-centavo piece was fetching 500 cruzeiros from coin collectors .
