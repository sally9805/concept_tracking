Alfie ! by Bill Naughton . A bird is a girl in cockney argot , and Alfie is strictly out for the birds . In this unpretentious and consistently pleasant comedy , Alfie counts the workaday world well lost for lust . He is the modern , international antihero , the man who wants to be kind to everyone and responsible to no one . <P> As a cockney Casanova , Alfie leaves behind him a trail of broken hearts and gravid wombs . If worse comes to worst , Alfie is game to arrange an abortion , though not quite up to paying for it . In the lost lingo of yesteryear , Alfie is a bit of a cad , and it might follow from this that he is repellent . Quite the contrary . Terence Stamp plays him with enormously ingratiating charm , zest and skill . More important , Playwright Naughton has netted a real character , and reality exonerates itself in the theater , turning moralizing attitudes into carping ghosts at a feast . <P> Alfie woos and walks out on six birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a father . His idea of child support is to buy a teddy bear . Another is a Venus flytrap . Still another likes to slave for Alfie , and it touches him , but workers are neuters . " Look at it - scrub , scrub , scrub . " <P> Like most moderns , Alfie suffers from overspecialization , and the comedy could use some of the variety and conflict that spice drama . Still , Alfie himself is irresistibly in the tradition of the picaresque novel , and his running asides are canny and constant delights : " If you make a married woman laugh , you 're halfway there with her . Mind you , it do n't work with a single bird . Get one of them laughin ' and you do n't get nothin ' else . " Bill Naughton was a truck driver before he began writing plays , but it is obvious that he kept a sharp eye on a lot of things besides the road .                  @ @ @
