Creaking Cabinet <P> The formal Cabinet meeting may be on the way out as an important Washington institution . President Kennedy has long believed that Government has become too big and complex for a board-of-directors kind of approach , and nothing about his first full-dress meetings with his Cabinet changed his mind .

The food-stamp plan , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it through Congress in 1959 , though Ezra Taft Benson had let it languish . But Humphrey 's pleasure faded when Kennedy failed to name Minnesota as one of the food-stamp areas . The President mentioned only Pennsylvania , Kentucky , West Virginia and Illinois . Humphrey quickly got on the phone , found that Detroit would be area No. 5 , and set up a big howl . Never mind , he said , that the Administration had named only five trouble spots ; his bill had authorized six-and where was Minnesota ? Answer : Minnesota became area No. 6.
