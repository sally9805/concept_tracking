For two months the small West African country of Dahomey had been racked by a three-way tug of war among rival politicians . The tugging ended abruptly one morning late last month when a burly general in a French paratroop uniform with a chest full of medals led his 1,000-man army into the commercial capital of Cotonou . " I am taking over , " declared General Christophe Soglo , 56 , " because of the incapacity of the politicians to govern . " With that , he dissolved the government and declared himself chief of state . <P> Trends form fast in Africa , and Dahomey seemed to set a pattern last week in two nearby countries : <P> &gt; In the Central African Republic , Colonel Jean-Bedel Bokassa , 44 , over threw President David Dacko , 35 , the country 's only President since independence in 1960 . <P> &gt; In Upper Volta , Lieut . Colonel Sangoule Lamizane , 50 , ousted President Maurice Yamogo after four days of demonstrations in the capital city of Quagadougou against a proposed 20% cut in government salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell in less than two weeks underscored the fact that political independence has not turned out to be the panacea many Africans had dreamed it would be . Dahomey , the C.A.R . and Upper Volta are all pitifully poor , lack the mineral deposits and rich soil necessary to lift the standard of living much above the bare minimums their populations had endured for years . Unable to do much for the people , the politicians unwisely did what they could for themselves . Dahomey 's first President built a $3,000,000 palace ; the Upper Volta 's Yamogo built himself a sumtuous country retreat with a swimming pool , while farmers still desperately seek water holes on the arid plains to keep their cattle from thirsting to death . <P> Trouble had to come , and when it did , the military was the logical , cohesive force to assume leadership . Demonstrators in Upper Volta actually carried signs asking the army to take over . As products of austere French military traditions , the army commanders abhorred frivolity and waste . " France gives us money , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after ousting Yamogo . In the Central African Republic , Colonel Bokassa used almost exactly the same words as he instituted a " moral cleanup " campaign for government officials : no bars , dance halls , riding in taxis . Also forbidden : tom-tom playing during working hours . <P> Once in power , Dahomey 's Soglo and the C.A.R . ' s Bokassa immediately broke relations with the Red Chinese , whom they accused of meddling in domestic affairs . Colonel Bokassa claimed to have found evidence that the Red Chinese had been planning a coup against the government , and summarily packed the entire 32-man embassy staff on a Brazzaville-bound airliner.
