The Scarecrow came to her funeral ; so did Andy Hardy . So , in spirit , did the countless legions of Judy Garland 's fans , 21,000 of whom appeared in per son and jammed the streets of Manhattan 's Upper East Side last week to file past the bier where her body , dressed in the ankle-length gown she had worn at her fifth wedding , lay in state . Many were moved to tears when a young girl from The Bronx began to play Judy 's records on a battery-powered phonograph . Some , of course , came only out of curiosity . Others were responding to a remembered image of the plucky , wide-eyed little girl in The Wizard of Oz who had said : " If I ever go looking for my heart 's desire again , I wo n't look any further than my own backyard . Be cause if it is n't there , I never really lost it to begin with . " <P> Why Change ? Unlike Dorothy of Oz , Judy Garland never really had a backyard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Minn. , Judy was a vaudeville trouper at the age of five . Her father died when she was twelve , and her mother , as Judy remarked bitterly years later , " was no good for anything except to create cha os and fear . She was the worst - the real-life Wicked Witch of the West . " The nearest thing to a home that Judy had was the MGM lot in Hollywood , where - between long agonizing hours before the camera - Louis B. Mayer sent her to the studio school with the rest of his adolescent stars . <P> To her studio , Judy was not a child but a box-office property with rare nat ural gifts . Rarest of all was the instinctive , trembling vocal style that somehow managed to combine womanly pathos and childish innocence . There were no singing lessons to mar her delivery , nor any acting lessons to ruin the uninhibited intensity of her stage presence . " She was so sweet , " recalls Jack Haley , who played the Tin Man . " I would say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star , please stay as sweet as you are , ' and she would say , ' I do n't know what could change me , Jack . Why would anything change ? ' " <P> But she did change . At 21 she was visiting a psychiatrist regularly and living on pills : pills to put her to sleep , pills to wake her up , pills to help keep her weight down . Eleven years , two husbands , and 20 movies ( including the Andy Hardy series with Mickey Rooney , Meet Me in St. Louis and Easter Parade ) after making Oz , she had established herself as the best of a bevy of girlish filmland warblers that included Gloria Jean , Deanna Durbin and Jane Powell . But she could no longer handle the pressure of stardom . She began showing up for work late or sick , then did not show up at all . She was suspended once , twice , and finally , in 1950 , fired for good .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
