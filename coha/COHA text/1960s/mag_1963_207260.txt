The Courtship of Eddie 's Father . A young man named Ronny Howard is Hollywood 's latest heartthrob , but to look at him you 'd never know it . His hair is the color of iodine . His teeth are separated by gaps he can push a pea through . His face is so heavily freckled his eyes can be located only when he blinks . Furthermore , he stands a mere 5 ft. 1 in. , weighs less than 70 Ibs. , and talks in a squeaky little voice that sounds as if it came from a nine-year-old boy . It does . It comes from a nine-year-old boy so charming , cuddly , cunning , cute and competent that sometime this year , if he can manage not to grow a long red beard , he will probably become the most successful kid star of the era : a male Shirley Temple . <P> Ronny hit the big time in the picture business in the 1962 film version of The Music Man , has now been signed to star in a string of multimillion-dollar movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toby and expertly directed by Vincente Minnelli , is the first of these . On the whole , it is just another sentimental comedy of the standard Hollywood brand . But at moments the sentiment warms to pathos , at others the pathos breaks up in belly laughs ; and in all these moments Ronny is the live wire that sparks the show . <P> He plays a six-year-old whose mother has just died . The boy has an original mind ( " Brave boys do n't bleed very much when they 're cut . No matter how big the cut is , they hold their blood in " ) , and he tries hard to understand what has happened to his mother . But he ca n't quite do it till he finds one of his goldfish floating belly up in the tank . At the sight he screams insanely and has to be slapped to his senses , but next morning he bounces up for breakfast as though nothing had happened . <P> " Say , Dad , d' you ever think about gettin ' married ? " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-trained parent , but in due time he meets three women he likes : a blonde ( Shirley Jones ) , a brunette ( Dina Merrill ) , a redhead ( Stella Stevens ) . He inclines to the brunette . His son says nix . " She 's got skinny eyes and big busts , like the bad ladies in the comic books . " Dad laughs , but later on he is forced to admit that kids actually can learn something about life from comic books . But not everything . After bringing up father , the boy develops romantic complications of his own , and he talks them over with the old man in a scene so sly that it does n't really matter if it 's much too cute . <P> " Dad , " he says , as solemn as only six can be , " for the first time in my whole life , I 'm in love . Her name is Cherry . And she loves me , Dad . " <P> " That 's good . Is she pretty ? " <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't so pretty from behind , Dad . " <P> " I see . " <P> " Dad , I 'd like to give her a present . " <P> " That 's nice . What ? " <P> <P> " Money . " <P> " Money ! How about a book ? " <P> " She ca n't read very good , Dad . And besides , I 'd like to give her the thing she likes best . " <P> <P> " Money is out ! Give her something that means a lot to you . Women like that . " <P> " My old sneakers ! " <P> " For God 's sake ! " <P>
