University of Florida fans call him " Batman , " " Goldflinger , " and " S.O.S. " A pro scouting report credits him with " the arm of Sammy Baugh , the poise of Johnny Unitas , the leadership of Norm Van Brocklin and the quickness of Joe Namath . " A rival coach calls him " the greatest quarterback in the history of college football . " Now wait a minute , fellows . His high school coach remembers him as being " slow and awkward . " Teammates say he is forever falling asleep . And his team has lost two out of its last three games . But last week sportswriters voted to award Florida 's Steve Spurrier the Heisman Trophy as the No. 1 college player in the nation . And what does Spurrier , 21 , say about that ? " I guess , " he moans , " that I was born a year too late . " <P> Too late , Spurrier means , to become an instant millionaire . Now that pro football 's two leagues have merged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Steve may have to settle for being merely well-to-do . He has hired a lawyer to plead his case-and quite a case it is . Spurrier has completed an astounding 61% of his passes , hitting on 179 out of 291 attempts for 2,012 yds. and 16 touchdowns . Against Miami last week , Steve completed 26 out of 49 for 227 yds. and one TD , although the Gators lost 21-16 . To top it all off , he also handles the kicking chores for the Gators : he has averaged 40.8 yds. per punt , booted three field goals - including a last-minute 40-yarder against Auburn that won the game 30-27 . The son of a Presbyterian minister , married to the niece of Penn State 's former coach Rip Engle , Spurrier rarely smokes , drinks only an occasional beer , is active in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes . Rumor has it that under secret terms of the pro merger , he is ticketed to the National Football League 's New York Giants , who desperately need a top quarterback if they are to improve on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a tie . Steve insists that he has not yet talked terms with the Giants , and wo n't until the Gators meet Georgia Tech in the Orange Bowl on Jan. 2 . Then , says his lawyer , the bargaining will " start at $200,000 and work up " - to $400,000 or so .
