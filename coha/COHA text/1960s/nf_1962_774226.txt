txt  | of the original , clear enough to be seen as changes but not so clear as to prevent recognition of their source . In short , Ruskin wants a real but slow modification of the traditional . There must be no sharp break with the past , nothing radical or revolutionary ; but there must also be no slavish fidelity to the past . This sounds so much better than it really is that Ruskin has to throw up the sponge and confess that " while it is easy to enumerate the signs of life , it is impossible to define or communicate life " ( p. 278 ) . But if he wishes architects to take over these signs of life and incorporate them in their work , what is he doing but telling them to copy with a fidelity which he has just condemned ? He admits that Raphael lifted whole figures from Perugino and Masaccio , that the architects who built the Romanesque churches incorporated into them classical capitals , but this was done frankly and with no attempt to conceal it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century was just as frank when he asked his patron whether he wanted a Queen Anne cottage or a French provincial manor . The reproduction of Marie Antoinette 's Trianon which was built for Mme de Castellane on the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne made no attempt to conceal its origin but on the contrary flaunted it . How much change was required to give such buildings the quality of life ? At this point we must let Ruskin again speak for himself . Dealing with the history of Christian architecture he says ( p. 283 ) , " We have at first an imitation , almost savage in its rudeness , of a classical design ; as the art advances , the design is modified by a mixture of Gothic grotesqueness , and the execution more complete , until a harmony is established between the two , in which balance they advance to new perfection . Now during the whole period in which the ground is being re-covered , there will be found in the living architecture marks , not to be mistaken , of intense impatience ; a struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling to be neglected ; and a restless disdain of all qualities which appear either to confess contentment , or to require a time and care which might be better spent .  | And , exactly as a good and earnest student of drawing will not lose time in ruling lines or finishing backgrounds about studies which , while they have answered his immediate purpose , he knows to be imperfect and inferior to what he will do hereafter , so the vigor of a true school of early architecture , which is working under the influence of a high example or which is itself in a state of rapid development , is very curiously traceable , among signs , in the contempt of exact symmetry and measurement which in dead architecture are the most painful necessities . " In brief then , vitality is shown by a lack of perfection , a rapidity of execution , and I imagine that this is the difference between a sketch and a finished painting where the latter is carefully rounded off , varnished , and polished . It is probably true that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be more appropriately to the former . This would be just , for living beings are seldom so wellbalanced , so perfectly proportioned , as geometrical symmetry would require . To prove this one has only to trace a human face , a butterfly , or a leaf which looks symmetrically disposed about a vertical axis and then fold it along the axis . The two halves will never coincide precisely . It may also be the reason why modern imitations of Greek temples , such as the Madeleine in Paris , strike some people as " cold and lifeless . " On the other hand , I have heard these very adjectives applied by Englishmen and Americans to French seventeenth-century tragedies which seem anything but either cold or lifeless to the audiences at the Theatre Frangais . I recall my professors in college saying much the same thing about even Alexander Pope and other Augustans . An ear which can not hear the subtleties of Racine 's alexandrines may well find them mechanical rather than alive , and if he does not like mechanisms , may well find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind of the spectator . It is true that some writers admired Gothic architecture because they thought it was irregular , like nature.9 The truth was of course that they had never seen a finished Gothic cathedral and when it takes a century or more to complete a building , it is likely that  | modifications will be made in the original design or that some parts which were to have been included have been omitted . The two towers of Chartres are unlike each other , but were they originally planned to be that way ? Ruskin too has a yearning for slight irregularities and inequalities . As an example he cites the facade of the Cathedral of Pisa and enumerates the variations in its arcades and arches . And after citing the measurements , he says , " Now I call that Living Architecture " ( p. 293 ) . After similar remarks about St. Mark 's in Venice , he then quotes a comment of the English architect Wood who thought it and the Ducal Palace next door extremely ugly . " Some persons , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that irregularity is a necessary part of its excellence . I am decidedly of a contrary opinion , and am convinced that a regular design of the same sort would be far superior . " This might have given Ruskin pause , but on the contrary he simply asserts that Wood , though " by no means unintelligent in his observations generally , " here shows " the effect of a contracted knowledge and false taste " ( p. 298 ) . But a psychological effect caused by a material arrangement of details ought to appear in any normal human psyche , and if it fails to , the only reasonable conclusion is that its appearance is determined by something other than the object before one . Either the irregularity of Pisa and St. Mark 's did not strike Wood as vital , in which case it is not the cause of the feeling of vitality ; or Wood was not interested in vitality , in which case vitality is not inevitably one of the marks of great architecture . Ruskin did not say that there was any recipe for achieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built altogether from feeling . . . and it was because they did so , that there is this marvelous life , changefulness , and subtility running through their every arrangement ; and that we reason upon the lovely building as we should upon some fair growth of the trees of the earth , that know not their own beauty " ( p. 302 ) . For this reason all good work is freehand work ( p. 309 ) , work in which the machine has had no part . It would be easy to point out that a chisel and mallet  | are machines and so are a plumb line , an adze , and a yard stick . But they are machines , it might be said , which permit more variation than an electric drill or saw or pneumatic chisel . These variations are of course errors if the aim is accuracy . But if the aim is evidence of handwork , then they become signs of vitality . The relativity of vitality to the instruments used is important , even if vitality is admittedly one 's aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not any more irregularity than it is evidence of humanity . One wants to see the hand of a man in his work , not merely to know that it has been there . But Ruskin goes farther than that , for he is addicted to extreme inferences . He sees in what he calls vitality evidence of the workman 's happiness ( pp. 316 ff. ) and joy . This is not only extreme but fallacious , for Ruskin is transferring his own feelings to the artist . For we must again point out that there is no reason to believe that the effect of a work of art upon a spectator is identical with , or even similar to , the feelings of an artist when he was in the process of making it . It may be the case and it may not . But to insist that it is always the case is as absurd as to maintain that the blue sky which fills us with joy is itself joyful . 6 . The Lamp of Memory Ruskin opens his discussion of this standard of excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he imagined they would be before another landscape " in some aboriginal forest of the New Continent " ( p. 323 ) . A " sudden blankness and chill " came over him . " The flowers in an instant lost their light , the river its music ; the hills became oppressively desolate ; a heaviness in the boughs of the darkened forest showed how much of their former power had been dependent upon a life which was not theirs , how much of the glory of the imperishable , or continually renewed , creation is reflected from  | things more precious in their memories than it is in its renewing . Those ever-springing flowers and ever-flowing streams had been dyed by the deep colors of human endurance , valor , and virtue ; and the crests of the sable hills that rose against the evening sky received a deeper worship , because their far shadows fell eastward over the iron wall of Joux , and the four-square keep of Granson " ( p. 323 ) . It is this remembrance of the past which architecture is specially equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the European past , and because of this the sight of them would be cold , lifeless , dark , depressing , and so on . Man desires a firm assurance of his link with what has gone before and the strongest of these links is found in architecture . Architecture then should be built to last . We shall spare any possible reader Ruskin 's long passage on the sanctity of the home , which to his way of thinking is the house , and his religious passion as he argues that impermanent housing is disrespect to God and morality . We are more inclined to build domestic architecture so that it may be altered to meet new sanitary possibilities , growth of family , and all the other problems which confront men as time moves on . He of course pays little attention to such matters and , moreover , to him it is the facade of the building which is of the most interest and importance . Light and air , interior space , adequate provision for sanitation and cooking do not concern him . A house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetorical passages on our debt to unborn generations , our yearning for the marks of history , our necessity to defeat transiency of things without once mentioning the use which a building is designed to meet . One is compelled to reply , our debt to the unborn is to be paid by giving them a decent dwelling , not in handing on to them an obsolete one ; our yearning for the past had better be satisfied in literature than in living conditions ; and rather than defeat the passage of time , we had better accept it and meet its challenge face to face . As a matter of cold fact , Ruskin himself can do little with the Lamp of Memory and spends more of his words singing the praises of tradition and castigating restoration . It would seem  | to me personally that the best way to apply this principle would be to continue doing what the average domestic architect of the United States does anyway : put up a colonial red brick dwelling and let its occupants dream of good King George III and Lord North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of quahaugs and scallops . 7 . The Lamp of Obedience The opening of this chapter is a candid statement of what Ruskin 's aims have been : to show how " every form of noble architecture is in some sort the embodiment of the Polity , Life , History , and Religious Faith of nations " ( p. 361 ) . This is indeed true . And Obedience is the crowning virtue of them all . To Obedience j " Polity owes its stability , Life its happiness , Faith its acceptance , and Creation its continuance " ( Ibid . ) . In a gloss of unusual sagacity he points out flatly that there is no such thing as liberty . This is sagacious in that he appreciates our dependence on our forebears , our contemporaries , our traditions , natural law , all of which determine our conduct and afford us our means of action . To this no one could properly object . It is simply the expression of sound common sense . The architect who is building with stone can not do what he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not do with it what he could do with concrete . But if this is common sense , we simply can not be disobedient . As in our speech we have to accept with almost complete fidelity the customs of vocabulary and grammar if we wish to communicate , so clearly in building a house or skyscraper , we have to obey the laws of statics and whatever is expressed in the formulas of engineering . To disobey such laws is a manifest impossibility . ' What then can we disobey ? It turns out once again that we are to work within a tradition . Originality is deprecated , except insofar as it is an accident . Living  | just a generation before the most revolutionary changes were made in all the arts , Ruskin was shortsighted enough to exclaim , " We want no new school of architecture . Who wants a new style of painting or sculpture ? " ( p. 368 ) . What is wanted is one general code of laws accepted and enforced from one end of the nation to the other . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source of all our troubles , would cease and happiness descend upon the land . There is little said under the rubric of Obedience which had not been said by him before . Though Ruskin is always annoying with his preaching and denunciation , yet he has at least said one thing in the Seven Lamps which , we feel , should be taken with the greatest seriousness . And that is that the appreciation of a work of art is not made in a vacuum , but on the contrary in the total environment of a man 's interests . Whatever his shortcomings , he at least saw that no work of art was just an aesthetic surface to be explored exclusively by the sensory organs . We may not feel impelled to see history in a building , to see a mountainous cliff in a skyscraper , to see happiness in a capital of leaves and flowers , but at any rate we are told that there is more to a building than a perceptual pattern . Everyone has always known this , but we have become intimidated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick and tired of the commonplace literal representations of natural objects . Ruskin never denied the beauty of some abstract forms , but he affirmed the presence in works of art of other qualities as well , and for that the man of today may be grateful . Remembering it , we can see the work of art as a whole and with our whole minds . In the second place , there is a fusion here , as was inevitable , between moral and aesthetic values , meaning by aesthetic here the purely perceptual . If Ruskin had restrained his enthusiasm , it would be difficult to object to his ethics . Loyalty to material , obedience to tradition , love of nature , surely are not mean and base traits , however much he may have inflated his rhetoric to deal with them . But even if they are not the virtues which we specially  | admire , and if they are expressed in works of art , we might with a little good will grant that a man has a right to look for them and find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find them , he has a right to say so and to announce his appreciation of them . But , I will be told , we must distinguish between the ethical and the aesthetic . We have , it is true , two words here and they mean different things , but if what they mean is actually integrated in a work of art , why should we deny it ? When Tolstoi says that a work of art which does not further brotherly love is ugly , that seems like a confusion . But is there any reason to assert that the same shudder of disgust which we feel in front of what we discover to be ugly can not be stimulated by what we believe to be immoral ? I am not saying that the differentia of evil is ugliness , but nevertheless the sight of evil may be ugly . And , for all I know , the sight of virtue may be beautiful . If this is possible , then it is also possible for a work of art to be immoral if it awakens feelings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can not see why he should deny it . I am willing to confess that I find Ingres ' " Bain Turc " disgusting , not because of any technical faults which I have been able to discover , but simply because I have the same feeling of revulsion before it which I would have before a pool of slimy water crawling with white worms . As far as I know , I have no objections to a crowd of naked women squirming about on the floor , if I am not forced to look at them . But all this may be a poor excuse on my part for a lack of manliness . I may in fact-be trying to pacify a certain attraction which these bodies have for me and of which I thoroughly disapprove . Who can tell ? If I see a bully torturing a child in the street , I am repelled also . A picture of such a scene might either please me , if I read into it a criticism of cruelty , or displease me , if I saw it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult and , I should imagine , foolish for me to look at the real scene and simply comment on its color , form , and design . I am not urging anyone to take an ethical attitude toward works of art , far from it . But since I believe that no painting is  | only a painting and no building only a building , but that all works of art have multiple facets , if one of these facets reflects moral values , that has to be taken into account . Whatever one may say in dispraise of Ruskin , his basic idea was sound . The artist , he maintained , is a complete man , occupying a place in society , preoccupied by moral and religious problems , producing things for the enjoyment of others as well as for himself , things which moreover would inevitably be interpreted as something more than a source of sensory pleasure . ' When all is said and done , his general attitude toward the arts seems more congruent with experience than that of writers who would skim off colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they rest . Yet it should never be forgotten that in spite of his extraordinary influence , he was still a man of the nineteenth century and did not foresee the radical changes which were to take place in philosophy , science , technology , as well as in the arts . Great as has been the influence of such men , Aristotle , Horace , and their imitators , Boileau , Pope , Du Fresnoy , Guadet , and Fux , it is questionable whether it has ever been so effective on artists as on critics . For artists are more likely to be influenced by other artists than by theorists and critics . The followers of Raphael and Michelangelo , of Mozart and Beethoven and Wagner , of Brunelleschi and Bernini and Frank Lloyd Wright , of Richardson and Walpole and Faulkner , were in all probability more numerous than the dramatists who followed Aristotle , the painters who followed Bellori , the architects who followed Guadet , the composers who followed Clementi , and the novelists who today follow Edmund Wilson , Van Wyck Brooks , or Rene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe that a man with an itch to write , paint , compose music , build , first reads books which criticize the works of the dead . Once such a man has begun his career , he will no doubt , if he has the time , read critical essays . But one can no more think that a painter , before beginning to paint , would first read Ruskin 's Modern Painters , than one could believe that the painters of the Italian Renaissance tried to conform to what  | Berenson was going to say about them 400 years after their death . Historically the work of art is always prior to the work of criticism . The critic would have nothing to criticize if this were not so , and the theorist would have no basis for his theories . The first Greek works on the arts were written centuries after the first works of art were made and the first serious treatise on the beautiful , by Plotinus , was not written until the third century A.D. Berenson 's discovery of tactile values was made after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation from the Muses or by deductive methods . Ruskin first studied Gothic architecture and what he thought was Gothic painting before writing his various critical essays . His Seven Lamps were universally illuminating simply because he said so and because he thought that the artists whom he admired were examples of excellence for all times and places . In fact in his case , the generation immediately following his violated every one of his rules and made a decisive break with the past which he thought was eternal . Common sense suffices to show that an aesthetician can describe only the works of art with which he is acquainted and theoretically he might be acquainted with all works of art up to his time . But obviously he can not know the future and is merely shouting in vain when he pretends to dictate to the future . Critics would do well to wake up to the fact that the arts have a history and that in the Occident the history of the arts shows steady and unbroken change . This change will be found not only in the look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform also . There have been , of course , times when artists have tried to revive the past , but the Swiss Guards are not living in the sixteenth century simply because they wear uniforms designed by Michelangelo . It is indubitably true that once one knows what function has been assigned to any work of art , whether the assignment has been made by the artist or by someone else , one can tell whether the function has been well-performed . But that does not condemn all humanity to liking or approving of the work of art simply because it has been a successful instrument . One may with a certain  | objectivity admire the skill with which the function has been performed , and that indeed is relevant to aesthetics . But I fail to see why our admiration for skill should entail our finding the instrument beautiful . We need not know how to express our sense of beauty in order to feel its power . No one can say truthfully why he finds a woman beautiful , though everyone will make the attempt . Nor does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before being attracted to a woman . But we may also look at a landscape and be carried away by its beauty without being warranted in generalizing its character as the essential traits of all beautiful landscapes . As Delacroix said , there are varietes du beau . Romantic scenery , such as one finds in the canvases of Salvator Rosa , came in with the eighteenth century and the landscape without figures was to all intents and purposes a nineteenth-century invention.r0 Hence , though we may know the significance of the cryptic paintings of Tanguy or Mark Tobey or Masson or Kandinski and conclude that they have done what they set out to do , that in no way commits us to liking them or finding them anything more than " interesting . " The interest may begin by being what is wrongly called purely intellectual , and it may of course grow into evoking in us admiration for a job well done and thence into a genuine liking for the artistry which has been so successful . So we may admire a perfect crime , could we find one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirmish of psychological warfare , perfectly successful social climbing , or any other perfectly successful bit of behavior , the end of which we find detestable . Hypocrites , liars , venal politicians , orators , financial wizards , sophists , may all be perfectly successful in reaching their ends , whatever those ends may be , and we may be forced against our distaste to admit that they have reached them admirably . The hypocrites have convinced the public that they were sincere ; the liars have gained a reputation for naive and candid truthfulness ; the politicians have been elected over and over again ; the orators have transported the public in wild enthusiasm ; and the sophists have tangled up their adversaries in the spider webs of their argu-  | ments and then devoured them . Is one then compelled to like and approve of hypocrisy , mendacity , oratory , financial scheming , and sophistry ? It was Greenough 's unfortunate admiration for the clipper ship , if I am not mistaken , which started the vogue for functionalism . Unfortunate , because simply as a spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea speedily with all sails set . But the sight of the ship was no revelation of its functional success . The adaptation of instrument to end , whether in a tool or in animal anatomy , has always aroused the admiration of those who have known of it , just as the supposed interrelations of the parts of the solar system have convinced men that it must have been made by a God who shared their taste for instrumental efficiency . Most tools are successful : screw drivers , monkey wrenches , hammers , axes , buzz saws , telephones , and bulldozers . And when such tools become obsolete , men gather around to look at them in museums and they turn into objets d'art . The beauty of instrumentally obsolete instruments accounts for most of our household furnishings , our religious rituals , our college curricula . But it should be noted that we find such things beautiful because they no longer serve any useful purpose . Before they became obsolete , no one talked about their beauty . This principle , on which I have expatiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who have heard of it . It seems to lower the rank of the beautiful and to make works of art trivial . Quite the contrary is the truth of the matter . From Aristotle down to our contemporaries , it has been pointed out that only that which is good-initself is worth striving for , and by definition , an instrument is good-for-something-else . If one has to know the purpose of an object before one can find it beautiful , how can a man find a woman beautiful just by looking at her ? And what is the purpose of a landscape , of the sky , of flowers and butterflies , of a color ? Even if it is believed on faith that everything has some purpose and that one can discover what it is and then be able to tell whether it has or has not performed its function well , the fact is that we  | find things beautiful long before we discover what their purposes are . In one sense of the word the function of a tree is to produce the seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species . It serves this purpose , as everyone knows , very badly , by which I simply mean very wastefully . But even if it did it well , would we not see that the tree was beautiful without thinking of its generative powers ? The question is purely rhetorical . Like works of art , works of nature have not only their purposes in the biological or economic scheme of things , but purposes for which we and not nature fit them . Which purposes are we to choose before admiring them ? We are back again at our starting point , namely that purposes or functions are given to things by us , and that we may all differ in what purpose we may assign to a given object .  | The Arrested Moment ONE OF THE functions which is assumed by works of art , when they have become obsolete as instruments , is the freezing of time . This is not usually a function of which the artists are aware , though many of them seem to hope that they are working for posterity and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes called immortality . But whether an artist is aware of this or not makes little difference . One of the most potent forces in human desire is the defeat of time and change . Nor is it so unusual , as Goethe seemed to think , that man bids a moment , fair or not , to stay . And it is hard to see why the bidder should be turned over to the Devil . The freezing of time is brought about in several ways . We retain the past in our language without deliberately meaning to , for as soon as a common noun is glued to a new object or event , that thing becomes fixed as a member of a permanent class and to it are attributed all the essential characteristics of the class . As a result of this inevitable but misleading procedure , no matter how much novelty is discoverable in the thing labeled , the novelty will be thought of as inessential or as deliberate perversion of tradition . The right way is then the traditional way and , though the traditional way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too has been congealed into a formula in the realm of ideas . One has simply to look up definitions of well-known animals and plants in a dictionary to see how much has to be left out if the defini-  | tions are to cover a large number of cases . The definition of the word cow , for instance , may include the colors of various cows , white , red , brown , and black , but obviously can not include the description of any one particular cow which may be an Ayrshire out of a Guernsey dam . This is not the fault of definitions . They are not supposed to do more than give a reader the clue to identifying the thing which the word being defined names . Our comment is no more than an indication of their limitations . Any cow , then , will be covered by a good definition of the word cow , but no individual cow will be described by it except in so far as her traits are those of all cows . Thus a conception of what cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our minds , but it is only a conception . If a cow turns up which has certain novel aspects of her own , then she is either not a cow or the novelty is not real or the definition bad . Cows , like other works of God , seldom create a problem for philosophers of art . We accept them as they are and submit ourselves docilely to the natural order . But works of art are by definition made by man , and for some reason or other we want them too to maintain a fixity of nature which precludes novelty and change . When one considers the definitions of painting , portrait , illustration , landscape , sonnet , ode , and epic , fugue , sonata , tone-poem , romantic and classic , poetry and prose , the comic and the tragic , to say nothing of other class names of works of art and artistry , of movements , traditions , schools , one sees at once that we hope to transfer to the realm of human desires and their satisfaction the same immutable natures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not restrict communication to proper names . And the moment one ventures into the realm of universals ( adjectives , relations , and common nouns ) one runs the risk of violating the traditional definitions of the terms one uses . One sees a collage by Picasso and says , " What a beautiful ? or ugly ? picture ! " Immediately the objection is raised that it can not be a picture since a picture has to be a picture of something and , moreover , it has to be drawn or painted . The collage is labeled " Still Life , " but  | there is no recognizable object in it and we are used to seeing jugs , tables , flowers , shells , dead game , and the like in still lifes . Therefore it is not a still life and we say that the label should be changed . Then we see that along with the pieces of paper which are glued to the board there are also certain areas which have been colored with paint . It is not even a collage , but partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraps are one or two letters cut from a newspaper . But they do not spell anything . Bit by bit we are harassed into admitting that there is no word in common use which can be applied to this object . One is defeated . One 's adversary , for there is always an adversary , walks off triumphant , having forced us to confess that we do not know what we are looking at . Why has there been all this argument ? Not simply in the interests of a stable vocabulary , for people likely to engage in this sort of dialogue know how language has grown and how it continues to grow . In part the trouble arises because of Picasso 's violation of the traditional formulas and in part because of his introduction of such a degree of novelty into his work that the spectator can not classify what he is seeing . To break through the limitations of tradition is a genuine threat to security . To be unable to understand , whatever meaning one gives to that term , is to be frustrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , one might ask , what is there to understand in a work of art ? If the work of art is of an art of communication , then one can expect to understand what is being communicated . One can communicate ideas , can transfer one 's emotions to others , can raise doubts , can edify morally , or simply describe . The art of communicating ideas in its literary form is exposition and presumably when one understands an expository essay , one can paraphrase its ideas in declarative sentences , it being understood that the author will agree with what you have understood him to say . It is of course rare that this occurs , because most authors have a sufficient grasp of the language which they are using to deny the possibility of a paraphrase 's being as good as the original . And if we  | assume that no two words are identical both in denotation and connotation , then such an author might be right . Synonyms are seldom exact . I open my dictionary at random and find that decry is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decry , I find that disparage , derogate from , detract from , belittle , and minimize are given as its synonyms and that the lexicographer has carefully distinguished the meaning of each of these synonyms from all the others and quite rightly too . So witty , humorous , facetious , jocular , and jocose are also given as synonyms and again care has been taken to distinguish their precise meanings . But this is an old story and needs no further comment here . On the other hand , though synonyms are seldom if ever exactly identical in meaning , the caution against using them is a bit pedantic , for we do all make abstracts and summaries of things which we have read and we use them in place of the originals . This in itself does not prove that we are right to do so , but it at least shows that a paraphrase may have pragmatic value . As for the transfer of emotions , one usually does this by shouts , cries , laughter , gestures , facial expressions , but sometimes one attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Wordsworth said , and he surely must have known , that the emotion to be transferred must be recollected in tranquility , for when one is in the grip of an emotion , one can hardly be expected to write verse or paint pictures . To write or to paint is itself an experience surrounded by or bathed in emotion , but that emotion is hardly the one being transferred . I am not the first to point out that often some apparently insignificant detail of a situation will produce the emotional sting , whether it be the taste of a madeleine or the wood spurge 's cup of three . I suspect that much of the emotional force of some of Utrillo 's paintings comes from the little figure in black in the middle of the deserted street which appears in so many of them . Van Gogh 's painting of a pair of boots with the worn hobnails showing , the thin trickle of blood on the scalp of Saint Stephen in Fouquet 's portrait of Etienne Chevalier , the hands in Ingres ' portrait of Bertin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pregnant detail . And if the emotion evoked by the work of art is one felt also by the artist and then communicated to the spectator , it would be reasonable to attribute the evocative power of the work to the detail in question . But from the artist 's point of view , what has been done is to fix a moment of his past so that it will not disappear into vacuity . His past , however , is never that of the spectator , nor could it be . Yet a work of art can be so intimately absorbed into the life of those who assume it to have been addressed to them , that the past preserved in it becomes , as it were , their past too . This , one imagines , accounts for much of the power of Oriental sculpture . If ever there was an art which is almost entirely foreign to Occidental ways of thinking and feeling , it is Indian and , in general , southeast Asian art . We have nothing in Mediterranean Paganism , Judaism , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Buddha in meditation , or an Apsaras . Yet it seems incredible that anyone could look at the sculptures in the caves of Elephanta or the great heads on the towers of the Bayon at Angkor , and not be carried away by their sheer power . Both the simplicity and the size of these sculptures compel one to look at them in silence and meditation . And bit by bit , they enter into one 's consciousness and fill it like a long poem or a slow piece of music . One can judge such things only from one 's own experience of them , and all of us have a tendency to set up our experience as typical of the whole human race . But on this basis , however shaky it may be , one might erect a theory that it is not the pregnant detail at all which is most evocative of feeling , but the absence of detail or , if one will , of the transformation of the entire work of art into a single detail . There seems , moreover , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a desire to preserve the past by the scrupulous copying of a recognized masterpiece . Mr. A. B. Griswold in a passage to which I have already referred ( Chap . V , n. 1 ) , tells us that the Siamese " image-maker had no desire to be original : he was always a copyist . It may be hard for us to believe that the master-  | pieces are all copies no less than the stereotyped statuettes produced by the thousand for the general market ; to us in the West the difference between a genuine old master and a copy is immeasurable , even if we have to get an expert to decide which it is . In the art of the image-maker , on the contrary , copying is not only the line of least resistance , it is ( or was , until Western ideas began to break the tradition ) a necessity : an indicative reminder is , by definition , a copy . " In short , the image-maker resembles the mediaeval scribe who preserved the literature of the past by copying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking , it might be well to point out that it is more familiar than we seem to realize . The Siamese have been criticized for their interest in having a story retold in exactly the same words which were used to tell it the first time they heard it . As one travels through the Orient one sees incidents from the Ramayana painted on walls , danced on the stage , and carved in reliefs . These images are not ancient but have been frequently reproduced in modern times , though the people who enjoy them know the stories by heart . But after all certain literary masterpieces of the West , the plays of Shakespeare for instance , are read over and over again , not merely by successive generations , but by individuals who like to renew their acquaintance with them . Gilbert and Sullivan operettas are attended by Gilbert and Sullivan enthusiasts year in and year out . The operas of Puccini , Verdi , and of course Wagner , are so often produced that they crowd contemporary operas off the stage . The public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayreuth the annual performances of the Ring remind one of the repeated performances of the Passion Play in Oberammergau and that in more ways than one . Publishers continually publish books on painting with the same illustrations in them of the frescoes of Giotto , Piero della Francesca , and Michelangelo , and no proof is needed that the purchasers of these volumes are not merely men and women who have never seen the originals . The most striking example of the repetition of the familiar is religious ritual , which in  | the minds of believers must be repeated ipsissiniis verbis each time the services are given . And to insure the exactitude of the repetition , prayer books and missals are printed for the use of officiants and worshipers as well . In this way the passage of time is defeated and the past is preserved intact . One should add to this Shakespeare 's practice of lifting whole passages from North 's Plutarch and Florio 's Montaigne , modified only by the exigencies of blank verse . Well-known Latin tags , familiar quotations , the recasting of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture . Poetic diction , ceremonial speech , such as using the second person singular in addressing God , formulas of politeness as frozen as those in Japanese , are usually archaistic , as are the full-dress costumes of men , civilian , military , and academic . In these and similar matters we do not want the new to appear ; we want the reassurance that the past is still with us , however illusory the reassurance may be . A work of art then may well be one of the instruments for achieving this end . The flight from time has always characterized Western civilization , even if we are not so aware of it as we are in the East . Art not only can freeze the present and carry along the past but also help in the avoidance of the future . The codification of laws which can actually do no more than congeal the status quo is used by courts to prevent any changes in the future , as if the future could actually be forced by the magic of words to repeat the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courts of appeal act as if a concept verbalized in the time of Edward the Confessor could be applied to the present and future . Yet we have every reason to believe that this magic is performed by refusing to admit as real the obvious changes that have occured . A person suddenly realizing that he is not immortal will make a will supposed to be effective in carrying out his desires for three generations , if not forever . The document will not only prescribe his funeral rites but also , of course , the proper division of his property . Because of his present likes and dislikes , he will bequeath money to one member of his family and cut off another ,  | tie up funds in trust for his grandchildren , dictate what should be done with his books , jewels , clothes , and family souvenirs , and thus try to prevent the accidents , which since they will be accidents can not be foreseen , from happening . The older universities of this country have funds encumbered with absurd limitations which date from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of families now extinct , funds for books in subjects which are no longer of any interest , prizes for essays on subjects which no one studies any longer , and our contemporaries often fail to profit from their ancestors ' mistakes . The present vogue for natural science , for instance , excellent in itself , is stifling work in the Humanities and turning the United States into a country of technicians . This is all in the name of selfpreservation and no one would pretend that a nation should commit suicide . But it is sometimes forgotten that the basic metaphors and intellectual models used in the sciences come from the arts.l It is also forgotten that the dissatisfaction with the present which acts as a stimulus to scientific , as well as to social , progress is characteristic of the artist whose dreams of a more beautiful , more orderly , more intelligible world may be just as important in scientific as in aesthetic work . There are , as we shall have occasion to repeat frequently in this study , always two extreme forms of temperament in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is also always conflict between them . The submissive individual is only too happy to let things stand as they are and to do whatever he can to keep them as they are . His humility in the face of higher authority may be both saintly and stupid , saintly in its self-abnegation , stupid in its sloth . The recalcitrant individual finds no salvation in obedience and in his extreme form wants to change everything . The lasting security of a social group depends on the equilibrium between the two tendencies , for if the submissive souls have their way , a society will be unable to face the new problems which are bound to arise as long as there are neighbors beyond the social frontiers , or the possibilities of natural disasters , such as floods ,  | droughts , earthquakes , fires , and overpopulation . But on the other hand , if one objects to everything and sets out to change it , clearly the result will be chaos and men will become unable to solve any problem whatsoever . For the solution of problems depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the future repeats nothing whatsoever from the past , one is in a desperate situation . The history of the arts illustrates this interaction between recalcitrancy and submission . If one takes the history of one art alone , painting , one sees clearly how a given painter , for instance , Duccio , preserves and also modifies the tradition out of which he emerged . Duccio retains much of Byzantinism , but he also , as everyone knows , introduces certain novelties . Giotto preserves much of Cimabue and yet modifies what he preserves . One can classify even Rembrandt as a Caravaggesco , but one also sees much more in his handling of light and dark than is in the sixteenthcentury Italian . Monet , Seurat , Sisley , and Pissarro can , if one is enamored of classifications and schools , be lumped together as Impressionists , but the fact that the term Neoimpressionist had to be invented to label two of these painters is proof enough that they and their admirers recognized what they had added to the technique of their seniors . A single painter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , inevitably grows and , though like Ingres he may think that he clings to the teachings of his master ? in this case Raphael 2 ? nevertheless in his old age does not paint as he did in his youth . This sort of thing can be illustrated in all the arts . Nor is it mysterious . No man is uniform . He is a sheaf of purposes which are sometimes in conflict with one another , though the conflict may be attenuated in some cases more than in others . It goes without saying that some people are not only self-satisfied but satisfied with the world around them , if they are ignorant of what lies beyond their immediate horizons . Ingres , for instance , was much more self-satisfied than Delacroix ever was , but since he was a man of the world and knew that there existed people unlike himself , he was at least dissatisfied with their existence and did his best to discourage them . He would have petrified  | painting in the condition of his own painting if he could have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like many another man in his situation , railed against the existence of variety and change . Unfortunately the appeasement which comes from venting one 's anger in words seems to have little effect upon the course of history , for history does not listen . There is of course a certain pathos in our desire to fix the past and thus retain it . We all no doubt have a strong nostalgia for whatever we think of as the happiest time of our life , and one can sympathize with this in spite of its futility . But what is of more interest is a survey of the possible reasons for our flight from time . Here we are in the realm of speculation , for no one really knows why human beings love the things they love and hate the things they hate , since no one knows why human beings are not more homogeneous . But one can see that just as reluctance to change in either an individual or a group makes for stability , so the equally irrational desire to change accustoms men to meeting new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing that they must be faced at all costs , if life is to continue . When a tidal wave , an earthquake , a hurricane descends upon a village , the villagers actually have but one choice : to escape . It is always theoretically possible to lie down and die and I am not denying that . But in general people will try to save their lives , even if after the passing of the disaster they go straight back to living as they did before . Now it is true that each day brings some new problem of small proportions to mankind . Each glance at the world about us shows us differences which are greater than the similarities . Each hour presents new irregularities , but we do not have to be conscious of them and happily our minds are skilled in overlooking them . Happily , since if we had to live in continuous novelty and to meet its challenge , we should go mad . The synthetic view of the world , which is able to overlook novelties and differences and see things as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disregard small deviations from the norm , is an essential of all rational thought . The arresting of time in the arts then is not  | simply a refusal to face reality . It is the first step toward consolidating experience and making science and philosophy possible . How then is this accomplished ? First , by establishing the rules of artistry . From our vantage point of 3000 years we can see that actually there have never been any everlasting rules except those inherent in the materials which are used . We have the requisite information now to comprehend the changes which have been introduced into all the arts since their origin and to reject the notion that they have always been the same in method , in purpose , and in their effect on those to whom they have been addressed . It should be obvious that frontal Egyptian statues neither look the same as fifth-century Greek statues , that the latter do not look like Hellenistic naturalistic statues , that these do not resemble Romanesque statues , that Romanesque statues do not resemble Gothic statues , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Moore , Brancusi , and Naum Gabo . This will surely be granted . The same is true of paintings , music , and buildings , to say nothing of literature . Yet each age of which we have critical writings stated the artistic rules with precision , as if they were inviolable . Such writings are not copious for the earlier periods and sometimes we have to guess what the rules must have been from the similarity of a period 's works of art . But nevertheless in every period there has been a high enough degree of conformity to stylistic canons to warrant the conclusion that most of its artists were agreed upon their ends . Neither Aristotle nor Demetrius nor Longinus nor Pliny nor Plotinus give any hint that they were legislating merely for their own contemporaries . And , the same is true of today 's critics . Second , they fix the historical moment , intentionally or not , so that men born at a later time will interpret it as given in the arts . In this way we write the cultural history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle Ages as these various cultures appear in works of art . A book like Nilsson 's famous History of Greek Religion gets its evidence for the early period largely from the  | Homeric epics . The gods thus are what they appear to be in the Iliad and Odyssey , supplemented by the Homeric hymns . When we come to the fifth and later centuries , we find in the sculptures of Phidias , Scopas , Polycleitus , and Praxiteles , mainly as described by Pausanias ? for most of the original works have been lost ? the Greek ideals of beauty . And many an essay has been written on the Greek sense of calm , of repose , of balance , of eternalism , of the mens sana in corpore sano , and so on , based on the appearances of such works of arts Winckelmann is an amazing example of this type of writer , for he did not even seem able to distinguish between a statue of the time of Phidias and a Hellenistic work like the " Apollo Belvedere . " The legend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that they were gazing into eternity is only one of the more extravagant fantasies in this domain . Nor does it seem to have occurred to anyone before our own time that no one had ever seen any of the statues described since the days of Pausanias and that furthermore no one had ever seen even Roman copies of them in situ .4 An hour in either the archaeological museum in Athens or in the Acropolis Museum would have sufficed to convince anyone with eyes to see that all the sculpture with only one or two exceptions is mutilated . But what I am saying of Greek sculpture can be said with unimportant modifications of Romanesque , Gothic , and Renaissance sculpture : in each case we derive the rules from practice and , insofar as the practice is uniform , we find uniform rules . Third , art elevates a historical event into the realm of the timeless . Personages such as Socrates and Plato , Julius Caesar and Augustus , Alexander the Great and Antinoiis , have become types , determined by their supposed portraits .5 We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apology and Crito , though we have differing accounts of the man in two other works of art , the Memorabilia of Xenophon and the Clouds of Aristophanes , and all of the writings mentioned claim to be history . So in the early Renaissance events of the Old and New Testament history were removed from time to become inhabitants of an ideal timeless  | world : the Creation of Adam and Eve , the Temptation and Expulsion , Susanna and the Elders , the story of Tobit , the Annunciation , Visitation , Nativity , Adoration of the Magi and the Shepherds , the Baptism of Jesus , the Crucifixion , Resurrection , and so on . The way these events appeared in the paintings became the right way of presenting them . And what is the more interesting is that the Biblical texts upon which the paintings rest give but the scantiest details to guide the artist . The creation of Eve out of one of Adam 's ribs might seem to present problems to the man who would visualize the process , but we now know what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way so often . Any attempt of a sneering critic to make it seem absurd is bound to fail , for the dated and localized event has become a timeless emblem , not an illustration . Fourth , art universalizes the particular . This is analogous to making the historical timeless . Just as historians of art speak of the Philosopher-type , so we can speak of the Saint Christophertype , the Saint Sebastian-type , and the Christ-type . We know what each of these beings must have looked like for their looks have been fixed once and for all . Though the figures of Christ painted in the Renaissance and later do not resemble those in the early Byzantine mosaics , no painter would go back to the latter if asked to paint a Miracle at Cana or any of the other scenes in which Christ Himself is to appear . When Michelangelo overlooked the Second Commandment and dared to represent God Himself , he depicted Him as an old , but powerful , man with full and flowing beard , and elsewhere He even appeared crowned with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that when such books as Beverley 's History and Present State of Virginia were illustrated , the Indians were modeled after the Baroque nude . Sir Kenneth Clark incidentally , in his book on The Nude , has justified my point . The nude is an idealized version of what the naked body ought to look like . It is , so to speak , an incorporated Platonic ideal . Finally , the work of art by arresting time puts order , perceptual  | or conceptual , into experience . I imagine , though I do not know , that the conceptual order precedes the perceptual , for I fail to see how through the sense organs alone one could ever experience order . For as one 's eyes turn from point to point , one sees variety not uniformity , variety of colors , of forms , of movement , and even when a group of objects have the same color or shape , the light which plays over them modifies it in subtle but noticeable ways . One suspects that just as a child asks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , or a dog , or a horse , as if there were a standard way of doing so , so the adult first has an idea of how an object ought to look and then tries to put it down on paper . It ought to look as it does look in other men 's drawings , seen from in front with the eye immovable . But the scientist does precisely the same thing with the material of his science , for , as is well-known and inevitable , he chooses the typical to talk about , not the deviant . And furthermore he produces the typical by a skillful laboratory technique of what one might call purification . Purification is best illustrated of course in chemistry , but it occurs wherever the intellect is at work . The physicists , who used to talk about bodies moving in free space , were purifying the bodies of which they had any acquaintance of their dissimilarities in order to have a pure subject of conversation . But similarly when one reads a book in zoology or botany , one finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any individual differences which can symbolize a concept , more true of the individual things subsumed under it than of any other concept but probably not true of any one of them in isolation . If this were not done , science would be a series of portraits of individual things and events . So far it looks as if we had been talking of metaphysical constructions and indeed we have been approaching that as a limit . But actually the practice of an art is habitual for any artist and the looking at works of art is habitual for the spectator . In both cases a ritual has been developed . The artist from his training acquires a way of doing things which by definition has been repeated over and over again . If it is a question of subject matter , it will  | have become the right subject matter , and if it is merely a question of how one is to do something , the question involves the right way of doing it . But the spectator too becomes accustomed to looking for certain things in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of looking for it . The artist is dissatisfied until he has accomplished what his habitual practices demand , and similarly the spectator is dissatisfied until he finds what he is looking for . All habit becomes compulsive , even if it is nothing more than the habit of drinking coffee for breakfast instead of tea or cold milk . And the same hostility is expressed by dissatisfied breakfasters as by dissatisfied critics and artists . Something is wrong . If a critic assumes that a painting ought to be a painting of something , he will disapprove , and often violently , of paintings which are nonobjective . If he assumes that everything represented ought to be in classical perspective , he will object if the view shifts within the frame . If he assumes that there ought to be a unity of design , he will object if he fails to find it . If he assumes that every color ought to be balanced by its complementary , again he will object if he comes upon paintings in which this is not the case . Right and wrong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or with the traditions of the culture in which one is immersed . But this amounts to the same thing in the long run . One can form habits not only of seeing and hearing , but also of thinking . One thinks in terms of categories , categories of space and time , of causality , purpose , origin , material , form , to list but the most common . There is no reason , for instance , why everything should have an origin , for , as some of the Ancients saw , matter at least is never created nor destroyed . Plato 's Demiurge , for instance , found His matter at hand ; He had only to organize it . Aristotle 's entire cosmos was everlasting , without beginning or end . We have a tendency to ask what started or created or produced every type of thing . No one in his right mind would ask what was the origin of the cardinal numbers or what was the origin of gravitation . One could of course ask who first systematized arithmetic and who discovered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of question . People addicted to looking for origins and sources will tend to universalize them and even try to find one origin for everything . That this is no more than a habit of mind is amply proved by the fact that some people are not possessed by it . Such is also true of artistic practices , not one of which can be shown to be genuinely universal . We have our standards of rightness which lead us to condemn works of art and artistry which are not in accord with them . The statues of Kwannon , for instance , in the Temple of Sansusangendo with their multiple arms are monstrous to be sure if we look at them as literal representations of women . But the Goddess of Mercy is not a woman ; she is a goddess . And what would a Goddess of Mercy be if she did not have enough arms to embrace all suffering humanity ? Similarly no man was ever so perfectly built as the Hermes of Praxiteles nor any woman so magnificent as the Venus of Melos . But again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mathematical formula of what were believed to be perfect proportions , not according to the way any man or woman actually looked . We have already ? in Chapter II ? expatiated upon habit and shall here simply recall that along with the drop of the habitual into unconsciousness comes the feeling that it is innate , though we know that all habits have to be acquired . It is this which makes people think that they are inspired when writing or painting or performing music . What else could they think ? It all appears to be easy and effortless , and of course that is precisely the effect which long training is supposed to produce . The habitual becomes the instinctive , the automatic . It helps the artist appear to be untaught.6 Let us also recall that as habits are acquired they take less and less time to perform . Their time span never reaches zero , but does approach it . The importance of this is that , combined with the compulsiveness and unconsciousness of the acts in question , artistry seems like a mysterious process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time which is in the work of art is duplicated , so to speak , in the process of artistry .  | Thus a tradition is established as the process is passed on from master to pupil , or from manual to reader . There seems to be no explaining how the values involved were initiated , nor is the question frequently raised . To explain something is not to annihilate it or even to depreciate it , though all charms may fly at the mere touch of cold philosophy . Habit and ritual have a positive value which should be granted by any critic , no matter how enamored he may be of novelty and invention . For it is they which bind individuals together in society and give them a feeling of companionship . Since everyone acts in the same way , everyone feels kinship in the family of thinkers and doers . The fellowship of thought and action is something which must be valuable since so many people desire it . To be completely isolated , if that were possible , would probably be death . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there have been artists who have sought hermitages and there are no doubt degrees of sociability among artists as among other men . But since the early days of Greek philosophy , thinkers seem to have formed schools in which by definition all the members thought in the same way and agreed upon their general principles . This must be one of the reasons why learned societies exist today . One wants to associate with one 's fellow workers . I do not pretend to know why this should be so , for the annual meetings of most learned societies do not accomplish much in the way of co-operative work . Papers are read and listened to and discussed , and presumably both the readers of the papers and their audiences get some satisfaction out of the ritual . But painters and musicians and actors and architects have their societies too , not always run in the same way to be sure and sometimes very informal . Even the Impressionists met at a cafe and exhibited together , and they were the most individualistic of men . Their techniques were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seemed to agree . If the feeling of belonging to a group is important , then one can not deprecate the formation of group habits . Moreover habits stabilize social groups , from the little ones to the largest . Society  | with an initial capital has its laws and rules , some of which are obsolete and many of which are obsolescent , but all of which act as a sort of cement to bind the members together and to frustrate time . Finally habit saves thought as well as time . To save time is not always of the greatest importance and a bit more leisure would do no harm to modern urban society . But we have come to believe that saving time is important whatever we may choose to do with the time saved . To save thought may also not be so important as we tend to believe . There is no great quantity of thought needed for living . One can live from day to day by following yesterday 's pattern , and I imagine that the overwhelming majority of people do this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularity of whose life was such that the Koenigsburgers are said to have set their watches by his daily walk . Still most people have an hour for rising and one for going to bed ; have a set menu for breakfast and eat their meals at a set time ; dress in a set way when going to work and in another when dining out or going to a movie ; follow a set ceremonial pattern at worship when they are married ; use the limited vocabulary of their social set ; read the same papers and magazines ; subscribe to the same book clubs , if they read books ; and in general settle down to a well-ordered and utterly uncapricious life . All this is the negation of thinking . The philosopher may look down upon this , the critic may condemn it , the reformer may preach against it , but if any one of them thinks that the primary value of thought is pragmatic , he is mistaken . When there are real problems to be solved , thought obviously is needed . But most lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are in fact manuals on how to do anything : cooking , speaking , bringing up children , engaging in the various arts , even behaving properly in company . Once one has absorbed the lessons , one is taken care of . It is true that if one ventures far abroad from one 's neighborhood , whether geographical or mental , one may run into difficulties . But one need not be so adventurous . One can always confine oneself to the  | immediate environment , the village within the great city , seeing exactly the same people , patronizing the same shops , calling upon the same doctor and dentist , and attending the same church . Thinking is not merely useless in such a life ; it is a positive nuisance . Even when new problems do arise , intruding themselves upon one 's peace , there is always the escape through submission . No force compels a man to see an exhibition of pictures which he knows he will not like or to read a book which is , as he will say , upsetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance are close to his home and that to cross them would be sacrilege . The curiosity of the inventive thinkers has always been condemned by their fellowmen , whether in the Athens of Socrates or the New York of Cardinal Spellman . Well enough is to be let alone ; sleeping dogs are to be allowed to sleep ; such are the programs which keep the peace . And though keeping the peace may not be everyone 's ideal , it is the ideal of enough people to make the lives of intellectual warriors unpleasant . Hence , though the primary purpose of thinking is the solution of problems , one is not obligated to solve problems or even to perceive their existence . If any evidence other than one 's own experience is needed for art 's power of freezing time , one has only to think how forms become petrified and repeated even when their original purpose is forgotten . We have already illustrated this but here may add one or two more examples . In the cave temples of Ajanta Plate 1 , temples which were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rafters were carved in them and the facades were made to resemble those of a constructed building , though the former support nothing and the latter just masks a hole . The flat roofs of the Mediterranean are found in the north and the peaked roofs of the north are found in the south . Poetic meters and stanzaic models are carried over from century to century , sometimes with laughable effects , as in " I am monarch of all I survey , " an inappropriate dance rhythm if ever there was one . The five act  | tragedy and the four movement symphony , the eight bar song and the minuet , the three volume novel and the fourteen line sonnet , all are conventions whose main value is our familiarity with them . We find motifs in all the arts which have been carried along for centuries like vestigial organs and they have acquired a kind of sanctity . Sometimes the motifs were once symbolic , like the swastika or the various animal forms in Chinese decoration or the zigzags on American Indian baskets , but they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptors began to imitate pencil and pen sketches in wire and string as if the visual appearance of pen and pencil sketches were beautiful in themselves and not a by-product of the instruments used to make them . I am not condemning this , nor anything else except illogical arguments , but it is worth knowing what is going on . One is reminded sometimes of the little vegetables made in marzipan which are given to children . No one is fooled by them except the childlike.  | Art and History IN SPITE OF the fact that each work of art tries to fix a moment of time in the experience of the artist , or continues a tradition in the hope of defeating the passage of time , nevertheless no moment can be fixed permanently nor can any tradition continue without internal change . For in the first place , each work of art , if it is seen by someone , has to be interpreted . The interpreter projects into the work of art his own personal understanding , his anticipation of what ought to be in it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he will appraise it in his own terms . He does not invent these terms , to be sure , but in spite of that they have become accepted by him and integrated into his life , both emotional and intellectual . In the second place , traditions are carried along by real people and are manifested through the behavior of real people . Men contribute something to them and are not utterly passive . A set of ideas does not flow through an individual as water flows through a pipe . Even those ideas which are supposed to be the least subject to change , such as religious dogmas , regardless of what they are supposed to be , have a history which exhibits as much change as uniformity . Very little is said , for instance , about the Blessed Virgin in the New Testament . The story of the Annunciation itself occurs only in Luke ( I:26 ? 38 ) ; the Visitation in the same Gospel ( I:39 ? 56 ) only . She does not appear before the Cross in Matthew , Mark , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conception  | or the Corporeal Assumption in any of the Gospels . Yet we know how , as the centuries have passed , Mary became one of the leading figures in Catholic dogma , until at present it is a matter of faith to believe in ideas which emerged long after the apostolic period had ended . On a lowlier plane the " Apollo Belvedere " was considered the most beautiful of all works of Greek art 150 years ago by one of the most influential figures in modern criticism ; r today it is more often ridiculed than praised . Until about 1780 there was no Hamlet-problem ; 2 now everyone who writes on Shakespeare discusses it . The fortunes of both Shakespeare and Chaucer stubbornly resist all attempts to prove that great masterpieces and great writers retain an even career in criticism . Few of us have ever seen a play of the former uncut and in the eighteenth century the plays were rewritten in order to make them more palatable to the public . Though some of the dispraise of Chaucer was due to his English which some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure of Matthew Arnold , surely no insensitive critic , to refute the theory of his immortality . The marble of the " Apollo " except for its loss of color and the words of Hamlet are about as they always were ; it is our interpretation of them which has changed . But similar remarks could be made about the tradition of artistry . What is asked of a picture or piece of sculpture , of poetry or of music , is not what was asked of them a century ago . The static order , the balance and harmony , the mechanical form , which were thought of as the aim of all artists , have given way to tensions , dynamic thrusts and retractions , to something called the vital and creative . The role of the Unconscious has been given more attention than would have been possible before Freud . Whether we know precisely what these terms mean or not , it is obvious that they do not mean what their antitheses mean . No painter of the middle nineteenth century would have utilized accidental effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of children 's toys , bits of hardware , objets trouves , into a single mass and cast  | it in bronze ; no composer would have cast dice to set a pattern for his compositions ; no poet would have depended on his random associations for the emotional effect of his poems ; no novelist would have avoided the balance of good and evil characters or ? though this is less certain ? omitted comic relief in a serious novel . In fact , most novels related the triumph of good over evil : that seems to have been the novelist 's problem . I admit that my universal negative must be taken with a grain of salt , for artistry has never been absolutely uniform at any time . When I write " no , " it should be interpreted as " no one to speak of , " that is , the statistical " no . " For there are always some artists who anticipate the future . That human beings and everything that they do have a history is undeniable . History is admittedly irreversible ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animals , as far as we know , for it looks as if the ways in which the various kinds of animals live have been the same since they first appeared on earth . As we have said above , the birds ' nests , the spiders ' webs , the beehives , and the anthills are organized today as they were thousands of years ago . It is true that a bird can utilize for her nest bits of string and human hair which would not have been available if the creature did not live in the vicinity of human beings . It is also true that when an animal , like the mongoose , is introduced into a new country , it will adjust to the new environment rather than become extinct and eat foods which it might not have found in its original environment . But in 2500 years European man has changed in every respect except those rooted in his biological nature . He still produces children as his most ancient ancestors did , though once in a while a test tube may be invoked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life has been lengthened greatly , one must grant that he still dies and that his body is disposed of . He still has children and rears them , but the rearing of the modern American child is totally different in all essential details from that of a child in fifth-century Athens . He learns to read and write , but what he  | reads and writes is not only different in language , but in purpose . I do not mean by this simply that Winnie the Pooh is not the Iliad , but that the reason why a Greek boy read the Iliad is not the reason why the twentieth-century American boy reads Winnie the Pooh . The reason why my generation read the Bible was religious , not aesthetic , and so the reason why the Athenian boy read the Iliad was because it was true , not simply beautiful . He believed in the historical reality of the heroes , just as my contemporaries believed in that of the patriarchs ; moreover he believed in the reality of the gods as my contemporaries believed in the reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not have been so severe a critic of the mythographers . It is as impossible for a later generation to turn into an earlier generation as it is for an old man to turn into a child , a moth into a caterpillar , or a plant into a seed . These are merely truisms , so obvious that few people even bother to think about their significance . Not only is history irreversible , but every event in history is unique . History shows us no homogeneous classes of events . This may seem to be contradicted by wars , rebellions , assassinations , the rise of heroes , the shifts in dynasties , and all the other classes of things which are described by historians . But we have to have common nouns to name events and it would be only the most naive of historians who would say that because the American Civil War was a civil war , it was identical with the French Revolution or the War of the Roses . Moving in the direction of classifications and general principles , the historian might become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an historian is what differentiates one historical event from another of the same general type . If we read a history of the Civil War , we do not expect to find in it general principles and pseudo laws , however interesting such information might be . We should expect the firing on Fort Sumter to appear somewhere in it , the formation of the Confederacy , the various battles , the relations between the Confederacy and the Union with foreign nations , the  | economic situations of both sides , the victories and defeats , Sherman 's March to the Sea , none of which would appear , except as specimens of some class of events , if history were a compilation of what all civil wars had in common . In reality , all that they have in common is the fact that they , are internecine struggles , group against group , and not even the groups are always similar . In other words , if one is writing history , rather than social science , one directs attention to the peculiarities of the events which one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who calls himself a historian to do this , for the names of professions are largely accidental . He can do anything he likes . But that the events in history are unique can hardly be denied , whatever their similarities . But so are individual biographies . The lives of men resemble one another in certain respects and in an isolated community the resemblance may be very great . Just as twins , though biologically identical , have different experiences , so do all other men . Each of us differs from everyone else in our ability to absorb shocks , in our adventurousness , in our docility , in our interests , as well as in our genetic make-up . There is no need to deny this in order to preserve an imaginary homogeneity which might serve scientific purposes . Some people try desperately to be like others whom they admire and by whom they would like to be admired , and this must be granted . Others try desperately to be different from everybody else and this too must be granted . And since works of art are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we may as well admit at the outset that they will reflect the differences of the people who make them . It has not required the publication of this study to convince people that even when two artists try to be alike , their differences show up before the observant eye . Luini was certainly influenced by Leonardo , but anyone with any powers of discrimination can see that a Luini is not a Leonardo . Maes followed the technique of Rembrandt and it may well be that some of his paintings have been attributed to Rembrandt . But nevertheless , the resemblance  | is not so close that on the whole a Macs can not be distinguished from a painting by his master . Leonardo studied in the workshop of Verrocchio , Braque and Picasso both had a Cubist period , Seurat and Signac accepted the same methods of putting paint on canvas , Mary Cassatt was a pupil of Degas . Yet most students of art can tell who is who in this list . But this should require no demonstration when one thinks that no two people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify a friend by his voice alone even when he is speaking over the telephone . Yet one might imagine that writing and speaking would be about as homogeneous within a group as possible , for we have lessons in both as we go through school . It is true that there are such things as an English and an American accent , but that does not mean that we can not distinguish between the accents of two Englishmen or of two Americans . If what I say is plausible , then it might be expected that the focus of the critic 's attention would be the individuality of the work of art and artistry rather than their lack of it . One of the causes of cultural change is contact with other cultures . A community in a Kentucky mountain village may , as we are told , still speak seventeenth-century English , as the French Canadians have retained some of the vocabulary and pronunciation of seventeenth-century France . But one can be sure that as the mountaineers install radios and listen to them , their vocabulary and turns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been facilitated , architecture and painting and music have become more international in style than they have been since the thirteenth century . The influence of the American novel in France is not attributable to any law of aesthetic evolution ; it is attributable simply to the fact that Frenchmen are reading American novels . You can not be influenced by what you do not know , except at second or third hand , though the mere acquaintance with something new does not suffice to put you under its influence . Matisse and Picasso could not have been influenced by African sculpture if they had  | never seen any , but again they were not influenced by other things which they had seen , such as academic painting .3 Contact with different cultures then is not sufficient to cause a change , but it is a necessary cause . If Egypt was really as static and conservative in its arts as some of the books say , it was note because it lacked knowledge of other cultures . The influential cultures in all probability must have a certain prestige , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but how a culture acquires and retains prestige I do not pretend to know . It is , for instance , admitted that " action-painting " at the present time is an international style and also that it originated in the United States . One can guess why American painters took to action-painting , as American novelists took to action-writing , but one can only guess . We are not an outstandingly meditative people ; we have become more chauvinistic since World War II and more frightened of European art and civilization , and , if one may indulge in metaphysical slogans , we are more interested in doing than in being . Yet even if these conjectures are true , they do not answer the question of why the rest of the Occident and Japan among the Oriental cultures have adopted it too . There have been values associated with change which have induced people to look favorably upon the new as inherently better than that to which they have become accustomed . Along with the nostalgia for the ancient past , the Golden Age , there developed a desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what men possessed . This took several forms in antiquity . There was the cyclical theory of history according to which one might be on the upturn or the downgrade . But since Hesiod and others had maintained that the present was the worst of times , the cosmic cycle could bring about only an improvement in human affairs , a return eventually to the Golden Age . Then there was the account of man 's history as given by Lucretius , according to which man had steadily progressed toward a better civilization through the use of his intelligence , once he had accidentally discovered fire . In the third place , there was the  | Messianic dream of the early Christians , the dream of a Second Coming , which appears to have seemed close to realization in the early days of Christianity . Later it was postponed to the millennium , and after that date realization of its promise has become indefinitely postponed . In any event , the mixture of these hopes gave men as a mass something to look forward to , and in modern times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally held that history through its own momentum would bring about the betterment of life on earth . The various theories of evolution , biological , economic , sociological , intellectual , even aesthetic , joined in making the word progress , which etymologically connoted nothing good , a model of hopefulness . As the material welfare of the Americans seemed to be steadily increasing , and since in part this was due to their willingness to abandon the old and try the new , it may well be that our prestige increased because of that alone . There is and always has been misery in the United States , but the general atmosphere up to very recent times has been one of faith in the future . Our technological successes produced dramatic changes in our ways of living and only sourfaced critics despise material comfort . Moreover , one of our outstanding contributions to philosophy has been pragmatism and , in spite of what William James and John Dewey actually thought and indeed said , that set of vague ideas has been interpreted by Europe and Latin America as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that James spoke of the cash value of ideas as their truth and Dewey of thinking as problem-solving , and both phrases were said ? by others ? to indicate that one could profitably act without reflection . It is obvious that one can not build a building nor choose a college nor do anything other than routine without taking thought . The most terre-d-terre behavior , unless again it is habitual , will be random thrashing about unless it is planned . But the breezy American does not look like a planner ; he looks to the outsider like a happy-go-lucky fellow who is the darling of fortune . Some of us apparently believe this ourselves , in spite of all  | evidence to the contrary . It is perhaps the image which we should like to present to the world , what the psychologists used to call our ego-ideal . Regardless of the truth of the picture and the validity of the doctrine , it presumably has seemed to be a stage in progress toward the good . But , as we have said , there has developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of krimitivism . This point of view is chronologically earlier than its opposite . And when one looks at contemporary forms of cultural primitivism , one sees how it too harmonizes with the picture which we have of our contemporary ideals . For since the middle of the eighteenth century the Noble Savage has lost ground to the Child , the unrestrained Unconscious , the Neurotic Genius , and the Folk . Dr. Lawrence Kubie in his lectures on The Neurotic Distortion of the Creative Process has shown how some artists have believed that the cure of their neuroses would entail the loss of their artistic powers . The return to the promptings of Jung 's Collective Unconscious has been the program not only of painters but of poets as well , and this not merely in order to find significant subject matters , sexual urges , uncriticized activities , irrational and even nonsensical combinations of events , but also an appropriate technique . The drawings and paintings of children , who are supposed ? wrongly ? to be uninhibited , are regarded as works of art on a level with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more childlike than they really are . Critics have spoken of Klee and Mire ) as if they were the village innocents and have seen in their paintings the expression of the child who survives in all of us .4 Folk art also has been elevated to a position of serious consideration as if it really were the production of the collective folk and therefore better than the work of intelligent individuals . This movement as a whole is a sheaf of ideas which has emerged out of cultural primitivism , yet is presented as progress . Both sets of ideas attach to the temporal dimension a value , as if cultures could be appraised according to their date . The  | child is obviously prior to the man and for that reason alone may be thought of as superior to the man . The neurotic is the man who behaves " inappropriately , " that is in rebellion against the criteria of decency , goodness , sociability , legality , or what you will , and since these rest upon standards which are not those of the savages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be discarded and the neurotic restored to his ancient prerogatives . The folk , the peasant , like the savage , are survivors of earlier , if not primitive , times when men were fresh from the hands of the Creator , with none of the false sophistication of the urban dweller , the intellectual , the bourgeoisie , and consequently their ways of life are inherently finer than those of modern man . The tradition that the earliest period of history is the best is combined with the logically independent tradition that the best period is that which has none of the accretions of civilization and , though no one really knows what primitive man was like , we have to find a substitute for him in savages and children . Since the neurotic often acts with the irresponsibility of a child , he too becomes an exemplar of the good life . It is true that civilization does restrain the individual from carrying out all his wishes , and sometimes the restraints seem needless and perhaps even bad . But until someone can find a society which employs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest happiness , the nostalgia for a past which never existed seems a bit absurd . One can not change this by argument . It is too deeply rooted in our nature to be eradicated . It would be almost impossible to dig out the motivation of this attitude , for it is pretty well buried in the depths of the minds which preach it . It may come from a genuine disgust with the pretentiousness of oversophistication , with the wastefulness of urban living , with the love of inessentials , superfluities , and luxuries which characterize civilized people . It is such disgust which drove Walt Whitman to the animals since ,  | They do not sweat and whine about their condition ; They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins ; They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God ; Not one is dissatisfied ? not one is demented with the mania of owning things ; Not one kneels to another , nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago ; Not one is respectable or industrious over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as Occidentals are concerned , from the religious thesis that man 's happiest time on eafth was before the Fall of Adam . No one seems very sure of what the condition of Adam and Eve was and there exist conflicting views about it , 5 but no Christian Father was uncertain that man would have continued in that blessed state if only the Father of the Race had not sinned . A third source of the idea may well be simply dissatisfaction with life , the taedium vitae , and the inability to find any historical society in which it is better . The probability is that there is no rational argument which would prove that the adjectives " first " and " subsequent " imply any value whatsoever . When looked at coolly , no date connotes any superiority to any other date . But regardless of that one must admit that dates do possess an emotional coefficient , however difficult it may be to justify it . When men look back to their childhood with longing , it is surely not because they have trustworthy evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be due to a desire to escape from the responsibilities of age , to find a substitute for suicide , to retreat into the womb , or to a dozen other psychological causes . But psychological causes are not reasons . The appraisal of the remote past , whether the past of an individual or of society as a whole , may well be simple nostalgia . Anyone who can recall his homesickness when first going away to school knows perfectly well that it was a genuine psychical sickness , not an argument . One just did not like the new environment . Any new environment presents problems of adjustment and problems of any sort are troubling . The homesick boy  | may have been as unhappy at home as he is in school ; in fact his unhappiness may have been one of the reasons why he was sent away from home . But it was a familiar unhappiness . He may , furthermore , adjust to his school in a few short weeks and forget his homesickness . It is equally possible that the longing for primitive times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least in Hesiod 's case we have reason to believe that he hated his own time , just as the early Christian Fathers hated theirs . But it does not require much argument to show that hatred of one time is no proof that any other time was better . Yet whether there is any evidential value of goodness or badness in hatred of this sort , still the alternative to chronological primitivism is death or futurism . The latter , however , demands a kind of hopefulness on the part of a person , a willingness to admit that reform is possible and that all is not lost . But here too we have little to go on . Reforms have been made , it is true , and if one overlooks their subsequent deterioration , one can fight for more and more reforms . That vague period called the " future " then is envisioned as the great possibility which men have only to work for to make it actual . Thus we can argue that if men really wanted peace instead of perpetual war , they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem . The antiprimitivist is the man who too often thinks that by some historical law amelioration will arrive , progress being the magic word which will command its advent . But history seems reluctant to obey any command . This being so , dates do make a difference and one 's feelings about the distant past and future will be turned into arguments for returning to the former and pushing on toward the latter . The former , however , is an impossibility . It is a longing , Sehnsucht , which will be satisfied by reconstructing in poetry or painting the Golden Age . The magic of living in an imaginary world will be a substitute for creating one , as the relic of a saint can act as a fetish and be venerated in place of the person with whom it is associated . The future is equally imaginary and exists at  | present only as an ideal . Yet it has proved to be a greater stimulus to realization than the past could possibly be . Men are incurably optimistic ; it is their optimism which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are constantly growing better of their own accord , but in the sense that the best is attainable if only men will work doggedly for its attainment .6 This in itself does not prove that what they work for is any better than what they have ; it is , however , proof that they think it is better . To lay out a program for reform in which present evils are eliminated and no new evils introduced is the only method which we have of improving our lot , however childish though we may be in our conception of what improvement is . We can of course lie back and do nothing , like Quietists , but no Quietist could ever be an artist nor could he have any interest in the arts . For if everything is believed to be equally bad , then there is no sense in doing anything whatsoever and even the drawing of a sketch or the writing of a letter becomes a silly waste of energy . God , evolution , the laws of history , or something equally remote from human action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job to be done . Happily there are practically no limits to the human imagination . We can imagine impossibilities , such as mythological animals , centaurs , mermaids , giants , talking fish , fauns , nymphs , and tritons . We can imagine worlds in which all human desires are fulfilled and no man envious of another 's goods . We may also project such dreams into the past or future and create in our imaginations Fortunate Islands in which we are all translated heroes . There have been men who have invented countries , like Islandia , drawn their maps , written their history , described their constitutions and economy , for no other reason visible to their readers than the sheer pleasure of depicting an imaginary country . Others , like Thomas More , have done this sort of thing with a reformer 's purpose , hoping to illustrate concretely what a better world would be like . But frequently , just as a boy draws pictures of his ideal girl on his scratch pad or in the margins of his books  | or even satisfies his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utopias may be simply satisfying his dreams of a better life by constructing in fantasy a better country . This is the art of the apocalypse , the completion of the daydream . If reason disillusions us , we negate reason . Only psychiatrists could explain why this is so , what good it does to the dreamer and what interest we have in listening to his dream , but that the good and the interest exist is undeniable . If the human race did not have this temporal dimension , its works of art , like the artifacts of animals , would show no difference over the centuries . Like the spider 's web , the bird 's nest , the beehive and the anthill , painting , poetry , architecture would be today just what they were in the Neolithic Age . We would have become accustomed to living in caves and chipping arrowheads and the possibility of doing anything else would have been unheard of , not to say sacrilegious . But man does have a history and his arts have a history too . If the flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been important stimuli to action , it must have been because these periods , however imaginary their descriptions , seemed better than the present . The seeming need not have been more than seeming and may have resulted simply from the recalcitrancy which is always found in every society . The refusal to accept what one has need not be followed by the creation of a substitute ; it may be followed merely by inertia , sabotage , or grumbling , all of which are probably interconnected . But this reaction leaves no record . It is only the dreams which are recorded in literature and the other arts of which we know anything . And they show simply that dissatisfaction projects into the world of ideas at least two values , the value of primitive times , either collective or individual , and of its antithesis . This is the contribution of history to art .  | The Social Complex BOTH PRIMITIVIST and antiprimitivist tend to think of " man " and " society " as units . Man as a whole is very heterogeneous in so far as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is society . It is questionable whether primitive men were any more alike than we are , though if they wandered about in small groups , it is possible that the members of the groups were fairly similar . To be so they would have to want the same sorts of things , to satisfy their wants in the same way , always to co-operate with one another , never to be jealous and try to hurt the object of their jealousy , and to divide whatever food they had in equal portions which seemed fair to all . Such a state of affairs may have been possible but , if so , primitive men were not much like their descendants . That may indeed be the reason why some moderns are primitivists . From the point of view of physiology , it is reasonable to suppose that they showed only those deviations from the norm which are to be expected , differences in height and weight , in rapidity of action , in pulse and breathing and metabolism , in perceptual acuity , and perhaps occasional congenital malformations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to philosophers who talk about man as a unit , but they are precisely what cause disagreements and conflict among people . If two men are out hunting and one does not see the game as clearly as his fellow , does not shoot his arrows accurately because of his poor  | eyesight , has a slower rate of reacting , the two of them are not going to return in a happy frame of mind . And was it never possible that two men in the group should lust after the same woman and fight together in order to have her ? Were there no lazy members of the little bands ? Did all work at collecting food with the same zeal ? If primitive man was as homogeneous as we are sometimes led to believe , one wonders how the present heterogeneity ever arose . But society , at least in historic times , has always been composed of smaller societies , groups of men and women who work at different things , for instance . In some communities , as in the United States , we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of their own , with special privileges enjoyed by no one else in civilian life . The Catholic clergy and monastic orders are in a similar situation , insulated to a certain degree from competition with secular groups . Sometimes , as in Sparta , the division of labor was made according to race . If the Helots , as we are told , were remnants of conquered indigenous tribes , that would explain why they were separated from the upper classes to carry on the burdens of the society ? much like the pariahs in India . ' In Athens there were three classes of residents , the free Athenians , the slaves , and the Metoikoi , resident aliens . Each class had its own privileges and duties , and status was assigned according to whether one was free , slave , or alien . The Middle Ages with its feudal system needs no illustration ; we all know how rank from sovereign to serf carried special rights and even its vestiges in Great Britain induced in the mass of the people a certain respect for what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth or with ancestry or fame . This we may call the hierarchy of prestige . Even when it emerged from conditions which no longer obtain , it subsists with only minor criticism . But there is also a hierarchy of power , both that power which is recognized by law and that which is exercised without benefit of legality . We all know that powerful industrialists and labor  | leaders can get what they want simply by exercising their unlegalized , if not illegal , power . The magic word " contacts " names some mysterious force which facilitates the life of such men . The force may lie in their ability to ruin a man 's livelihood by boycotts , threats of boycott , strikes , combinations in restraint of trade , price fixing , and all the other melodramatic gestures which fill our newspapers . Many a college is frustrated by the influence of prospective donors , just as many another has found ways to lubricate the machinery of bequests and donations and grants . These lines are written at a time when industry fattens on government orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The technological skill can be found only in the universities and in a few laboratories supported by industry . The universities can not provide it from normal income . The conclusion is obvious . What has this to do with the philosophy of art ? Its main effect is to reduce the arts ? and the humanities as well ? to a position of inferiority . They are on the defensive . Instead of its being taken for granted that music , painting , poetry , and drama should be supported with all the fervor with which the sciences and engineering are supported , arguments have to be elaborated to prove that they have their place in the curriculum . A great newspaper such as the New York Times will devote a whole section of its Sunday edition to business , another to finance , a third to travel , and put all painting on part of a page . By actual count 74 columns of the Book Review section on March 12 , 1961 were given to book reviews , illustrations , letters from readers , and requests for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when one thinks of how the editor of a more venal paper would choose the books to be reviewed , one requires little more to demonstrate the influence of power on art . If an exhibition of painting is not so much news as a murder or a divorce , one can scarcely expect that all classes of society will be informed about the exhibition . In this way a start is made toward stratifying a society , assuming that it was unstratified to begin with . The truth is that it was stratified all along and that the editors of  | the various papers and magazines recognize the stratification and have to decide to which stratum they will address themselves . But it would be as false to think of that stratum as representative of the whole society as it would be to select the most backward or the most advanced as typical . Even if society is stratified according to the division of labor , each class will have its own interests , not only economic but also aesthetic . For the arts often idealize the interests of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereigns and members of the royal family , of warriors , of influential social leaders were not made in the same way as those of peasants . Most painters , with the startling exception of Louis Le Nain Plate 2 , portrayed peasants as comic figures , drinking and dancing , or as they were portrayed in the plays of Shakespeare . Or else , as in the paintings of Breughel the Elder , they might be represented as heavy bumbling louts . It took men like Daumier and Millet and Courbet to give us a peasant class which was serious , pathetic , or even noble . Whether this was attributable to the rise of socialism or not , I do not pretend to know , though in Courbet 's case it may well have been ? In our own time painting and literature , if not the other arts , are clearly oriented toward satisfying the interests of the various social classes and not one only . We recognize folk art , as we falsely call it , the art of the great masses in the covers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich bourgeoisie in fashionable portraiture and the slick magazines , and the art of the intellectuals in the paintings and sculpture of the avant-garde . It would be folly to assume that the paintings of Mondriaan , for instance , or Kline or Rothko say much either to the main body of troops or the rear guard . Where there is no subject matter , there is little if anything for the great mass of people to grasp in a painting . This may be denied or condemned as snobbishness , but nevertheless one has only to go to a museum and listen to the comments of the visitors to realize its truth . One has only to go to a concert , moreover , to see that the thundering applause is given to Tchaikovsky , not to Bartok or Schonberg ,  | not to speak of more recent contemporaries . As the government of the Soviet Union was reported as saying in regard to some symphony or other of Shostakovich , " The People should be able to whistle the music which it hears . " Whether the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to atonal music is hard and the whistlers have not yet become sufficiently accustomed to it to whistle it . But Tchaikovsky himself when alive received all the abuse which Schonberg and Hindemith and Bartok received two generations later.3 The violence of such abuse is perhaps proof enough that the works of art in question have a deep emotional effect . One does not have a tantrum before something which leaves one cold . That there is a conflict of interest among the various social classes then can be easily proved . The conflict does not of course pertain to all interests , nor am I saying that it does . The laborer and the peasant may join with the banker and industrialist in worshiping God , or in national defense , or for that matter in politics . The rich gave as high a percentage of their sons to the Army and Navy as the poor did , even if the superior educational opportunities which are open to the rich placed their sons in positions demanding more intelligence . Where there is no evidence that one 's economic position can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many museums open to the public , it is to be expected that the peasant 's or laborer 's son will see as great paintings and sculptures as the millionaire 's , though he will not be able to buy them . It is perhaps likely , though by no means certain , that as far as economic and religious interests are involved , members of a given class will stick together , but that does not imply that all laborers go to the same church , like the same music , play the same games , wear the same clothes , eat the same food , speak the same language , read the same books . The contrary of this is plainly demonstrated every day . But the same is as true of individuals as of classes . The fact that I prefer Bach to Gershwin does not commit me to preferring Rousseau to Camus or Frederick the Great to F. D. Roosevelt . We have  | mentioned this type of difference within the individual before and I shall not labor the point . It is , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great a tendency to think of individuals as well as of social classes as homogeneous . Since certain social classes , the agricultural , the military , and the ecclesiastical , for instance , have a longer history than some of the others , they will acquire greater prestige . One of the constant criticisms of Courbet 's " Stone Crushers " was that it was socialistic propaganda . If he had painted two peasants somewhat in the manner of Leopold Robert , his picture would have been praised as an idyll . Some of the distaste for Courbet , if not all , was the feeling that he was rubbing salt into the wounds of the bourgeoisie . These wounds were of course self-inflicted ; they were feelings of guilt . If a painter of today were to paint pictures of an auto-da-fe , he would be treated in much the same manner in a Catholic country . Why dig up unpleasantness ? Why always show the seamy side of history ? Why ca n't we all be friends ? 4 People have never been friends on a grand scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love is selective . If people have not always been friends , maybe there is something about human nature which stands in the way . That something may be the ineradicable difference between people , a difference which runs from their anatomical structure to their likes and dislikes . Not enough is known of human nature to permit one to explain such differences . They may reside ultimately in physiology , for all one knows , but it is safe to temper that judgment with some thought of educational and other environmental influences . Until we know why there are differences of taste in erotic matters , which one would assume to be all equally appealing , we had best suspend decision about such differences in aesthetic matters . Gentlemen may prefer blondes , but surely some men , and some gentlemen too , must prefer brunettes , or else whole nations would have died out by now . Not only does one admire a social class because of its historical antiquity , but also because of its necessity for society 's survival .  | Since the Industrial Revolution we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reliance of one class upon the others , as normal . We are more aware than our great-grandparents were of the contributions of all classes to civilization . This occurred earlier in the United States than in Europe , for we had no tradition of a leisure class . But by now the sentiment seems to be fairly general that everyone works and should work . The privilege of enjoying the arts is no longer reserved for a select few , and it is customary for municipalities to take the place of patrons , much as the national government does in France . The threat of " leveling " which used to be predicted as inevitable has turned out to be unrealized and no one could honestly say that the municipal art museums in the United States show a lower grade of paintings and other objects of art than were formerly shown in the collections of the eighteenth-century virtuosi ; that the symphony orchestras play worse programs than were formerly played in the nineteenth century or at the royal opera houses ; or that even the radio always plays trash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the times and , should there be a reversion to " story-paintings , " to program music , to highly decorated architecture , the abstractions which have crowded out the story-pictures would be put in the vaults and the Geromes and Alma-Tademas and Landseers would emerge from darkness into the light of day . There are already murmurings against action-painting and abstractions emanating even from the intellectuals . And no one would be rash enough to say that our interest in the Baroque and Rococo is attributable solely to their sensory beauty . After a period of functionalism in architecture , we begin to find the leaders of taste turning to Gaudi . Even the Museum of Modern Art found some interest in Art Nouveau . Fantasy is staging a comeback in almost every field , including that most stodgy of fields , men 's clothing . How far this may go only a prophet could tell . But one thing seems very plausible : that , having recognized the necessity of work , we also recognize that of play . Now that all of us have more leisure than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we also want the amusements of the leisure class . In the long run those amusements come from fantasy . We have probably had enough of reason , of hard common sense , of the useful . What is the antecedent of " we " ? It can only be all of us , if we are to talk sense , and all of us who live in the twentieth century are just as complex as society is . We are each , to cite Royce again , a sheaf of purposes which we hope to make harmonious . We know now that we too exist in strata , that our consciousness is an affair of layers . Psychoanalysis has shown us that much of our past has been suppressed and suppressed because we do not want to remember it . If we wish to suppress something , it must be because it would conflict with what we want to keep in the foreground of consciousness . This is not the place , nor have I the competence , to discuss the reasons for suppression , but one can accept a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence whether we suppress experiences because they conflict with our ego-ideal , because they are censured by society , because we want to punish ourselves , or for some other reason , we do know that some things are suppressed . And being suppressed , they lie hidden and act as a brake upon the realization of some of our desires . The most obvious of these are sexual , sexual in the literal sense of that word , but we also suppress at times our sense of humor , our desire for self-aggrandizement , our desire for telling the bitter truth . Since almost all of our desires require other people for their satisfaction , it is probably always the other people , more or less consolidated in social groups , who lead to suppression . It seems likely that every man is an anarchist at heart , seeing no reason why each and every wish should not be gratified , but only subterfuge will permit him to live as an anarchist . Suppression , however , is not the only source of complexity . Individuals may and usually do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular for twenty-four hours a day . If he were , he would be a broken-down neurotic , if not worse . The  | businessman has a hobby ; reads books , listens to music , and perhaps even plays an instrument ; goes to church and perhaps holds a place in the vestry ; belongs to associations of various sorts which are not directly connected with his business ; and , though he may assign different hours of the day and different days of the week to the satisfaction of these interests , that does not imply that they are not in possible conflict with one another . Setting up a calender is a modus vivendi , a way of letting various interests be gratified , not of eliminating their variety . But a man can not act as if he were compartmented , or as if his interests were entirely separate things which could be let out of their cages for a run now and then . Their association with one another is bound to count for something . A banker who is also a mycologist , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a collector of contemporary paintings , these are not simple homogeneous people . And in modern urban society the possibility of having various interests and also of satisfying them is very great . One can not , moreover , do two things at the same time and there is always the possibility that when one is doing one of them , the others will interfere . We are warned from childhood that we must make the great decision of what we want to be , as if one could be only one thing . But those of us who have had military experience have learned how to turn off one self and turn on another as occasion demands . This , I admit , is an extreme case and would not exist if military service were not compulsory . But after all we have the careers of Ives , the composer , Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams , the poets , to show that diversity of talents did not disappear with the Italian Renaissance . The demand for harmony of purpose is , it goes without saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize ourselves , that choice is rejection , that character is uniformity of behavior , that we must hitch our wagon to a star and at the same time keep our feet on the ground . But such lessons would not be preached if we carried out their precepts normally . The point is that we are not uniform and that we do try to move in several  | directions at the same time , that we are not organized . We look back to Leonardo da Vinci as if his width of interest were something abnormal , whereas it was really his ability to satisfy so many of them successfully which was abnormal . It is probably true that a man like Michelangelo who could practice architecture , paint enormous frescoes , carve marble , write sonnets , and even design uniforms , is not someone whom one meets every day . But that may be simply that the possession of manifold interests was less frowned upon in the sixteenth century than it is now . Such a man today would not be thought of as serious . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why the idea developed that an individual must have a consistent character , which in the long run leads to a regrettable narrowmindedness , I do not know , but I suspect that it is not unconnected with the belief in individual conscience . For if the most important thing in life is one 's relation to God and if that relation is direct and not mediated by a church or a clergy , a heavy burden is put upon the individual soul to discover just what the relationship consists in , how it is to be exteriorized , and what is to be sacrificed to its exteriorization . There is literally , not figuratively , nothing to guide one to the proper path . Hence what is called harmony of interests frequently amounts to nothing more than repression of interests . We know how the Puritans scorned many of the arts and we know that one of the reasons was their power to distract the mind from the all-important religious goal . For the same reason one was taught to look down upon the satisfaction of our sexuality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty . This asceticism resembled Greek cynicism with the difference that God was substituted for Nature . When men decide to conform to socially imposed standards , and indeed it would be hard to find any others , then clearly all individuality tends to atrophy . People are always torn between their desire for self-assertion and for self-discipline . In most societies self-discipline wins out . For a social group by its very nature holds together by the willingness of its members to conform . One  | can not reject everything , for by the time that one is aware of the problem , one 's mind has already been formed by others and oriented in a given direction . One has at least a language which will in part determine how one will think . One has been punished for disobeying the social code and no one likes punishment unless unusually masochistic . I am not minimizing the pleasure which we take in self-mortification , the love of martyrdom , and it is always possible that some good comes of it . But again one does not annihilate that self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always there in the shadows ready to pop out of them if only in disguise . In spite of all the laws and regulations , both secular and religious , both terrestrial and celestial , no one can deny that we still have malefactors . The jails are not empty . And though it is always more peaceful to follow the law in civil life , in business , in religion , and in art , where one knows the law , it is not only the criminal who is recalcitrant . But what self is the rebellious person expressing ? Is he expressing his religious self , his political self , his ethical self , his erotic self , his ethnological self , or what ? The psychomachy is not always a duel . It sometimes resembles a rough and tumble fight within a gang of hostile forces . And it is only by specious generalization and abstraction that they can be lined up as the forces of good and of evil . The conscientious objector illustrates this . We may assume , for the sake of argument , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . He therefore must infer that he should not join the Army even though he will violate the law . In doing so he will run into the objections of his social group , and he will normally want the respect of its members . His parents believe that one should obey the law whether one approves of it or not , for disobedience of the law leads to anarchy . He is also in love and had thought of marrying . Even if his beloved is willing to marry him , he has to think first of whether his wife would be done an injustice by marrying a man who will be put in prison , and second whether he will seem to be avoiding conscription by confronting the Draft Board with the problem of drafting a man  | with a dependent . He is , moreover , not at all sure of the grounds on which his conscientious objections are based . Does he really believe that life should never be taken or is he simply too cowardly to face the prospect of battle ? He has read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make one 's acts more agreeable . In short , he is in a turmoil of emotion and reason and , as he will say , he just does n't know what he should do . If the principle of the sanctity of life is an expression of " the good , " then every temptation to throw in his lot with the Army is evil . If , on the contrary , obedience to the law is always right , then he should answer the call to military service . Can he do that and also marry ? If he marries before being drafted , he may be evading the law . If he is drafted and then marries , he is doing an injustice to his wife . The debate will be interminable . For when there are more than two adversaries , there is no either-or . The diversities within the individual may seem to be exaggerated by me , for after all they are all enclosed , as it were , within the one body . But unfortunately for the lover of unity , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as within its psychical make-up . The studies of Professor Roger J. Williams show such an extraordinary range of differences in such features as anatomy , chemical composition , enzymic patterns , endocrine activities , and so on that one wonders why anyone should have thought that all human beings could be put in the same class.5 If such things have a significant influence on a man 's likes and dislikes , his artistic ability , his sexual pattern , his aggressiveness and docility , and it is obvious that they do , then individual differences are not merely curiosities of nature , like two-headed calves and three-footed geese . The very concept of normality requires reconsideration , for we have in the past spoken of the arithmetical mean or the statistical mode as the normal , as if anyone with a little good will could approach it as closely as society demands . We have also talked as if this were desirable . It would be desirable , to be sure , if our goal were unanimity and conformity , but it would also be desirable that everybody speak a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we all understand , are hardly the same thing and a philosophy of art , like a philosophy of morals , would do better first to plot the possible and only afterward the desirable . It is all very well to identify normality with social adjustment , but to what social group should one adjust ? The grosser crimes and misdemeanors rarely present any temptation to the general run of mankind . Few of us feel the need of murdering , stealing , and bearing false witness . Even these require at times neater definitions than the mere labels provide . A person who would not dream of entering a house and stealing will not find it hard to evade the customs when re-entering the country , mainly perhaps because his group does not look down upon that sort of theft . Petty thefts are committed every day by the most respectable citizens : students and professors stealing books from college libraries and stationery from hotels , souvenirs , as they will be called , and should anyone reprove them for this , the reproof will be laughed off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such infractions of the law in a country where oaths taken before God in His temples are violated daily and then solemnly repeated after six weeks residence in Nevada . There is then the likelihood that both self-assertion and selfdenial are deeply rooted characters which can never be extirpated . They can be concealed and disguised and permitted to express themselves in socially approved ways . Decency of speech , for instance , may be a standard for the drawing room and not for the smoking car or men 's gymnasium . Conjugal fidelity may be exacted of women but not of men . Observance of oaths may be insisted upon in trials but not in christening ceremonies . In time of war men will be ordered to slaughter other men , whereas in times of peace they will be punished for doing so . The state is permitted by law and custom to do what no subject nor citizen can lawfully do . The standards involved in all this have a history , though its earlier stages are lost , and the standards also vary from region to region . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are imposed upon the individual by society or by social groups and are  | not invented by any individual . We all , I suspect , fundamentally believe that the satisfaction of our personal desires is self-justified . When one is hungry , one wants to eat ? for that is what hunger is on the psychical side ? and when one wants to eat , one sees no reason why one should not be fed . We learn from Paul Radin 6 that in primitive societies " the idea of withholding food from anyone for any reason whatsoever , no matter what the status of the individual , what crime against the community he may have committed or how unwilling to work he may be , is . . . simply unthinkable . It would be tantamount to denying his existence . " Some of us would take the point of view that he who wo n't work wo n't eat , though we do feed our criminals in jail and before those sentenced to capital punishment are executed , we feed them whatever meal they request . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , if someone does , his objections are not heard . But hunger is only one of the impulses to action which we control through social sanctions . No baby has any innate desire to keep quiet when he is in pain , to control the elimination of urine and feces , to sleep at night and be awake in the daytime . It is almost foolish to point this out . We all know perfectly well that we are trained to conform to the standards of others from infancy on , for the only standard which is inborn in us is to do what we want to do when we want to do it . Nothing is gained by overlooking this . To recognize it is not to deny the importance of education or , if one prefer , conformity to social standards . Societies differ in what they will permit all their members to do , in what they will permit various age groups to do , and in what they will permit the two sexes to do , and they consequently differ in what they forbid as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aims of all human beings even within a single social group , for if recalcitrancy and submission are always likely to be present and to manifest themselves , one can talk about the ideals of an individual but not of a single ideal for all . ' Where there seems to be a single ideal , one has substituted custom or statute for individual purposes . But there would be no need for laws and rules if everyone wanted the  | same sort of thing and would co-operate in its attainment . There would be a coincidence of law and behavior . In art schools this is almost realized , though even here the contribution of individual temperament , of personality and character is not to be discounted . The role played by ideals in behavior is undeniably of the greatest importance , for no one in all probability is so mercurial , and so lucky , that he can satisfy all his wishes as they arise . We set up ideals for ourselves and we also accept some which are given to us by tradition and reading and schooling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break away from the rest of society to " live their own lives , " they set up customs at once which they expect the whole group to observe . They must be unconventional in the same way , if it is only the way of growing untidy beards , wearing blue jeans , and hanging a defiant medal round their necks . But how could it be otherwise , if they are objecting to the same conventions ? If one disapproves of monogamy , one has to be polygamous . If one disapproves of sobriety , one has to be intemperate . If one disapproves of traditional syntax , one can only be ungrammatical . The choices open to defiance are strictly limited by what one is defying . And thus rebellion is often enslavement to another set of rules . A nonfigurative painter has to eliminate from his paintings any resemblance to recognizable objects . And if one wishes to write nonsense , one must beware of sense . This was amusingly illustrated by that form of art known in Surrealist circles as the " Exquisite Corpse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group was set to work on a single work of art , each contributing his share in ignorance of what the others had done . Thus there could be no logical link between the parts and reason was defeated .  | Ideals and Values IDEALS THEN ACT as guides to behavior . They are whatever goals a man is trying to reach . We need not discuss their status , whether they are Platonic ideas residing in a world of their own , whether they are purely material twitchings and strainings , whether they come from a divine or terrestrial source , or any other questions of that sort . We are simply stating the fact that men sometimes act in order to reach some end which they think , regardless of what others may think , is worth reaching . A value is not merely the satisfaction of an interest , but the apparent realization of an ideal . I say " apparent " deliberately , for nothing is more common than to be disillusioned when one has reached the goal for which one has been striving . There may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all occasions , whose program of life consists in living from moment to moment . These individuals may indeed be the happiest of mortals since they never entertain the possibility of possessing anything other than what they have . If plants and animals are lacking in selfconsciousness , they would be exemplars of such happiness . But they do not seem to be typical of human beings . For , as we have pointed out above , they have no history , but once established in a mode of life , they persistently cling to it . But surely no one will deny that human beings are distinguished from other animate creatures by their ability to form plans for the future which will  | be different from their traditional ways of living . It is such plans which I am calling ideals . One thing is certain . An ideal in the context of this study must be present to consciousness . I am not speaking of patterns of behavior embedded in habit which might be said to operate as ideals . One can speak figuratively of a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is an ideal which s always realized and therefore can not serve as a guide to action . It may well have begun as a plan laid out ahead of time to guide one 's action , as a protocol or aide-memoire , but as it sinks into habit and becomes compulsive and unconscious , it is no longer an ideal in the same sense as a newly formed plan is . There is no doubt an instrumental value in such patterns of behavior , but they are no better than the patterns of involuntary acts , such as digestion , pulse , and breathing , which one performs because they are an integral part and necessary condition of living . What I am referring to is plans which need not be carried out but which one would like to carry out for some reason or other . The so-called " ego-ideal " of psychiatry may never be fulfilled and usually is not fulfilled . But though each man 's plan may differ from every other man 's , all men will probably have one or several in succession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman or an astronaut may very well turn into the most prosaic of mortals , and his childhood ideals may linger on in his memory to be laughed at later or to be regretted . Regardless of the importance to society in general of such ideals , they have their importance to the person who forms them and one has the impression , when they are being entertained , that their realization would be happiness . This may well explain why an artist is so often disappointed at the outcome of his work . Just as the perfect circle is never found on paper , so the perfect picture or story or poem or sonata is never found on canvas or in sounds or words . It is a platitude that one 's intentions are never satisfactorily realized . Carrying them out may be an intense pleasure , but once finis is written , the brushes are cleaned and dried , the last note has died away , one sees that the  | result was not exactly what one had planned . The same is true of the one art which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning clear seems to be an impossibility and nothing is more ironical than a conversation between philosophers trying to convey to one another what they have on their minds . The Platonic dialogues seldom come to any conclusion and that may have been what Plato was trying to demonstrate . This makes one think that the German Romantics were right when they said that striving was more important than attainment , though there is an element of sour grapes in the saying . It is doubtful whether anyone would strive for anything if he was convinced that he would always fail to reach his goal . But no one actually is convinced of this . The next time or the time after the next will see success . The moment when the artist accepts the inevitability of failure is the moment when he breathes his last as an artist . We have given two examples of the use of ideals in art , primitivism vs. anti-primitivism , individualism vs. traditionalism . ' When primitivism is drummed into people , they will preach a return to primitive life , as they conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sect , they will strive to realize in their art the qualities of the primitive . Individualism , as I am using the term , idealizes the differences of each man and preaches both the right and the duty to express his own personality . The traditionalist , on the contrary , argues that every man , whether he likes it or not , belongs to a tradition and that whatever he does in the way of artistry is influenced by a tradition . Consequently he for his part preaches fidelity to the tradition and the artist 's need to " belong " to something greater than himself . The facts in both cases are correctly stated . Every man is an individual , more or less integrated , and , as we have insisted , genetically , anatomically as well as mentally , no two men are exactly alike . But also no man is entirely cut off from his ancestors genetically ? for from whom did he get his genes ? ? and resembles all other men to some degree and has been educated by others whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideal .  | They turn into an ideal when a person maintains that he ought to be as centrifugal as possible , emphasize his differences , be himself rather than a copy or reflection of his fellows , or on the contrary that he ought to be aware of his origins , both biological and cultural , and devote his art to perpetuating them . We know that we are both tied to the past and different from it ; that , though we speak our mother tongue , it changes as the years go on ; that our environment itself changes while still retaining much that has already existed ; and that both rebellion and submission vary from man to man . How far a man can change his congenital equipment is an unsolved problem , for we simply do not know how closely we are bound to our native endowment nor to what extent the education which we receive can change it . The wisest course to follow is to recognize the inevitability of both tendencies and the variation in men 's ability to resist them . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tradition and innovation , as we have pointed out above . Neither can be imposed on all men , for even when the state with all its power tries to force artists to conform to an official pattern , it fails . But regardless of that , a submissive artist , when he expresses his submission in his art , will give traditionalism as the reason for what he produces . And similarly the critic who admires traditionalism , will praise it when he sees it appearing in artistic form . Likewise those of us who are individualists , will look for originality in works of art and praise it when we find it and , if we are artists , we shall write manifestoes saying that we want to be original and not " slavish copyists . " But such reasons are not in any sense of the word an explanation of the psychological ? or other ? causes at work . At best they are rationalizations . The distinction between reasons and causes is important . In the nature of things we can not be aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the level of consciousness and others of which can not rise to consciousness . We may be aware of the psychological fact that we are hungry , but few men are so skilled in physiology that they know why the feeling of hun-  | ger arises when the walls of the stomach contract . We know when we are sexually stimulated , when we are angry , when we are restless or bored or hopeful or despondent , but none of us , unless we are trained endocrinologists or psychologists or specialists of some other sort in the causes of feelings , have the slightest conception of the mechanism by which such feelings are aroused . It is true , for instance , that any unfamiliar experience is likely to be unpleasant , but its unpleasantness will vary from man to man . Yet it is probable that no man will say that the reason why he dislikes a dish or a foreigner or atonal music is because he has never run into them before . On the contrary , he will say that bird 's nest soup is disgusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he is a trifle more sophisticated , he will say that the ingredients of bird 's nest soup are unwholesome , that a man ought to stick to his own people , and that the diatonic scale is rooted in the natural series of overtones and therefore the only correct basis for musical composition . But the feeling of unpleasantness is prior to all this rationalization ; it is the datum which the rationalization attempts to justify . To substitute the reasons for the causes would be like arguing that the Law of Gravitation is the cause of the planetary motions or that the change in the color of a piece of litmus paper is the cause of acidity or alkalinity . This is not to say that we can not act from reasons in the sense that we can not modify our reactions by our awareness that certain principles are or are not being exemplified in a picture , poem , or piece of music . But just as in morals , we may see the better and do the worse , and also refrain from doing the worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see something attractive and disapprove of it or be repelled by something and yet learn to understand it . ' One may of course understand why a work of art was made as it is and yet not like it , but at least one 's annoyance is sometimes mitigated by understanding . To become aware that we are liking something of which we ought to disapprove is familiar enough in the field of ethics and is in fact one of the basic moral problems . We strive to harmonize  | what we want to do and what we ought to do . But the desire is rooted in us and the principle which we hope to harmonize with it is given to us by others . This need not make it the less powerful as a corrective to our behavior , though just how an acquired principle corrects our behavior is somewhat mysterious . In part , I suppose , we accept the principle and follow it because we have been punished as children for refusing it . We are punished for incorrect speech and manners and acts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to conform . It is true that conformity is easier for some individuals than it is for others , but it is doubtful whether anyone is congenitally adapted to accepting all the rules which have been elaborated over the centuries . If such a person exists or has existed , he would have no will of his own beyond the will to do whatever he is told . Most of us have to grow into such docility or be beaten into it or gently persuaded into it . For even the traditional version of the Lord 's Prayer , whether textually correct or not , includes a plea that we be not led into temptation . If most of us were not prone to yield to temptation , it would be inexplicable that such a plea would have been included in the prayer . But this is not peculiar to morals , unless consideration for the feelings of others , social amenities , and good taste in art are part of morals . In school we are usually told to read books which at first sight are boring . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Burke 's speech on Conciliation , to name three classics which were inflicted on the boys of my generation , are needlessly tiresome . It is probably true that Caesar is a good start if one is to learn how to read Latin , just as Czerny 's Fingerfertigkeit is a good start toward learning to play the piano . But most of us , even if we can be convinced of the necessity of such exercises , find them no more interesting than other painful duties . They are among the tiresome things which adults put upon us , we know not why . But visits to art galleries filled with Italian primitives , pictures of the same old martyrdoms and crucifixions , awkwardly drawn in spite of their piety , endless rows of Roman sculptures , all stiff and pompous ,  | cases filled with Greek vases of a few traditional shapes and ugly color , this may indeed be an impetus to a love of art , but it takes on aesthetic interest only after a few sermons on why it has aesthetic interest . If my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gallery tour and listen to what the docents tell the youngsters . They may of course arouse an intellectual interest in the works of art on which they are lecturing , and they probably do , but one seldom sees a spontaneous interest expressed by any of the pupils . They will build up an interest after such tours and that can not be denied , but here the aesthetic feeling is posterior to the conviction that one ought to experience it . The lecture confers an aesthetic ideal upon the listeners , awakens interest , and may suggest understanding . In short the pupil acquires reasons for approving of the works of art and the hope is that his approbation may lead to liking . Such ideals have to do with artistry , the way in which the artist has constructed his work of art . They may have to do with the subject matter , with the life of the artist , his reasons for making that particular work of art , with the historical setting in which the work of art was made , with the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the work of art is located . But such details are selected out of a score or more of possible subjects of conversation . One hears gallery talks in which design alone is emphasized , pyramidal composition , balance and rhythm of masses and lines , color harmonies and contrasts , tensions , thrusts , unity and variety . But one hears others in which supposed psychological facts are brought out , the artist 's feelings , aspirations , repressions , thoughts , all expressed , it would seem , in his work of art . Each side of the complex datum , the work of art , is accentuated , as if it were the unique and proper focus of attention . Yet all these sides are there and there is no dogma which can tell us which is the most significant . If one takes pictures alone as fair samples of all works of art , it is obvious that there are at least nine different aspects which may be talked about . Most pictures up to recent times represented  | actual physical objects which have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter " means at least two things , as it has been used . It may mean first , the physical objects themselves or second , that for which they stand . For instance , in a Crucifixion one will see the body of a man hanging on a cross , usually , though not always by any means , with three women at the foot of the instrument of torture . If the subject matter is just a crucified man and three women , then the critic will probably talk about how the four people are drawn and grouped . But if he is thinking of the subject matter as the Crucifixion , then he will talk about the artist 's conception of that historical event . In early Crucifixions , the eyes of Christ were open and the head was not hanging on one side . For , it is said , the early Christians could not accept the idea that God , whether incarnate or not , had really died .2 ( I take no responsibility for this explanation . ) Again , few paintings have been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are usually represented a woman , Mary , and a young angel , Gabriel , though the famous " Annunciation " of Antonello da Messina has no angel in it . But Annunciations also frequently have other figures present and the Virgin is now represented as a royal personage , now as a peasant . If the subject matter is simply the human and superhuman figures , then what the critic will emphasize is not the meaning of the scene . But if it is the event itself , then every artist will have his own interpretation of it , an interpretation which the critic will elicit from the pose of the figures , the costumes , the setting , the attendant figures , and so on . But no paintings , except certain still lifes , are merely subject matter . Third , the artist is supposed to have " something to say . " That this is possible is proved by caricatures and portraits , where the facial expressions and bodily stance of the sitters carry the message of the artist . If we call this message the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be doing an injustice to his art . If Christ is represented on the Cross with His eyes open , it might well mean that the self-sacrifice was deliberate , which of course dogma says it was . It might simply be an affirmation of the  | belief that the Redeemer was both alive in His godlike nature and dead in His human nature . The number of things which it might mean is undoubtedly very great ? how great we do not pretend to know ? and the artist himself might not be too clear in his mind about which of them he was expressing . If Giovanni di Paolo puts an Expulsion from Eden in the background of an Annunciation , it may be because he thought that just as the Expulsion was the penalty for the original sin of mankind , so the Annunciation was compensation for it . How clearly he realized this , no one could say , but that it is suggested to the modern spectator of the picture is undeniable . The only danger into which the critic runs when he makes this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that of the painter . He has no right to say that what he reads out of a work of art is what the artist intended to put into it . The artist may simply have been following orders and the elements in his picture may have been dictated to him by the man or group who commissioned it . We know that many details in a painting are symbolic , fourth , both in the sense of being unconsciously revealed symbols of the artist 's suppressions and fifth , in the sense of being part of the traditional vocabulary . The gods of antiquity with their attributes , the saints of Christianity with theirs , are in essence no different from pictographs . They are symbols which require interpretation , though it goes without saying that we make our interpretations of them so rapidly that we are unaware of the process . To read a word is to interpret a visual symbol , to translate it into its intellectual meaning . Similarly when we see a picture of an old man in ancient clothing holding two large keys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter . In the same way when one sees a little naked boy with a bow and arrows , one knows at once that he stands for Cupid . Such symbols have been accepted over the years and no questions about their meaning ever arise in the minds of Occidentals . They form a sort of sign-language , like the arrows which indicate directions , the red and green lights which signal to us to stop or go . But such symbols also vary in their in-  | telligibility . The meaning of some has been lost and the whole field of iconology has been developed to discover what it may have been . The earlier representations of Cupid , for instance , were very different from those which we today think of as normal . He began by being a young man , old enough by the end of the classical period to fall in love himself and marry Psyche . But such a Cupid nowadays would have to be labeled , as the figures on Greek vases were so often labeled . Unconscious symbols are more difficult to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was assumed that there was a lexicon in which the meanings of all the symbols of dream and fantasy could be looked up . Its place now seems to have been taken by Jung 's archetypes .3 Freud himself recognized that each unconscious symbol must be interpreted in terms of the symbolist 's own life and indeed when one thinks of what people have read out of music or painting or poetry or any other work of art , one realizes how the meanings are in part ? though by no means entirely ? contributed by the spectator or auditor . But that is true even of words , for a large part of communication is devoted to clarifying what one is saying . I realize that this is no problem when day-by-day topics are being discussed , but as soon as one ventures an opinion of a critical nature , one finds that one is in great danger of being misunderstood . Since critics habitually think it their duty to say whether they like or dislike , approve or disapprove of the work of art about which they are talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various meanings which even ordinary terms of praise and blame have taken on . Nor would they be called upon to express their feelings about such matters if they had no reason to believe that other people did not share them . T. S. Eliot in his early essays spent most of his time showing his readers that the works of art which were traditionally praised did not deserve the praise which they had received . Later he wrote essays to show that some of the works of art which had not been praised should have been . This was the more amusing in his case since he believed in the value of tradition . Why then  | break a tradition or reorient it ? The answer would be found , I suppose , by first deciding whether one was appealing to critical tradition or to artistic tradition . In his early essay on Hamlet he attacked critical tradition which had thought of that play as one of its author 's undoubted masterpieces . But in his lectures on The Use and Misuse of Poetry he seemed , whatever the reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If critics over the years have agreed that a given work of art is great , one would feel humiliated to believe it little . On the other hand , it can be shown that even when critics have been agreed on the greatness of a given work of art , it is not always for the same reasons . To value highly the Aeneid because of its epic grandeur is not the same as valuing it highly because of its magical powers , as in the sortes Vergilianae . The symbols involved in a poem often change their value as well as their meaning , and it is doubtful whether any schoolboy working his way through the Aeneid can read it as a Roman would have read it . To a Roman it was history as well as poetry . We simply can not take it as such . But I have digressed from the topic of unconscious symbolism . Whether one accepts Jung 's archetypes or not , one is forced to admit that to some minds a given symbol will have an emotional coefficient which may vary from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike , and some are repelled by , snakes , toads , and other reptiles and amphibians . A great many others like and are attracted by birds , flowers , and trees . It would be ridiculous to try to prove the obvious and I shall not attempt to do so . We all know this and we also know that when someone likes what we dislike , we wonder how it is possible . If the emotional coefficient of all symbols were pervasive of the human race , disagreement on such matters would be as impossible as it is for human beings to live on raw grass or to breathe under water . There would then be general , in fact universal , agreement in matters of taste . But this clearly is not the case . Just as taste varies in so important a sphere as sexual attraction , so does it in what looks like less important fields . We are told that we can be educated  | into changing our taste and that may be true . But why we should submit to such a modification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to uniformity of opinion which some hold as a great ideal . But we should first try to find out why opinion is not and never has been uniform . The interpretation of unconscious symbols has often led to a reconstruction of the artist 's life . Miss Spurgeon 's classical study of Shakespeare 's imagery was used by her to demonstrate his interest in weather , birds , domestic matters , food , sickness , sports and games , and personified emotions.4 With Marlowe , she found , metaphors from classical learning lead , the celestial bodies and animals came next , whereas in Shakespeare nature and animals lead and classical learning has fourth place . In Marlowe images drawn from personification are more numerous than those drawn from daily life , whereas in Shakespeare images drawn from daily life are twice as many as those based on personifications . There was no attempt on her part to perform any psychoanalytic interpretations here but simply to set up criteria for studying the interests of Shakespeare and possibly distinguishing between the genuine and apocryphal works . Norman O. Brown , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various authors to penetrate deeper into their psyches . From Luther 's metaphors he derives his anal-eroticism , as he does for Swift as well.5 But we have a warning against such interpretations in the work of Dr. Lawrence S. Kubie who in his Neurotic Distortion of the Creative Process points out that , " Where conscious processes predominate at one end of the spectrum , rigidity is imposed by the fact that conscious symbolic functions are anchored by their precise and literal relationships to specific conceptual and perceptual units . Where unconscious processes predominate at the other end of the spectrum there is an even more rigid anchorage , but in this instance to unreality : that is , to those unacceptable conflicts , objects , aims , and impulses which have been rendered inaccessible both to conscious introspection and to the corrective influence of experience , and which are represented by their own special sym-  | bols in impenetrable and fixed disguises . As long as their roots remain unconscious , the symbolic representative will remain unmodifiable . This is what renders them rigid . " 6 To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagery and this can be done only by the co-operation of the pre-conscious . Since few critics have ever been able to analyze their authors professionally , to say nothing of ever having had any clinical experience whatsoever , the function of an artist 's symbolism in his own life is always a matter of conjecture . Moreover , what an artist tries to conceal is as important as what he overtly reveals . If one believes that only in the Collective Unconscious will be found the universal values of which one is in search , then of course the ostensible meaning of a symbol is not so important as its hidden meaning . I have seen doodles made by Hitler which represented , or suggested , high towers , plumed helmets , mountain peaks , and other so-called phallic symbols . I have also seen doodles on the walls of men 's urinals which represented male genitalia without disguise , accompanied by verbal invitations to sodomy , fellatio , and other deviant practices . The graffiti in Pompeii are good examples of this sort of thing . Such symbols running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the people who used them : they are afraid to be themselves openly . They are right to be afraid , for revelation of their repressed desires would be disastrous . But as far as our present interests are concerned , two things should be noted . First , we can not overlook man 's desire for telling others about himself whether overtly or not nor , second , the emotional reaction of the person to whom the revelation is made . Are we to suppose that because mountains were not highly praised before the eighteenth century that 1 ) they were not phallic symbols before that time , or 2 ) that people were less repressed sexually in earlier periods , or 3 ) that people disliked phallic symbols before that time ? or a combination of all three possibilities ? The situation is almost hopelessly complicated , for apparently one may like or dislike something without knowing why , so that one can not say that a symbol is not sexual because  | someone dislikes it , though all people ought to like it given its biological importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mendacity . And finally it is always possible to dislike that which one has learned to disapprove of . Hence the value of a work of art , as far as symbolism is involved , is more likely to be the value from the artist 's point of view . If our psychological theory is correct , then we can see what the work of art " meant " to the artist . But this does not give us any clue to what value it will have for a spectator . The " Excremental Vision " of a Swift will have one value for Swift and another for his readers . One can enjoy the song of a bird or the sound of running water or the sight of the stars in heaven without any knowledge of ornithology , flumenology , or astronomy . Such knowledge may well enrich our sensory experience and I am not pleading for the impoverishment of our lives . If one knew what the bird was saying in his song , one might well be shocked , for all I know . Nor do I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals whatever it is that he is revealing . There is a level of aesthetic enjoyment which does not penetrate beneath the surface of things . And so long as one does not maintain that there is nothing below the surface , one is on safe ground . For the approach to any work of art is bound to be through the sensory surface and the first attraction to it will be on that level . The error consists in denying to others the right to go further and in dogmatically asserting that only the surface is of aesthetic interest . For if that were true , then all poetry would be sound and nothing more and all painting nothing but colors and shapes . Unfortunately that thesis too has been propounded by some critics . This brings up the sixth focus of criticism , design . By design I mean that order which all works of art exhibit . I should call it form , had not that word taken on a discouraging variety of meanings . Now design too may be produced unconsciously as well as deliberately . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist 's career and later dropped into his unconscious , or what would be better called his habitual way of doing things . The child  | who learns to speak is taught to correct his pronunciation and syntax in accordance with rules which have been given to him by others . So the painter and writer as students of their arts learn how to paint and compose and write . That is , someone else gives them a method which he believes for reasons which do not concern us here to be the right method . Once learned , that method ceases to be deliberate and becomes habitual . Nevertheless the works have design in them which is imposed on the raw material with which the artist is working . The order of which we are speaking is seldom inextricably united to the matter which is being ordered . A moment 's reflection will show how at certain times accurate representation or realism was the target of the artist and the focus of the critic 's attention . If the design of the work of art did not reproduce the design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was condemned . But then it was realized that some things which might be represented were ugly or uninteresting or trivial or otherwise displeasing , and consequently the design had to be that of beautiful objects . But , as Sir Kenneth Clark has shown in his book The Nude , the beautiful in art is always a modification of the real ; it is an ideal form selected , arranged , distorted in short , to make the object represented more beautiful than it is . In the case of the human body , it has been elongated , flattened , rounded , proportioned according to supposed perfect numerical relationships ? In all cases the artist is forced to select certain features and eliminate others . A standard design or form is at length developed and that becomes the criterion of correct design . In landscape it was decreed that there be a foreground , middle ground , and background , though it is obvious that no natural scene is ever so divided except by convention . By the seventeenth century a complete vocabulary was developed for expressing the emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not earlier , was transferred to the dance . And later , at the time of Lavater , Gall , and Spurzheim , artists were given a convention by which they might express character by cranial and facial conformations . Similar con-  | ventions were adopted for lighting and for cast shadows . And there were also the rules of perspective and , as everyone knows , Italian painters played with perspective as a good-in-itself , enjoying foreshortening , representing complicated shapes in various lights , and painting their scenes as if there were one observer frozen at a single spot in front of them . To complicate matters , standards of order taken from geometry and statics were then introduced and such criteria as balance , harmony , rhythm , were utilized to judge pictures , poems , musical compositions , and architecture . In architecture and sculpture such criteria may have made sense , since the works of art were not supposed to collapse when once erected , but they were once removed from the facts of other works of art . In our own time the paradigm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are asked to exhibit a vital dynamism , not a mechanical equilibrium . But this is little more than a shift in the basic metaphors on which all theoretical considerations are founded . To speak of the balance of a flat visual design is to introduce a concept which is literal in statics into something in which it can be only figurative . The paintings of Raphael , for instance , are frequently constructed about a vertical axis in bilateral symmetry . According to the theory of Lipps , we would feel ourselves unbalanced if this were not so and our lack of equilibrium would make us uncomfortable ; hence we should dislike the picture in question . In fact the old schools of art instruction went so far as to insist that if a shape of a certain size were placed at a certain distance from the vertical axis , shapes on the other side must , if not equal to it in size , be placed at that distance which would produce balance on a pair of scales . Thus a weight of a pound can be balanced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fulcrum . There may now be some justification for such a rule in a visual design on a flat surface , for we have become accustomed to it for so long that we might indeed feel uncomfortable if it were not obeyed . But on the other hand , there are plenty of designs in Japanese art in which the balance is occult , to use the term given  | to it by Dr. Denman Ross , 8 and we do not feel uncomfortable when we look at them . Hence there seems to be nothing inherently valuable in this principle . It must be accepted simply as another of those rules which became sanctified by usage rather than by natural law . Organic form too is metaphorical when applied to works of art which have no temporal dimension . The term " organic " is as vague as most terms used in aesthetic criticism and sometimes it means nothing more than the reproduction of organic shapes , such as those of microscopic organisms ; sometimes the use of the internal organs of the body : liver , kidneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as growth . One can understand how a work of art , like a narrative or a drama or a piece of music , can grow in a literal sense of the word , but surely when a picture or statue or building is said to be organic in this sense , the meaning becomes metaphorical . The metaphor may be a good one , in that the eye , for instance , seems to light on a particular spot of the design and be carried upward and across and in various directions as the painter has desired . But on the other hand the mere fact that a design is zoomorphic , like an amoeba or paramecium or blob of jelly , is no proof that it symbolizes growth , vital dynamism , creativity , or anything antimechanical whatsoever . D'Arcy Thompson has shown us that in all organic structures there is an effect of mechanical forces . But if one has been captivated by the biological as opposed to the mechanical , then a suggestion of life , however stimulated , will induce a feeling of satisfaction and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art in question is dynamic , vital , creative , as if these words in themselves were terms of value . Bad things , however , grow and live and create , as well as good things 4 do and it is only by decree that we prefer suggestions of vitality to suggestions of mechanism . We shall have more to say of this below , but here may note that the order which is produced by the artist is order , whatever its roots may be . And if we are looking for form in a work of art , we may find it both in machines and in or-  | ganisms . We do want forms which can be easily spotted , geometrical shapes of the simplicity of circles , squares , triangles , as well as organic shapes of easily grasped outlines . But whatever the design , it will have to be produced by elimination and selection . There is no other way to do it . If one should try to count all the details which are held together in even the simplest geometrical shapes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be too great for any eye to apprehend . We do not hear all the tones and overtones produced by any air waves as they vibrate and we do not see all that is to be seen in a piece of bark . In the first place , our sensory organs are selective , and in the second , we have to look in order to see and we look for what we expect to be there . The more fundamental question for the aesthetician is why we look for certain things and not for others . A seventh focus of the critic 's attention has been technique or artistry . It has been fashionable for some years now to decry technique in favor of spontaneity . That may be the reason why the works of art of children , peasants , savages , and the untaught have become specially favored . For , regardless of fact , such people are supposed to be free of convention and the rules of the schools . Nothing could be farther from the truth than this assumption , for savages are highly ritualized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Sunday painters , have definite ideas of what they are trying to do ; and peasants are the most conventional of men . We all know that the Sunday painters achieve their charm by their technical inadequacies , for if one repainted their pictures according to the rules , they would lose most of their picturesqueness . We admire Henri Rousseau because of his romantic imagination and his insensitivity to what is rational . Gypsies do not lie sleeping on sofas in the wilderness , however amusing it may be to see one doing so in a painting . But it is precisely the amusing , the totally unexpected quality of what one finds in the modern primitives which capitivates us and makes us apply to their works such adjectives as childlike , naive , innocent , fresh , and spontaneous . The cult of the childlike is modern and no doubt responds to  | some need which we feel for escaping maturity . But the justification of such adjectives lies in us , not in the pictures themselves . There was really nothing naive in Henri Rousseau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kane . These painters have been wide awake and conscious of their aims . Their technique is not that of the academies and the reason why we admire it , when we admit that it exists , is the reason why we are sick of tradition . Most of us would prefer to look at a child 's water color than at an Ary Scheffer , an Alma-Tadema , or a Cabanel . But would we prefer one to a Winslow Homer , a Courbet , or a Degas ? There seems to be no good reason for depreciating technique . Artistry is an answer to the challenge of matter , an overcoming of its limitations , and even virtuosity , however trivial its goal , is something which it is not disgraceful to admire . I suppose that coloratura singing is about as purposeless as any artistry could be , in the sense that it is no more than doing something very difficult , as are acrobatics , rhymed and metrical verse , fencing , mountain climbing , ballroom dancing , and most conversation . The person who engages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would be absurd to justify his attempt by looking for some more profound significance in it , if by profound one means something of biological utility . Virtuosity is an extension of the drive to conquer the environment , not merely to adjust to it . There is no need to conquer it in order to live . One can always remain at the point where one has just enough food to eat , enough sexual satisfaction , and enough sleep . But though this would be a possibility , it has never been a reality in our civilization . Men , at least in the Occident , have always wanted more than the necessary and by getting it have created their culture . At the same time they have always met the criticism that civilization was superfluous and have been urged to return to something more primitive . But this criticism in itself is praise of civilization , for it indicates precisely that which differentiates man from the beasts . I realize also that people have existed who preferred the beasts to men . Such a preference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too  | indicates a desire for the unattainable and thus constitutes the best of ideals . There is little reason to strive for what one already has . The value of artistry exists of course , like all other values , in two areas , that of the artist himself and that of the spectator . To overcome the limitations of matter and make it do what one demands of it is certainly a great satisfaction , analogous to the control of the body . And it is also a great satisfaction to watch another doing this , a vicarious satisfaction , to be sure , but none the less important . To Aristotle and some other Greeks observation was better than participation : the spectator at the games was better than the athletes . This is not supposed to be our own point of view , but nevertheless the " sidewalk superintendents " also have their day and many a man has stopped work to watch another manipulate a crane or bulldozer . This is not very different from watching a dancer or listening to a pianist , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something more emotionally exciting than lifting heavy weights and scooping out roots and boulders . That , however , simply adds another value to what one is observing . It would not be revolutionary to maintain that it is better to hear a fine piece of music well-played than a poor piece of music well-played . One would imagine , for instance , that the " Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue " well-played would give one greater pleasure than one of Liszt 's operatic transcriptions well-played , though the technical difficulties are about equal . All I am saying here , however , is that overcoming the technical difficulties of Liszt 's bravura compositions is not to be despised as mere technique , because technique is not in itself something trivial . One may retort that there is no sense in wasting one 's efforts on trivialities , but the retort is beside the point . Technical excellence is in itself a focus of values and always has been . And when a critic is talking about it , he should not be scolded for not talking about something else . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not a fresh egg . What a man chooses to do in the arts will always be used by  | some critics , eighth , as an index to his psychology . And in recent times we have become more interested in what a man 's actions reveal about his soul than we are in the actions as an end in themselves . This may be due to our increasing sense of individual differences . Freud 's study of Leonardo da Vinci is relevant . Such a study tells us more about Leonardo than it does about his paintings , it will be said , but as a matter of fact it integrates the paintings into the life of their author or , if preferred , it extends the life of the painter into his works of art . Art is a part of life and the apparent break between what one does as an artist and what one does as a man can be mended when one knows enough psychology . The artist 's life is his art and his appearances in the drawing room may be simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist is done in a world , so to speak , of his own creating . A novelist may be perceptive and sensitive before his typewriter and obtuse and without insight in society . But his social life is no more his real life , to be explained through his artistic life , than the reverse . People often change in different situations and their lives are therefore as multiple as the situations in which they live . Nonartistic experiences flow into artistic work and art flows back into nonartistic activities . How could it be otherwise ? Even if a man deliberately tries to eliminate from his art everything which he does outside of his studio , that attempt itself will be symptomatic of the kind of man he is and will affect his paintings or writings or music . He may be hiding from himself ; he may be revealing things which he dares not reveal ordinarily ; he may be escaping from the problems which beset him when he is at home . There are scores of possibilities here . But the kind of things which he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from , are important as indexes to his total character . The critic 's error consists in maintaining that a psychological reconstruction of a man 's total character on the basis of what his art reveals is a judgment of the value of his art to anyone else or could be used as a basis for such judgment . That it is possible , and indeed usual , to judge works of art in ignorance of what they do for the artist , of what repressions they express , of  | his sincerity or hypocrisy , of his motivation , of his hates and loves , is obvious . For in most cases we know next to nothing of the men whose works we most admire . No one thought any the worse of the Homeric epics when it was believed that they were collections of anonymous folk ballads . And even to those who believe that they were written by Homer himself , they give us but the faintest clue to who Homer was , what kind of man he was , why he wrote them . And yet our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lowered them in our estimation . We know a little bit more about Shakespeare than we do of Homer , but to all intents and purposes we are enclosed within each play and poem as we see or read them . The invocation to light in Paradise Lost gains added pathos when we know that it was written by a blind man , but it is not necessary to know that in order to be deeply moved by the passage . The autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini contains in all probability exaggerations and bragging and hence would not do as strict history . Yet no one has ever said that it was not an enjoyable book . Even John Stuart Mill 's autobiography , though certainly more straightforward and true to fact than Cellini 's , is not read with a view to going beyond it for indications of what he has omitted . No work of art can fail to indicate something of the kind of man who made it and , if it is interpreted as biographical material , an added interest , and sometimes added understanding , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of art in this manner and much foolishness has been perpetrated by biographical critics . But the fact remains that it is impossible to talk about anything in complete isolation from everything else , for the simple reason that it would cease to exist if so cut off . In point of fact , when a man says that he is simply looking at a work of art in isolation from its maker , the cultural environment , the historical antecedents , and so on , he is doing no more than looking at it in exclusive relation to himself , as if it had swum into his ken from outer space . I admit that the important part of what is known as the aesthetic experience is the impact which a work of  | art makes upon a human being . But this does not imply that one not only chops off the work of art from everything past and present which made it what it is , but also chops off oneself from one 's own past and present . The man who thinks he can accomplish this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless if it could be achieved . Just reading a plain English sentence is interpreting it in the light of what one has learned . After all one can not look at a sentence in an unknown foreign language and understand it by simply gazing . Similar remarks may be made about the critic who uses works of art , ninth , as indications of social and cultural states . It would be absurd to say that social reference is all that exists in a work of art , but it would be equally absurd to deny that such reference is there . Certain qualifications again must be made . To separate works of art from their " times , " as they are called , and speak about them as if they were influenced by their times or expressed their times , is as fallacious as to lop them " - off from their authors ' lives . A time is as much made by its works of art as by its economic structure , its political constitution , its military adventures , its religious beliefs , its social stratification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causation . 1 ) Causes can be assigned only to classes of things or to individual events insofar as they are representative of classes . Thus one can discuss the cause of yellow fever , of rainfall , of population growth , of death , but there will always be a margin of doubt between the cause of this man 's contracting yellow fever on this particular date and of yellow fever in general , of the rain which fell yesterday at 3 P.M. along the coast of Cape Cod and rainfall in general , of the growth of population in general and of the growth of the population in the United States between 1930 and 1940 , of death and the death of Herbert Smith on May 22 , 1898 . ' What one wants to know is why a given person contracted yellow fever at a specific time and the answer is not merely that he had been bitten by an anopheles mosquito which had bitten someone suffering from yellow fever twelve days earlier . It is true that if  | the general cause of yellow fever is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it can not be known , but to know the general cause is not sufficient to inform us of the specific cause . When Herbert Smith , Jr. , asks why his father died on May 22 , 1898 , he does not want to be told that it was because his heart stopped beating . Apply this now to our immediate interest . We may discover why painters paint and why sculptors sculpture and why poets write poetry , but that does not tell us why Michelangelo painted the Sistine ceiling when and as he did or why Renoir painted the " Dejeuner des Canotiers " when he did , why Shakespeare wrote The Tempest , or T. S. Eliot The Cocktail Party . We know why ships sink , but that does not tell us why the Titanic or the Lusitania sank , and I assume that what one wants to know is at least that the former hit an iceberg and that the latter was hit by a German torpedo . Both sinkings were cases of sinking , to be sure , but that is not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but each also was very different from the other and a lot more than just painters .9 2 ) No event that happens outside a laboratory in uncontrolled conditions is a pure sample of anything and , whatever else causation may be , it occurs in an environment peculiar to itself . In a laboratory a falling body may fall through a vacuum , but outside the laboratory it falls through air or water or some other medium . In aesthetic matters works of art are produced in a cultural atmosphere which includes religion , science , economics , psychological factors and everything else which happens to interest both the artist and the spectator . These factors help determine the effects of any cause . It is true that anopheles mosquitoes transmit the bacillus of yellow fever , but it takes twelve days or so for the bacillus to incubate in the insect host ; it will not incubate at certain low temperatures and at high altitudes ; and it will not affect a man who happens to be immune . So Leonardo may have painted the " Mona Lisa " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the converse is not true . By which I mean that not everyone suffering from an incestuous love of his mother paints a  | " Mona Lisa . " One of the reasons why Michelangelo painted the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel is that he was commissioned to do so by the pope . But if the pope had commissioned Raphael to do so , the frescoes would have been different from what they are , even if their subject matter had been the same . This would seem to be obvious . 3 ) Though the number of these determining conditions is not infinite , it is so large that many of them are unknown and , since they are so numerous , the probability of their all occurring together is very slight . We may say that the reason why the frescoes are as they are is that they were painted by Michelangelo who had been commissioned by the pope , and that would be true , if not very informative . But the probability of two events occurring together is , other things being equal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concur . If then we could calculate the probability of the pope 's being just the pope he was and the probability of Michelangelo 's being just the man he was , the probability of the two would be the product of these fractions of probability . But when one tries to think of the fraction of probability of the birth and survival of any one man times the probability of his being elected pope , multiplied by the probability of another man 's being Michelangelo and commissioned by the pope to paint the frescoes , one sees that the denominator is so huge that it seems to indicate an impossibility or a miracle . And when one thinks of two men being just what they are and of the probability of their meeting , leaving it at that , one begins to realize that on the basis of probability alone , the creation of any specific work of art at a specific time and place is to all intents and purposes inexplicable . 4 ) Causes are normally thought of as occurring prior to their effects . One first has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill one . One first has to plant a seed before the germination will take place . This will be granted by everyone who is not a general teleologist . Hence whatever the cause of the production of works of art may be , it will have to exist prior to the work of art . But the  | times , the social structure , the cultural atmosphere , and so on , do not exist prior to that which they are said to effectuate , but on the contrary they all exist together . It would be ridiculous to say that Renaissance art was caused by the " spirit " of the Renaissance , for that spirit did not exist until Renaissance artists and scientists and philosophers and statesmen and bankers and warriors began to operate . Remove the Medici and the Florentine Academy from the later fifteenth century and what would be left of the Renaissance in Florence ? But in the same way remove Dickens and Thackeray and their fellows in all the arts , as well as the British statesmen and industrialists and philosophers from the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victorian Age ? The names of the Zeitgeist and ages are good enough shorthand expressions for certain chronological periods , but they are in no sense of the word explanatory . 5 ) When we think of causation , we picture it as a cause acting upon a patient and changing it . Aspirin , for instance , is taken to reduce fevers . Since we are more interested in the effect of the drug on the feverish patient than the effect of the patient 's body on the drug , we overlook the fact that something has to happen to the aspirin before it becomes effective . A biochemist would of course be as much interested in what happens to the drug as in what happens to the fever . Analogously what I am writing here is written because I have read books and articles which try to explain works of art by the age in which they were produced . But if there is a reaction on the part of the patient to the causes influencing it , then it is inevitable that an artist will affect his age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the hope , feeble though it be , that what I write will influence whatever readers I may have . To the best of my knowledge this has not happened in the past . But at least in one case an article of mine has influenced a colleague to try to refute it in three chapters of a little book . Both he and I are in our small way parts of our age . We are not a great part , but at least I can say that one of my writings has had a definite effect on at least one reader and , though it has not made him  | change his mind , it has induced him to continue the discussion . One launches an idea and then someone picks it up , either supports it or tries to refute it . One has only to look at any exhibition of contemporary painting or sculpture to see how works of art are influenced by earlier works of art . The fashion of nonfigurative painting at present did not arise because we are living in a nonfigurative age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its origin , was in no sense expressive of anything other than the aesthetic ideals of Picasso , Braque , Juan Gris , and their imitators . Why younger men began to imitate them is another question . But it will not be answered by any appeal to the spirit of the times since the nonfigurative spirit came later . To invoke such spirits simply rephrases the question in declarative form . The arts then are all parts of the ages in which they are practiced and help historians to describe the character of their age . Causality is not involved in this except in the most general way . That is , we might be able to explain why England has had so many great poets and so few great painters , though I should be skeptical about the success of such an attempt ; but we shall never be able to explain successfully why a specific work of art was produced precisely as it was produced by the man who produced it at the time when it was produced . All nine of the foci of criticism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fused into a single work of art , but in the nature of things are not usually seen together . For few critics know enough to look for all of these things and to speak of them informatively . The public memory is weak , moreover , and the interests of one set of critics are easily forgotten by their successors . Levels of meaning , for instance , have drawn the attention of literary critics in recent years almost to the exclusion of everything else , and few people seem to know that they were distinguished as early as Clement of Alexandria . The hieroglyphic paintings of the Renaissance had very little interest for critics after the seventeenth century ? indeed after the sixteenth , and it is thanks to the members and former members of the Warburg Institute that such  | an interest has been revived . Now that these scholars have published iconological works , iconology has become the fashion and some critics overlook everything else which is to be found in a painting . But after all , no iconologist of the first generation that I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting lay in its iconography . Similarly when A. O. Lovejoy first began finding philosophic and other ideas in poetry , his works were so interesting that a number of his juniors began to adopt his method and carry out his program for themselves . Now we have a whole school of intellectual historians and a journal devoted to the publication of their articles . The result has been that unfriendly critics have maintained that a poem is no better nor worse for incorporating , let us say , a philosophic idea than it would be if it did not . That of course is true . But no one , and least of all Professor Lovejoy , ever said that it was . I should think personally that anything which makes a poem more interesting is all to the good . But there happen to be human beings who distrust the intellect and like to think of poets as irrational and inspired animals , like Plato 's Ion the Rhapsode . If then there are fashions in criticism and changes in the emphasis which critics put on the various aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say something of how this comes about . We can do no more than suggest an answer to this question , but the suggestion may be useful .  | The Orientation of the Critic 's Eye IF VALUES are the satisfaction of wishes or the realization of ideals , then each of the foci of criticism should stand for some ideal which either the artist or the critic is attempting to realize . I have listed only nine of these , limiting myself to this number , not because it is exhaustive but because these nine seem to be the most usually found in aesthetic matters . I have been maintaining then that 1 ) artists wish to see clearly the world about them and to fix it in recognizable form and that critics look for such vision in works of art . To be able to clarify the world of perception is both a useful and a pleasant process , since our vision is often obscure both literally and figuratively . Clarity of vision , even in the figurative sense , is an aid to understanding . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why after all there has to be visual illustration in a scientific text as well as in works of the imagination . Descriptions in literature are not so rare that anyone need be astonished at this . Even in music we have descriptive passages , ranging from incidental bits such as the storm in Beethoven 's Sixth Symphony to the elaborate details of Strauss 's tone poems . What will be illustrated and clarified has varied . In paintings it will be found running the gamut from the trompe-l'ceil still lifes of some of the classic painters to Harnett 's  | dollar bills and scraps of printed paper . But there is more to the matter than this . In Loyola 's Spiritual Exercises he urges his readers to visualize the sufferings of Christ so as to render them more real and a good anticipation of this is found in the Revelationes of Saint Birgitta . Realistic or illusionistic painting , then , has been put to various uses and , regardless of current fashions , there is little sense in decrying it . 2 ) In the second place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things which they wish to express and there happen to be others who want to listen to them . These ideas may simply consist in saying , " This is the way it was , " or may , on the contrary , be satirical , eulogistic , deprecatory . They may be calls to action , exhortations . The various paintings of such scenes as the Slaughter of the Innocents , the Flight into Egypt , or the Adoration of the Magi , on the one hand , or victories , surrenders , triumphs , apotheoses of secular incidents on the other , are more than representations . They invite us to pity , to self-satisfaction , to pride in our nation , to contempt for evil , or simply to laughter . Greenough 's famous statue of Washington " said " that Washington was a lawgiver above all , not merely a general . Elgar 's " Pomp and Circumstance " is a musical satire as Ravel 's " La Valse " is , though the latter may also have political overtones . The Gothic revival in architecture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to get away from the Neoclassic , and presumably pagan , churches of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to what was believed to be the more religious architecture of the Middle Ages . In the early days of the modern dance , ballets were composed on political themes , such as Joos 's " Green Table " and even such a dance as " Shore-leave " was not without satirical reference . 3 ) That we also like to present our thoughts and fantasies through symbols , again , is an ideal , the more so since we have learned that some ideas can not be expressed adequately in literal language . The obscurity of contemporary poetry and painting may at times be willful and the artists may desire simply to bewilder their public . But there are jokers in every pack and the  | mere fact that a spectator fails to read a picture correctly , does not prove that the picture symbolizes nothing . We may look at action painting , for instance , as doing , not as that which has been done , much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calligraphy in the boldness or timidity or serenity or what not of the brush strokes . 4 ) The use of unconscious symbols was practiced in the belief that they were of more universal interest than the conscious and possibly idiosyncratic symbols of the individual . If the theory of archetypes is true , then anyone anywhere can read them and , what is more , be stirred by them . There is nothing in the desire to find a universally intelligible art which needs belittlement , even if it can not be satisfied . But if there are symbols which all mankind can apprehend , though one may not be able to translate them into words , that is all to the good . The uneasy balance between legibility and obscurity may be the very thing which makes such symbols powerful . If one knew in reading the Oedipus trilogy that what Oedipus did is what we should all like to do but dare not do because of social reprobation , then it is likely that we should think of the drama as scandalous . But as long as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be purged of pity and fear . Once more we have no way of knowing how serious the artists are who utilize the archetypes and the so-called Freudian symbols deliberately , but it is good tactics to credit others with as much sincerity as we have ourselves and it must be admitted that , if it is desirable to make works of art which mankind as a whole can appreciate , this ideal is hardly an unworthy one . 5 ) The desire to enter into another 's life and share his experiences is once more an ideal which many men have shared and when it is a question of the great men of art and history in general , this desire is the more understandable . Other people obviously are what count most in our lives and if we do not succeed in understanding their behavior , the world is even more puzzling than it normally is . No practical good perhaps will come  | from understanding Petain or Benedict Arnold , for they will never reappear , and we can do nothing about the dead . Still one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what moved them to acts which seem inexplicable to some of us . This ideal of understanding our fellowmen is complemented by the desire which many of us have had to be understood ourselves . There are not so many autobiographies as biographies , but yet the number is impressive . Some desire to explain oneself to others must have motivated Saint Augustine , Rousseau , and Cardinal Newman , to say nothing of the hundreds of other men who have unlocked the doors to their souls and thrown them open to the public . Those of us who live on a lower plane take it for granted that our lives need no apologia . We assume that we are understood except in minor matters , but that we want to be understood is undeniable . One can call this exhibitionism , as one can call the desire to understand others voyeurism , but there are more charitable explanations of both . To a large extent our lives depend on communication with our fellows and communication depends in part on sympathy . The words which we use to pass on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should be , and there is always a residuum of what we should like to have said which is never said . If then the biographical critic can illuminate the motives of a Shakespeare or a Racine , so much the better . 6 ) The discovery of design in our experiences , like the ordering of our experiences , is again a step toward clarification . It clarifies things for ourselves as well as for those to whom we are addressing ourselves . The search for order is the search of the scientist as well as of the artist and in both cases order may be imposed upon a subject matter as well as uncovered in it . We see only bits of the universe and have to use them as pieces of a larger pattern , but the larger pattern has to be imagined by us and is not given to us from without . The novelist we may imagine as a man looking at a life or a group of interacting lives and trying to find some meaning in them , meaning in the sense of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some explanation of their disasters or successes , should there be any successes . Out of his ruminations may come the idea of a curve rising and falling as in Balzac 's Cesar Birotteau or one which as in South Wind would seem like steady decline to some and steady rise to others . For these geometrical metaphors suggest only the most superficial aspects of a novel . But we know also that sometimes a writer will impose a design upon his story , as in the variations on the theme of the triangle or the kick at the end of a short story by O. Henry . But in any event , the desire to organize experience in terms of a dominant pattern is there . The pattern may now be derived from geometry , now from one of the natural sciences , as in Zola , now from theology ? when vice is punished and virtue rewarded . And even when the artist is merely taking over from tradition the design which he deliberately imposes on his experiences , the spectator need not care for he may find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the nineteenth-century play , utilized a balance of good and evil , age and youth , poor and rich , the laughable and the serious , was surely not always present to the consciousness of the public which found some satisfaction in living in a world in which things came out as they thought they should come out . So customary was this design that the repertory theaters maintained crews of actors who could play each type of role , heroes and heroines , juvenile leads , heavies , character actors , and clowns . In such works of art the value as the ideal could not be missed , for , as in flattering portraiture , the artist produced a world better than that in which his public lived from day to day . 7 ) I can offer no well-grounded hypothesis to explain our admiration for artistry as an end in itself . We do find , it is true , that the material world , " the Other , " is an adversary to be conquered and much of our energy is spent in conquering it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a victory and everything which we learn is a skirmish in the battle over Nature . The only spectators who are always spectators are , as Bacon said ,  | God and the angels.l The rest of us have to participate in the interchange of natural and human forces . We can therefore understand our own efforts to win out in this struggle and feel a certain pleasure in our success . But this does not explain the pleasure which we feel in another man 's success . Do we look upon the artist as our servant ? Is our pleasure in his good workmanship the pleasure of a master whose servant has done a good job ? Or is this just another case of vicarious self-satisfaction ? Is this the reverse of that experience by which we shudder at another 's misfortunes ? One fears to answer that question since after all there is such a thing as jealousy . Maybe in the long run our admiration for artistry is our admiration for an ideal in the process of realization . 8 ) The one value which can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the expression of unconscious symbols . If the theory of Jung is correct , there is nothing else which an artist can do anyway . The archetypes well up from the Collective Unconscious willy-nilly and one is simply the medium through which they are passed on to others . They are , says Jung , 2 " autonomous factors , " " living subjects , " and presumably we have no control over them . When one is writing , one has to use words and , though the words may be chosen deliberately to convey a certain idea , the choice is always partly determined by forces of which we are unconscious . Dr. Kubie would locate these forces in the preconscious , a zone between the individual 's unconscious and his conscious . But regardless of their location , words are in the last analysis metaphors and no one can be sure of why one metaphor seems juster than another , since none , in view of figurativeness , is strictly accurate . Hence we may as well submit to whatever laws of psychology exist , for rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archetypes or unconscious symbols or of the artist 's strategy , as Kenneth Burke would call it , may be an ideal of the critic , if not of the artist . Depth psychology is a modem science and has proved enlightening to all except those  | who need it most . It has seemed to some of us the surest clue to the puzzle of human nature . Until it has become better established as a science , no outsider will feel that he can use its results with the confidence which he gives to physics and chemistry . But in the half century or so of its existence it has given us all some reason to believe that no one can conceal himself from all scrutiny . The moral effect of this should prove to be of the greatest value . For even if we are not so presumptuous as to pardon those whose behavior we understand , the understanding in itself is something which we all desire . The search for such understanding is of course abused , but not all curiosity is idle . For one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more satisfactory for critics to discover the real Shakespeare , for instance , in his plays and poems than to reveal to the world their appraisal of those works of art . Since no man can know everything knowable and since no man can talk of more than one thing at a time , the question arises of why men talk of certain things at one time and of others at another . Is there any way of finding out what orients the critic 's eye , attracting him now to design , now to symbolism , now to biographical indexes , now to technical excellence ? To answer this , as far as individual critics are concerned , would be practically , though not theoretically , impossible . For we do not know enough about even the most famous critics to answer such questions . Berenson , for instance , was more interested in the effect of paintings on him than in their iconography , but do we really know why ? Panofsky is more interested in deciphering the iconography of paintings and translating it into ideas , but again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decline of Impressionism and the rise of iconology . It is true that in a general sense we can spot certain fashions in criticism and correlate them with certain regnant ideas , just as we can correlate certain aesthetic programs with popular nonaesthetic movements in science , politics , and religion . Such correlation is not proof in any sense of that word . For though we can say from the vantage point of two millennia  | that the early centuries after the birth of Christ were dominated by religious problems , we forget that there were many people , and not the least influential , who were not interested in religion at all . We can judge the past only in the light of what remains of it , and frequently what remains of a past epoch is only what has not been deliberately destroyed . As far as one 's own time is concerned , in spite of the speed of communication and the availability of books and articles , every man has his own interests and some are reluctant to spread them . Aesthetic movements , moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , is dead in Europe , but is being born in the United States in music . So , long after the waning of Zola 's popularity in France , Dreiser began practicing the same technique in America . It may very well turn out that historians of the future will think of the spread of existentialism in some of its forms as the characteristic feature of the middle twentieth century . But if one reads the philosophic journals in this country , one finds much more space given to ethics and to logic than to existentialism . Moreover when a field of study captures the imagination of scholars , they soon form groups which specialize in it , and before long they publish a journal given over entirely to it . At that point men who are not professionally interested in it seem to find it difficult to read the specialized journals . The symbolic logician , for instance , will tell you that he can not be bothered reading articles on aesthetics or religion or politics , and the aesthetician will shrink from reading articles on logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not impressed with the spread of existentialism , and analogous remarks could be made about the contents of other learned journals . This seems normal enough and nothing to excite either approval or disapproval . It took well over 300 years for Christianity to become the official religion of the Roman Empire and there were practicing Pagans until much later . In fact , as is well-known , Christianity gained power by absorbing many of the divinities of Paganism and giving them new names . Furthermore , what one will call Christianity will  | depend upon one 's tolerance for difference . Are Arianism , Gnosticism , and the various doctrines later called heresies Christian ? The more one studies the matter , the more convinced one becomes that Christianity is simply the religion which someone calls Christian . But this too is to be expected . The term " regnant ideas " must be taken with a grain of salt . No field of inquiry has ever been pervasive of a European culture or a time or a society . The present moment is one in which physics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergraduates are being urged to become physicists , though more for political than for scientific reasons . Civilization is threatened with extinction because of the release of atomic energy , and the feeling seems to be that if everyone finds out how to produce weapons utilizing this energy , no one will dare to use it for exterminating his fellows . At the same time museums are flourishing and paintings have become a means of making fortunes ? at least for the dealers . Just as people who think that the world is coming to an end will sell all their goods , though they should know that they will have nothing to spend the proceeds on , so with a kind of desperate excitement , men buy pictures for unprecedented sums though there will be no one to look at them , nor will the pictures themselves escape the holocaust . The middle classes , moreover , are busily acquiring real estate in housing developments , as if they and possibly their children would live to enjoy life in them and every city in the land spreads out its tentacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground from an airplane has the impression that cities now touch one another . From Portland , Maine to Richmond , Virginia , if not farther , there spreads the Megalopolis , to use Jean Gottmann 's phrase , and daily more little houses and shopping centers crystallize along the strings of the roads . There is of course justification for calling this the " Age of Anxiety , " but the general population does not seem to share Auden 's feelings on the subject . If they did , the birth rate would go down instead of up , the collecting of works of art would cease , and  | no one would care whether he lived in a new house on the edge of Suburbia or not . If by some chance , or by a rare use of reason , we are not exterminated , the historians of the future may well call our time the " Age of Confidence . " With these qualifications , then , we may say what are the nonaesthetic ideas which achieve an ingression into artistry and criticism . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Occident is religion . Not only are the religious themes illustrated in the arts , as is obvious , but the way they shall be illustrated is determined by religious and theological ideas . To return to our example of the Crucifixion , if Christ was not represented on the Cross until several centuries had passed , it may have been attributable to a theological mystery . Theologically Christ had to die if man was to be saved . He had to be dead for three days . But if Christ and God the Father are one , then Christ 's death would leave the world without God and that was unthinkable . To represent a mystery visually is as difficult as it is to express it verbally . But a verbal expression is not so impressive as a visual representation and the number of people who can see things but can not read them is always greater than the number of literates . To become habituated to seeing the dead Christ might propagate the idea that the world had been left God-less for three days . But once the mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arianism avoided , then the scandal and the stumbling block were also avoided .3 To take another example , the earliest representations of the Blessed Virgin show her as the Mother of God , holding her divine progeny on her knee . But as the Litany of the Blessed Virgin was elaborated and spread about the Christian world , and the verses of the Song of Songs were used to address her , painters represented her as the Closed Garden , the Ivory Tower , the Queen of Heaven with the crescent moon at her feet , and even the various black Virgins , such as the one at Chartres , were justified by the verse , " I am black but comely . " The Byzantine Theotokos was transmogrified into the Second Eve holding the  | Second Adam , who in some cases reaches for the apple which is held out to him by the Virgin Mother . And as the theory that the Old Testament prefigured the New gained popularity , one finds reflections of it in pictures of the Annunciation and the Crucifixion as well , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Expulsion from Eden in the former . To read such pictures demands a knowledge of the two Testaments as interpreted by the Fathers and the Doctors . One 's eye unaided by religious doctrine is helpless . But for that matter the representations of Christ himself are modified by changing conceptions of His role in history . He may be the terrible judge of Michelangelo , the Good Shepherd , the miracle worker , the heavenly child , the sacrificial scapegoat . Emphasis will be placed either on His humanity or His divinity , according to the beliefs of the artist or the demands of his patron . It has been pointed out by others that the nineteenth century was the age of the landscape . There may be several reasons for this , running from the Wordsworthian cult of Nature to the agnosticism of materialistic science . As late as the first quarter of our own century , it was common to see vestiges of divine goodness in the rural scene , in much the same way as Saint Bonaventura saw them in his Mind 's Road to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lack of human beings . They were just scenery . This also may have been due to the artist 's notion that scenery was beautiful in itself and was not more beautiful when peopled with men and women , peasants , herdsmen , picnickers , nymphs and fauns . But it may also have been due to a growing sentiment of man 's unimportance . Just as some economists believed that reform was always ineffectual since the laws of economics were as immutable and as omnicompetent as those of physics , so artists may well have felt that man as the plaything of economic law was of less importance than the stage on which he acted . It is to be noted that the latter half of the nineteenth century saw the first thesis of pessimism that had ever been pronounced in the West , not only in the  | metaphysics of Schopenhauer and Hartmann , but in the poems of Leopardi and James Thomson , the novels of Thomas Hardy and Gissing , and the plays of Strindberg . Christian painting reached an all time low and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chavannes and Maurice Denis that a fresh beginning was made toward renovating it . It is true that the Nazarenes in Germany preceded these men , but their paintings had all the sickliness of Ary Scheffer and fully justified Nietzsche 's comment that Christianity was the religion of slaves . Every painter has his own beliefs and ideals , but it would have been strange if the nineteenth-century artist had not been affected by the spread of religious skepticism . The number of religious themes in the works of Courbet , Cezanne , Monet , Manet , Degas , Pissarro , and the Postimpressionists , to say nothing of our contemporaries , is insignificant compared to the purely secular . And though there existed alongside them such painters as Holman Hunt , Watts , and the Pre-Raphaelites , Scheffer and Bouguereau ? not to mention Henner with his innumerable Magdalensthese men were not the innovators whom we are likely to consider as representative of their time . Their works are usually rated nowadays as only a step or two higher than those of the Quartier Saint-Sulpice . Men had to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even now it is far from pervasive . Political programs also have not been without influence in the history of the arts . The glorification of princes has always been a favorite aim , together with the commemoration of national victories . But it is one thing to see the symbol of a country in a prince and another to see it in a people . The nation as " the people " is probably a contribution of the French Revolution and in this bit of iconographic history Delacroix 's " Liberty Leading the People " is of outstanding interest . Just as the style of LouisPhilippe was " Roi des Francais , " so Napoleon 's before him was " Empereur des Francais . " Neither was King of France . This shift of accent was indicative of a shift in mood . The Demos now became the center and before long the national symbols , John  | Bull , Uncle Sam , Marianne , came from the middle classes and replaced the older feudal symbols . In the tenth century Alcuin could ridicule the idea that the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the nineteenth century it was not only not ridiculous , but sacred dogma . There are very few painters before Daumier and Millet who portrayed the lower classes seriously and sympathetically , Breughel , Louis Le Nain , whom we have already mentioned , and occasionally Goya being the most important . Power has no doubt always resided in the purse , but one waited for Karl Marx to see this stated as a cardinal principle of politics . When Proudhon came out with his famous slogan , " Property is theft , " he struck a note which jangled harshly in the ears of society 's leaders . If one has any doubts about what Millet , for instance , meant to some of the more sensitive men of the nineteenth century , one has but to read the letters of Van Gogh . There was , of course , as far as nineteenth-century artists were concerned , a streak of cultural primitivism in all this idealization of the peasant . He and by extension the working man were more natural than the man of the upper classes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " noble savage , " who also was able to do without things , to subsist on the strictly necessary , closer to that mysterious thing known as " reality . " The peasant was a sort of latter-day Diogenes . As long as people thought that labor was a punishment for the sin of Adam , that economic prosperity was the reward of virtue , no one was going to waste any sympathy on the poor . One might give them alms , for almsgiving was a step toward the acquisition of merit . But one did it more for one 's own good than for that of one 's beneficiaries . Rank had for centuries been a mark of divine favor . But when one began to suspect that it was not God but Mammon who reduced the poor to their level in the social hierarchy , sentiment changed . Perhaps the most significant symptom of the change is found in the cant phrase , " the Dignity of Labor . " If people could be made to believe that labor was dignified , they might also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | hard it was for this change of mind to be brought about is shown by the reception given to Courbet 's " Stone Crushers. " 4 One of the most influential of the forces changing artistry was in physics , psychology , and anthropology . The physics of light we know was a powerful influence on the technique , if not the subject matter , of a man like Monet . That what we see is illuminated surfaces and not solid objects appears to have been the guiding idea in his painting . ? Anyone can see its effect in such series as " Rouen Cathedral , " the " Haystacks , " the " Poplars , " and finally the " Water Lilies . " If painting is essentially a visual art , which though doubtful is a popular belief , it is reasonable for the painter to eschew everything but the visual surface . The all-importance of sensory impressions appeared not only in painting , but also in music , as in many of the works of Debussy , and as for philosophy , phenomenalism and Comte 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge is a mosaic of sensory data was accepted by almost all who had become tired of absolute idealism and , even in the writings of such men as the American New Realists , R. B. Perry , E. B. Holt , W. P. Montague and their colleagues , the basic nature of sensory data was taken for granted . What they refused to take for granted was that there was any perceiving mind to enjoy the data . This tendency , though modified , has persisted into our own time and it might with reason be maintained that paintings such as those of Jackson Pollock , where all reference to objective reality has vanished , are as purely visual as is possible . I say purely visual since colors in themselves are not inherently the colors of anything . When one sees blue , one does not necessarily see the sky or the sea or the eyes of a blonde or cornflowers or any other blue thing . And since all colors , when put on a canvas , seldom occupy the whole field of vision , they must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of any recognizable object . It is true that some of Pollock 's canvases call to mind the swirling of water and of thin clouds , but such an association of ideas is far from universal or inevitable . On the other  | hand it is possible , though not as yet demonstrated , that the majority of people have emotional associations with certain colors , such that blue might be depressing and pink cheerful.6 Yet since all colors on a canvas are usually combined with other colors , whatever the emotional effect may be , it must be that not of any single color but that of the combination . The whole thesis can be no more than a rough statistical generalization and a reading of Van Gogh 's letters in which he sets forth his notion of the emotional , indeed the moral , significance of colors makes one wonder how anyone could believe all his fellows to be affected in the same way by a malachite green or a lemon yellow . There have been people who have said that major keys are gay and happy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked the demonstrable fact that many of the folk tunes , dances for instance , are in the minor keys and certainly not depressing . In recent times the psychological theory which has most impressed artists is that which derives from Freud . ' When one reads the criticisms of the sculptor , Jacob Epstein , one sees that at least in England , and as a matter of fact it would also hold of the United States , there was a real need of liberating people from the fear of expressing sexual emotions . Epstein lived well into our own time and yet the average critic kept harping on the supposed indecency of his works . The indecency consisted in the absence of fig leaves and loin cloths . When men are willing to print such impassioned objections to seeing what everyone knows is beneath the fig leaf , it can only be concluded that they have a pathological fear of sexuality , or perhaps I should say of their pathological interest in the sexual organs . The psychoanalysts , whatever the faulty details of their various theories , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has never , to the best of my knowledge , been such a flood of sexually oriented works of art produced in civilized times . The Ancients with their phallic symbols were open and above board and , until theologians began to preach against it , they had no inhibitions  | against representing men as men and women as women . In our own time artists have in a few cases , such as that of Miro , stated the facts openly , but on the whole their sexual references have been hints contained in what they believed to be " Freudian symbols . " Critics , however , have gone well beyond this , have looked for and of course found sexual symbolism almost everywhere . ' Much of this has been done by letting one 's undisciplined imagination roam at will and it requires no great study or effort to see genitalia in any straight or curved shape . This seems to be an extension of the sniggering habits of school boys , but on the other hand it is also part of our satisfaction in defying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come the belief , found most clearly in Surrealism , that truth will be discovered by releasing our unconscious from the chains of reason . Such terms are loaded with emotion and should be clarified . For sometimes the word " reason " is used as an equivalent for " social approval " and sometimes for objective realism . There is a grain of common sense in granting society the right to censor our speech and control our behavior . One can not rebel against everything . But it is also true that the arts have yielded to the pressure of the rebels rather than to that of the submissive . To read the arguments over the key in which Mozart wrote the opening of his so-called " Dissonant Quartette " ( K.465 ) , usually said to be in C-major , is to realize how passionate critics can become when they detect something which violates the traditional rules.8 Such innovations are mild compared to a complete surrender to automatic writing and painting , but nevertheless they are a step in that direction . The present vogue for what looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to occur to the painter while he is painting , paintings in which accidents are left as they happen and the painter is proud to admit that he was not aware of what he was up to , shows that automatic painting can be as emotionally satisfying as disciplined painting . One can not believe that all men are snobs and hypocrites , and if one can not enter an ex-  | hibition of contemporary painting and sculpture and find a single piece of representational art , one has to grant that the day of the " unconscious " has arrived . This does not imply that it will last forever . In the long run , the history of every art is the history of fashions . The history of fashions is to some extent propelled by fatigue with the old and a desire for the novel . But such fashions do not last very long and the vogue of nonobjective painting and sculpture has already passed its zenith . One can say that with some confidence in that such artistry has already become routine . One of the troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who write books and essays on art are seldom of the generation of the artists about whom they are writing . To them an art is what it was in their youth and they are reluctant to admit change as a reality . Laments for the past , for the good old days ? usually undated ? are nothing new . The slightest knowledge of cultural history would suffice to show that cultural change is inevitable . Within a cloistered society such as the Church one may find a minimum of change , but even there a historian could point out that dogma as well as its interpretation has grown . The very heart of Catholic liturgy , the Mass , is not what it was in its beginning , as is shown by the vestiges of the Greek in which it was originally celebrated . The United States Constitution which was supposed to be frozen as of 1789 has , as everyone knows , not only been changed by amendments , but also by the decisions of the Supreme Court . All culture is bound to be modified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be thought of as a serious interpreter of life , and I do not say that this would be true of all artists , then he should be encouraged , rather than forbidden , to meet life 's problems as other men do . What would one think of the critic who said that the transmutation of the elements was wicked because an element by its very nature must be immutable ? This may have been reasonable before 1900 . But since the days of the Curies , Rutherford , and Soddy , it is nonsense .  | If the unconscious operates in accordance with its own laws , those laws will establish a rational order , as they did in psychoanalysis . It is irrational for an adult to act as a child , " inappropriately " as the psychiatrists say . But the irrationality of such behavior consists not in acting in an inexplicable fashion but in acting in an extremely unusual fashion . It is abnormal in the sense of not being modal . But that simply means that few if any people know what the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a logical fallacy or a mathematical error is . So in the art of painting , if it is assumed that painting is the art of reproducing ordinary objects as they appear to the normal eye , then one can logically infer that any deviation from objective realism is irrational . But not even the most dogmatic Realist or Naturalist , not even Courbet or Zola , ever succeeded in creating a world which was a complete reproduction of the objective world . In fact Zola himself pointed out that art was nature as seen through a temperament . The trom fie-l'ccil painters almost re-created the world , but they too had to see objective reality through their own eyes and not through some standard eye which was that of the mythical being , Humanity . Though the birds may have pecked at the grapes of Apelles , they soon found out that their pecking was wasted effort . And even Pygmalion had to invoke the help of the gods before he could actually embrace his Galatea . Most painters , even when they clung to the doctrine of objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or ugly ) in accordance with their own standards of beauty . But it is obvious that whatever is put into a painting , and by extension into any other work of art , will have to be composed of parts first seen . But what is seen is determined as much by psychological laws as by physical . One of those laws expresses the conditions under which attention is oriented . Another expresses the influence of the observer 's emotional set , his liking and disliking for certain objects . A third states the influence of expectation : one looks for things before one sees them and what one  | looks for is what one expects to see . But all this is modified by the materials in which an artist is working . One simply can not with the pigments at one 's disposal reproduce all the tiny shades of color gradation which a scrutinizing eye will observe . E. H. Gombrich in his Art and Illusion has clarified this matter definitively and what he has to say is harmonious with what contemporary students of perception have discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seeing , he will reply , " A tree , " " A bird , " " A cloud , " and not " A colored shape . " That is , he will contribute what he believes to be before him to what his eyes report . But the minute he does that , he has to decide where he is going to stop . For such words as " tree , " " bird , " and " cloud , " are not the names of visual perceptions but of things . And though they do well enough in ordinary conversation , they are not very explicit . He knows that no bird is just a bird . It is also an ornithological specimen , a biochemical specimen , a combination of atoms and molecules , and with all that a symbol whose meaning has been determined for him by all that he has learned in life . If one sees Picasso 's famous dove , one can not just say that it is a bird . And if one sees Aldus ' printer 's mark , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round an anchor . No reclining nude is just an anatomical specimen . For artists , like critics , see with their whole mind , not merely with their eyes . Beyond the range of scientific ideas lies that of political and national allegiances . A few years ago there was a hue and cry for urban poetry , along with this went another for the American Scene . In Russia , we are told , the artist is ordered to make works of art for the proletariat , and all nonobjective art , even if only so far from Realism as Cubism , is denounced as an appeal to capitalistic and bourgeois taste . As early as 1860 , Henry Ward Beecher condemned Renaissance Italian art as undemocratic . And not too long ago Congressmen denounced a traveling exhibition of American painting as Un-American . Emerson in his wellknown oration on the American Scholar wanted to free his fellow countrymen from their enslavement to Europe and by the  | end of the nineteenth century composers were being nationalistic , as they thought , by introducing folk tunes into their compositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancies , the call to artists to express the political and national ideals was not unheeded . But no culture in the Occident has ever been fenced in and , though we may talk about the American language , as distinguished from English , American is at best a dialect of English . The fact that we drop the u in such words as color and honor and have slang expressions which would not be understood in Great Britain does not constitute our speech as a separate language in the sense that Norwegian is separate from Swedish , to say nothing of Spanish being separate from Portuguese . What one calls a separate language depends on one 's definition of a language . But the differences between English and American are exaggerated by the nationalistic spirit of people who dislike the speech of others . There is nothing to dislike in either English or American , but there are plenty of Americans who dislike the English for reasons which have little to do with their speech , and similarly plenty of Englishmen who dislike Americans for analogous reasons . One can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , his clothes , his sports , his arts , and his religion . Thomas Craven in his book on Modern Art took out his dislike of the French by attacks on what he called the School of Paris . And Leon Daudet saw in every work of art which he disliked the hand of the International Jew . If Chagall is a Jewish painter because he has painted rabbis and ghetto life in Russia , then what of Rembrandt ? For that matter , what of all the hundreds of painters who have illustrated the New Testament ? One might as well say that Landseer , since he painted dogs , was canine and Alma-Tadema Greek . We now know how monkeys paint and have no reason to think that the man who likes to paint like a monkey is simian . The pallid drawings of Flaxman were the poorest imitations of Greek vase paintings and no one would say that Lahme was more than the most remote approach to Indian music . The point , of course , is that most artists  | deal with those subjects which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is one thing to talk about national subject matters and another to talk about national artistry . But even here there has been much exaggeration . No one any longer denies the influence of Scythian designs on Chinese design , but also no one asserts that they can not be distinguished . The degree of isolation of a culture depends on the degree of communication between it and other cultures . As one descends from China , for instance , into northern Thailand , one sees sculptures which echo Chinese sculpture both in decoration and in subject , but the farther south one goes , the less the resemblance . If there were such a thing as a Chinese or Siamese spirit , it would express itself wherever Chinese and Thais were to be found . But that is contrary to fact . In such ways the critic 's attention is directed to a variety of possible targets . It is always possible to find in any work of art or in any artist 's style indications of all the things which we have mentioned and of others as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his preconceptions of what he ought to find , and these preconceptions naturally will depend on his total education . Standardization of both subjects and manners is no cause for surprise ? most living is ritualized . But the adult might be expected first to realize that he is not the " human race " and second , that all the elements of a culture are mutable . One can scarcely object to a man 's painting or writing as he thinks fit and not as some critic thinks fit . The artist has to pay the price of his independence nevertheless . That price is usually abuse , which may extend from mild expressions of dislike to downright slander . That critics think it their duty to transform their likes and dislikes into principles of approbation and disapprobation is normal . We all do it . To see one 's ideas as peculiar to oneself is rarely achieved . Men hunger for the universal and unchanging . They seem inevitably to believe that their taste , their family 's taste , their neighborhood 's taste , and what they imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste and always has been . I suppose  | that just as some Christians believed that Adam and Eve spoke Hebrew , so the Chinese believed that the first men to inhabit the world spoke Chinese . In the mythology of every people is the idea that their country is the center of the universe . And it is , for them . When the Bodhisattva was about to be born and descend from the Tushita Heaven , he had to decide just where his descent would take place . Of course it occurred in the center of the world , India . Surely one might expect our contemporaries to have outgrown these childish notions . We know enough about the history of criticism to see that critics from time to time shift their point of view and look for different things . For that matter we also know enough to see that at any given time a group of critics will take various points of view . Though men like Clive Bell and Roger Fry formed schools of criticism , they were surrounded by other men who disagreed with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 February 1920 ) writing about Epstein 's " Christ " could say , " At this time of day neither Mr. Epstein 's nor any other artist 's ideas of the Redeemer are of the least interest to anybody . They are , in the true sense of the word , impertinent . Above a certain level of importance , all historical figures are true in proportion as they are traditional , and any attempt to reinterpret ' them makes them relatively untrue . ... But , apart from the folly and impertinence of all such reinterpretations , Mr. Epstein has made another mistake : an artistic mistake . Reinterpretation , or even interpretation , of the subject is not the business of sculpture . . . . The business of the sculptor is to interpret not the subject but the material ; to make the stone or bronze or whatever it may be more like the subject than anybody has made it before by the nice recognition and skillful handling of its properties . This applies to every kind of art . " 9 One week before this J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Christ ' is a man , austere , ascetic , emaciated , having no form or comeliness . He is a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief . There is pain , bodily agony , not merely in  | the gesture with which he points to the torn flesh of his outspread hand , but in the poise of his proud unseeing head . If he has risen from the dead , he rose as a man , by virtue of a tense and concentrated effort of the human will .... What Epstein had to express was the nature of the man who knew every second of his agony and disillusion . The man of reality swoons under the pain , gives up the ghost ; but art can envisage a man who remains fully a man under sufferings intolerable . This is a Christ-Prometheus. " 1 ? Most people would , I think , agree that both Marriott and Murry were men sensitive to whatever it is that art communicates . Murry has given an interpretation of the " Christ " which he believes to have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could not have been far wrong . But Marriott not only says nothing about what the figure symbolizes , but denies that it has a right to symbolize anything . I confess that I am far from certain about the meaning of making stone more like the subject than anybody has ever made it before , especially since in this case no one has the remotest idea of what the subject looked like . But even if one understands this cryptic phrase , it is obvious that what one critic denies , the other affirms . These two opinions can not be reconciled , for they negate each other . One can only conclude either that one of the opinions is wrong and the other right , or that each critic is looking for something which he believes ought to be present whether it be there or not . Marriott was disappointed at what he found and he found exactly what Murry was delighted and deeply moved to have found . There is no Supreme Court to tell critics what they ought to look for . It had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for " significant form " and significant form was the form which gave rise to an " aesthetic emotion . " Unfortunately the only definition which he gave of this kind of emotion was that it arose from looking at significant form . His book was an important item in the rise of modern art , for it justified , or tried  | to , the distortions which the Fauves and later Postimpressionists had introduced into their representations of human bodies . To have called people 's attention to this was a valuable contribution to the appreciation of the visual arts . But unfortunately it also gave people the impression that anything else which might be present was illegitimately there . The verdict was to be sure unwarranted . It was judgment based upon the use of words . Etymologically , as we have pointed out above , the word " aesthetic " suggests that the values of works of art must reside exclusively in the perceptual surface . Anything other than the purely perceptual which might be apprehended in a work of art would therefore not be aesthetic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " He might take the point of view that more than one value was to be found in most pictures , sculptures , poems , buildings , and pieces of music . To contemplate a painting as a focus of concentrated ideas might be thought of as one of the values of the painting . To see one as a religious effigy , a magical tool , a moral argument , is not aesthetic in Bell 's use of that term , but then one must invent another term to cover all the values which are fused together in a single work of art . To refuse to do this is like refusing to see in a mountain anything more than its mineral possibilities or in a tree anything more than its cubic feet of lumber . But both a mountain and a tree are much more than that and are valued for more than that . So , though a painting may have significant form , it may also have other significance and it is only by fiat that one can rule that other out of court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to human life as a whole and we shall now turn to that .  | The Hierarchy of Values WE HAVE DESCRIBED the role of values as that of ideals which guide our action . They are that which we hope to attain , the personal reward of our struggles and the compensation for our disappointments . As such they are seldom achieved in real life . They are , to refer again to Fichte , what ought to be , not what is . At the same time there is such a thing as finding something valuable . The thing may be either an object or an act . I see no way , as I have said , of substantiating the existence of values which no one finds valuable . Those which , like justice , are rarely actualized and which are usually taken seriously only when one is oneself involved , have nevertheless been valued at some time or other by some real person . The valuation may exist only in a book or in legislation and never found in practice . But in spite of that someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least hoped that the day would dawn on which it would be sought by all men . One of the great difficulties in discussions of this sort is that we use too general terms to name our values . Even the criminal would agree that he thinks justice ought to prevail ; he would maintain that the sentence passed on him was not just . In ethics it is specific acts , dated and localized , which are in question , not  | the abstract principles upon which most opinion is uniform . A Nietzsche may have the courage to say openly that he does not accept the usual virtues , which he believes to have their origin in the Will of Slaves , but he is a very rare exception to my generalization . It is understandable why this should be so . The names which we give to our values are all question-begging ; by their very nature they include an appraisal of the things they name . We all approve of the virtues and disapprove of the vices , but we differ on whether a given act actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casuistry enters the debate and for its part it asks whether or not a given act should or should not have been performed . The perfect tense of the verb is important , for before an act is performed one can never prophesy what its effects will be and the effects have to be taken into consideration in appraising it . And when motives also enter , who really understands his motives ? Though it would be an error to say that all acts are actes gratuits , there is always a gratuitous element in every act : one wants to do it or does not want to do it . We can theoretically generalize about the kinds of act which we have wanted to do in the past , but when we are confronted with a new problem , we usually discover that there is just enough novelty in it to make our generalizations fall short of covering it . The same holds good of artistry . We have a vague idea of what we want to make , but the process of making it modifies our plans . Accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment upon what we are doing ; the thing does not seem to be turning out as we had anticipated . Or , from the spectator 's point of view , we have a mass of memories which orient our eyes and then come upon a picture which conflicts with them . How can we reconcile the new with the old ? A distinction must of course be made between those ideals which we have been told to make our own and those which we do make our own . In view of the indisputable fact that men have changed their values as time has gone on and have succeeded in imposing new values on society in the form of custom or statute ,
