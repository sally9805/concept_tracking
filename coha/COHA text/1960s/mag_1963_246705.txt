( See Cover ) <P> The air was atingle in Scarborough last week as 2,000 delegates poured joyously into the windswept seaside resort for the Labor Party 's 62nd annual conference . It was n't just salt they sniffed on the North Sea breeze . From the elegant old clifftop hotels to the pubs where Laborites adjourned for their midmorning pints , Scarborough smelled of victory . <P> For the first time in their twelve years out of office , the Laborites who filled Scarborough 's three-tiered Spa Great Hall were buoyantly aware that all Britain was watching them - and the man who is expected by the majority ( 56% ) of Britons to be their next Prime Minister . The delegates fidgeted impatiently through the first day of ho-hum oratory . Finally , at the stroke of 10 o'clock next morning , Harold Wilson rose to make the keynote speech as the new leader of the Labor Party .

" <P> A marriage of science and socialism , in Wilson 's vision , will ensure accelerated technological progress that can make Britain " the pilot plant of the world . " A socialist government will radically step up the training of more scientists , ensure that they are creatively employed , and staunch the " brain drain " to the U.S. by offering them the prestige and prospects for which many of the country 's ablest men now cross the Atlantic . With heavy state support for their work and more " purposive use of research , " he prophesied , British scientists will yield new products , new laboratories , new industries , new sources of world trade . <P>
