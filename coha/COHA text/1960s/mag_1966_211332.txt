One of the most familiar techniques for teaching elementary electricity is to compare the flow of electrons through wires to the passage of fluids through pipes . The analogy is so valid that scientists are now changing it from a textbook explanation to practical application . They are building fluid circuits that supplement and even replace some electronic devices . By controlling and amplifying the flow of fluids ( either gases or liquids ) , just as electron flow is controlled and amplified in electronic circuits , they have conjured up a variety of odd new fluidic devices that offer valuable improvements on their electronic counterparts . <P> Because they are unaffected by temperature extremes , radiation , vibration or shock-conditions that often damage or knock out electronic circuits-fluidic controls show their greatest promise in aerospace and defense work . The Army has already successfully tested a fluidic roll-rate control on its TIM ( test instrumentation ) missile ; it is evaluating a fluidic navigational device developed by Martin Marietta Corp . for use by foot soldiers . Honeywell Inc. has developed and flown a fluidic autopilot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used on New York Central locomotives , General Electric turbines and the machinery that manufactures Speidel watchbands . <P> Switches &; Amplifiers . In place of the battery or generator that energizes an electronic circuit , fluidic devices use a continuous stream of fluid , usually air . The supply can come from a pump , from the hot gases of a jet engine , from air forced through nose vents in " missiles or airplanes , or even from a tank of compressed air . In a simple fluidic circuit , the power stream is fed into the base leg of a Ylike arrangement of tubes or channels . As the stream flows through the Y toward outlets at the end of two diverging arms , a fluid-flow phenomenon , called " the Coanda effect , " causes the stream to attach itself to one side of the circuit and to flow out through only one of the arms . <P> A tir&gt;y " control jet " of air , blown perpendicular to the power stream as it passes through the base leg , can force the stream to attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happens , the power stream flows out entirely through the other arm of the Y. A puff of the other control jet reverses the process , just as a small voltage change on the grid of a vacuum tube can control a relatively heavy flow of current through the tube 's plate circuit . Like a vacuum tube , the fluidic circuit can thus be used as a switch to turn on or shut off a supply of power . <P> By etching or carving out a cavity at the point where the arms and base leg of a fluidic circuit meet ( see diagram ) , fluidics engineers can prevent the power stream from clinging to either wall . Instead , it flows down the center of the Y and divides equally between the two outlets . In this " anti-Coanda " configuration , the application of a control jet merely deflects the power stream by an amount proportional to the intensity of the jet . As the output of the two legs varies with the strength of the control jet , the fluidic circuit is once more something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amplifier , exaggerating with its power stream the fluctuations of its tiny control jet .
