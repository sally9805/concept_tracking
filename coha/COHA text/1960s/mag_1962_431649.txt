 | WANTED REAL WOMEN Today , if the human race is to be saved , man needs woman as never before . He needs her love and faith , yes , but he needs her actual co-operating work , both of hand and mind , and not only in the home and family . He needs her in every phase and level of national and international life , and , most hopeful of all , he recognizes his need , and is ready to acknowledge it . Yet faced with that need , and with that acknowledgment , we , the women of America . have crawled into our shell ? the home ? and have bolted the door . Twenty-five years ago , when I first came to the United States , my own country . to live and to make my permanent home ( I had lived in China since I was five months old ) , I was deeply interested in the American woman . I found her a paradox . She had equal opportunity with men for education and training in the professions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead she married and devoted herself to a small group , her own family . I hasten to say that I am all for marriage and home and children . Nor do I minimize the important role of woman as wife and mother . The question , however , was whether the woman was sufficiently or properly trained even for this position , if it were to be her only one or , at best , her chief one . To educate her for mobility and freedom and then deny her that same mobility and freedom can lead only to frustration , and a frustrated woman is not a good wife and mother , however much she may love her husband and children . By PEARL S. BUCK 1 observed frustration in the American woman . She often repudiated the word . insisting that she wanted to be married , that nobody had forced marriage on her , that it was woman 's highest calling , her natural place , and so forth . Nevertheless , in spite of such protestations . it was obvious that she was discontented in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Her life was hectic between kitchen and school . her time schedule not her own but that of husband and children . To serve is beautiful . but only if it is done with joy and a whole heart and a free mind . The American woman served her family as a duty . brightened by love , it is true , and by intervals of joy . but the atmosphere she created in so doing was not one of continued content . Out of these early observations I wrote a small book entitled Of Men and Women . This little effort has brought me thousands of letters from all over the world , from both men and women . Now , two decades later . I am often asked if I would write the same book again . My reply is that I would . but I would add Part II . Much of what was true a quarter of a century ago is still true . Woman 's education is the same . her frustrations are more obvious although some small attempt is being made to alleviate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of supplying about one-third of the labor force of the whole country . but her basic situation remains the same ? with one greatm , astounding difference . If omen have not changed . hot men hare . continued on 67  | Two decades ago the attitude of American men toward women was tolerant but i superior . It was still considered a handicap to a man if his wife worked , a proof of his incompetence : A man should be able to support his family . This is no longer true . A young man nowadays expects his wife to help support the family if necessary . If it is not necessary , he 1 encourages her to work where her interest leads her . This can mean only one thing men have a new estimate of what women can be and should be , and ? here is the newness of it ? in relation to themselves as men . This change . which has begun only @# @# since the end of the war . is the result of several forces . Much is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , advertising and general culture . It is true that this present emphasis is beyond reality . perhaps because it is only the far swing of the pendulum from the past . when women were supposed to have little if any interest in sex ? " nice " women . that is . The other kind of woman existed , of course , but for men alone . The daring notion that women enjoy sex as much as men do , if not always in the same way . and the man 's discovery that he himself enjoys sex more when the woman enjoys it too . has revolutionized the relationship between men and women . They have become partners not only in @#  | reproduction but in the joy of creation . Nowadays young husbands want to share more than the moment of conception . They share to a heartening degree the period of pregnancy , the hour of birth , the care of the infant , the growth of the child . Fathers are emerging from their unimportant and sometimes even ludicrous position to a place of equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function of producing the next generation . I do not say that all men so share , but it seems to me the younger ones do share , and want to share . That is important ? they want to share . A real marl , moreover , does not feel it threatens his masculinity to change a diaper , or to wash the dishes of an evening . It is only the man on the fringe of masculinity who fears that " woman 's work " will change his sex . THIS new kind of interest in women , which American men are now beginning to evince openly . may have its beginning in a new appreciation of sex as a process , but it is developing into a new appreciation of the woman as a human being . The man does not now doubt her chastity or think the less of her because she , too , frankly enjoys sex . On the contrary , he is stirred to the depths of his own being , where he thought he was alone , and now knows he is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the more inclined to share with her the other aspects of his life . He discovers that he likes to talk with her intelligently . He is impatient when her conversation is limited to trivialities and daily humdrum and gossip . Never before has the intelligent and well-educated woman had so much good male companionship as she has now . Even age does not prevent the attraction . I am impressed by the fact that while American men are hungry for a fuller companionship with women sexually , they are even more hungry for her companionship mentally and spiritually , too . I wonder how many American women realize this change in men ? If women fail in such recognition , I fear for the world . For man , disappointed in woman , retreats into a frustration which can compel him to such cynicism and despair that he is capable of brutality on any scale and for which indeed she must assume responsibility . If American women can understand the opportunity they now have , and the responsibility , if they can accept both , they will enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their freedom is absolute , or as absolute as it can be in a world wracked by huge choices for good or evil . Even so , they may , if they will , if they can grow quickly enough , have a share in deciding what sort of a world it will be . Certainly the decision should not be left to men alone , and it still is , as of this moment . Yes , what I am saying is that nobody is holding women back except women themselves . The challenge that men give us today is simple and clear . They want women to be intelligent as well as beautiful . All the beauty aids in the world will not serve if the brain inside that carefully coiffed head is an empty one , vacuous and small . The instant 's diversion will not last . Real men today want real women . Charm must be redefined . It must now include the delight of a mind FLEXFIT Sandal Amber or Black @# 242  | alive and alert , thinking , imagining . considering , enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex , more than home , more than family . For the first time , at least in the United States , I discern in men a yearning desire for women who can fulfill them , and a yearning , equal in its intensity , to fulfill their %omen . They are beginning to find new depth in sex , new excitement in love , persading the entire life and not limited to led and board . WHAT a challenge this is to woman ! How is she responding ? Well . as of now , - he is frightened . She is the more frightened and even resentful because women , f other countries are entering her field . American men are marrying Asian women , European women , wherever they an find the woman they need . The competition grows fierce . So far , American women are responding in terms of panic . They are catching their men very young . I heard a young woman of my acquaintance complain only yesterday that " If you do n't get married before you 're twenty-two , your chances are slim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , but it accounts for many I , f our young marriages . The door of the house is wide open for woman to walk through it and into the world , but the stupendous scene beyond it terrifies her . She slams the door shut and pulls down the shades . She is Aso terrified that she sometimes even rails against the exceptional woman , the daring individual , who accepts the invitation of the open door and enters into wider opportunity and assumes the new responsibility . Both fear and resentment are natural , though not intelligent . Every change into a new life is terrifying and seems impossible . A child at birth springs into the larger world beyond the womb not with joy but with loud cries of rage and fright . When death draws near , the dread is deep . What change is this that strips from us the familiar body ? We put it off as long as possible . And ? let us face it ? women have had a good life and an easy one . Yes , yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child-bearing , the ? everything ! I maintain that it has been easy . The hardest work in the world is responsibility , and men have had it , not women , with notable exceptions . Yes , yes . too , the woman has had to encourage the man and keep him at it , and coax him , and feed him food and love and sex in judicious amounts , but he is the one who has shouldered the responsibility and gone out of the open door . And she has stayed safely under the roof . knowing that he would return . Meanwhile she gets the dishes washed , does the daily chores and keeps busy and within her limits . , The trouble is that the limits must be removed . She must be busy with everything in the world and useful everywhere . If her housewifery prevents her development , then the plain truth is that woman must order her home duties . She must deal more efficiently with housekeeping demands .

I hear such rumblings already from men who feel the burden of today 's world intolerable upon them , not only the actual labor but the heavier burden of intellectual effort in solving problems and devising new processes . Women 's brains are needed today in every field , in the highest echelons . Old prejudices are fading , intelligent men are eagerly seeking intelligence wherever it can be found , and they are impatient when intelligent women continue to live in narrow ways , apart from the world 's problems and dangers . Now is the time for all good men , and women . The demand is here , the opportunity waits . It is for women now to consider themselves and that open door . There is no household problem which women , working together , can not solve . The question which faces every woman is no longer " Do I want to ? " or " How can I ? " The answer is simple . You must ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Admit impediment . . True marriage is the complete co-operation of men and women in all human life . To such mutual respect and responsibility let women not admit impediment . There are no impediments except in their reluctant minds . I believe that happy families and good children come only from trite marriage between man and woman . Similarly and on a universal scale a good society . a safe world , can come only when men and women work together , using their valuable differences and the special contributions of their individual personalities through partnership in work for the human race . 241-
