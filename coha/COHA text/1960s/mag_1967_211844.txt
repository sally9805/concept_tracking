Down with the Yanquis , <P> Down , down . <P> Down with Barrientos , <P> Down , down . <P> We shall defeat the accursed forces . <P> Forward , forward . <P> This song is heard these days in the rugged jungle country of southeastern Bolivia , where it is sung by a band of Castro-style guerrillas who are harassing the eleven-month-old regime of President Ren Barrientos . Though they number only about 100 men ( some say as few as 60 ) , the guerrillas have caused consternation in the Bolivian government and army . At first , Bolivia 's army promised a speedy campaign and victory over the guerrillas . But it has found them so tough and elusive that President Barrientos three weeks ago even asked neighboring Argentina to send in some troops to help out . The Argentines , feeling that Bolivia 's 8,000-man army ought to be able to handle the guerrillas for now , refused . <P> A New Ambush .

Their field of operation - a 1,300-sq. - mi. area that straddles important oil lands between Santa Cruz and Camiri-is steep and covered with thick , thorny vegetation and huge plants with leaves so sharp that they can slice through clothes and skin . The guerrillas first surfaced in March , when they ambushed and killed seven men on an army patrol . Since then , they have been striking once every two or three weeks . By last week they had killed 33 soldiers and civilians and lost only six or eight of their own men . <P> One of the boldest of the guerrillas is Antonio Negro , a Cuban who fought with Castro in the Sierra Maestra . A few weeks ago , Negro strolled into the small town of Saipuru , stole a truck and eight gallons of gasoline from a government-owned oil company , then fled with five soldiers as his prisoners .

Barrientos , an ex-air-force general , has 2,500 men scouring the guerrilla area and several choppers flying lookout missions . The government 's anti-guerrilla campaign , called " Operation Cynthia " after the commanding officer 's daughter , so far has produced only eight captured guerrilla suspects , including a French leftist intellectual named Jules Regis Debray . A close Castro friend , Debray was picked up walking out of an abandoned guerrilla camp three months ago . Since then , he has told half a dozen conflicting stories , some of them implicating Cuba 's long-absent revolutionist , Che Guevara , in the Bolivian operation . Last week 's version was that Che organized the guerrilla uprising , then left for parts unknown . The Bolivian government 's plan to try Debray has raised a storm of protest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
