CITIZEN OF NEW SALEM He assured those with whom he came in contact  --  wrote a friend later  --  that he was a piece of floating driftwood ; that after a winter of deep snow , he had come down the river with the freshet ; borne along by the swelling waters , and aimlessly floating about , lie had accidentally lodged at New Salem ... . The previous winter saw " the celebrated deep snow of Illinois , " as he called it long afterward . On Christmas Day in 1830 came the snow upon all the great prairie , and snow fell almost continuously in the whole winter . So thick a winter made a flooded spring . The rivers received the melt and rose up until they flowed into the branches of bankside trees . Travelers went by river , in home-fashioned boats . A certain merchant enterprise began when a tall flatboatman with two companions set out from Decatur , Illinois , for Springfield in a homemade cottonwood canoe . On Spring Creek near Springfield they set to work building a flatboat destined for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a barge eighty feet long and eighteen feet wide . At night they camped on the creek shore and played seven-up . The tall flatboat-man did most of the cooking , though occasionally at noon they all went to Caleb Carman 's nearby cabin for dinner . The flatboat was ready in mid-April and , with the owner , Denton Offutt , on board with the others , took to the Sangamon River heavily loaded with a cargo of " barrel pork , corn and live hogs . " The waters were receding . The voyagers wound along the slow , unruffled W . . T stream until on April nineteenth they came rounding a baylike bend where a , high bluff pointed at the river . At the foot of the bluff was a mill , and reaching out from the mill was the miller 's darn . Running to ride over it , the llatboat hung itself up on the dam with its bow in the air . Water poured into the shallow deck . For a day and a night the boat could not move . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Salem up on the bluff people came to watch what would happen next . They saw the tallest flatboatman take charge , though he was the youngest . Giving thought to the problem , he ordered the boat lightened by the putting ashore of part of her cargo . Another part he moved forward , to balance the boat on the dam crest . Still weighted with water aboard , it could not move . The flatboatman borrowed an auger and bored a hole in the suspended bow . The shipped water poured out . He then plugged the hole , and the boat was edged off the dam into free water . It was then a simple matter to stow the cargo again . The watchers saw the flatboatman dressed in trousers of blue jean rolled up any which way , showing a lot of shank , and a white-andblue striped cotton shirt , and a buckeye-chip hat not worth twelve and a half cents . He described himself as " a strange , friendless , uneducated , penniless boy , working on a flatboat  --  at ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sangamon River into the Illinois and with the Illinois into the Mississippi and all the way to New Orleans , where , selling the cargo , the boatmen saw the sights . Denton Offutt remembered New Salem . He could establish a store there in that thriving village on the long bluff above the Sangamon . To help him he hired the tall flatboatman , who had nothing else to do and nowhere else to go . The flatboatman  --  as he declared in a sketch of his own life long later , written in the third person  --  slopped indefinitely , and , for the first time , as it were , by himself , at New Salem . . This was in July , 1837 . Here he rapidly made acquaintances and friends . , , .

One was an ordained minister and the other was the town 's first innkeeper , John M. Carnron and James Rutledge . A few years before , only hunters and trappers came that way , traveling alone and vanishing . Later came emigrant parties destined westward , who did not linger . But now with farms on the prairies the village was wanted as a trading post . Its lots , laid out by the surveyor Reuben Harrison in 1829 , sold for as much as ten dollars , and to put up a log house took as much again . Now came a man , and now another , and another , each with his skill , to meet needs felt by all . With them all came their women and their children , and it was not long until new lives were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not strangers . Though some families came and stayed only briefly , moving on farther west in search of their notion of a life , the village at its fullest would have about twenty-five families occupying twenty-five to thirty wooden buildings . It was the largest town the flatboatman had ever thought of staying in . All about lay the prairie under its summer skies , the color of water as he saw them through gaps in the great ranks of trees that marked off the open land . Between two creeks that trifled away toward the Sangamon River was a high stand of wooded land which pointed to the river like a finger . Its far end dropped away in the bluff that backed up the mill . Along its flat crest , which curved this way and that , the village was strung out in a long line amid the forest clearings , with prairie behind it and river before it . On the forest-edged hillsides grazed cattle , sheep and goats , and hogs snouted in the woods and grunted in the wagon ruts . Small as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep and took what they could . Every man was a hunter and went for deer and wild turkey in the woods , prairie hens and quail in the open country , wild geese and duck by the river . In spring ( Continued on Page 66 ) T he New Salem mill has been rebuilt on its original site , although the river 's course has now shifted . Lincoln worked at the gristmill off and on during the 1830 's , unloading and measuring farmers ' grain . The mill 's activity provided the basis for the town 's commerce . alley , and this woman had her wheel chair right against the wall . " " Did you speak to her ? " " Why ? " " Because a car turned into the alley , drove on past me and stopped right beside this woman .

" " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . It was a woman . " " Can you describe her ? " " She was wearing a raincoat , a sweater , slacks and a man 's hat which was pulled down over the eyes . " " Did you at any time see this woman 's face ? " " Yes . " " Had you ever seen that woman be-fore ? " " Not to my knowledge . " " Did you ever see her again ? " " Yes . At the police station . " " Who showed her to you ? " " There was a line-up of five women . I picked this woman out of the line-up . " " And who was this woman , if you know ? " " The defendant , the woman sitting there , Susan Fisher . " Susan Fisher gasped with horrified dismay . " Did you have an opportunity to observe the make of the automobile ? " " Indeed I did . " " Have you seen that automobile since ' ? " " Yes . I subsequently identified it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number nineteen painted on it to designate it .

By the time 1 was told that what I had seen might be of great importance in a murder case , I found I could n't recall the license number . " " Did you see the number nineteen on this car at the time it drove in the alley ? " " It was dark at the time ? " " It was dark . " " Were you standing near the car ? " " Within about twenty feet .

" " That time in the alley , " " Never before that ? " " Well , I had a glimpse of her when she was being escorted into the show-up room . " " Had you seen her picture prior to that time ? " " Yes . Police had shown me her picture and asked if that was the young woman I saw . " Citizen of New Salem ( and summer behind the dam , boys and men caught bass , catfish and suckers . As they saw him in his first summer , while he waited for Offutt to come with the stock for the new store , the flat boatman stood up high in any gathering , for he was already six feet four inches tall , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him look even taller , for his breeches  --  jeans or buckskins  --  never reached his shoes by six inches , and his shirt sleeves  --  tow linen or brown-and-white checked cotton  --  hardly touched his wrists , which were as hard-fibered as a thick walnut branch . His hair was thick and dark , coarsely combed , perhaps by one of his huge hands , perhaps in search of some elusive thought . In his wide-boned face his eyes were set deep in shadow under his strong Continued from Page 21 ) brows . Bone and long muscle showed frankly everywhere in his frame . He considered himself overly plain , and he seemed conscious of all that he lacked in knowledge , presence and talent . A child of the backwoods , he had always held himself less worthy than most . A youth his age saw him in boyhood as " the shyest , most reticent , most uncouth and awkward-appearing , homeliest , and worst-dressed of any in the entire crowd . " One day he was bullied by a boy larger than he was and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his physical strength , he was " secured by his prowess . " It was not enough . There were other ways to advance . Perhaps he might learn something of these in New Salem village , where he waited for Offutt and the merchandise and the opening of the store in a ten-dollar cabin near the bluff and the start of his career as a merchant clerk . The flatboatman had his first chance to meet people in a crowd on August 1 , 1831 , when an election was held in New Salem . Citizens gathered . He voted for the first time , speaking out his vote , like the others , to the poll clerks who sat at a table . Such a day was given over to politics and pleasure . Men and boys showed what they could do in wrestling matches , fist fights  --  with the crowd as referee  --  and gander pulls . A potent whisky called Monongahela went around , and rumlike spirits known as tafia , and the stunts grew wilder . The flat boatman hungered to please . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke or speak a comic poem or imitate an Irishman , a Dutchman or a Negro , which he could do " perfectly , " as T. G. Onstot , the cooper 's son , said , adding that " in the role of storytelling I never knew his equal . " If to be liked he had to live down his disadvantages , the flatboatman set out to entertain . Caleb Carman at first decided he was " a Green horn , " and then he added , " tho after half hdur 's Conversation with him I found Him no Green Horn . " It was a trial to be idle . Most men brought their own trades with them to New Salem and set themselves up to do work for which to be paid in barter or hard money . The flatboatman , waiting for his employer , could only hang around the village and try to make friends , watching for ( Continued on Page 69 ) March 4 , l no I ( Continued from Page 66 ) odd jobs . He earned a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Illinois River . From Beardstown the pilot walked back some seventy miles to New Salem . The village houses were made of logs  --  white oak , black walnut or linn  --  chinked with native clay . The floors were laid with unplaned planks . On such a house the roof was pitched and covered with clapboards , or shingles called " shakes . " One end wall was almost wholly taken by a fireplace either of stone or locally made brick or wood chinked with clay  --  which on a windy day might catch fire . Windows were set in south or east walls . If a cabin had no window , the doorway supplied light and air , and these were regulated by a flap of untanned deerhide or rag carpet in a hinged frame set in the door . The interior of the house was dark even in daytime , for the windows were small , trees arched close overhead and the raw logs of the walls weathered with time to a shadowy ash gray . In winter and summer alike fire was kept up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the flatboatman saw any time he was asked in . The furniture was strong , plain and sometimes beautiful . In a corner was a double bed , dressed with a home-woven coverlet . Trundle beds beneath it fitted the children . Rush-seat chairs and a chest of drawers and a corner cupboard and a spinning wheel stood primly out of the way . For a piece of elegance , if it could be had , the family showed a Boston rocker or a Connecticut clock . Beside the hearth was a box for firewood ; near the mantel hung tongs , spurs , a bootjack , a candle mold ; and over the door and along the walls hung rifles and shotguns on wooden pegs or antlers . Outside , near the door , was a great woodpile , which dwindled as winter passed . In back of the cabin was a wooden hopper for leaching wood ashes to yield lye , which went into soap . All about the house grew a garden of wheat , cotton , oats and corn , with a tobacco patch beyond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and wood . Open to the summer day , the house was a haven of shade and cool ; shut to the winter night , a firelit stronghold against the dangers of wilderness and ice . In it the flatboatman saw his present view of home . Referring to Denton Offutt , he wrote later that he contracted with him to act as clerk for him ... in charge of a store and Mill at New Salem . . . . By September second Offutt was back , paying ten dollars for lot No. 14 in the village , there to build a store . It was quickly built , and the new clerk went to work . He had someone to help him in the store , " Slicky Bill " Greene , who was nineteen . They had a varied stock of goods to handle . Some of it was imported  --  dry goods , certain seeds , tools , firearms , ammunition , saddles and fancy liquors . The rest was homemade or gathered about the prairie  --  cheese , butter , bacon , lard , tallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vegetables , ox yokes and raw liquor from a " little still house up at the head of a hollow . " The store clerk , in his mild , considering way , seemed eager to learn any lesson in the busy life all about him . Primitive in aspect , the village in its variety of persons held several of education , grace and culture . Here was modest opportunity to reach for values of mind and grace . The store clerk , in his own way and time , began to do so . But first , as a newcomer who hoped to remain , he had to prove himself against the roughest strain of life . On the prairie near New Salem was a small settlement at Clary 's Grove . The " Clary 's Grove Boys " paid their respects to newcomers , and the clerk would have his turn . He knew their sort . They ruled in the backwoods with petty ( error , hazing drunkards , putting stones or burrs under the saddles of unsuspecting riders , cropping manes and tails of horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by night the property of anyone who might displease them . The leader was Jack Armstrong . He believed he must take the measure of the new clerk . What he got was his own instead . Jack issued a challenge to wrestle , since no one had ever thrown him . The clerk took him on . They were both good men , in the physical value of the Clary 's Grove Boys . It was hard to believe and accept , but the store clerk wrestled Jack to a draw . They shook hands when they gave up . Jack made it clear to his boys that the clerk from now on was in good standing , even though he could read and did n't drink or cuss or indulge in hazing weaker creatures . The clerk , in fact , found himself in a position of leadership , and though he never interfered with the dissipations of the boys , he would , on occasion , bring them to be more merciful than they intended to be . Boxing and wrestling he approved , but if a fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop it , " he would say ; and they would . The store clerk saw entertainments for play and work and worship . A dance followed every gathering . The furniture was hauled outdoors or , if the house had enough room , was pushed to the walls , and to the sound of accordion , guitar or fiddle and clapped hands , the gaunt and formal gaieties of figured dances rocked the puncheon floors into the dawn . A feast would follow , made by the craft of men as hunters and women as cooks . Jugs of Monongahela and tafia went around  --  the company drank hard . Some guests came from a distance and need n't think of going back in the dark . For hospitality was cousin to hardship , and the one-room log house met all occasions , The cooper 's son wrote of it : " At mealtimes it was all kitchen . On rainy days when the neighbors came there to relate their exploits , how many deer and turkey they had killed , it was all sitting room . On Sunday when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the young ladies in their best bow dresses , it was all parlor . At night it was all bedroom . " And if guests stayed overnight , after the party was over , the bedding was spread on the floor for all to share . They lay down with their feet toward the fire , which was kept up all night . Family and visitors slept together , and nobody felt " consciousness of impropriety or indelicacy , " a citizen declared . if , in the morning , a raw-potato poultice for a whisky headache should be needed , any housewife could provide it . Medical care was largely homemade . though Doctor Allen , the Vermonter , might be at hand with his Dartmouth learning . Wives treated cold and sore throat with a piece of peppered fat meat fastened about the neck . If an eruptive disease was slow to break out , they fed a dose of " nanny tea , " which was compounded of sheep dung . They gave other remedies made from brimstone , sulphur , tobacco juice ; bitters derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ague was so common that people would say of a victim that he was n't sick , he only had " the tiger . " If Doctor Allen was called , he sometimes had to accept lard , bacon or dressed hogs in payment of his bill . These he sold at Beardstown or St. Louis . The store clerk boarded out with various families , walking to their homes for his meals  --  the Herndons , the Millers , the Kelsos . At night he slept in the store , and so did Slicky Bill . Their employer presently rented the mill on the river from Camron and Rutledge , and there , too , he set the store clerk to work , unloading , measuring and trading for sacks of grain brought in by farmers off the prairie . In mill or store he did his work with good humor , adding many a tall story or memorized joke to his exchanges with customers . His rectitude was proverbial . Once . waiting on a woman , he gave her the wrong change , keeping six and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , checking over his accounts , he discovered his mistake . He had left a four-ounce weight on the scales while weighing out tea . It was an error to be undone by walking six miles with a refund before taking his ease for the night . In his first winter in town he joined the New Salem Debating Society . The members stirred with anticipated fun when he got up to speak , for his jokes were famous . After the meeting the president of the Society declared that " there was more than wit and fun " in the store clerk 's head . " He was already a fine speaker .. . all he lacked was culture . " It was a view in which the clerk shared , sometimes hopelessly . But in the following spring , in Offutt 's store , using what spare moments he had , he thought he would study grammar . A little while later he had all the time he wanted for study , when Offutt 's enterprises failed . Offutt left town . The clerk was at loose ends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sober view of his own shortcomings and disadvantages , something stirred deep within him and moved him to give form to a fantastic hope . In the weeks of February and March he devoted himself to writing a long and earnest statement which he published in the issue of the Sangamo Journal for March 15 , 1832 , announcing his candidacy for the office of assemblyman in the forthcoming session of the Illinois state legislature . Like other frontier settlements , New Salem and its vicinity felt the stir of the future . Optimists spoke of raising money to build a railroad for Sangamo County , declaring that improved transportation was the key to future growth . The store clerk agreed about transportation , but as for the railroad , " there is always a heart-appalling shock , " he wrote , " accompanying the account of its cost , which forces us to shrink from our pleasing anticipation . " He proposed another measure : " The improvement of Sangamo River is an object much better suited to our in- fant resources . " He knew the river well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mill . " These circumstances , " stated the candidate , " are sufficient evidence , that I have not been veiny inattentive to the stages of the water , " and that therefore his " calculations with regard to the Sangamo , can not be unfounded in reason . " It was clear from his style that he had been reading the English rhetoricians of the late eighteenth century and in their symmetries of construction he set forth his plan for the river . Though the river had its natural advantages , its course could never b'e " practically useful to any great extent , without being greatly improved by art . " The whole river , he recalled , was clogged by drifted timber , and the last thirty-five miles were the worst , where the channel meandered tortuously . Drifting timber could not pass the bends . Navigation was impossible . But why not straighten the course " by removing the turf a sufficient width " in a straight line through flat and treeless prairie land , and " damming up the old channel ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through " the new channel , " thereby curtailing the distance , and increasing the velocity of the current very considerably , while there would be no timber upon the banks to obstruct its navigation in the future . " There are also , continued the candidate , " many places above this where the river , in its zigzag course , forms such complete peninsulas , as to be easier cut through at the necks than to remove the obstructions from the bends  --  which if done would also lessen the distance , " He could not say what his measure might cost , but surely it could cost no more than was " common to streams of the same length . " In any case , he believed that " the improvement of the Sangamo River , to be vastly important and highly desirable to the people of the county ; and if elected , " he declared , " any measure in the legislature having this for its object , which may appear judicious , will merit my approbation , and shall receive my support . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wick at night , the jobless candidate , with no place to sleep but the loft of somebody 's house , set down words meant to sound again in the high chambers of government . The steamboat surely meant the fortune of Sangamo County . It was immense news , and the candidate heard it with all others that Capt . Vincent Bogue , of Springfield , intended to bring the steamboat Talisman through the rivers from Cincinnati to Beardstown , New Salem and Springfield in March and 70 April , 1832 . Captain Bogue knew the Sangamon was cluttered with floating timber and overhanging branches . He sent word asking for men and boys to sweep the channel ahead of him . They were to bring long-handled axes and report to him at Beardstown . The candidate joined those who responded in high spirits . The Talisnran was described as a " splendid , upper-deck cabin steamer , " of 150 tons , 136 feet long , with a fortyeight-foot beam . Everyone turned out to see if the river could take her . Along the banks men and boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing their first steamboat , cheered and whistled her on her course . The ax crew worked at snags and overhangs , and high water got her safely past the dam at New Salem . She went on upstream to tic up at Portland Landing , five miles from Springfield . A public reception and dance followed at the Springfield courthouse . The future had arrived . Captain Bogue had brought it . But meanwhile the river was changing  --  the spring freshet had passed , and the Sangamon within a week began to fall to its ordinary low water . The Talisman must sail if she would complete her round trip . The candidate was hired as assistant pilot to help Rowan Herndon get her back to Beardstown . Making about four miles a day , the ship came to New Salem , and was halted by the milldam , which in low water was an impassable obstacle . The Talisman hung on the dam crest . The dam must be removed . The Talisman backed off , threw out her anchor , and her crew tore away enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sailed across on the first try and proceeded to Beardstown , leaving behind her instead of proof of a prosperous future a bitter disillusionment . The candidate and his pilot were each paid forty dollars , and both walked back to New Salem . The Talisman sailed on to St. Louis and a few months later went up in flames at her mooring . When the Black Hawk War of 1832 broke out , wrote the candidate , he .. . joined a volunteer Company , and to his own surprise , was elected Captain of it  --  He says he has not still had any success in life which gave him so much satisfaction . . . . " Go to the devil , sir ! " said the first soldier of New Salem to whom the captaM gave an order . It was one of the Clary 's Grove Boys , whose members made up a great part of the company . Despite their free speaking , they followed the captain loyally . The war was a three-month campaign in pursuit of Chief Black Hawk who with 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In doing so he violated a treaty of a year before . So many Indians on the rove seemed like a threat to settlers . A thousand mounted volunteers joined with regular troops to chase Black Hawk away again . It was , for the captain 's company , a war of march and bivouac , without sight of the enemy at any time . The poet and editor , William Cullen Bryant , seeking out the front for a glimpse of action , reported how settlers complained that the soldiers " made war upon pigs and chickens . " He met the captain and found much of interest in this " raw youth , " with his " quaint and pleasant talk . " One of his soldiers remembered his " freedom without familiarity " and his " courtesy without condescension . " Easy with his men , he could prevail when he was firm . One day he heard a commotion in camp and went to investigate . He found a throng of angry soldiers clustered around an old Indian who had wandered into the bivouac . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill him . The old man pulled from his shirt a letter signed by Gen. Lewis Cass commending him to white citizens for his good and faithful service to settlers in the past . " Make an example of him , " cried the soldiers . " The letter is a forgery , and he is a spy . " They heard another voice . " It must not be done , " said the captain , coming between his men and their victim . The captain 's face , as someone said , was " swarthy with resolution and rage . " He freed the old Indian to go safely on his way . By woods and river the campaign proceeded , and the captain 's enlistment of thirty days ran out . " I was out of work , " he said to a friend long later , " and there being no danger of more fighting , I could do nothing better than enlist again " ? this time for twenty days . Another period of thirty-day service took him to mid-July . In his re-enlistments the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other officers who signed up again after their first hitch . The war would end in August with the surrender of Black Hawk . It was an election summer , and soldiers soon returning home talked politics . The ex-captain was still an announced candidate , and the army was a good place to find votes . The Clary 's Grove Boys were all for him , and so were many others . Once his willingness was known , " The mess , " said one of his companions , " pitched on him as our standard-bearer , and he accepted . " He was mustered out with the rest of Captain Early 's company on July tenth , and the march homeward began . The ex-captain had to walk much of the way , for his horse had been stolen the night before . The company was disbanded at Peoria . With a messmate , he bought a canoe and started down the Illinois River . The water was low and they hardly made " half the speed of legs on land , " said the messmate . At Havana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking home to New Salem . Returning from the campaign , noted the candidate , and encouraged by his great popularity among his immediate neighbors , he , the sante year , ran for the Legislature , . . He had less than three weeks ' time to campaign for office . Backwoods citizens gathered to hear the candidates in clearings , where forest trees had been cut down to make an open-air hall . A candidate to be heard jumped up on a tree stump and made his speech -- -a " stump speech . " The ex-captain , now campaigning as a politician , had practiced for it all his life , Even as a youngster , said a playmate , he " would frequently make political speeches to the boys . " Though he could have talked only a boy 's idea of high-toned argument , he was " always calm , logical and clear . " Now he bore inwardly an image of himself which was different from the one that had come with him to New Salem . A friend said that he had " great individuality which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from the mass of men like a stone cliff over the plains below . " 11 he loomed up naturally because of his physical tallness , he seemed to match it with some tallness of spirit that stood forth on its own account . Going off to make his first campaign speech , he found an audience already gathered for a public sale at Pappsville , eleven miles from Springfield . He wore the dress of his place and time  --  a mixed jean coat with claw-hammer tails which , on him , were too short to sit on , flax and tow-linen pantaloons , pot-metal boots , a calico shirt like the one he wore in his Black Hawk command and " a straw hat , old style , without a band . " In national politics he was for Henry Clay , who opposed Andrew Jackson . In local politics , he had already made his proposals known in the Journal . At Pappsville , " thar was a large gathering thar , " recorded a witness , and " hee was the only candadate thar and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the ticket . The candidate got up on a platform or the rear of a wagon and made ready to begin . Just then there was a disturbance  --  one of his friends , Rowan Herndon , was suddenly closed in on by a group of Jesse Dodson 's friends . Rowan had licked Jesse not long before , and now he was catching it from the gang all at once . He was being badly whipped . The candidate saw unfair advantage . He leaped from his stand and took up a back of the neck and a seat of the pantaloons which belonged to Rowan Herndon 's chief attacker and threw him away a distance of twelve feet , Peace suddenly descended . Rowan Herndon put it that he had been attacked by " a set of Ruggings and they atempted to shoe foul play . " Well , sir , the candidate " piched in and Piched them out Like they were Boys and told them his friend Could whip the whole of them one at a time that ended the fus . " The crowd got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rostrum and held up his hand for attention and said , " Fellow Citizens , I presume you all know who I am . " They did . " I have been solicited by my friends to become a candidate for the legislature . My politics are short and sweet , like the old woman 's dance . I am in favor of a national bank . l am in favor of the internal improvement system " ? into which his Sangamon River proposal might fit ? " and a high protective tariff . If elected shall be thankful ; if not it will be all the same. - On August fourth the closing rally of the campaign took place in Springfield . The candidate spoke at the Old Court House . Stephen T. Logan heard him and felt the change of heart which the candidate so often inspired . " He was a very tall and gawky and rough-looking fellow , " said Logan , " his pantaloons did n't meet his shoes by six inches . " This bumpkin ? An aspirant to public office ? " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He made a very sensible speech . " Logan came to the rally thinking of him as " a sort of loafer down there " at New Salem . True enough , the candidate was out of work . " But , " added Logan , " one thing we very soon learned was that he was immensely popular . . . . " The election in August showed as much . In his home precinct of New Salem he received 277 out of 300 votes cast viva voce . In Sangamo County he totaled 657 votes . For a self-doubting young man who had been there little more than a year it was a good showing  --  though not quite good enough to elect him . Once again in his short history he had to wonder what to do and where to go . He was now without means and out of business , he wrote , but was anxious to remain with his friends who had treated him with so much generosity , expecially as he had nothing elsewhere to go to . . . . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penniless and depressed  --  the jokester turned miserable and anxious . He boarded with the family of Rowan Herndon , the storekeeper , doing odd jobs to pay for his meals . He thought about what to do . Should he learn to be a blacksmith ? It was hard work , but when had he ever feared hard work ? Yet , with his hankering for books and learning , could there be another way to make a living  --  with his brain instead of with his hands ? There was a way , and he considered it dearly , and gave it up  --  the vocation of attorney at law , for , as he put it , he " rather thought he could not succeed at that without a better education . " The backwoods had made him , had given him his limitations and seemed sure to hold him forever . But " before long , " he declared , " strangely enough , a man offered to sell . . an old stock of goods ; upon credit . " It was Rowan Herndon , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with William F. Berry to his boarder , whom he regarded as a good risk . The boarder gave his note and entered on his position as a storekeeper with Berry in August , 1832 , in a narrow cabin of square-hewn logs in the middle of New Salem . " They opened as merchants , " he remembered , adding , " and he says that was the store . " On January fourth in the following year the partners were paid off for service in the Black Hawk War . Pooling their cash , they paid 5265 for the stock and premises of a larger store and took possession a few days later . Their new building was the only one in town finished with planed lumber . It had a pitched roof of shakes and a lean-to in back . At one side stood a log ( Continued on Page 72 ) 72 ( Continued from Page 70 ) rail for hitching horses.The new store was much nearer to the river than the old one . The woods came almost up to it in the rear . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storekeeper often reached for his book . He was trying to learn by himself what others took from school and academy . He said that " the aggregate of all his schooling did not amount to one year . " He had never even been inside a college or academy building , as he said . At twenty-three , alone in the world , the storekeeper felt the need to be taught . English grammar must be his first subject . One day in February , 1833 , he went along the village and down the wooded slope to the northwest and came to the schoolmaster 's place and found Mentor Graham , the schoolmaster , at home . " I have a notion of studying grammar , " said the storekeeper , The schoolmaster looked at him and said , " If you expect to be before the public in any capacity , I think it is the best thing you can do . " " If I had a grammar , I would commence now . " The schoolmaster knew of only one grammar book in the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in constant use with his pupils in school . But he thought of another which the storekeeper might be able to borrow . " I know of a grammar at Vance 's , about six miles , " he said . It was an old copy of Kirkham 's Grammar . The storekeeper finished his breakfast , as Mentor Graham remembered , " got up and went on foot to Vance 's to get the book . He soon came back with it and said he had it . He then turned his inerdinate and almost undivided attention to the subject of grammar . " The teacher knew a student when he saw one . To the little forest settlement where the tasks of life were mostly physical , Mentor Graham and his family brought reminders of other values . He was a teacher by vocation . During his teaching hours he was formally dressed , with a white tall collar , a stock of shining black satin and a black-velvet vest . He was clean-shaven . When his classroom day was done , he would see the smallest children to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long snows timber wolves were bolder than usual , and pupils must go their way through woods . The hungry-minded storekeeper came to his teacher with a taste for reading already well developed . He was never without a book , walking by the river or through the woods or along the single street . A boy who watched him said that when night came , " he read by the aid of any friendly light he could find . " Sometimes he would go to Onstot the cooper 's shop and scrape up shavings and other scraps of wood lying about and make a fire , " and by the light afforded read until far into the night . " In the store he took every chance , even for a few minutes at a time , to take up his book and recite from it to himself . If someone came , he put down the book and entertained the customer with business or comedy . Even in company , if the talk lost his interest , he brought out his book from under his arm and spent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others ; and then , if a spoken word caught him again , he shut the book away and entered again into the concerns of those about him . He was how he was , and unlettered friends let him be so , for his books never seemed to estrange him from the people he knew and loved . What he learned made him more of a companion , not less of one lost to them in superior knowledge . He talked about what he was reading , and Caleb Carman wrote it down that the storekeeper would " Refer to that Great man Shakespeare allso Lord Byron as being a great men and Burns and of Burns Poems and Lord Neilson as being a Great Admarall and Naval Commander and Adams and Henry Clay Jackson George Washington was the Greatest of them all of them and was his Great favorite . " During the spring , summer and fall he studied with Mentor Graham , in whose house he learned not only academic subjects but something of the amenity of life by which the Grahams lived . He saw handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teacher put him to work . Mrs. Graham did things with what style could be managed , and he saw how in the humble roughness of the backwoods surroundings grace of manner and feeling could be acquired . He came many an evening to recite his lessons to Graham . From grammar they moved on to mathematics , and Graham did not find him " anything of a mathematician  --  especially so of geometry and trigonometry . " But they worked late , and Graham 's daughter said the two of them " frequently sat up till midnight engrossed in calculations , and only ceased " when Mrs. Graham sent them out after more firewood to keep up the fire they had forgotten in their shared absorption . The grown-up scholar was a thorough student . Someone knew him " to write a proposition in three different forms in order to state the meaning as clearly and simply as possible  --  and to spend half a day doing it . " It was an echo of Graham 's method of learning . His teacher watched him at study and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitching quoits , swimming , shooting , telling storiesanecdotes  --  and not infrequently truth to say ' sitting up to the fair girls of Illinois . ' " But in the main his life was work , and even the teacher noted that " he was so studious he somewhat impaired his health and constitution . " Other friends feared he " might bring on a mental derangement . " Fearing for him , they thought of his best qualities . Everyone spoke of his honesty and rectitude , and Graham said he was one of " the most companionable persons you will ever see in this world . " The teacher 's pride was pardonable when he spoke of his grown-up student , " I have taught in my life from four to six thousand pupils as a schoolmaster , and no one has ever surpassed him in rapidly , quickly and well acquiring the rudiments and rules of English grammar . " Pursuing his true interests , the storekeeper devoted most of his time , said Graham , " to the Scriptures , and books on science and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With modest certainty , the schoolmaster said , " I think I may say that he was my scholar and I was his teacher . " In the green light of the woods by day and at night by coppery firelight the young storekeeper took out of borrowed books what daily experience denied him . Referring to himself and his partner Berry in the store , he declared , Of course they did nothing but get deeper and deeper in debt . In March , 1833 , William F. Berry took out a license to sell liquor by the drink in the store and to operate a tavern . The store was becoming more of a saloon . Berry 's habitual intemperance was a trial . The other partner was lost in his books , " The store winked out , " he said , and when it failed , and when Berry died soon after , he was left owing $1200 , which was a sum so great in his eyes that he referred to it as " the national debt . " Eventually he would pay it all off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his neighbors for tasks by which to earn bread and a bed , He had more time for books , but these did not make his living for him , At Rutledge 's tavern he listened to circuit-riding lawyers and other travelers from the world of which he knew nothing . He knew his own terms were coming alive in him  --  the terms of mind and spirit ; but if they should never have their chance to shine , then anyhow he could show what he could do in the more ordinary needs of life in the backwoods . On the rude prairie frontier all was arduous and physical , if life was to go on . Attainment and distinction came mainly from excellence at the hard brute jobs all about . The ex-storekeeper had innate excellence which could show itself in the humble acts common to all . Why , think what he could do , they said . Slicky Greene bet a man a fur hat that his storekeeping friend could lift a whisky barrel and drink from the bung . He won his bet when his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it so and spat the whisky out , One of the Rutledges saw him take a barrel of whisky " by the chimes and lift it up to his face as if to drink from the bunghole . " James Short was there the day he lifted " 1000 pounds of shot by main strength . " They liked how else he used his prodigious strength too . Mrs. Jack Armstrong said he " would do anything to accommodate anybody . " Widows and poor people who needed firewood brought in could count on him . For a boy in bare feet who needed money to buy shoes he split a pile of rails that could he sold . And " My , how he could chop ! " said a witness . " His ax would flash and bite into a sugar tree or sycamore , and down it would come . If you heard him fellin ' trees in a clearin ' , you would say there were three men at work the way the trees fell . " If his worries were not concealed from his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun and gravity grew on him alike , " and if asked , he would sing one of his favorite songs . He always liked " De Blue-Tailed Fly , " which he referred to as " that buzzing song , " and Caleb Carman wrote that he sang " Oald oald Suckey bleuskin " and " Woodpecker tapping on the hollow Beach tree . " Children were drawn to the entertainer , saw in him something of an elder brother , and felt his simplicity of spirit which could reach out to them in childlike fondness and equality . Those lucky enough to have work to do could give children little time . Children loved a man who had plenty of time to give them . But his friends were at work on his behalf . For some time they had felt dissatisfaction with the conduct of die post office at New Salem . They made certain recommendations , and as a result the unemployed storekeeper received the appointment as postmaster on May 7 , 1833 , from the Democratic President Andrew Jackson . The new postmaster was well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he explained his appointment , which he promptly accepted , on these grounds ? " the office being too insignificant , to make his politics an objection . " Two friends signed his bond of $500 , and he had work again . The mail arrived by stage once a week , If people did not call for their mail , the postmaster took it to them . They said , " he carried the office around in his hat , " and he used an old blue sock in which to keep his postal receipts . His safe was a wooden chest under the counter . Of the amount of business going through his blue sock each month , his share amounted to between four and six dollars . He had earned twice as much in his first job as a flat boatman two years earlier . To earn a little extra , he did small tasks as legal clerk for Squire Bowling Green , the local justice of the peace , writing a summons now and then or witnessing a deed . It was a relief when another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sangamo County , offered the postmaster the position of deputy surveyor , to cover the vicinity of New Salem . The work would March 1901 not interfere with the duties of the post office , and would bring a little pay with it . The postmaster accepted , knowing that he must learn the science of surveying in a hurry . All that summer he was still studying with Mentor Graham . and together they took up his problem . Having mastered grammar in three weeks . he now attacked textbooks of surveying -- Flint 's . Gibson 's  --  and mastered the subject in six . " He procured a compass and chain , " as he said , " , .. and went at it . This procured bread , and kept body and soul together . " Out in the country with his compass and chain , surveying new townships , roads and tracts , he became known to more people , until his name was a household word . With his openhearted feeling for his fellow beings and his comedy and his book learning , he was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , it also endeared him to them , with his " blue cotton round about coat , stogy shoes , and pale blue casinet pantaloons , " with great gaps at waist and ankles , as they saw him . He was capturing more friends , and perhaps future votes , for another election was coming in the summertime , and on April 19 , 1834 , he published his name in the Sangamo Journal as a candidate once again for the legislature . Rowan Herndon now lived at Island Grove , and one day during harvesttime his old boarder came there campaigning , for there were some thirty men harvesting in the field and each had a vote in his giving . The candidate " got his dinner , " said Herndon , and then went out to see the harvesters . Herndon " gave him an introduction . " but without arousing enthusiasm . " The boys said that they could not vote for a man unless he could make a hand . " " Well , boys , " said the candidate , " if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With that he took hold of the cradle , and , said Herndon , " led the way all around with perfect ease . The boys were satisfied , and I do n't think he lost a vote in the crowd . " On the electioneering trail during that campaign summer he saw his old comrade in arms of the Black Hawk War , the attorney John T. Stuart of Springfield . Stuart had encouraged him before , and he did so again , to take up the study of law . The county surveyor had also supported his aspirations to overcome his lack of education and prepare seriously for a legal career . The candidate began to think that he might after all realize the ambition which so long ago as his boyhood had led him to try reading a copy of the statutes of Indiana . He was now hoping once more to be elected to a law- ? making body . It would be another step forward to find a living in the practice of law . On August fourth he was elected an assemblyman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to record that he received " the highest vote cast for any candidate . " The assemblyman took his seat as one of the fifty-five members of the House of Representatives on December first . Three days later he received an appointment to the Committee on Public Accounts and Expenditures . He began to learn something of the machinery of government , which seemed almost all a member could do in his first term . " At this session . " observed a friend , the new assemblyman " was anything but conspicuous . " When the Assembly ad. journed on February 13,1835 , he returned to New Salem and his duties as postmaster and deputy surveyor . But he brought with him now a resolve to pursue his dearest ambition . If you are resolutely determined to make a lawyer of yourself , the thing is more than half-done already .... The stage fare from New Salem to Springfield was a dollar and a half . The assemblyman rode in a farmer 's wagon or walked to Springfield to borrow law-books from Attorney Stuart . He went more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a copy of Blackstone 's Commentaries on the Laws of England . Back home it was now the law books  --  Chitty or Blackstone  --  which he took everywhere with him . The neighbors saw him and remembered how he studied wherever he could ? " in some nook in a store , " or at " the foot of a haystack , " or " sometimes lying on his back . putting his feet up the tree . . . . " They were used to him and let him be , though to an occasional observer he was a sight . Russell Godbey , the farmer for whom he did odd jobs , found him one day sitting barefoot at the top of a woodpile with a book . It might seem a curious thing for a farm hand to be doing , and the farmer asked , " What are you reading ? " " I am not reading . " replied the farm hand . " I am studying . " " Studying what ? " " Law , sir , " said the farm hand with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , as he looked at the law student , " sitting there proud as Cicero . " Going on his way , " Great God Almighty ! " exploded Mr. Godbey . During the summer of 1835 , at her father 's farm northeast of New Salem , after an illness of six weeks , young Anne Rutledge died . The law student knew her well , as he knew all her family . She was the third of nine children , and as a boarder at her father 's New Salem tavern in 1832 he had often seen her . She was vivacious and pretty , with auburn hair and blue eyes . At quilting bees she was faster than anyone with her needle , and in the other household arts she was accomplished . She would make someone a good wife . In 1832 she became engaged to a prosperous young farmer and storekeeper who went east to arrange his affairs , with a promise to return and marry Miss Rutledge . Time passed while his letters dwindled and finally ceased . She grieved . The law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might be ready to fall in love . A few became sure for all their lives that he courted her and that she was prepared to accept him . She hesitated , but at last wrote to break her engagement . No answer came . Torn between desires , she fell ill and within a few weeks was dying of fever . One of her brothers said she kept asking for the law student , and at the last she was allowed to be alone with him . A few days later - she lost consciousness and on August twenty-fifth she died . They buried her in Concord graveyard . New Salem sorrowed for Anne . Some said long afterward that the law student sorrowed more than anyone else  --  that once again they feared for his reason . His inclination to occasional low spirits seemed to be increased by her death . " Woefully abstracted , " said a friend . the law student would range along the river and into the woods . Neighbors kept an eye on him , especially on " damp , stormy days , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a depression of spirits as to induce him to take his own life . " It was one thing to be given " the hypo , " as he called it , by fugitive annoyances ; quite another to be lost to the whole daily world . Finally he was persuaded to stay for a few weeks with the jolly justice of the peace , Judge Bowling Green , beyond the little hills north of New Salem . Judge Green loved to laugh with all his 300 pounds . The shape of his belly earned him the nickname of " Pot . " He was good for the law student . The ordinary matters of life proceeded . The law student tended the post office , though someone complained that he neglected his duties at this time . He studied . He surveyed a ten-acre lot of timber . On December 7 , 1835 , he was counted present at the opening of a special session of the Assembly in Vandalia . On March 24 , 1836 , his name was entered on the record of the Sangamon Circuit Court as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of three steps leading to the license to practice law . The law student was coming back to himself . Throughout the spring he was active as deputy surveyor , but in May he lost his other position when the post office of New Salem was discontinued by the Government . The village had ceased to grow  --  it had even begun to decline . Families moved away . A number of them founded the town of Petersburg , which the deputy surveyor had laid out in February . Perhaps the future lay elsewhere . In early summer an old excitement came back in the air , for it was again a campaign year , and the assemblyman announced his stand for re-election on June thirteenth . From July fourth , when the campaign opened at Petersburg , to the thirtieth , when it ended at Springfield two days before the election , the candidate toured the district , supporting the Whig position . On July twenty-ninth he spoke at the farm of Isaac Spear , six miles southeast of Springfield , where the campaign would wind up . Moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Forquer , who was running against him . On top of the house  --  it was regarded as the finest house in Springfield  --  he saw , for the first time , a lightning rod . What a contraption . He never saw the like . It led him to speculate about electrical conduction . It gave him thoughts about the owner . George Forquer had until recently been a Whig himself , but now he was running as a Democrat , and what was more , as a new Democrat who had been given the post of register of the land office at a fine salary-53000 a year . No wonder he could build a new frame house with a lightning rod on top . It was enough to give a man the hypo . The New Salem candidate rode on to Springfield . There the next day he took his turn and made his speech . He was the last . When he was done , the crowd began to go . Democratic Land Office Register George Forquer rose to detain the crowd , and they turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of his opponent , who had just spoken , he must say that " the young man would have to be taken down . " The Democrat , as an elderly and prominent man , had much to say , and he said it at length , and with every air of superiority . The New Salem candidate stood aside listening intently and with growing excitement . His chance for re- 73 buttal came , and he took the platform again , made another speech and ended with this : " Mr. Forquer commenced his speech by announcing that the young man would have to be taken down . It is for you , citizens , not for me to say whether I am up or down . The gentleman has seen fit to allude to my being a young man ; but he forgets that I am older in years than I am in the tricks and trades of politicians . 1 desire to live , and I desire place and distinction ; but I would rather die now than , like the gentleman , live to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth three thousand dollars a year , and then feel compelled to erect a lightning rod to protect a guilty conscience from an offended God . " " Wonderful , " said a witness , the effect of this reply was wonderful , something he would never forget . The public was captivated by it . Two days later , on August first , the young man from New Salem  --  he was twenty-seven  --  was reelected by the highest vole out of the field of seventeen candidates . On December fifth , then , he was present when the Tenth General Assembly of Illinois met in Vandalia . He came there with his desired goal more clearly in sight , for on September ninth he had applied for a license to practice law in all the courts of the state , and this had been granted to him on the same day . It was the second official step which would lead him to the work he wanted . Only one more remained . In his current term , as in his previous one , the assemblyman met with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the concerns and the natures of the men and women whose lives they sought to govern for the better . The assemblyman took part in the vote on such matters as the works of human justice and dignity which appeared in bills on the establishment of circuit courts , and on the powers of justices of the peace , and on legislative procedures , and on the delineation of voting districts and precincts . With his fellow members he voted on the election of the United States Senator . He considered as a committee member the problems inseparable from the disposition of public moneys , and with scarcely a half-cent piece in his pocket , he voted on questions of taxation , of banking and of incorporation of insurance companies and railroads . The Assembly was much occupied with the development of travel and the needs of people coming and going . He considered and helped to decide upon proposals dealing with public roads , toll bridges , canals and river navigation . Education was public business , and the assemblyman worked on schools in general and schools for orphans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homely life of work , household and sustenance . He was on the record of legislation covering cattle marks and brands , the regulation of mills and millers , the killing of wolves and the determination of bounties therefor , and  --  an act which reflected with intimacy and compassion the poverty , the need and the terms of the farmer 's life  --  a bill to declare exempt from legal attachment one work horse or a yoke of oxen , so that daily work might continue . The Assembly took account of human trouble , and the assemblyman acted with his associates on bills looking to the relief of debtors , and bills against gaming , and bills regulating the penitentiary . It was a broad experience of man and man 's ways of constantly reshaping himself as a social being . In his first term the assemblyman had been " silent , observant , studious : ' as a contemporary said . In the new term he was , of those his own age and length of service , " the smartest parliamentarian and cunningest ' logroller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second term to secure the removal of the state capital from Vandalia . Many towns were after the prize , but Springfield was the leader . The assemblyman led the fight , and on the last day of February , 1837 , he saw the bill he backed win the approval of the majority . On March first he saw another achievement when in the office of the clerk of the Supreme Court of Illinois his name was entered upon the roll of attorneys as a member of the State Bar . It was the third and final qualification toward which he had worked . Before the term was over , the assemblyman , with Dan Stone , his fellow townsman , filed dissent from a resolution adopted by the House . The House resolution went on record against the abolition of slavery . The Sangamo assemblyman and his colleague made a joint statement saying that " the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy . " In the temper of the time , however , they added that " the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moral act , the assemblyman was ready for the adjournment of the House on March sixth . During this term his self-image found words ; for he told Joshua Fry Speed of Springfield that he aimed  --  it could only be the pinnacle of fame  --  he aimed at the " great distinction " of being known as " the DeWitt Clinton of Illinois . " Joshua Speed could be excused if he smiled kindly at the hope of anyone to match such art illustrious citizen . On March seventh and eighth the assemblyman , in his short claw-hammer coat and his hiked-up pantaloons , made his way home to New Salem . He brought with him a new resolve . It would not be long until he should make it known . New Salem had been his school , his academy , his college . There he had learned how to use language correctly and beautifully ; how to speak and debate in public ; how to study ; how to plan towns ; how to write laws by reading law ; how to live amidst people and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There it was he had left the forest and the river , which had also taught him much , and had found the world . Like all others , he had to find out where to look for it , but it was there to be seen , if he would look , in a hamlet in a wood above a river . In all his young life he had worked to overcome disadvantages , and as they enlarged , so did he , in spirit , patience and strength , among his neighbors of New Salem . They had suffered him when he suffered , and laughed for him when he reached for their funny bones , and allowed him his hopes , and voted for him when he asked them to . As he was , so had New Salem helped to make him , On April twelfth the Springfield paper carried an announcement that the assemblyman  --  once a flatboatman , a store clerk , a militia captain , a candidate , a postmaster , a deputy surveyor , a law student , and now a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " practice conjointly in the courts of this Judicial Circuit Office No. 4 Hoffman 's Row upstairs . " The resolve made , it was time to go . On April 15 , 1837 , he borrowed from Judge Bowling Green a small pony with a worn-out saddle . In the saddle bags he put his copy of Blackstone , a copy of the compiled laws of Illinois for 1833 , three volumes of session laws , two small mis-cellaneous books and ' some underclothes . When he mounted the pony , his long legs nearly reached the ground . His fortune consisted of about seven dollars in his pocket . A friend declared that " superficially he seemed like a farm hand in search of employment . " So it was he rode off to Springfield , leaving New Salem , which , in two years , like the store he had once owned with William Berry , would " wink out . " The new attorney and counselor at law from New Salem rode into Spring . field on April fifteenth and went to the only cabinetmaker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the store of Joshua Speed . He tied his pony and unsaddled it and went in , hauling the saddlebags , which he threw on the counter . What , he asked , would the mattress and bedding for a single bedstead cost ? Joshua Speed took his slate and pencil and worked out some figures . The total , he stated , would conic to seventeen dollars . " It is probably cheap enough , " said the attorney , " but I want to say that , cheap as it is , 1 have not the money to pay . " They looked at each other . " But , " he continued , " if you will credit me until Christmas , and my experiment here as a lawyer is a success , I will pay you then . " The tone of his voice , thought Speed , was so melancholy that he felt for him . The attorney said , I fail in that I will probably never pay you at all . " Speed looked at him and said to himself that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . He said to him , " So small a debt seems to affect you so deeply , 1 think I can suggest a plan by which you will be able to attain your end without incurring any debt . I have a very large room and a very large double bed in it , which you are perfectly welcome to share with me if you choose . " " Where is your room ? " asked the attorney . Speed pointed to the stairs leading from the store to his room . " Upstairs , " he said . The attorney said nothing , threw his saddlebags over his arm , went upstairs and set them on the floor , and at once returned . Speed said his face was " beaming with pleasure and smiles . " " Well , Speed , " he exclaimed , " I 'm moved . " The satisfaction of this youthful attainment of a momentous stage could not last . But for now  --  while still lost in the inexorable future were the circuit and the Congress and the White House and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart  --  it was enough For the former citizen of New Salem ,
