txt The Democratic National Convention , unsettled by a brushfire ? movement to draft Senator Edward M. Kennedy for President , plunged into fights on its rules and on the seating of disputed delegations soon after it opened last night . By voice vote , it eliminated enforcement of the unit rule , over the objections of the Texas delegation , which was supported.by Vice President Humphrey . While two contending Georgia delegations disrupted the proceedings in a dispute over who would physically occupy the state 's , seats the floor last night ? the convention decided by an overwhelming roll-call vote to settle all credentials questions right away . Then , by a much closer rollcall. of 1,368 to 955 , the delegates upheld . the Texas delegatiop against a challenge based on charges that Negroes and Mexican-Americans were inadequately represented on it . The two votes constituted something of a test of strength between Mr. Humphrey and those opposing him , and suggested that the Vice President 's supporters were in control of the convention , but none too firmly . Rough Convention Likely All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas to say : " This is going to be the roughest convention in years . " The convention adjourned in turmoil at 2:40 A.M. after rejecting , by 1,0411/2 to 1,413 , a move to unseat the regular Democratic delegation of Georgia . Just before the delegates made their way through the Chicago ghetto and heavy police security to the International Amphitheatre , a spokesman for Senator Kennedy said in Washington yesterday that the Senator had asked that his name not be placed in nomination . But the draft movement , with something of a base in the California delegation , which was once committed to Robert F. Kennedy , was being borne along The Mayor got down to the main issue right away , " as long as I am Mayor of this city , " he declared , " there 's going to be law and order in Chicago . " Once the opening preliminaries and the keynote speech were out of the way , the convention proceeded by voice vote to eliminate enforcement of the so-called unit rule , an action strenuously opposed by the Texas delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . under the unit rule . All three major Presidential candidates had been thought to support the elimination of the unit rule under which a delegation may be obliged to vote as a unit . But Tom Gordon , a delegate from Abilene , Tex. , making the main argument for his state , tsaid that Mr. Humphrey told him this afternoon that he thought the unit rule should not be abolished until the convention in 1972 . This was bound to be interpreted as having something to do with Gov . Connally 's close personal and political relationship with President Johnson . The Texas delegation , angered by the unit rule development and by a challenge to its credentials , has been the source of several reports that it might place the President in nomination . This could be a serious threat to Mr. Humphrey 's candidacy . The Texas position was that the elimination of the unit rule at this late stage would be unfair to the states that had already adopted it in good faith . He said Texas had no objection to abolishing the rule for 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insurgent Georgia delegation led by Julian Bond appeared on the floor , after having been initially barred . The insurgents got a big hand from the generally friendly delegates . Later on , convention officials decided to go ahead with floor debate on the seating of several disputes and challenged delegations . This angered several delegations supporting Mr. and Mr. McCarthy , since the debate originally was scheduled for tomorrow . They contended they had not had time to prepare properly . Supporters of both Senators had hoped to use the seating here on a tide of gloom over the prospects of the front-runner , Vice President Humphrey , in the general election this fall . The Kennedy statement probably will not quell it altogether , particularly since the nationwide Harris poll , scheduled for publication tomorrow , gives the Republican candidate , Richard M. Nixon , a 2-to-1 lead over Mr. Humphrey . Some sources here thought there was a possibility that Senator Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota , the Vice President 's leading opponent , might ultimately throw his support to Mr. Kennedy . Mr. Humphrey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Kennedy would be drafted . When asked if the movement might really be aimed at drafting the Senator for Vice President , Mr. Humphrey said that Mr. Kennedy had already rejected that office , but added : " He may change his mind . " Mr. Kennedy would " add great strength to any ticket , " Mr. Humphrey said : Former Gov . Michael V. DiSalle of Ohio , who talked to Mr. Kennedy by telephone in the afternoon , told a news conference that he had told the 36-year-old junior Senator from Massachusetts that " the draft movement has gone too far to be stopped . " Mr. DiSalle had planned to put Mr. Kennedy 's name in nomination and the California delegation was prepared to yield its place to Ohio in the roll of the states to enable him to do it early . But Mr. DiSalle said he had agreed at Mr. Kennedy 's request not to act . Enlivened by Paradox He said he was positive someone else would nominate Mr. Kennedy and that he had " gained the impression " in the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push the drive but was available for " a genuine convention draft . " Mr. DiSalle later visited John J. Burns , the New York State Democratic Chairman , and told him that he expected Mr. McCarthy to drop out of the race after the first ballot . Jesse Unruh , leader of the California delegation and long associated with the Kennedy family , issued a statement saying that he did not regard Mr. Kennedy 's conversation with Mr. DiSalle as final . " I would guess , " he said , " that Senator Kennedy might take a careful look at the situation if enough support was evidenced for him . Certainly he could not be expected to fully appreciate the current situation in Chicago from 1,500 miles away in Hyannis Port , Mass . . " Mr. Unruh is widely regarded as the spearhead of the draft movement , although he refused to commit himself to it at a news conference . " I am not given to efforts that are fruitless , " he said . But he added that he believed Mr. Kennedy 's " nomination could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All day , reports of the Kennedy draft movement enlivened a convention in the paradoxical position of seeming to be ready to nominate a candidate many delegates believed can not win . Few were willing to predict that the convention would turn to Mr. Kennedy in preference to Mr. Humphrey or the other formal candidates , Senator McCarthy , Senator George S. of South Dakota and Gov . Lester G. Maddox of Georgia . But the divisions that afflict the convention , and hence the candidacy of Mr. Humphrey , were heightened by the report of the platform committee , which gave its approval to a plank on Vietnam that reflected the views of President Johnson . This action made it certain that the McCarthy-qzmcq#Govern forces would offer a floor fight for their own " peace plank " on Vietnam . The Humphrey camp has made it clear that the Vice President will support the platform committee in the debate scheduled for tomorrow night . As a result of the committee draft , Mr. McCarthy said , the lines are " now clearly drawn between those who want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to change our course in Vietnam . " " The convention as a whole will decide , " he added . " There is little escape from the conclusion that Secretary of State Dean Rusk has won this stage of the platform fight , " Mr. McCarthy said in a statement that accused Mr. Humphrey of asking the party to accept four more years of the Johnson Administration 's policies . The first convention session heard an unusually candid keynote speech by Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii , a onearmed veteran of Japanese ancestry , who dwelt at length on the problems of the war and of violence in American cities . Mr. Inouye did not turn to the glories of the Democratic party and the Johnson Administration until the last three pages of a 13-page speech . Mr. Inouye threaded a cautious course on Vietnam , calling it an " immoral war " but adding that so were all wars , and raising the question whether it would not be " more immoral ? if there be such a degree ? to fracture our commitments and then see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but by our enemies ? " The war has to be ended by negotiation but ended " responsibly , " he said . On domestic questions , Mr. Inouye struck out more boldly . Violence in the cities , the plight of the Negro , unrest among young people  --  all these , he said , threaten " a loss of faith in our country , its purposes and its institutions . " The Hawaiian Senator said that " poverty , discrimination and deprivation , as evil as they lam , do not justify violence and anarchy , do not justify looting or burning , do not justify murder or assassination . " On the other hand , he said , " the evil face of racism " could hide behind " the mask of law and order , " and " in the last analysis law and order can only rest securely with justice as its foundation . " Only after thus discussing the nation 's ills , in terms somewhat unusual for the keynoter of a party in power , did , Mr. Inouye deliver the expected praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was declaiming that it was not because the Democrats had done so well that they should be retained in office but because they were " the party of change and challenge , " not because all was well but because " today 's crisis is one of the human spirit " and the Democrats were the party that gave " priority to the needs of human beings . " The opening session was also addressed by Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago , a major figure in the draft Kennedy speculation because of his delegation 's refusal to commit itself to any candidate ; Gov . Samuel H. Shapiro of Illinois ; the party 's national chairman , John M. Bailey , and others . Mayor Daley 's appearance to welcome the delegates to Chicago got the convention off to an unruly start . In defiance of the Democrats ' new rule barring floor demonstrations , the Illinois delegation brought in a small band , raised a host of signs demanding " Daley for President " and paraded for several minutes in front of the podium . disputes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own support . They believed that moving up the time of the debate had been designed by pro-Humphrey convention officials to thwart this purpose . The roll-call was not , however , a precise reflection of the strengths of the pro and antiHumphrey forces . For instance , Massachusetts largely voted against the delaying move , although it is committed to Mr. McCarthy on the first ballot . Illinois , uncommitted on the Presidential candidates , voted unanimously to hold the debate immediately ? at least partly because Governor Shapiro , the Ichairman of the Rules Cornmittee , was sponsoring the changed schedule . Nevertheless , the final vote ? 1,691% to 832 ? reflected no threat to Mr. Humphrey 's position and to some extent reenforced his position as the front runner here . It was a busy day for the three major candidates . Mr. , who is regarded by many delegates as a " holding " candidate for those who once supported Robert Kennedy , told several delegations he visited he was not a " stalking horse " but a serious candidate . He also attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passive President " and one not equipped to deal with the domestic crisis , and said that Mr. Humphrey would lose next fall . Mr. Humphrey , campaigning hard enough to make himself look worried , acknowledged the pessimism about his chances by comparing himself before venous delegations to Harry S. Truman , the underdog who emerged triumphant in 1948 . In an interview on the " Today " television program , Mr. Humphrey also repeated his strong defense of President Johnson 's Vietnam policy . His spokesmen continued to claim enough votes for a firstballot nomination and claimed to have received more votes than expected in a poll of the Pennsylvania delegation . Mr. Humphrey also made an important gain when Senator George A. Smathers of Florida ended his favorite-son candidacy and released the state 's 63 delegates  --  more than 50 of whom are expected to vote for the Vice President . Mr. Smathers said this ought to make Mr. Humphrey grateful to Florida and said he would be willing to be Secretary of the Treasury , if asked . Mr. McCarthy met with Mr. Unruh in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the draft Kennedy movement . But neither man said anything about such a possibility . The draft movement , bruited about among delegates and reporters at every bar , restaurant and gathering place in town since last week , began to take on a more formal shape today when " draft Ted " stickers appeared and Senator Phillip A. Hart of Michigan seemed to give it endorsement . Just after midnight Sunday , following a caucus of the Michigan delegation , Senator Hart said he regarded Edward Kennedy as " the most electable " Democrat . This was widely interpreted as an endorsement . Labor union men in the Michigan delegation were angered and threatened to poll the 96-man delegation to disclose their control of about 70 of its votes for Mr. Humphrey . So Mr. Hart went before the delegation in the morning to deny that he had endorsed anyone and to say that he was " operating on the assumption " that Mr. Kennedy was not available anyway . Draft-Kennedy strength surfaced during the day in the Colorado and Iowa delegations . Gov . Harold E. Hughes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a speech by Mr. Kennedy last week that he would accept " an honest draft . " Open to a Change Daniel Gaby , leader of the 21 McCarthy supporters in the New Jersey delegation , said that Mr. Kennedy would be " an excellent candidate " and that his group " would be very open minded about this . " The situation in California apparently is that only about 120 of the 174 delegates are , committed to Mr. McCarthy , Mr. and Mr. Humphrey . The others , apparently including Mr. Unruh , are stil ? " looking for a candidate . " Two other major states , Illinois and Ohio , are in position to give the draft strong impetus . Neither committed itself in caucuses yesterday and today . Mayor Daley could swing Illinois almost anywhere he chose , and Ohio is reported to harbor substantial Kennedy sentiment just under the surface . The draft plan is sure to encounter Southern opposition , although Georgia  --  hitter at Mr. Humphrey as a result of the credentials dispute ? was reported in a mood to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
