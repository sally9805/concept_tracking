txt Washington Ask former United States Ambassador to Indonesia Howard P. Jones about United States-Indonesian relations today , and he likens them to an elevator . Over the last six months , only the " down " button has worked . But recently the elevator has steadied . Today it may even be edging upward again . Mr. Jones , whose ready smile and easy manner helped him stay on the best of personal terms with President Sukarno during his seven-year term , is in Washington for a few days before leaving for Honolulu . There he is to become chancellor of the East-West Center at the University of Hawaii . Preparing to replace him in Jakarta is Marshall Green , State Department veteran and former Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs . Gazing at a wall map of Southeast Asia in a borrowed office in the State Department , Mr. Jones said President Sukarno had been angered over the United States decision to give military aid to his archenemy , Malaysia . Small amount of aid No actual aid has been given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaysia have $4 million worth of aid . President Sukarno has interpreted this as meaning that the United States now is actively hostile to Indonesia in its confrontation with Malaysia . In fact , Mr. Jones said , the amount was infinitesimal compared with the total military budget of Malaysia . Washington officials say that the IndoAssociated Press Howard P. Jones Indonesia : ' a period of less strain ' nesian Communist Party ? the PKI ? has convinced Mr. Sukarno that the Central Intelligence Agency is plotting against him . However , Mr. Jones pointed out , the picture was not all bad . Last April , relations had improved to the point where President Johnson could send veteran diplomat Ellsworth Bunker to Jakarta as his special representative for talks . The joint communiciu ? issued after the talks referred to the " general pattern of friendship " between nations " which had existed for so many years .. . . " But other observer 's consider the Bunker visit a fiasco . They point out , for example , // // that no Indonesian official saw Mr. Bunker off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direct insult to President Johnson 's personal representative . Mr. Jones said that he personally had , appealed to President Sukarno to stop the mob attacks on the ' United States embassy ; Mr. Sukarno had made a speech disapproving violent demonstrations , and the attacks had stopped . Also , Mr. Sukarno continued to agree to programs by which several United States universities train Indonesians as teachers and professors . The universities send their own staff Members ' to Indonesia until the training is completed . Skillful tactics " In short , " Mr. Jones said , , " we seem to have entered a period of less strain . " Underlying his remarks was the hope that Ambassador Green would find a relatively calm atmosphere when he arrived to take up his new duties . Mr. Green goes to Indonesia at a time when officials here are watching developments closely in Southeast Asia . Officials note ' that the PKI success in convincing President Sukarno that the United States had turned against him on Malaysia is a continuation of skillfully chosen tactics . The PKI always tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can expect considerable popular backing in the country . The Communists have every interest in keeping the Malaysian dispute flaring . As long as they do so , Mr. Sukarno must include them under the umbrella of " national unity " so that he can fight the war . This leaves the PKI free to sow discord while publicly echoing his unity plea . Despite some optimism , some officials are , still worried at the long-term relationship between the United States and Indonesia . They note that United States foreign aid now is virtually suspended . President Sukarno still sees the world as divided between the " have " and the " hive-not " nations , rather than Communist and non-Communist powers . UN findings On this , he has not changed his essential position since the 1920 's . Malaysia , he believes , is simply a puppet whose strings are pulled by colonialist Britain . His answer has been to prevent the pdople of Borneo , Sarawak and Brunei ( who , together with Malaya and Singapore , make up the Malaysian Federation ) from ? as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their will . Malaysia was proclaimed on Sept. 16 , 1963 . A United Nations commission visited Borneo and Sarawak in late August . It announced in early September that the people there wanted to join the federation . Mr. Sukarno scoffed , saying it would take the commission much longer than a few weeks to conduct a proper study . He also was annoyed because Malaya announced on Aug. 29 that the federation would come into being on Sept. 16 regardless of the UN findings . Some Western diplomats concede that , as he saw it , he was not wholly unjustified in his anger . President Sukarno 's strategy includes trying for leadership of the powers in his area . His latest effort is to try to set up an organization called Conefo , or Council of Emerging Forces  --  possibly as a rival to the UN . Potential members Work is beginning on a mammoth complex of buildings in Jakarta , designed to be Conefo 's headquarters . So far Communist China has indicated support for the idea . North Korea , North Vietnam , Cambodia , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the UN , but other Afro-Asian states depend on the marble-and-glass building in New York to keep up contacts with the rest of the world . Officials here are also watching the events in Algiers , where the crucial Afro-Asian conference is set down for June 29 . The conference still may be postponed . Many moderate countries  --  including 13 British Commonwealth nations ? want a postponement until the implications of the coup against Ahmed ben Bela are better known . Indonesia , one of the original sponsors of of the conference , has been fighting strongly to keep Malaysia out . The Algiers coup gives it an excuse to urge a postponement if it can not prevent Malaysia from being voted in . There is little doubt , officials say , that a majority of nations would prefer to see Malaysia in . Before the coup , Indonesia might have staged a dramatic walkout rather than let Malaysia enter . Now it has another tool to use . Indonesia 's success or failure in winning friends and influencing people at Algiers will give Washington significant clues for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
