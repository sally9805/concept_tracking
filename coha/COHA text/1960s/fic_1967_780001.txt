 | " You 're the boss , Barney . Just a suggestion . But what about the love interest ? " " Work her in early , you know how to do it . " " That role is made for me , Barney darling , " the voice whispered in his ear as warm arms wrapped him and he began to drown in a sea of resilient flesh . " Do n't let him sweet-talk you , Slithey , " he heard a muffled voice say . " Barney Hendrickson is my buddy , indeed my old buddy , but a mighty good businessman to boot , shrewd , so no matter what you promise him , I 'm sorry to have to say this , I got ta look closely at all contracts before we sign . " " Ivan , " Barney said , struggling free of the perfumed octopoid embrace , " just take your client aside for a moment then I 'll be with you . I do n't know if we can do business , but at least we can talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lank hair , hawk nose and rumpled , dandruff-speckled suit made him look like a crooked agent , was a crooked agent . He could smell a deal ten miles upwind in a hailstornl and always carried sixteen fountain pens that he filled ritually each morning before leaving for the office . " Sit over here , baby , " he said , levering Slithey toward the corner with a long-practiced motion . Since she was n't stuffed with greenbacks he was immune to her charms . " Barney Hendrickson is a man good as his word , even better . " The phone rang just as Jens Lyn came in waving the contract . " Ottar can not sign this , " he said . " It is in English . " " Well translate it , you 're the technical adviser . Hold on . " He picked up the phone . " I could translate it , it would be extremely difficult but possible , but what would be the point ? He can not read . " " Just hold on , Lyn . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Of course I saw the estimate , I made it myself . No , you do n't have to ask me where I 'm getting the LSD . . .

The impossible may take a while , but we do it , you know the routine . . . What ? . . . On the phone ? Sam , be reason-  | able . I 've got three rings of Barnum and Bailey in the office right now , this is n't the time to go into details . . . Brush-off ? Me ? Never ! . . . Yes , by all means , ask him . L.M. has been in on this picture from the beginning , every step of the way , and you 'll find that he 'll back me up in my own footsteps every step of the way ... Right . . . And the same to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Charley Chang said , " She could be captured in the raid , in the opening , she could fight with him with true hatred , but hatred would , in spite of itself , turn to love . " " I 've never been captured in a raid before , " Slithey husked from t h e corner . " A good idea , Charley , " Barney agreed . " And even if he could read  --  he can not write , " Lyn said . " We 've had that problem with foreign actors more than once , " Barney told him . " Staple the true translation to the contract , have it notarized as a true translation by a bilingual notary , have the party of the second part make his mark and affix his thumb print on each document , both witnessed by two impartial witnesses , and it will stand up in any court in the world . " " There may be some difficulty in locating a bilingual EnglishOld Norse notary ? " " Ask casting , they can find anyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his secretary said , coming in through the open door and placing a bottle of Benzedrine tablets before him on the desk . " Too late , " Barney whispered , staring at them , unmoving . " Too late . " The telephone and the intercom sounded at the same moment and he groped out two of the pills and washed them down with the cold , black , cardboardy coffee . " Hendrickson here , " he said flipping the key . " Barney , I would like to see you in my office at once , " L.M. 's voice said . Betty had answered the phone . " That was L.M. Greenspan 's secretary , " she said . " L.M. would like to see you in his office at once .  | " I get the message . " His thigh muscles hurt when he stood up and he wondered how long it would take for the bennies to show some effect . " Stay with it , Charley , I 'll want a synopsis , a couple of sheets , as soon as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand darted toward his lapel , but he moved away from it with reflex efficiency . " Stick around , Ivan , I 'll want to talk to you after I see L.M. " The chorus of voices was cut off as he closed the door behind him . " Lend me your towel , will you , Betty , " he asked . She took the towel from the bottom drawer of her desk and he draped it around his shoulders , tucking it carefully inside the collar of his shirt . Then he bent and placed his head under the faucet of the water cooler and gasped when Betty turned it on . He let the icy stream run over his head and the back of his neck for a few moments , then straightened up and dried himself off . Betty lent him her comb . He felt weaker but better , and when he looked in the mirror he looked almost human . Almost . " Lock the door behind you , " L.M. said when Barney came into the office , then grunted as he bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle-nose wire cutters . " Are there any more , Sam ? " " That 's the last one , " Sam said in his gray , colorless voice . Sam was pretty much of a gray , colorless man , which was assuredly protective coloration since he was L.M. 's own personal , private accountant and was reputed to be a world authority on corporative finance and tax evasion . He clutched a folder of papers protectively to his chest and flicked his eyes toward L.M. " That is no longer necessary , " he said . " Maybe , maybe , " L.M. said , puffing as he fell into his chair . " But if I even say the word bank when the wires are n't cut my heart gives palpitations . I got not so good news for you , Barney . " He bit off the end of a cigar . " We 're ruined . " " What do you mean ? " Barney looked back and forth from one expressionless face to the other . " Is this some kind of gag ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that Climactic Studios will soon be bankrupt . "  | " On the rocks , the work of a lifetime , " L.M. said in a hollow voice . Sam nodded once , as mechanically as a ventriloquist 's dummy , and said , " That is , roughly , the situation . Normally it would be at least three more months before our financial report would be sent to the banks , who , as you know , own the controlling percentage of this corporation . However , for some reason unknown to us , they are sending their accountants to examine the books this week . " " And . . . ? " Barney asked , feeling suddenly lightheaded . The silence lengthened unbearably until hC jumped to his feet and began to pace the room . " And they 'll find the company is on the rocks , and that all the profits are on paper " ? he turned and pointed dramatically to L.M. ? " and that all the hard cash has been bled off into the untaxable L.M. Greenspan Foundation . No wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drain , but L.M. Greenspan goes marching on . " " Watch it ! That 's no way for an employee to talk to the man who gave him his first break ? " " And his last one too  --  right here ! " Barney said , and chopped himself on the neck with the edge of his hand , much harder than he had planned . " Listen , L.M. , " he pleaded , rubbing the sore spot , " until the ax falls we still have a chance . You must have thought there was the possibility of a salvage operation or you would n't have got involved in this deal with Professor Hewett and his machine . You must have felt that a big box-office success would get the pressure off , make the firm solvent again . We can still do it . " L.M. shook his head morosely . " Do n't think it does n't hurt to shake hands with the knife that stabs you in the back , but what else can I do ? A big box-office hit , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could laugh at the teeth of the banks . But you ca n't make a picture in a week . " You ca n't make a picture in a week ! The words hissed and sizzled through the caffeine-clogged , Benzedrine-loaded channels of Barney 's brain , levering up a reluctant memory . " L.M. , " he said dramatically . " You 're going to have a heart attack . " " Bite your tongue ! " L.M. gasped , and clutched a roll of fat  | roughly near that vital organ . " Do n't say that . One coronary 's enough to last a lifetime . " " Listen to this . You go home with Sam to work on the books tonight , you take them with you . You get sick . It could be indigestion , it could be a coronary . Your doctor says it could be a coronary . The fees you 've been paying him he should deliver at least that one small favor . Everyone runs around and shouts for a few days and the books are forgotten about and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the books until Monday , maybe Tuesday . " " Monday , " Sam said firmly . " You do n't know banks . No books on Monday and they 'll have a hired car full of doctors over to the house . " " All right , Monday then . That will be time enough . " " So Monday  --  but what difference does it make ? Frankly , I 'm puzzled , " L.M. said , and knitted his brow and looked puzzled . " It makes this difference , L.M. On Monday I will bring you the new picture in the can . A picture that will have to gross two , three million on length , width of screen and color alone . " " But you ca n't ! " " But we can . You 're forgetting about the vremeatron . This gadget works . Remember last night when you thought we had all gone for about ten minutes ? " L.M. nodded reluctantly . " That was how long we were gone from here and now . But we were an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again . Take the company and everything we need back there to shoot the picture , and use just as much time as we need to do it right before we came back . " You mean . . . ? " " Correct . When we come back with the film in the can we need only have been gone ten minutes as far as you 're concerned . " " Why did n't they ever think of this before ? " L.M. gasped with happy appreciation . For a lot of reasons . . . " " Do you mean to tell me . . . " Sam leaned so far forward in his chair that he was almost out of it , and the hint of some expression , perhaps a smile ? , touched his face . " Do you mean that we will have to pay production costs for just ten minutes ? "  | " I do not mean that , " Barney snapped . " I can tell you in advance that there are going to be some headaches for bookkeeping . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can shoot on location  --  with more extras  --  for about one-tenth the cost of filming in Spain . " Sam 's eyes glittered . " I do n't know the details of this project , L.M. , but some of the factors make very good sense . " " Can you do it , Barney ? Pull this thing off ? " " I can do it if you give me all the help I ask for and no questions . This is Tuesday . I see no reason why we ca n't have everything we need sewn up by Saturday . " He counted off on his fingers . " We 'll have to get the contracts signed with the principals , get enough raw film to last for all the shooting , the technicians , at least two extra cameras . . . " He began to mumble to himself as he ran through all they might possibly need . " Yes , " he said finally , " we can do it . " Still , I do n't know , " L.M. said pensively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teetered on the balance and Barney groped despertcly for inspiration . " Just one more thing , " he said . " If we 're on location for , say , six months , everyone has to be paid six months ' salary . But if we rent the cameras and sound equipment , all of the expensive hardware , we will only have to pay for a few days rental fees for them . " " Barney , " L.M. said , sitting up straight in his chair , " you 've got yourself a deal . "  | You have n't heard the last of Cinecitta yet , Mr. Hendrickson . " " Barney . " " Not yet , Barney , not by a long shot . The new realism came out if Italy after the war , then the kitchen-sink film that the British picked up . But you 'll see , Rome ai n't dead yet . Guys like me come over here to Hollywood for a bit , pick up some techniques ? " " Pick up some loot. " " ... ca n't deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But ou know , you 're not going to get much on color this time of day . " Ic swung the 8-mm Bolex that hung on a thong from his wrist . I should have loaded this up with Tri-X . It 's five in the afternoon . " " Do n't worry , Gino , you 'll have plenty of light , take my word or that . " He looked up as the warehouse door opened and Amory 13lcstead came in . " Over here , Amory , " he said . " This is our cameraman , Gino Cappo . Amory Blestead , technical adviser . " " Pleased to meet you , " Amory said , shaking hands , " I always wondered how you got those repulsive effects in Autumn Love . " " You mean in Porco Mondo ? Those were n't effects , that 's just the ay that part of Yugoslavia looks . " " Christ ! " He turned to Barney . " Dallas told me to tell you they 'll be down with Ottar in about five minutes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his machine up . " Barney climbed painfully into the back of the army truck and dropped onto the boxes . He had managed to grab about an hour 's sleep on the couch in his office before another urgent message from L.M. had dragged him awake and up to L.M. 's office for an extended wrangle over budgeting . The pace was beginning to tell . " I have recalibrated all my instruments , " Professor Hewett said ,  | tapping happily on a dial face , " so that now I can guarantee the utmost precision temporally and geographically in all future time transports . " " Wonderful . See if you can recalibrate us to arrive just after our last trip , close to the same time , the same day . The light was good ? " The door crashed open , and loud , guttural singing filled the warehouse . Ottar stumbled in with Jens Lyn and Dallas Levy each clutching one of his arms , holding him up rather than restraining him , since he was obviously roaring drunk . Tex Antonelli came behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all three of them to heave the Viking up into the truck , where he passed out , mumbling happily to himself . They piled the boxes in around him . " What 's all this ? " Barney asked . " Trade goods , " Lyn said , pushing a crate labeled JACK DANIELS in over the tailgate . " Ottar signed the contract . I was very surprised to discover an Icelandic notary public here ? " " You can find anything in Hollywood . " " And Ottar agreed to study English once he was back in his own house . He has developed a decided taste for distilled beverages and we agreed on a payment of one bottle of whiskey a day for every day of study . " " Could n't you have fobbed him off with some rotgut ? " Barney asked as a second crate of Jack Daniels slid into the truck . " I can see myself trying to justify this on the gyp sheet . " " We did try , " Dallas said , shoving in a third case . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits , but it was no sale . He developed an educated palate early . Two months , five cases , that 's the bargain . " Jens Lyn climbed in and Barney admired his knee-high engineer 's boots , puttees , many-pocketed hunting jacket and sheath knife . " Why the Jungle Jim outfit ? " he asked . " A simple matter of survival and creature comfort , " Lyn said , making room for the sleeping bag and a packing crate that Dallas pushed up to him . " I have DDT for the body lice that are sure to abound , halazone tablets for the drinking water and a quantity of tinned food . The diet of the time is restricted , and I am sure un-  | wholesome to modern tastes . Therefore I have taken a few simple precautions . " " Fair enough , " Barney said . " Climb in and lock up the tailgate , let 's get rolling . " Though the vremeatron still whined and crackled with the same intensity , there was no longer the tension there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man took over and the voyage through time became just as commonplace as a ride in a high-speed elevator , a trip in a jet plane , a descent in a submarine or a blast-off in a rocket . Only Gino , the newcomer , showed some apprehension , darting rapid glances at the bank of electronic gadgetry and the sealed warehouse . But in the face of the others ' calm  --  Barney managed to doze off during the transition while Dallas and the Danish philologist quarreled over the opening of one of the whiskey bottles and the resultant loss thereby of a day 's English lessons  --  he relaxed a little . When the transition did occur he half rose , startled , but sat down again when the bottle was passed to him , though his eyes did widen considerably when the ice-blue sky appeared outside and the tang of salt spray filled the truck . " That 's a pretty good trick , " he said , pointing his light meter . " How 's it done ? " " For details you have to ask the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large a swallow of the whiskey . " Very complex . Something about moving through time . " " I get it , " Gino said , stopping his diaphragm down to 3.5 . " Something like the time zones when you fly from London to New York . The sun does n't seem to move and you arrive at the same time you took off . " " Something like that . " " Good light . We can get some good color with light like this . " " If you drive do n't drink , " Dallas said , leaning out to hand the bottle to Tex , who sat behind the wheel in the cab . " One slug and let 's get on the trail , pardner . " The starter whined the motor to life , and , looking out over the cab , Barney saw that they were following the tire tracks of another truck , clearly visible in the damp sand and gravel . Memory pushed  | up through the layers of fatigue and he hammered on the metal roof of the cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he shouted . They were coming to the rocky headland and the horn sounded as they swung around it . Barney stumbled over the crates and trod on the sleeping Viking as he rushed to the rear of the truck . There was the rising grumble of another engine as an identical army truck passed them , going in the opposite direction . Barney reached the open rear and clutched the bent-wood canvas support over his head . He had a quick glimpse of himself in the rear of the other truck , white-faced and wide-eyed and gaping like a moron . With a feeling of sadomasochistic pleasure he raised his open hand , thumb to nose , and wiggled his fingers at his shocked other self . The rock headland came in between them . " Get much traffic around here ? " Gino asked . Ottar sat up , rubbing his side , muttering something foul under his breath . Jens quieted him easily with a long drag from the bottle as they braked to a sliding stop in the loose gravel . " Primrose Cottage , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke still drifted down from the chimney hole of the squat , turf house , but there was no one in sight . Weapons and clumsy tools littered the ground . Ottar half fell , half jumped from the truck and bellowed something , then clutched at his head with instant regret . " Hvar erut Per rakka ? Komit ict ! " 1 He held his head again and looked around for the bottle , which Jens Lyn had wisely tucked out of sight . The servants began tremblingly to appear . " Let 's get moving , " Barney said . " Get these cases unloaded and ask Dr. Lyn where he wants them . Not you , Gino , I want you to come with me . " They climbed the low hill behind the house , pushing through the short , stubbly grass and almost tripping over a ragged and wildlooking sheep that went baaing down the hill away from them . From the top they had a clear view of the curving bay that swept away from them on both sides , and the vast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs ? Come out ! "  | long roller came in , breaking far up on the beach , then hissing away again through the pebbles . A grim-looking island with cliff sides that fell straight to the foaming ocean stood in the middle of the bay , and farther off , just a dark blur on the horizon , was another , lower island . " Pan right around in a circle , 36o degrees , so we can study it later . Zoom in for a close-up on that island . " " What about going inland a bit , take a look at the land there ? " Gino asked , squinting through the viewfinder . " Later , if there 's time . But this is going to be a sea picture and with all this free ocean I want to use it . " " Along the shore then , we should see what 's behind the point there . " " That 's all right  --  but do n't go alone . Take Tex or Dallas with you so you stay out of trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we can find you when we have to leave . " Barney glanced along the shore and noticed the rowboat ; he took Gino 's arm and pointed . " There 's an idea . Get Lyn to translate and have a couple of the locals row you offshore a bit . Give me some shots of the way this place looks coming in from the sea . . . " " Hey , " Tex said , pulling himself over the brow of the hill , " they want you down at the shack , Barney . Pow-wow of some kind . " ust in time , Tex . Stay with Gino here and keep an eye on him . " " I 'll stick to him like glue . Va buona , eh cumpa ' ? " Gino shot him a dark , suspicious look . " Vui sareste italiano ? " Tex laughed . " Me ? No , I 'm Americano , but I got ginzo relatives all around the Bay of Naples . " " Di Napoli ! so ' napoletano pur'io ! " Gino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovering mutual relations , and went down to the house . Dallas was sitting on the tailgate of the truck smoking a cigarette held in his cupped hand . " The rest of them are inside , " he said , " and I 'm keeping an eye on the shop to make sure we got transportation home . Lyn said to send you in when you come . " Barney looked at the low door of the house with complete lack of enthusiasm . It stood partly open and more smoke appeared to  | be coming from it than was coming out of the chimney . " See that you do watch it , " he said . " I can think of a lot more attractive spots to be shipwrecked . " " The same idea had occurred to me , " Dallas said quietly and lifted his other hand to show the automatic pistol he was holding . " Ten shots . I never miss . " Pushing the door wide , Barney stooped and entered the house . The smoke from the smouldering fire was thick around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it served to mask some of the other odors that hung richly in the air . He recognized old fish , tar , lockerroom lilac , plus others that he did not want to recognize . For the moment he was almost blind , coming in out of the sun , since the only light here came through the door and some openings that had apparently been kicked in the wall . " Jaja , kunningi ! ku skalt dreklza me5 mer ! " 2 Ottar 's hoarse voice shivered the air , and , as his eyes adjusted a bit , Barney could make out the men seated around a thick plank table , with Ottar at one end hammering on the boards with his fist . " He wants you to join him in a drink , " Lyn said . " This is a very important step , hospitality , bread and salt , that sort of thing . " " 011 " 3 Ottar bellowed , picking a small barrel up from the stamped earth floor . " Drink what ? " Barney asked , frowning into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barley , their staple crop . It is an invention of these north Germanic tribes , the ancestor you might say of our modern beer . Even the word has come down to us , though slightly changed in pronunciation of course ? " " Drekk ! " 4 Ottar ordered as he slopped full a horn and handed it to Barney . It really was a cow 's horn , Barney saw , curved and cracked and none too clean . Jens Lyn , the professor and Amory Blestead were also clutching horns . He raised it to his lips and took a sip . It was flat , sour , watery and tasted terrible . 2 " Ho , my friend ! You shall drink with met " 3 " Ale ! " 4 " Drink ! "  | " Good , " he said , hoping his expression could not be seen in the darkness . " Ja , gott ok vel , Ottar agreed and poured more of the loathsome beverage into Barney 's cup so that it slopped over and ran stickily down his arm inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Amory said hollowly , " wait until you taste the food . " " And here it comes now . " The professor pointed to the end of the room where one of the servants was rooting about in a large wooden chest against the wall . As he straightened up , the man kicked one of the rounded dark mounds that littered the floor there and a pained lowing trembled the air . " The livestock . . . ? " Barney could not finish . " Kept in the house , that 's right , " Amory said . " That 's what adds a certain , subtle fragrance to the air in here . " The servant , who looked not unlike an uncurried sheepdog , with his long blond hair that fell down and concealed his eyes , trudged over with a lumpish object clutched in each grimy paw and dropped them onto the table before Barney . They cracked against the wood like falling rocks . " What 's this ? " Barney asked , eyeing them suspiciously out of the corner of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to shake the rivulet of ale out of the sleeve of his cashmere jacket . " The chunk on the left is cheese , a native product , and the other is knaekbr  --  d , hard bread , " Jens Lyn said . " Or is it the other way around ? " Barney tried a nibble of each , or rather clattered his teeth against them , in turn . " That 's great , really great , " he said , throwing them back onto the table and looking at the glowing dial of his watch . " The light 's going and we should start back soon . I want to talk to you , Amory , outside , if you can tear yourself away from the party . " 6 " Yes , very good , "  | " My pleasure , " Amory said , shuddering as he finished most of his horn , then turned the thick dregs out onto the floor . The sun had dropped behind an icy band of cloud and a cold breeze was blowing in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket pockets . " I need your help , Amory , " he said . " Draw up a list of everything we 're going to need to shoot this picture on location here . It does n't look as though we 'll be able to help ourselves locally with any commissary supplies ? " " Second that motion ! " " So we 'll have to bring it all with us . I want to do all the cutting here , so set up a cutting room in one of the trailers . " " You 're looking for trouble , Barney . It will be a devil of a job to turn out even a rough cut here . And what about dubbing ? Or the musical score ? " " We 'll do the best we can . Hire a composer and couple of musicians , maybe use a local orchestra . " " I can hear that already . " " It does n't matter if we have to dub most of the sound again . What does matter is bringing back the film in the can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushing open the door and coming toward them . He fumbled in the breast pocket of his bush jacket . " I just remembered , there was a message I was supposed to give you . " What is it ? " Barney asked . " I have no idea . I presumed it was confidential . Your secretary handed it to me just as we were leaving . " Barney took the crumpled envelope and tore it open . It contained a single sheet of yellow paper with a brief , typed message . It read : L.M. on phone says cancel operation , all work to cease on picture . No reason given .  | Barney threw the magazine back onto the table , but the cover stuck to his hand and half tore off . He impatiently peeled away the paper and regretted not having taken the time to wash off the Viking beer before coming here . But canceled ! " Miss Zucker , " he said . " L.M. wants to see me . He said so . He left a message . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " I 'm very sorry , Mr. Hendrickson , but he left strictest instructions that he is in conference and can not be disturbed . " Her fingers poised for a second over the typewriter , her gum-chewing suspended momentarily . " I will notify him that you are waiting as soon as I am able . " The typewriter thrummed again , the jaws moving in slow rhythm with it . " You could at least ring through and tell him that I 'm here . " " Mr. Hendrickson ! " she said , her tones those a Mother Superior might use if accused of running a bawdy house . Barney went over and took a drink of water from the cooler , then rinsed off his sticky hand . He was drying it on some typing paper when the intercom buzzed and Miss Zucker nodded to him . You may go in now , " she said coldly . " What do you mean , L.M. ? " he asked the instant the door closed behind him . " What do you mean by sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair as mobile as a log of wood and Charley Chang slumped across from him , sweating heavily and looking miserable . " What do I mean ? What could I possibly mean I mean ? I mean you led me up the garden path , Barney Hendrickson , and pulled my leg . You got my agreement to go ahead on a picture when you did n't even have a script ! "  | " Of course I do n't have a script , how could I when we just decided to do the picture . This is an emergency , remember ? " " How could I forget . But an emergency is one thing , doing a picture without a script is another . In France maybe , they make the arty-schmarty things you could n't tell if they had a script or not . But in Climactic we do n't work that way . " " It 's not good business , " Sam agreed . Barney tried not to wring his hands . " L.M. , look . Be reasonable . This is a salvage operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances involved ? " " Say bank . The word do n't hurt no more . " " I wo n't say it , because we can beat them yet . We can make this picture . So you called in my scriptwriter ? " " He got no script . " " Of course he 's got no script . It was just yesterday when you and I finalized the idea . Now you 've talked to him and explained your ideas ? " " He got no script . " " Hear me out , L.M. Charley 's a good man , you picked him yourself and you briefed him yourself . If any man can deliver the goods , good old Charley can . If you had a Charley Chang script in your hand for this film you would let production go ahead , would n't you ? " " He got no ? " " L.M. , you 're not listening . If . That 's the big word . If I were to here and now hand you a Charley Chang script for this great motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus , would you okay production ? " L.M. was wearing his best poker face . He glanced over at Sam , who let his head drop the merest fraction of an inch . " Yes , " L.M. instantly said . " We 're halfway home , L.M. , " Barney hurried on . " If I were to hand you that script just one hour from now , you would okay production . Same difference , right ? " L.M. shrugged . " All right , same difference . But what difference does it make ? " " Sit right there , L.M. , " Barney said , grabbing the startled Char-  | ley Chang by the arm and dragging him from the room . " Talk to Sam about the budget , have a drink  --  and I 'll see you in exactly one hour . Viking Columbus is almost ready to roll .

I have heard rash promises in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the gold plated bagel ? " " Save it , Charley . You got some work ahead of you . " Barney steered the reluctant script writer out into the corridor while he talked . " Just give me your estimate of how long it would take you to rough out a first draft of a script for this film , working hard and putting your best into it . How long ? " " It 's a big job . At least six months . " " Right . Six weeks . Concentrated effort , a first-class job . " " I said months . And even six weeks are more than an hour . " " If you need six months you can have them . You have all the time you need , just take my word for it . And a nice quiet spot to work . " They were passing a photomural and Barney stopped and jabbed his thumb against it . " There . Santa Catalina Island . Plenty of sun , a refreshing dip in the briny when the thoughts grow stale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lousy with people , parties all night . " " That 's what you think . How would you like to work on Catalina without another soul around , the whole island to yourself ? Just think of the work you could get done . " " Barney , honestly , I do n't know what the hell you are talking about . " " You will , Charley . In a very few minutes you will . " " Fifty reams of typing paper , a box of carbon paper , typing chair  --  one , typing table  --  one , typewriter . . . " " This is a steam model , Barney , " Charley said . " The antique kind you push with the fingers . I can only work with an IBM electric . " " I 'm afraid the electric current is n't so reliable on the part of the island where you 'll be . You watch how fast the fingers will get the old touch back . " Barney made a tick mark on the sheet as a big  | crate was pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfit , complete . " " One what ? " " A do-it-yourself safari from the prop department . Tent , cots , mosquito nets , chairs , folding kitchen-and everything works . You 'll feel just like Dr. Livingstone only twice as comfortable . Fiftygallon drum of water  --  three , spring-powered time clock with cards ? one . Charley Chang watched in numb incomprehension as the varied assortment of items was loaded into the army truck . None of it made any sense , including the old geezer behind all the junk who was working away on a Frankenstein radio set . The ancient , mahogany time clock with roman numerals on its face was pushed over the tailgate , and Charley grabbed Barney 's arm and pointed to it . " None of this do I understand , and that least of all . Why a time clock ? " " Professor Hewett will explain everything in greatest detail in a few minutes , meanwhile take it all on faith . The clock is an important part , you 'll see . Punch in every morning , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary called out , " you 're very much in luck . " She came into the warehouse leading by the arm a frowning Negro who wore white work clothes and a tall chef 's hat . " You said you wanted a cook , but instantly , and I went right to our commissary and found Clyde Rawlston here . Not only can he cook , but he can take shorthand and type . " " You 're an angel , Betty . Order another typewriter . . . " " It 's on the way . Did the first-aid box come ? " " Already aboard . That 's the lot then . Clyde this is Charley , Charley , Clyde . You 'll get better acquainted later . If you will kindly board the truck now . " " I 'll go as soon as someone explains what is going on around here , " Clyde Rawlston said with cold-eyed belligerence . " A company emergency , Climactic needs you , and as loyal employees I know you 'll both cooperate . Professor Hewett will explain it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see you both right here in just ten minutes by my watch , that 's a promise . Now  --  if you will just climb over those crates so I can get this tailgate up . "  | Chivvied on by the voice of authority , they clambered aboard and Professor Hewett leaned out over their shoulders . " I thought the Cambrian period would be best , " he said to Barney . " You know , early Paleozoic . A nice , moderate climate , warm and comfortable , with no vertebrates around to cause trouble . Seas churning with the simple trilobite . Though it might be a little warm for continued comfort . Perhaps a little later in the Devonian . There would still be nothing big enough to harm ? " " You 're the doctor , Prof , whatever you think best . We have to work fast now , at least on this end . Take them to Catalina , drop them off , then move six weeks ahead and bring them back here . Leave the junk on the island , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Consider it done . With each trip made I feel it easier to calibrate the instruments , so that now the settings are most precise . No time shall be wasted , no time at all . " Professor Hewett returned to his instruments and the generator howled . Charley Chang was trying to say something , but his words were cut off as the truck vanished . There was no flicker or fading , it just disappeared as instantly and as quickly as the image on a back-projection screen when the film breaks . Barney started to turn to talk to his secretary , but just as his motion began the truck reappeared . " What 's wrong ? " he asked , then saw that all the supplies were gone from the back . Clyde Rawlston was standing near the professor at the controls and Charley Chang was sitting on an empty crate clutching a thick folder of typed sheets . " Nothing is wrong , " the professor said . " I have just timed our return with the utmost of exact precision . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was creased and faded , so bleached by the sun across the shoulders that all the color was gone . His hair was long and a black bristle of beard covered his cheeks . " How did it go ? " Barney asked . " Not bad  --  considering . I 'm not quite finished though , you see it 's those things in the water . Those teeth ! Eyes . . . ! " " How much more time do you need ? "  | " Two weeks should wrap it up , with time to spare . But , Barney , the eyes . . . " " There 's nothing there big enough to hurt you , that 's what the Prof said . " " Maybe not big , but in the ocean , so many of them , and the teeth . . . " " See you . Take it away , Prof. Two weeks . " This time the truck barely flickered , and if he had blinked at the wrong moment Barney would have missed the trip altogether . Yet , Charley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truck and the wad of typescript was thicker . " Viking Columbus , " Charley said , waving it over his head . " A wide-screen masterpiece . " He handed it down and Barney saw that there were some cards clipped to the folder . " Those are our time cards , and if you examine them you 'll see that they have been punched in every day , and Clyde and I are asking double time for Saturdays and treble for Sundays . " " Who 's arguing ? " Barney said , weighing the script happily . " Come on along , Charley , we 'll have the story conference right away . " Charley sniffed the twilight air as they came out of the warehouse . " What a lot of stinks , " he said . " I never realized it before . What great air we had there on the island . " He looked down at his feet while he walked . " Feels funny to be wearing shoes again . " " The native 's return , " Barney said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some clothes from wardrobe to replace your beachcomber 's rags and grab a shave . Get over to L.M. 's office as soon as you can . Is it a good script ? " " Maybe it 's too early to say  --  but in a way I think it 's the best thing I have ever done . Working the way I did , no outside distractions you know  --  if you do n't count the eyes ! And Clyde was a big help , a good clean typist . He 's a poet , did you know that ? " " I thought he was a cook ? " " He 's a lousy cook , I ended up doing all the cooking . He only took the job in the commissary to pay his rent . He 's a damn good poet , and great on dialogue . He helped me a lot there . Do you think we can get him a credit on this film ? " " I do n't see why not . And do n't forget that shave. "  | Barney went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Finished , " he said . L.M. weighed it carefully in both hands , then held it at arm 's length so he could read the cover sheet . " Viking Columbus . A good title . We 'll have to change it . You delivered like you said , Barney , so maybe now you can tell me the secret of in one hour producing a script . Tell Sam , he wants to hear too . " Sam was almost invisible , immobile against the dark wallpaper , until he nodded his head . " No secret , L.M. , it 's the vremeatron . You saw it in action . Charley Chang went back in time to a nice quiet spot where he worked very hard to produce this script . He stayed as long as he needed , then we brought him back to almost the same moment when he left . Hardly any time at all elapsed here while he was away , so from your point of view it looks like it took just an hour to produce a complete script . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beaming happily . " This is going to revolutionize the business . Do n't be cheap , Barney . Give me the highest hourly rate you can imagine , then double it  --  twice ! I do n't care about money . I want to do the right thing and see that Charley Chang gets the greatest rate per hour ever paid to man , paid for one hour of his time . " " You missed the point , L.M. Maybe only an hour of your time went by , but Charley Chang worked more than two months on that script , Saturdays and Sundays included , and he has to get paid for that time . " " He ca n't prove it ! " L.M. said , scowling fiercely . " He can prove it . He punched a time clock every day and I have the time cards right here . " " He can sue ! One hour it took , one hour I pay for . " " Sam , " Barney pleaded , " talk to him . Tell him you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' pay is still beans for a great script like this . " " I liked the one-hour script better , " Sam said . " We all liked the one-hour script better , except there never was a one-hour script . This is just a new way of working , but we still have to pay the same amount for the work whatever happens . "  | The buzz of the phone interrupted and L.M. picked it up , first listening , then answering with a monosyllabic series of grunts , finally slamming the handpiece back into the cradle . " Ruf Hawk is on his way up , " L.M. said . " I think maybe we can use him for the lead , but also I think he is under contract to an independent for another picture . Feel him out , Barney , before his agent gets here . Now  --  about this one hour ... " " Later we discuss the one hour , please , L.M. It 'll work out . " Ruf Hawk came in , stopping for a moment in the doorway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good he looked . He looked good . He looked good because that was really the only thing in life that he cared about . While all around the world , in countless movie houses , women 's hearts beat faster when they watched Ruf lock some lucky starlet in his firm embrace , little did these countless women know that their chances of getting locked in that embrace were exactly zero . Ruf did not like women . Not that he was a queer or something , he did n't like men either . Or sheep or raincoats or whips , etc . Ruf just liked Ruf , and the light of love in his eye was nothing more than a reflected gleam of narcissistic appreciation . He had been just one more slab of beefcake on muscle beach until it was discovered that he could act . He could n't act really , but it had been also discovered that he could act what he had been told to act . He would follow exactly whatever instructions were give to him , repeating the same words and actions over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he refreshed himself by looking into a mirror . His incompetence had never been revealed , because , in the kind of pictures he appeared in , before anyone could notice how bad he was the Indians would attack or the dinosaurs stampede or the walls of Troy would get torn down or something else mildly distracting would happen . Therefore Ruf was happy , and when the producers looked at box-office receipts they were happy , and everyone agreed that he had plenty of mileage left in him before his gut began to spread . " Hi , Ruf , " Barney said , " just the man we want to see . " Ruf raised his hand in greeting and smiled . He did n't talk much when he had n't been told to talk .  | " I 'm not going to beat around the point , Ruf , all I 'm going to say is that we 're going to make the world 's greatest picture and we were talking about a lead and your name was mentioned , and I said right out loud if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawk is the most vikingest Viking I can think of . " Ruf showed no signs of emotion or interest at this revelation . " You 've heard of Vikings , have n't you , Ruf ? " Barney asked . Ruf smiled slightly . You remember , " Barney said , " tall guys with big axes and horns on their helmets always sailing around in ships with a carved dragon in front . . . " " Oh , yeah , sure , " Ruf said , his attention captured at last . " I 've heard of Vikings . I 've never played a Viking . " " But in your heart of hearts you have always wanted to play a Viking , Ruf , it could n't be any other way . This is the kind of role that is made for you , the kind of role you can sink your teeth into , the kind of role that will make you look great in front of the camera . " The thick eyebrows slowly crawled together to form a frown . " I always look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course you do , Ruf , that 's why we have you here . You have n't got any big commitments , any other pictures , do you ? " Ruf frowned even deeper as he thought . " Got a picture coming up end of next week , something about Atlantis . " L.M. Greenspan glanced up from the script and matched his frown to Ruf 's . " I thought so . My apologies to your agent , Ruf , but we got ta find someone else . " " L.M. , " Barney said . " Read the script . Enjoy it . Let me talk to Ruf . You 've forgotten that this film will be in the can by Monday , which will give Ruf three days to rest up before Atlantis sinks . " " I 'm glad you mentioned the script because it has some grave faults , big ones . " " How can you tell  --  you 've only read ten pages ? Read it a bit more , then we 'll talk about it , the writer is waiting outside right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them practically while you wait . " He turned back to Ruf . " You 're going to get your wish and play that Viking . We 've got a new technical process whereby we go on location to shoot the picture , and , though we 'll  | be back in only a couple of days , you get paid for a feature-length picture . What do you think of that ? " " I think you better talk to my agent . Anything to do with money I do n't say a word . " " That 's the way it should be , Ruf , that 's what agents are for and I would n't have it any other way . " " It just wo n't do , " L.M. said in a voice of doom . " From Charley Chang I expected better . The opening wo n't do . " " I 'll get Charley in now , L.M. , and we 'll thrash this out , find the trouble and lick it . " Barney looked at the clock : 8 : oo P.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And fight the script through a rewrite and shoot Charley back to Catalina  --  and his teeth and eyes  --  to do the job . And find actors for the supporting roles . And get every single item lined up that they might need for a couple of months of shooting , then get the entire company moved back in time . And shoot the picture in the eleventh century , which should raise some interesting problems of its own . And get the entire thing done , finished and in the can by Monday morning . And here it was eight o'clock of a Wednesday night . Plenty of time . Sure , nothing to it , plenty of time . Then why was he sweating ?  | " A miracle of logistics , that 's what I call it , Mr. Hendrickson , getting all this done in less than four days , " Betty said , as they walked along the column of trucks and trailers that stretched along the concrete roadway leading to sound stage B. " That 's not what I would call it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful what words I use in front of women . How does the list check out ? " " All systems go . All the departments have turned in their check lists completed and signed . They 've really done wonderfully . " " Fine  --  but where is everybody ? " They had passed almost all the vehicles and Barney realized that , other than a few drivers , he had seen nobody . " It was after you left last night to get the raw film , and everyone was sitting around and we could n't leave and that sort of thing . Well , you know , one thing led to another ... " " No , I do n't know . What sort of things led to what sort of things ? " " It was fun , really , and we did miss you . Charley Chang ordered two cases of beer from the commissary because he said he had n't had a beer in a year , and someone else got some drinks and sandwiches , and before you knew it there was a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I guess they must all be pooped and still asleep in the trailers . " " Are you sure ? Did anyone make a head count ? " " The guards were n't drinking and they said no one left the area so it must be all right . " Barney looked at the row of silent trailers and shrugged . " Good enough , I guess . We 'll do a roll call after we arrive and send back for anyone who is missing . Let them sleep during the trip , it 's probably  | the best way . You better get some sleep yourself if you have been up all night . " " Thanks , bossman . I 'll be in trailer twelve if you need me . " The sound of rapid hammering echoed from the gaping doors of the sound stage , where the carpenters were putting the final bit of flooring onto the time platform . Barney stopped just inside the door and lighted a cigarette and tried to work up an enthusiastic attitude toward the jury-rigged fabrication that was to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame had been welded to the professor 's specifications , then floored with heavy planks . As soon as the first bit of planking was down at the front end a windowed control room had been built and Professor Hewett had mounted his enlarged vremeatronwhich in addition to being larger seemed to have far more festooned wires and glittering coils than the original  --  and a heavyduty diesel motor-generator . Almost two dozen large truck tires had been fastened to the bottom of the platform to absorb any landing shock , a pipe railing had been put along the sides and a ricketylooking pipe structure went across the top to delimitate the edges of the time field . The whole thing looked insubstantial and shoddy and Barney decided that the best thing he could do would be not to think about it . " Start it up , " Professor Hewett said , crawling out from behind his apparatus with a smoking soldering iron in his hand . A grip bent over the diesel engine , which groaned and turned over , then coughed out a cloud of blue exhaust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Prof ? " Barney asked through the open door . Hewett turned and blinked at him . " Mr. Hendrickson , good morning . I presume you are enquiring about the condition of my vremeatron mark two , and I am pleased to answer in the affirmative . It is ready to begin operation at any time , the circuits are all tested and I am ready whenever you are . " Barney looked at the carpenters , who were hammering home the last boards , then kicked a scrap of wood off the platform . " We 'll leave at once  --  unless you 've found a way to beat the return trip trouble ? " Hewett shook his head no . " I have experimented with the  | vremeatron to see if this barrier can be crossed , but it is impossible . When we return in time we cut an arc through the continuum , using energy to warp our own time lines out of the world time line . The return trip , after a visit in the past , no matter how prolonged the visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was established by the original time motion . In a sense the return voyage may be called endotempic , an absorption of time energy , just as the outward or backward voyage was exotempic . Therefore we can no more return to a point in time before the time of our original parting from the world time line , than a dropped ball on rebound can bounce higher than its original point when first dropped . You understand ? " " Not a single word . Could you try it again  --  in English this time ? " Professor Hewett picked up a clean piece of pine board , licked the tip of his ball-point pen and drew a simple diagram . " Examine this , " he said , " and all will be instantly clear . The line A Zl is the world time line , with AI the past and Zl the future . The point B represents our consciousness , today , our right now ' in time . The line A Z is the time line of the vremeatron making a voyage in time , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will note that we leave the world line at point B , today , and arc back through the extratemporal continuum to arrive at  --  say ' coo A.D. , at point C. Therefore the arc BC is our voyage . We re-enter the world time line at C and stay for a while , moving with the world z '  | line , and the duration of our visit is represented by the line CD . Do you follow ? " " So far , " Barney said , tracing the lines with his fingertip . " So keep talking while I still know what you 're talking about . " " Surely . Now note the arc DE , our return voyage in time to an instant in time , perhaps just a fraction of a second after the time we originally left , point B that is . I can control the arrival at point E until it comes just after point B  --  but I can never arrive before point B. The graph must always read BE , never EB . " " Why ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because that is the heart of the matter . Look again at the graph and you will note point K. This is the point where arc BC crosses arc DE . That point K must exist or it would be impossible to make the return voyage , for K is the interchange of energy point , where the scales of time are balanced . If you put point E between D and B the arcs will not cross , no matter how close they come , the energy will not balance , the trip will not be made . " Barney unknotted his brows and rubbed the sore spot between his eyes . " All of which adds up , " he said , " to the fact that we ca n't come back to a time earlier than the time we left . " " Precisely . " " So all the time we have used up this week is gone forever ? " " Correct . " " So if we want the picture to be completed by ten o'clock Monday morning we have to go back in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not have phrased it more succinctly myself . " " Then let 's get this show on the road since it is already Saturday morning . The carpenters are finished so it 's time to roll . " The first vehicle in the parade was a jeep : Tex was asleep in the front seat and Dallas in the back . Barney went over and leaned on the horn button , then found himself staring down the barrel of a long six-shooter held in Tex 's quivering grip . " I got a headache , " Tex said hoarsely , " and I wish you would n't do that . " He reluctantly slid the gun back into the holster.  | " Nervy this morning , are n't we ? " Barney said . " What you need is some nice fresh sea air . Let 's go . " Tex gunned the jeep to life while Dallas stumbled over to the platform and dragged two metal ramps into place at the back . As soon as the jeep had been driven aboard he pulled the ramps in after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Barney said . " We 'll find a level spot and come back for the rest . Take it away , Professor , back to the same landing site as the other trips , but eight weeks later . " Hewett mumbled to himself as he set the dials , then activated the vremeatron . The mark two was an improvement on the original model in that it compacted all the electrocution and nausea symptoms into a single quick twang of sensation  --  as though the passengers were harp strings plucked by a celestial finger  --  which was finished almost before it began . The sound stage vanished and salt spray and sharp , clear air took its place . Tex moaned softly and pulled up the zipper on his jacket . " Over there , that meadow looks like a good spot , " Barney said , pointing to a fairly level field that ran down to the beach . " Drive Inc over there , Tex , and Dallas stay with the professor . " The jeep ground up the rise in compound low , the popping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their heads . " Looks big enough , " Barney said , climbing out and kicking at a tuft of short grass . " You can drive back and tell the Prof to jump forward in time a bit and to land the platform over here , just to make sure he can find the right spot when we start bringing the company back . " Barney dropped to the ground and dug a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket , but it was empty . He crunched it up and threw it away while Tex wheeled the jeep in a circle and roared back to the platform . The ramps were still down and the jeep bounced up them ngain . Barney had a clear view as Dallas pulled the ramps in and the professor turned to the vremeatron . " Hey . . . " Barney said , just as the whole thing vanished , leaving nothing but the jeep tracks and the impression of the rows of  | tires on which the platform rested . He had n't intended Tex to go on with the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shivered . The gulls were settling down at the water 's edge again and the only sound now was the distant rush of the surf as the small waves broke on the beach . Barney glanced at the cigarette pack , the only familiar thing in the alien landscape , and shivered again . He never looked at his watch , but surely no more than a minute or two passed . Yet in that short time he realized only too well how Charley Chang had felt , stranded on prehistoric Catalina with the eyes and teeth , and he hoped that Jens Lyn was n't too unhappy after his two months ' stay . If his conscience had not been eroded away by years in the movie business he might have felt a twang of pity for them . As it was he just felt sorry for himself . The cloud moved away and the sun shone warmly upon him , but he was still cold . For those few minutes he felt alone and lost in a manner he had never experienced before . The platform appeared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " About time , " he shouted , the authority coming back with a rush as he stood and squared his shoulders . " Where have you been ? " " In the twentieth century  --  where else ? " the professor said . " You have not forgotten point K already , have you ? In order to come forward these few minutes in your subjective time I had to first return the time platform to the time we had left , then return here with the correct physical and temporal displacement . How long did it take  --  from your point of view ? " " I do n't know , a few minutes I suppose . " " Very good , I should say , for a round trip of approximately two thousand years . Let us say five minutes , that would give a microscopically small figure for the error of . . . " " All right , Prof , work it out on your own time . We want to get the company back in time and to work . Drive that jeep off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuttling back the vehicles and I want you to move them as soon as they arrive so we can have room for the next ones . Let 's roll . " This time Barney returned with the platform and never for an  | instant did he think about how the two men must feel who had been left behind . The transfer went easily enough . Once the first few trips had been made the trucks and trailers moved smoothly through the doors of ' the sound stage and vanished into the past . The only mishap was on the third transfer when a truck overhung the platform , so that when the time trip was made two inches of exhaust pipe and half a license plate clattered to the floor . Barney picked up the piece of pipe and looked at the shining end , flat and smooth , as if it had been polished . Apparently this bit had been outside the time field and had simply stayed behind . It could happen as easily to an arm . " I want everyone inside the vehicles during the trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents . " A tractor towing the motorboat trailer and the deep-freeze truck made up the last load , and Barney climbed on after them . He took one last look at the California sunshine , then signaled the professor to take it away . His watch said 11:57 , just before noon on Saturday as the twentieth century winked out and the eleventh century appeared , and he took a deep , relieved breath . Now time  --  in the cent ii ry they had left  --  would have a stop . As long as they stayed in this era to film the picture , no matter how long they took , no time would elapse back home . When they returned with the film it would ! e noon Saturday , almost two full days before the Monday deadline . For the first time the pressure was off . For approximately four seconds Barney relaxed as the tension drained away . Then he remembered that he had an entire picture to shoot , with all the problems and miseries that would entail , and the pressure dropped heavily back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , full strength . A roar of sound burst over him as the tractor driver revved up his engine , and the clear air was filled with reeking exhaust . Barney got out of the way as the motorboat trailer was carefully backed off , and he looked across the meadow . The trucks and trailers were scattered about at random , though some of them had been drawn up in a circle like a wagon train getting ready for the Indians . A few figures were visible , but most of the people were still asleep . Barney  | wished that he were too , but he knew that he would n't sleep even if he tried . So he might as well get some work done . Tex and Dallas were just settling down in the grass with cushions from the jeep when he came up . " Catch , " he said , flipping a quarter toward Dallas , who grabbed it out of the air . " Toss . I want one of you to go with me to pick up Jens Lyn , the other can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go , " Dallas said , then cursed at George Washington 's portrait . Tex laughed once , then settled himself down . " You know , " Dallas said , as they drove down to the beach , " I do n't even know where we are . " " The Orkney Islands , " Barney said , watching the gulls rocketing into the air before them , screaming insults . " My geography was always weak . " " They 're a little group of islands north of Scotland , about the same latitude as Stockholm . " " North of Scotland  --  come off it ! I was stationed in Scotland during the war and the only time I ever saw the sun was through a hole in the clouds , but not often , and it was cold enough to freeze the ? " " I 'm sure of it , but that was in the twentieth century . We 're now in the eleventh and in the middle of something called the Little Climactic Optimum . At least that 's what the Prof called it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The weather was  --  or is  --  warmer , that 's what it adds up to . " " Hard to believe , " Dallas said , looking suspiciously up at the sun as though he expected it to go out . The house looked the same as when they had seen it last , and one of the servants was sitting by the door sharpening a knife when they drove up . He looked up , startled , dropped the whetstone and ran into the house . A moment later Ottar appeared , wiping his mouth on his forearm . " Welcome , " he shouted as the jeep braked to a stop . " Very pleased see you again . Where is Jack Daniels ? " " The language lessons seem to have worked , " Dallas said , " but they did nothing for his thirst . "  | " There 's plenty to drink , " Barney reassured him . " But I want to talk to Dr. Lyn first . " " He 's out in back , " Ottar said , then raised his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 Jens Lyn tramped sluggishly around a corner of the house carrying a crude wooden bucket . His legs were bare and he was caked in mud as high as his waist . He wore an indifferent sort of sacklike garment , very ragged and caught about the middle with a length of hide , while his beard and hair were shoulder length and almost as impressive as Ottar 's . When he saw the jeep he stopped dead , his eyes widening , then shouted a harsh cry , raised the bucket over his head and ran toward them . Dallas jumped out of the jeep to face him . " Hold it , Doc , " he said . " Put the pail down before someone gets hurt . " The words or the stunt man 's waiting figure penetrated Lyn 's anger and he slowed to a halt , lowering the bucket . " What went wrong ? " he asked loudly . " Where have you been ? " " Getting the production rolling , what else ? " Barney said . " It 's ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , for us that is , though I realize that for you it has been two months ? " " Two months ! " Jens bellowed , " it 's been over a year ! What went wrong ? " Barney shrugged . " I guess the Prof made a mistake . All those instruments , you know ... " Jens Lyn grated his teeth together so hard that the sound could clearly be heard across the intervening space . " A mistake . . . that 's all it is to you . While I 've been stranded here with these louseridden barbarians , taking care of their filthy animals . Five minutes after you were gone Ottar hit me in the side of the head , took all my clothes and supplies and all the whiskey . " " Why work for whiskey when it just there to take it , " Ottar said with simple Viking logic . " What 's done is done , " Barney said . " You 've served your year here , but I 'll see you do n't suffer for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here ! "  | and you 'll get a full year 's pay . That 's not bad money for a couple of days ' work , and you still have your sabbatical coming up and a full year 's pay for that . You did your job and taught Ottar English ... " " His thirst did that . He was repellently drunk for almost a month and when he recovered he remembered about the English lessons . He made me teach him every day so he could get some whiskey if you ever returned . " " Ottar speak pretty good , that 's right . Where 's whiskey ? " " We have plenty , Ottar , just relax , " Barney said , then turned back to Jens , thoughts of law suits dancing darkly in his head . " What do you say we call it even , Doc ? A year 's salary for teaching Ottar English and you 're still working for us while we shoot the picture . I 'm sure it 's been an interesting experience ... " " Aaaarh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus the fact I bet you 've learned a lot of Old Norse . . " Far more than I ever wanted to know . " " So let 's call it quits . How about it ? " Jens Lyn stood for a long moment , fists clenched , then he dropped the bucket and savagely kicked it to pieces . " All right , " he said . " Not that I have much choice . But I do n't do one moment 's work until I have a shower , a delousing and a change of clothes . " " Sure , Doc . We 'll drive you back to the company in a few minutes , we 're right around the headland . . . " " I 'll find it myself if you do n't mind , " he said , stamping off down the beach . " Whiskey , " Ottar said . " Work , " Barney told him . " If you 're on a whiskey salary you 're going to earn it . This picture starts rolling tomorrow and I want some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in house . " " Not on your life , " Barney said , shying away . " I remember what happened to the last guy who did that . "  | " Stand still , " Gino shouted . " All you got to do is stand still and you ca n't even do that . " " Need a drink , " Ottar grumbled , and petulantly shook the housecarl with the matted hair who was standing in for Slithey . The man bleated and almost collapsed . Gino swore and turned away from the viewfinder of the camera . " Barney , " he pleaded , " talk to those Stone Age slobs . This is supposed to be a love scene and they 're moving around like some kind of wrestling match on the hill there . They 're the worse stand-ins I ever worked with . " " Just set up the shot , we 'll be with you in a minute , Gino , " Barney said , turning back to his stars . Ruf had his arms folded , staring vacantly into space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard . Slithey was leaning back in her safari chair while her wig was being combed , and she looked even more impressive with about twelve cubic feet of rounded flesh rising from the low-cut top of her dress . " I 'll give it to you once more , " Barney said . " You 're in love and Ruf is leaving to go to battle and you may never see him again , so you are saying good-bye on the hill , passionately . " " I thought I hated him ? " Slithey said . " That was yesterday , " Barney told her . " We 're not shooting in sequence , I explained this to you twice already this morning . Let me do it once more , briefly , and if I might have a small amount of your attention , too , Mr. Hawk . The picture opens when Thor , who is played by Ruf , comes with his Viking raiders to capture the farm on which you live , Slithey . You are Gudrid , the daughter of the house . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and  | Thor takes you as his prize . He wants you but you fight him because you hate him . But slowly he wins your heart until you fall in love with him . No sooner does this happen than he goes away on a Viking raid again and leaves you to wait for his return . That 's the scene we 're shooting now . He has left you , you run after him , you call to him , he turns and you come to him on the hill , right here . Is that clear . . . " " Look , " Ruf said , pointing out to sea . " Here comes a ship . " They all turned to look and , sure enough , there was a Viking longship just clearing the headland and coming into the bay . The sail was furled , but the dragon 's head on the bow rose and fell as the oarsmen on each side hauled the ship through the water . " Tomorrow ! " Barney shouted . " Lyn , where are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring his ship to-morrow ? " " They have a very loose sense of time , " Lyn said . Barney hurled his hat to the ground and ran to the camera . " What about it , Gino ? " he asked . " Is there a shot here ? Anything you can get ? " Gino spun the turret to the big telescopic lens and jammed his face against the eyepiece . " Looks good , " he said , " a really nice shot . " " Get it then , maybe we can salvage something from this . " Ottar and the other northmen were running down the hill toward the house , nor did they stop when Barney shouted at them to keep out of the shot . " What are they doing ? " he asked , when they began to stream out , clutching weapons . " I am sure I would not know , " Lyn told him . " Perhaps it is some custom of greeting I am not familiar with . " Ottar and his men stood on the shore shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Get all this , Gino , " Barney ordered . " If it 's any good we can write it into the script . " Under the thrust of the oars the longship ran up onto the beach , the dragon prow towering above the men waiting there . Almost before the ship had stopped moving the men aboard her had grabbed up the shields that were slung along the gunwales and  | jumped into the water . Like the men ashore , they also waved over their heads a varied collection of short swords and axes . The two groups met . " How does it look ? " Barney asked . " Santa Maria ! " Gino said . " They are killing each other . " The clang of metal mingled with the hoarse battle cries as the men fought . No details could be made out of the turmoil by the watchers above  --  it was just a mass of struggling figures  --  until one man broke from the crowd and ran haltingly down the beach . He had been disarmed , he appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ax in wide circles . The chase was brief and the end was sudden . As the gap closed , the ax swooped clown and the first man 's head jumped from his shoulders and bounded along the beach . " They play for keeps . . . " Barney said in a choked voice . " I do not think that this is Finnboggi and his men , " Lyn said . " I think this is a different ship that has arrived . " Barney was a man of action , but not this kind of action . The sound of battle and the sight of the beheaded corpse and blooddrenched sand had a paralytic effect on him . What could he do ? This was not his kind of world , his kind of affair . This was the kind of situation Tex or Dallas could handle . Where were they ? " The radio , " he said , belatedly remembering the transceiver slung over his shoulder ; he thumbed it to life and hurriedly sent out a call for the stuntmen . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way , " Gino shouted . " What a tremendous shot . " Instead of returning to the battle , the killer was lumbering up the slope toward them , shaking the ax and calling out hoarsely . The handful of movie people on the hill watched his approach , yet did not move . This was all so alien that they could think of themselves only as onlookers , they could not imagine themselves being involved in the murderous business taking place below . The attacking Viking lumbered closer and closer , until the black marks of the ocean spray and the perspiration stains were clearly visible on the coarse red wool of his blouse  --  and the red spatters of blood on his ax and arm .  | He went toward Gino , breathing heavily , perhaps thinking that the camera was some kind of weapon . The cameraman stayed in position until the last possible instant  --  filming his enraged attacker ? jumping away just as the ax came down . The blade smashed into one leg of the tripod , bending it and almost knocking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the equipment ! " Barney shouted , then regretted it instantly as the sweating , maddened Viking turned toward him . Gino was crouched , his arm before him , with the glistening blade of a knife projecting from his fist in a very efficient manner , undoubtedly the result of his childhood training in the slums of Naples . The instant the Viking turned his attention away , Gino lunged . The blow should have gone home but , for all his size , the Viking was as quick as a cat . He spun about and the blade slid into the slab of muscle in his side . Bellowing with sudden pain , he continued the motion , bringing up the ax so the haft caught Gino on the head , knocking him sprawling . Still shouting angrily , the man seized Gino by the hair , twisting his head down so his neck was taut and bared , at the same time raising the ax for a decapitating blow . The shot made a clear , hard sound and the Viking 's body jerked as the bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open with voiceless pain , and Tex  --  they had not even been aware the jeep had driven up  --  steadied his hand on the steering wheel and fired the revolver twice more . Both bullets hit the Viking in the forehead and he collapsed , dead before he hit the ground . Gino pushed the man 's lifeless weight off his legs and stood up , shakily , going at once to the camera . Tex started the jeep 's engine again . The others were still too stunned by the suddenness of the attack to move . " You want me to go down there and give our extras a hand ? " Tex asked , pushing fresh cartridges into his gun . " Yes , " Barney said . " We have to stop this mess before any more people are killed . "  | " I ca n't guarantee that wo n't happen , " Tex suggested ominously , , . and started the jeep down the hill . " Cut , " Barney called out to the cameraman . " We can fit a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tex had jammed something into the button so that the horn blared continuously , and he kept the gears in compound low so that the gear box screeched and the motor roared . At a bumpy five miles an hour he raced toward the battle . Ottar and his men had seen the jeep often enough before to be accustomed to it , but this was not true of the invading Vikings . They saw what could only have been some sort of bellowing monster approaching , and understandably refused to stand before its charge . They scattered to right and left while Tex skidded the jeep in a tight circle at the water 's edge , knocking down one of the men who had n't moved quickly enough . Ottar and his followers rallied behind the jeep and pressed in on the divided enemy . The invaders broke and ran , clambering back into the longship and grabbing up the oars again . This was where the engagement should have ended , and it would have if Tex had not been carried away with battle fever . Before the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the jeep and pulled a great length of steel cable from the drum under the front bumper . There was a loop at the end and he took this up and clambered up onto the jeep 's hood , spinning it in larger and larger circles as he climbed . His rebel yell was clearly audible above the other shouts as he released the cable . Straight up the loop rose to settle neatly over the dragon 's head onto the high stem post . He gave it a pull to settle it home , then leisurely jumped down and dropped into the driver 's seat . With slow grace the longship began to glide astern as the oars churned up a froth . Tex lit a cigarette and let the cable run out until twenty , thirty feet of it stretched between the ship and the jeep . One of the Vikings aboard the ship was hacking at the steel cable , with no results other than the ruination of the edge of his ax . Tex reached out his shoe and kicked the power takeoff into gear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bar-straight , and the longship shuddered through its length and halted . Then ,  | slowly but steadily , it was dragged back onto the beach . The oars splashed and dug deep into the water to no avail . It was all over then but the mopping up . Whatever enthusiasm had carried the raiders ashore had been wiped out by this last maneuver . Weapons splashed over the sides and the men raised their arms in surrender . Only one of them had any fight left , the man in the bow who had been hacking at the cable . With his ax in one hand , round shield in the other , he jumped ashore and charged the jeep . Tex cocked his revolver and waited , but Ottar joined the fight and cut off the attack . Both men shouted insults at each other as they circled warily at the water 's edge . Tex carefully released the hammer and slid the gun back into its holster when he saw that all other action had stopped as the two champions joined battle . Ottar , drenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working himself into a berserker rage , roaring and biting at the rim of his shield and running forward until the waves were up to his thighs . The invading chieftain stood scant yards away , glowering out from under the edge of his iron helmet , shouting his own guttural insults . Ottar beat the flat of his ax against his shield with thudding sledge blows  --  then suddenly charged , swinging his ax in a looping blow at the other 's head . The invader 's shield swung up to deflect the ax , but the force of the stroke was so powerful that it drove the man to his knees . There was a note of pure joy in Ottar 's bellow as he swung his ax again and again , never slowing , with the relentless measure of a woodsman felling a tree . The invader could not bring his own ax up , in fact he was leaning on his ax arm for support against the rain of blows . Pieces of wood flew from the shield and a wave sent spray swirling around them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Ottar swung his weapon high and brought it straight down with all his strength at the other 's head . The shield went up , but could not stop it . The ax " glanced from it , scarcely slowed , and hewed down into the Viking 's thigh . He howled with pain and swung his own ax in a backhand blow . Ottar jumped away , dodging it easily , and paused a moment to see the effect of his stroke . The invader struggled to a standing position , with all of his weight on his good leg , and it  | could be seen that the other was cut halfway through and pouring out blood . At this happy sight Ottar threw away his sword and ax and gave a shout of victory . The wounded Viking tried to attack him , but he dodged away , laughing at the clumsy attempt . All the northmen on shore  --  and most of the men in the ship  --  were laughing at the wounded man 's helpless anger . He kept crawling after Ottar , making feebler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ottar must have realized that this kind of fun could end only in his enemy 's death by bleeding , because he ran in suddenly and hit the man on the back , pushing him face downward into the frothing water . Then , with one foot on the Viking 's ax hand , he seized the man 's head in both hands and ground his face down into the sand and gravel , holding it there despite the frantic writhings until his enemy perished . Drowned in the few inches of bubbling sea . All the men on the beach and in the ship cheered . On the hill above there was only a shocked silence , broken by Ruf Hawk , who stumbled away to throw up . Barney noticed for the first time that Gino was back at the camera . " Did you get the fight ? " he asked , painfully aware that his voice cracked as he said it . " All in here , " Gino said , slapping the film container . " Though from this far away I 'm not sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best , " Barney said . " Let 's wind up the shooting for the day , the light will be going soon and I do n't think anyone wants to work with that around . . . " He nodded toward the grisly scene on the beach below . " Does n't bother me , " Slithey said . " Reminds me of the slaughterhouse where my father worked when we lived in Chicago . I used to bring him his lunch every day . " " Not all of us have your advantage , " Barney said . " Seven-thirty tomorrow on the dot , we 'll pick up where we left off today . " He started down the hill toward the noisy mob scene below . The dead and wounded from both groups had been pulled into a heap above the line of the waves , and the victors were already looting the ship of its supplies , starting with the ale . The surviving attackers had been grouped together under guard and were being harangued by Ottar , who strode back and forth before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punctuation . Whatever he said seemed to do the job because , before Barney reached the foot of the hill , the northmen , invaders and defenders both , turned and started toward the house . Only one man remained behind and Ottar struck him a wicked blow on the head with his fist , stretching him on the ground , and two of the housecarls carried him off . Ottar was groping in the sea for his ax when Barney came up . " Would you mind telling me what all that was about ? " Barney said . " Did you see how I hit the leg ? " Ottar said , brandishing the retrieved ax over his head . " Hit him . Krasc ! Leg next to off . " " Very well played , I saw it all . My congratulations . But who was he  --  and what were they doing here ? " " He was called Torfi . Whiskey ? " The last was added in an exultant shout as Tex dropped the freed cable into the sand and dug a pint bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tex said . " Not your favorite brand , but it 'll do . That 's a great backhand you got with that thing . " Ottar rolled his eyes with pleasure , then closed them tight as he raised the pint bottle to his lips and drained it . " Wish I could do that , " Tex said enviously . Barney waited until the bottle was empty and Ottar had hurled it into the sea with a happy cry before he asked , " This Torfi . What was the trouble with him ? " The aftereffects of the battle  --  and the whiskey  --  hit Ottar at the same time and he sat down suddenly on the pebbles , shaking his great head . " Torfi , the son of Valbrand , " he said as he got his breath back , " the son of Valthjof , the son of Orlyg came to Sviney .. . Torfi killed the men of Kropp twelve of them together . He also made the killing of the Holesmen , and he was at Hellisfitar , with Illugi the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed there . They also burned , in his own house , Audun the son of Smidkel at Bergen . " He stopped and nodded his head sagely as though he felt he had communicated vital information . " Well ? " Barney asked , puzzled . " What does all that mean ? " Ottar looked at him and frowned . " Smidkel married Thorodda , my sister . "  | " Of course , " Barney said . " How could I have forgotten that . So this Torfi has been in trouble with your brother-in-law and this means trouble with you , and it all ends up when he tries a bit of manslaughter here . What a way to live . Who were the men with him ? " Ottar shrugged and climbed to his feet , pulling himself up on the jeep 's front wheel . " Vikings , raiders . Go to raid England . They do n't like Torfi now because he comes here first instead of raiding England . Now they go with me to raid England . They go in my new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship and roared with laughter . " And that one man who did n't want to join you ? " " One Haki , brother of Torfi . I make him a slave . Sell him back to his family . " " I got ta give these guys credit , " Tex said . " No beating about the bush . " " You can say that again , " Barney said , looking in open wonder at the Viking , who at that moment seemed a giant of a man in every way . " Climb into the jeep , Ottar , we 'll drive you back to the house . " " Ottar ride the cheap , " he said enthusiastically , throwing his ax and shield in , then climbing over the side . " Not in the driver 's seat , " Tex told him . " That comes much later . " The supplies looted from the longship had included a dozen kegs of ale , most of which had been broached in front of the house , where a victory celebration was already in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the former invaders , who mixed with the victors and matched them drink for drink . Haki , who had been tied hand and foot and flung under a bench , seemed to be the only one who was n't enjoying himself . A hubbub of welcoming shouts heralded Ottar 's appearance , and he went at once to the nearest barrel that had a knocked-in head , plunging his cupped hands into the ale and drinking from them . As the shouting died away a rumbling exhaust could be heard and Barney turned to see one of the film company pickups come bouncing along the beach . It skidded to a stop in a rain of fine gravel and Dallas leaned out . " We been trying to contact you on the radio for ten minutes , maybe more , " he said .  | Barney looked down at the radio and saw that all the power had been turned off . " There 's nothing wrong here , " he said . " I just made a mistake and switched this thing off . " " Well there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've been trying to call you ? " ' What ! What do you mean ? " " It 's Ruf Hawk . He came back all excited , was n't looking where he was going . He tripped over a sheep , you know them dirty gray ones , they look just like rocks . Anyway he fell over it and broke his leg . " " Are you trying to tell me that  --  on the third day of shooting this picture  --  that my leading man has broken his leg ? " Dallas looked him straight in the eyes , not without a certain sympathy , and slowly nodded his head .  | There was a crowd around the door of Ruf Hawk 's trailer and Barney had to push his way through it . " Break it up , " he called out . " This is no side show . Let me through . " Ruf lay on the bed , his skin grayish and beaded with sweat , still wearing the Viking costume . His right leg was wrapped below the knee with white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood by the head of the bed , uniformed and efficient . " How is he ? " Barney asked . " Is it serious ? " " About as serious as a broken leg can be , " the nurse told him . " Mr. Hawk has suffered a compound fracture of his tibia , that is to say that his lower leg has been broken below the knee and the end of the bone has come through the skin . " Ruf , with his eyes closed , moaned histrionically at this description . " That does n't sound too bad , " Barney said desperately . " You can set the bone , he 'll be up and around pretty quickly . . . " " Mr. Hendrickson , " the nurse said in a frigid voice , " I am not a doctor and therefore do not give medical treatments to patients . I have administered first aid , I have placed a sterile bandage over the wound to prevent contamination and have given the patient an injection to alleviate the pain . I have done my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor will arrive ? " " The doctor , of course , he 'll take care of this . Is my secretary here ? " " Yes , Mr. Hendrickson , " she said from the doorway . " Betty  --  use the pickup outside , Tex will drive you . Find Professor Hewett and tell him to take you back to the studio on the platform , and not to waste one second on the trip , he 'll know what I  | mean . Find the company doctor and bring him here just as fast as you can . " No doctor , take me back . . . take me back . . . " Ruf said , and groaned again . " Get going , Betty . Fast . " He turned to Ruf , smiling broadly , and patted the actor on the shoulder . " Now do n't you worry your head for an instant . No cost will be spared and all the wonders of modern medicine are going to be at your service . They do great things these days , metal pins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you walking as good as new . . . " No . I do n't want to do this picture . This finishes it , I bet it says so in my contract . I want to go home . " " Relax , Ruf . Do n't excite yourself , rest . Stay with him , nurse , I 'll get these people out of here . Everything is going to work out fine . " But his words were as hollow as his smile , and he snarled as he cleared the wide-eyed spectators from the trailer and the doorway . Less than five minutes passed before the pickup arrived , and the doctor , followed by an orderly with two cases of equipment , came inside . " I want everyone but the nurse out of here , " he said . Barney started to protest , then shrugged . There was nothing more he could do at this moment . He went out and found Professor Hewett tinkering in the guts of his vremeatron . " Do n't disconnect it , " Barney said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case we need it . " " Just securing some of the wiring . I 'm afraid a good deal of the circuitry was breadboarded , in the rush you know , and may not be too reliable over an extended period . " " How long did this last trip take ? I mean , what time of day was it back there when you left ? " Hewett glanced at the dials . " Give or take a few microseconds , it is now 1435.52 hours , on Saturday ? " " That 's after half past two in the afternoon ! Where did all the time go ? " " It 's not my doing , I assure you . I waited with the platform  --  and had a rather unsatisfactory lunch from the vending machines  --  un-  | til the truck came back . I understand the doctor was not on the premises and had to be found and the necessary medical equipment obtained before they could return . " Barney rubbed his midriff where the sensation of a cold lump the size of a cannonball was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is now Saturday afternoon and we 've shot about three minutes of usable film and my lead is down with a broken leg . Time , we 're running out of time . " He looked strangely at the professor . " Time ? Why not time ? We have all of it we need , do n't we ? You could find a quiet spot , the kind you brought Charley Chang to , and that would take care of Ruf the same way . " He ran off excitedly before Hewett could answer , making his way through the company encampment and into Ruf 's trailer without bothering to knock . Ruf 's leg was now in a splint to the hip and the doctor was taking his pulse . The doctor looked sternly at Barney . That door was closed for a reason , " he said . " I know , Doctor , and I 'll see that no one comes through it . That 's a fine-looking piece of work , there  --  would you mind my asking how long it is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital ? " " That 's very good , very quick ! " " Where I will take the temporary splint off and put on a plaster cast ; and that will be on for at least twelve weeks , absolute minimum . After that the patient will be at least one month on crutches . " " Well , that does n't sound bad  --  in fact it sounds good , very good . I 'd like you to take good care of that patient , look after him if you would , and enjoy a bit of a holiday at the same time . We 're going to find a nice quiet spot where you can both rest . " " I have no idea of what you are talking about , but what you appear to be suggesting is impossible . I have my practice and I could not possibly consider leaving it for twelve weeks  --  or even twelve hours . I have a very important engagement tonight and I must be going at once . Your secretary assured me that I would be home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with calm assurance . He had been over this ground before with Charley and he knew the way . " You 'll be on time for your appointment tonight , and you 'll be at work on  | Monday and everything will be fine , in addition to which you are going to have a holiday  --  all expenses paid  --  and three months ' pay to boot . Does n't that sound great ? I 'll tell you what happens ? " " No ! " Ruf croaked from the bed , rousing himself enough to shake a fist weakly . " I know what you 're trying to do , but the answer is no . I 'm through with this picture , and I 'm through with the crazy people out there . I saw what happened on the beach and I do n't want any more part of it . " " Now , Ruf ? " " Do n't try and talk me around , Barney , you 're not changing my mind . I got an out with this leg so I 'm washed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the leg we 'd be through . You ca n't make me act . " Barney opened his mouth  --  he had a very nice remark that just described Ruf 's acting  --  then with a sudden burst of unaccustomed self-control he clapped it shut again . " We 'll talk about it in the morning , you get a good night 's sleep , " he mumbled between clamped lips , then turned and left before he said any more . As he stood outside and closed the door of the trailer he closed the door on the picture as well , he knew that . And on his career . Ruf was n't going to change his mind , that was certain . Few ideas ever penetrated the muscle and bone to that tiny brain , but the few that got in stuck hard . He could n't force the overmuscled slob to go to a prehistoric island for a rest cure , and if he could n't  --  there went the film . Barney stumbled and looked up , then realized that he had walked through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He was alone , on a hillock overlooking the beach and the bay . The sun was just above the horizon , edging a bank of lowlying cloud with a golden light that reflected on the water , breaking and reforming in molten patterns as the waves rolled in . It had the wild beauty of the world empty of man and he hated it , and everything about it . There was a rock lying by his foot and he picked it up and hurled it , as though the sea were a glass mirror that he hoped to break and destroy . But he hurt his arm when he threw it and the rock fell short and only clattered on the pebbles of the shore . There was n't going to be a motion picture . He cursed out loud .  | " What 's that mean ? " Ottar 's voice rumbled from behind him . He spun about . " It means get out of here you hairy-faced slob ! " Ottar shrugged and held out one big hand in which he clutched two bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . Have a drink . " Barney opened his mouth to say something scathing , remembered who he was talking to , so instead said , " Thanks , " and took the opened one . A long , long drink felt good going down . " I came here for my daily pay , one bottle , then Dallas say that from his own silver he buy Ottar one bottle because of fight today . This a big day . " " This a big day , all right . Pass the bottle . It 's the last day because this film is over , gone , finished , kaput . You know what that means ? " " No , " followed by a long gurgle . " No , I guess you would n't , you untarnished barbaric child of nature , you . In a funny way I really envy you . " " Not a child of Nature . There was a man called Thord Horsehead , he was my father . " " I mean really envy you , because you have the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good thirst , a good appetite , and never a moment 's doubt . Self-doubt , we live on it , and I bet you do n't even know the meaning of the word . " " Self-doubt ? That like sjalfsmor5 ? " 1 " Of course you do n't know it . " The Viking was sitting now and Barney dropped down himself so he could reach the bottle easier . The sun had set and the sky was a deep red at the horizon , blending into gray overhead , then darkening behind them . " We 're making a film , Ottar , that 's what we 're doing , a motion picture . Entertainment and big business rolled into one . Money and art , they do n't mix but we 've been mixing them for years . I 've been in this business since I wore velvet knee pants and right now , today , at the ripe young age of forty-five I am out of it . Because without this masterpiece Climactic is going to fold , and when they go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why ? " 1 Suicide .  | " Have a drink . " " Sure . I 'll tell you why . Because in my long and checkered career I have made seventy-three pictures and each and every one of them has been instantly forgettable . If I leave Climactic I am washed up since there are a lot better directors and producers around who are going to get any jobs that I may want . " Ottar , looking very noble and heroic , the eyes of an eagle , smiled out across the sea and belched . Barney nodded agreement and had another drink . " You are a wise man , Ottar . I 'll tell you something I never told anyone before because I am getting drunk on your daily wage and you probably understand one word in ten that I am saying . Do you know what I am ? I am mediocre . Do you have any idea what a terrible admission that is to make ? If you 're lousy you soon know it and you get booted out and go to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it and you got it made . But if you 're mediocre you are never quite sure of it and you blame it on the breaks and keep doing just one more picture until you have done seventy-three pieces of cinematic crap and there is not going to be a number seventy-four . The funny part is that number seventy-four could have been a good picture , God knows it certainly would have been different . Down the drain . The picture died unborn , poor picture now in picture limbo . Dead picture , no picture ... " " What is this picture ? " " I told you , a work of art . Entertainment . Like your what-doyou-call-them , sagas ... " " I 'll sing a song from a saga . I sing good . " Ottar stood , took a drink to clear his throat , and sang in a roaring voice that blended with the sound of the waves below . Strike , strike , sword , Thing of my heart where the worm is living ! Faces with anger my sons will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Valkyrs Brings new guests to the ale-hall of Odin . Death comes . The table holds a banquet . Life is done now . Laughing I die !  | Ottar stood for a moment  --  then roared even louder , with anger . " That was Ragnar 's song when King Aella murdered him and Aella died . I wish I could have slain him . " He shook his fist at the unsympathetic sky . Barney was having trouble with his vision , but he found that if he closed one eye he could see well enough . Ottar loomed over him , a figure from the dawn of the world , with his leather garments and flowing hair , the last light of sunset picking out red highlights on his skin . The saga was real to him , and life and art were one . The song was the battle and the battle became the song . The idea hit Barney with startling suddenness and he gasped . Well why not ? If he had n't been half potted , drinking on the shore of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a thousand years , it would never have occurred to him . Well why not ? Everything else about this business was madness , why not the final touch of insanity ? He had the freedom and the power  --  and he was washed up in any case . Why not ? " Come with me , " he said , climbing to his feet and attempting to pull the immobile form of the Viking after him . " Why ? " Ottar asked . " To see pictures . " Ottar was unimpressed . " To get more whiskey . " This was a lot better reason and they went back to camp together , Barney leaning a good deal on the other man , who seemed scarcely aware of it . " The rushes ready ? " Barney asked , poking his head into the studio trailer . " Coming out of the drier now , Mr. Hendrickson , " the technician said . " Right . Set the screen up outside and let 's see them . Show the other takes first , then put today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barney said , " Sure , sit right down here and I 'll get it . " There was a certain amount of difficulty in finding the right trailer in the dark , as well as unusually large number of items underfoot to stumble over , then the problem finding the right key for the lock . By the time Barney made his way back with the bottle a folding screen had been set up , as well as some safari chairs . He  | and Ottar settled themselves comfortably , with the bottle between them , the projector whirred and they watched the film in the wonderfully appropriate theater of open sky and stars . At first Ottar had trouble seeing the projected films as picture , his untrained eye not connecting the moving patterns with reality . But he was not unacquainted with representational art , three dimensional in wood carving and two-dimensional in paintings , and when he recognized the beach and his house he shouted with wonder . Dinner was almost through and most of the company wandered over to look at the rushes . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Viking raid by this time , and there were murmurs and gasps when the attacking ship appeared on the screen , cut through by Ottar 's deep growl of rage . As the ship was beached and the fighting began there was only a horrified silence . The angle was good , the pictures sharp and clear , the detail almost unbearable to watch . Even Barney , who had been there at the time , felt the hackles rising on his neck when the blood-spattered Viking charged up the hill right into the camera , closer and closer . Shouting a battle cry , Ottar leaped at the screen and crashed through it , rolling about in it and tearing at its fabric and metal embrace . Everyone else was shouting a good deal too , and one of the grips brought out a baby spot and plugged it in for light while Lyn managed to calm the Viking down and helping hands detached him from the ruined screen . While this was going on headlights appeared , moving through the camp , and a minute later a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the pool of light from the spot . " What a job finding anyone , " the driver said . " You movie people sure have some big sets . I never woulda thought all this could have fitted into one sound stage . " Barney said , " What do you want ? " " Got a call . Pick up a broken leg case , party name of Hawk . " Barney looked around the silent audience until he saw his secretary . " Show these people the way to Ruf 's trailer , will you , Betty ? And give him my best , tell him I hope he gets well quick , that kind of thing . "  | Betty tried to say something , but could not find the words . She turned away quickly , raising her handkerchief to her face , and climbed into the ambulance . The silence extended , and a number of people were having trouble meeting Barney 's eye . He smiled a broad , secret smile to himself , and waved his hand cheerfully . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another screen up and let 's see the rest of the rushes . " When the last foot of film had flicked through the projector , Barney stood in front of the screen in the glare of light , shielding his eyes against it with one hand . " I ca n't see who 's out there  --  Gino arc you here ? And Amory ? " There were sounds of assent from the crowd . " Good , let 's set up for a screen test . Get some grips and some lights out here ? " " It 's nighttime , Mr. Hendrickson , " a voice said from the darkness . " I 'm not that blind  --  and I get the message . Overtime rates then , but I want to shoot that test now . As you probably all know , since rumor loth flyeth on pretty damn rapid wings around here , Ruf 1 Iawk has broken his leg and is out of the shooting . Which leaves us without a male lead . Which may sound bad , but it is n't , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that we 'll have to scrap . But we need a new lead and that 's what we 're settling tonight , so I 'm going to make a test on a guy you all know well , our local friend , Ottar ... " There were some shocked gasps , a lot of whispers and a couple of laughs . The laughs were what got to Barney . " I issue the orders , and I 'm in charge here , and I want a screen test and that is that ! " He stopped to catch his breath and realized that he was in charge , more in charge than he had ever been before . A thousand years away from the front office , with no phone connections in between . No L.M. to bother him , even if L.M. had n't been shut away with his phony heart attack , with the books tinder his mattress . The whole load was on his shoulders , and his alone , and the picture depended on what he did next . More than the picture , the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone here  --  not to mention his own . Normally this was the sort of situation that gave him peptic  | twinges and sleepless nights , and left him wandering in a black hell of indecision . Not this time though . Something of the Viking spirit must have rubbed off , the awareness that every man is alone against the world and in luck if there is someone else there to help , but the help was not to be expected . " We 're doing that test now . Ottar looks the part , no one can argue with that . And if he has got a bit of an accent  --  well so did Boyer and Von Stroheim , and look what they did . Now let 's see if he can act , at least as well as Ruf . " " Five bucks says he 's better , " someone called out . " No takers , " another voice answered , and a ripple of laughter ran across the crowd . Just like that , they were with him , Barney could feel it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Whatever was causing it , they were on his side . Barney slumped back in the chair and gave a few directions and sipped at the Jack Daniels while the lights and camera were set up . Only when the arrangements were completed did he stand and pull the bottle away from the nodding Ottar . " Give it back , " Ottar rumbled . " In a minute . But I want you to sing me that saga about Ragnar again . " " Do n't want to sing . " " Sure you do , Ottar . I 've been telling everyone how great the song was and they all want to hear you sing , do n't you people ? " There was a welcoming chorus of " yesses " and some cheers . Slithev swam out of the darkness and took Ottar 's hand . " You 'll play it for me , darling , it will be my song , " she said , reciting a line from her last picture , which had been about some second-rate composer . Ottar could not resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he stood where Barney told him to , and took the prop ax . " Too light , " he said . " Made of wood . No good at all . " He sang for them then , first in a chanting monotone , still examining the ax , then louder and with more enthusiasm as the song began to stir his emotions . With an angry shout he finished the last  | line and swung the ax fiercely , knocking over and almost demolishing one of the spots . The audience broke into impulsive clapping and cheers , while he strode back and forth before them accepting his due . " That was great , " Barney said . " Now we 'll try just one more little business before we let you go . You see that lamp stand over there with the coat and helmet hung on it ? Well that 's an enemy sentry . You 're going to stalk and kill him , just as you really would . " " Why ? " ? " Why ? Ottar , what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what kind of a question it was  --  the kind that is very hard to answer . The why for an actor was easy enough , because acting was how he earned his bread . But why should Ottar do it ? " Forget that for a minute , " Barney said . " Come over here and sit down a minute , have a drink , and I 'll tell you a saga for a change . " " You have a saga too ? Sagas are good . " In this pre-entertainment , preliteracy age the sagas were song and history , newspaper and book all rolled into one , and Barney knew it . " That 's fine , " he said , and waved the camera on Ottar . " Just grab the bottle and listen to this story , the story of a great Viking , a great berserker and he was called Ottar . . . " " Same name as me ? " " The same , and he was a famous warrior . He had a good friend whom he drank with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . But one day there was a battle and Ottar 's friend was captured and tied up and taken away . But Q , ttarifolIowed and he waited , hidden near the enemy camp , until nightfall . I Ic was thirsty after the battle and he drank , but he stayed quiet and hidden . " Ottar took a quick sip from the bottle as he said this , then pressed his back against the trailer . " Then it was dark and the time had come . He would free his friend . Stand , Ottar , he said to himself , stand and go save your friend who they will kill by morning . Stand ! " Barney hissed the last word , commandingly , and in a single lithe movement Ottar was on his feet , the bottle fallen and forgotten .  | " Look , Ottar , look around this building and see the guard . Carefully  --  there he is ! " Ottar was part of the story now . He bent low and moved one eye slowly around the corner  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back is turned . Creep up on him , Ottar , and slay him silently with your hands . Close them around his neck so that he dies without a sound . Quietly now , while his back is turned . " Ottar was out from behind the trailer , bent double and drifting as soundlessly as a shadow over the rutted ground . No one moved or uttered a word as he advanced . Barney glanced around and saw his secretary next to him , eyes fixed on the stalking Viking . " Halfway to the guard , Ottar heard a sound . Someone was coming . He hid . " Ottar vanished into a patch of darkness and Barney whispered , " Get out there , Betty . Just walk on and exit stage left . " He took her arm and started her forward . " Ottar hid , shrouded by the darkness as one of the women came by . She walked close but she did not see him . She went on . Ottar waited until it was quiet , then came forward again , closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to pan the camera rapidly as the Viking moved out and sprang , running  --  still in absolute silence  --  and hurled himself through the air onto the dummy . The helmet rolled aside and he had the steel rod of the lamp support between his fingers , bending it almost double in a single contraction of his muscles . " Cut ! " Barney said . " That was the story , Ottar , just the way you would have done it . Killed the guard and freed your friend . Very good , real good . Everyone now , let him know how much you liked that performance . " While they cheered and whistled , Ottar sat up , blinking rapidly , slow memory returning as to where he was . He looked at the twisted metal , then threw it aside , grinning . " That was a good story , " he said . " That was the way Ottar does it . " I 'll show you the rushes tomorrow , " Barney said . " Let you see the moving pictures of yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a long day . Tex  --  Dallas  --  will one of you take the jeep and drive Ottar home ? " The night air was getting cool and the crowd broke up quickly , while the grips put the spots and camera away . Barney watched the tail light of the jeep vanish over the rise , then realized that Gino was next to him , lighting a cigarette . He took one from the pack . " What do you think ? " he asked . " I do n't think , " Gino shrugged . " What do I know ? I 'm a cameraman . . " " Every cameraman I ever met knows , deep inside , that he is a better director than any bum he ever worked with . What do you think ? " " Well  --  if you was to ask me , which you have , I would say that this guy is at least better than that slab of corn beef they carried away , and if the test looks like I think it will look  --  then maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , of course . Talk about method acting ! " Barney flipped the cigarette away into the darkness . " That , " he said , " was just what I was thinking myself . "  | Barney had to raise his voice to be heard over the drumming roar of the rain on the trailer roof . " Are you sure he knew what he was signing ? " he asked , staring ' dubiously at the shaky X and thumbprint on the bottom of the contract . " Absolutely , " Jens Lyn said . " I read him both the English original and the Old Norse translation and he agreed with everything , then signed in front of witnesses . " " I hope he never gets hold of a good lawyer . According to this , 1w  --  the male lead  --  is making less than anyone else in the company , including the guy who takes care of the john-on-wheels . " " There can be no possible complaint , the terms of salary were his suggestion . One bottle of Jack Daniels a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's hardly enough silver to fill a tooth . " " We must not forget the relative economic position of the two different worlds , " Jens said in his best classroom manner , admonitory finger raised . " The economy here is essentially one of barter and trade , with very little payment by coin . The silver mark thereore has a much greater value , which is very hard to compare to our rice for mass-produced silver . It is perhaps better to look at its buying power . For a silver mark you can buy a slave . For two marks " I get the point , enough already . What is more important , will he stick around to finish the picture ? " Jens shrugged . " Oh , that 's a very good answer . " Barney rubbed his thumb against the aching spot in his temple and looked out of the window at the  | leaden skies and the falling curtains of rain . " It 's been raining like that for two days now  --  does n't it ever stop ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget that , although the weather here in the tenth century is wanner than the twentieth because of the Little Climactic Optimum , we are still in the North Atlantic at approximately fifty-nine degrees north latitude , and the rainfall is ? " " Save the lecture . I have to be sure that Ottar will cooperate for the entire film  --  or I do n't dare begin shooting . He may sail away in that new ship of his , or do whatever Vikings do . In fact  --  what does he do here ? He 's not exactly my idea of a jolly fanner . " " He is in exile for the moment . It appears he did not relish conversion to Christianity as King Olaf Tryggvess  --  n practices it , so after a losing battle he had to flee from Norway . " " What does he have against becoming a Christian ? " " Olaf would submit him first to the ordeal of the snake . In this the mouthpiece of a lurhorn , the large brass war horn , is forced well down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bell of the horn , which is then sealed , and the horn heated until the snake seeks escape down the pagan 's throat . " " Very attractive . So what happened when he left Norway ? " " He was on his way to Iceland , but his ship was wrecked in a storm and he and a few of his crewmen made it ashore here . All this happened not too long before our arrival the first time . " " If he was shipwrecked  --  whose house is that he 's living in ? " " I am sure I do not know . He and his men killed the former owner and took over . " " What a way to live  --  but it 's good news as far as we 're concerned . He 's sure to stick around as long as he is well paid and drunk . " Amory Blestead came in , with a gust of wind and a splatter of rain , then had to lean against the door to close it again . " Hang your things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barney said . " There 's some coffee on the hot plate . How 's the set coming ? " " Just about finished , " Amory said , stirring sugar into his cup . " We knocked out the back wall of the house to get the cameras and lights in , covered it with plywood panels , raised the ceiling four  | feet . This was a lot easier than I thought . We just jacked up the beams and lifted the whole lot straight up , then the local labor cut sods and shoved them in to build the walls higher . These guys really know how to work . " " And cheap too , " Barney said . " So far the budget is the only thing that has gone right with this picture . " He flipped through his copy of the script , marking off scenes with a red pencil . " Can we shoot some interiors now ? " " Any time you say . " " Let 's go then , into the rubber boots . What did you think of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This Viking is a natural , a real find . " " Yeah , " Barney said , chewing on the pencil , then flinging it down . " Let 's hope so . He might be able to do a scene or two  --  but how will he hold up during an entire production ? I wanted to shoot some simple stuff on location first , climbing in and out of boats and looking heroically into the sunset , but the weather has killed that . It 's going to have to be interiors  --  and keep your fingers crossed . " Rain blew in around the side curtains of the jeep as they churned slowly over the hill along the mud track worn by the traffic from the camp . A cluster of vehicles was parked in the field behind Ottar 's house , dominated by the thudding bulk of the generator trailer . They pulled in as close to the house as they could , then sloshed tip the path . In the lee of the building were hunched most of the housecarls , dripping and unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film production . The plywood door was blocked partially open to admit the thick electric cables and Barney pushed his way in . " Let 's get some light in here , " he said , shaking out of his sodden cont . " And clear that crowd away from the end of the room . I want to see this shut-bed thing . " " Watch out for the stain , it 's still a little wet on the antiqued wood , " Amory said , pointing to the double doors set into the wall . " Not bad , " Barney said . Jens Lyn snorted . " Not good ! I explained that in a simple house such as this one , the occupants would sleep on the sleeping ledge  | along the wall , that ledge over there , but they might possibly have a shut-bed , a small , doored chamber built into the wall . Small to retain the body heat , that is the purpose of the shut-bed . " He swung open the five-foot-high doors to disclose a small room floored with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an abomination ! Nothing about it ? " " Take it easy , Doc , " Barney said , looking at the shut-bed through a viewer . " We 're shooting a picture , remember ? You 're not going to get a camera and a couple of people inside the kind of coffin you 're thinking about . All right , drop the back . " Two carpenters took away the back wall of the cubicle to disclose a camera in a shed on the other side . " Get in there , Gino , " Barney ordered , " and I 'll run through the action . This is take fifty-four . Just in time , Ottar , you 're about to go on stage . " The Viking stamped in , swathed in plastic raincoats and followed by the clucking makeup man , who held an umbrella over his head . " Hello , Barney , " he shouted . " I look good , not ? " He did look good . He had been soaked in a tub  --  the water had to be changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , color-rinsed , dried , trimmed and combed , and Ruf 's Viking outfit let out and recut for his massive frame . He was impressive , and he knew it and reveled in it . " You 're tremendous , " Barney said . " So great that I want to take some more pictures of you . You 'll like looking at them , wo n't you ? " " Good idea . I look good in pictures . " " Right . Now here 's what I want you to do . " Barney closed the shut-bed doors . " I 'll be inside with the camera . You stand here and open the doors . . . like this . . . and when they are wide open you look down at the bed like this and smile slowly . That 's all you have to do . " " That sounds like stupid idea . Better take a picture of me out here . " " I appreciate the suggestion , Ottar , but I think we 'll do it my way . After all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month and you should do something to earn it . " " That 's right  --  every day . Where 's today bottle ? "  | " When you 're through working , and we have n't started yet . So stand right here and I 'll get around with the camera . " He threw a raincoat over his head and sloshed out to the shed . After much shouted instructions and false starts , Ottar seemed to understand what was expected of him and the doors were closed once more and Barney called for the camera and action . The camera pointed into the dark bedspace and whirred as the doors were flung open with great force . One of the handles came off in Ottar 's hand and he threw it down . " Hell-damn , " he snarled . Barney took a deep breath . " That 's not exactly the way the scene should be played , " he said . " You have to put yourself into the part , ( ) star . You 've come home unexpectedly , you are tired . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see Gudrid lying there asleep and you smile at her . " " Nobody named Gudrid on this island . " " Gudrid is Slithey 's name in this screenplay . You know who Slithey is ? " " Sure  --  but she 's not here now . This is pretty stupid I say , Barney . " Barney had been directing indifferent and bad actors for years , so he took this objection in his stride . " Just wait one minute and we 'll try it again , " he said . There was a lot of rustling and grumbled complaints from the other side , but finally the doors swung open again , slower this time , and Ottar looked in . He was scowling fiercely into the camera , then he glanced down at the bed and his expression slowly changed . The wrinkled brow smoothed , the corners of his mouth rose into a happy smile and his eyes opened wide . He reached in . " Cut . That was very good , " Barney said , moving faster than Ottar and grabbing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll save this for you for later . Ow ! " The Viking had him by the wrist , which created a sensation not unlike being caught between the jaws of a hydraulic press , and the bottle fell from his limp fingers . Barney went back into the house rubbing his crushed wrist and wondering if , after all , he had n't made a mistake in casting .  | Slithey had arrived , and , when the rubber boots , coats and yards of plastic had been removed , she stood and shivered in bare feet and a diaphanous pink nightgown . She wore a flesh-colored body stocking , the garment was low cut and transparent , and the entire effect was devastating . " Very authentic costuming , very , " Jens Lyn said cuttingly , and left . Ottar sucked happily at the bottle and ignored everyone . " I 'm cold , " Slithey said . " Rig an electric heater with those lights over the bed , " Barney ordered . " Take forty-three , Slithey , just climb into the sack and close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't want to catch pea-newmonia . " " With your insulation , honey , not a chance . " It was a brief scene , just a few seconds on the screen , but everything takes time when making a film , and before they were finished Ottar had worked halfway down the bottle and was singing happily to himself in one corner . " Here we go , take fifty-five , , you 're on , Ottar , if you would n't mind putting your salary down for a while , " Barney called out . Much pacified by the whiskey , Ottar tramped over and looked at Slithey sprawled daintily in the oversized bed , covered by a Viking-Navajo blanket . " She tired ? " Ottar asked . " Too many lights to sleep . " " Very keen of you to notice , but we 're still making the film . Here 's what I want you to do . " Barney stood by the side of the bed . " You have just opened the doors , you look down at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand down and touch her hair . She awakes and does a fright take , shrinking away . You laugh and sit on the edge of the bed , you pull her toward you and kiss her . At first she struggles , pushes you away , but then hate turns to love and her arms steal around you and she kisses you too . Your hand slowly goes to her shoulder strap , make sure it 's this one  --  the other one is glued on  --  and you slowly slide it over her shoulder . That 's all . We cut there and the rest is left to the public 's imagination and they have good imaginations . So let 's run through it once first . " It was desperately hard work , since Ottar was n't interested in the least and kept looking toward the bottle to make sure no one was  | touching it , and Barney was sweating as he fought to put the Viking through his wooden paces . The bottle was finally placed in the corner of the bed out of camera range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction most of the time . Barney took a long drink of chemical-tasting water and one more time stood Ottar on the lines scratched into the dirt floor . " Here we go , " he said . " We 'll shoot this without sound and I 'll guide you through it . And everyone else shut up , this set sounds like a mah-jongg party . Camera . Here you go , Ottar , you look down , that 's it  --  not at the damn bottle  --  you reach out and touch her hair . Slithey wakes up , great , you 're doing fine , sit down now  --  do n't break the bed ! Okay , now you reach out and we have the kiss . " Ottar 's fingers closed around the bare flesh of Slithey 's arm and his back straightened suddenly and he completely forgot about his bottle . Slithey 's hormone magic worked just as well in the eleventh century as it had in the twentieth . The odor of scented female flesh rose into his nostrils and he did not need Barney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Barney called out . " A passionate embrace and a kiss , but you do n't like it , Slithey . " Slithey was squirming in his grip and beating his massive chest with her clenched fists . She turned her head away and said , " Easy , caveman , take it easy , " then he was kissing her again . " Great ! " Barney shouted . " Writhe all over like that , Slithey , perfect . Force her down to the bed , Ottar . Now the shoulder strap . " There was the sharp sound of torn fabric . " Hey  --  watch what you 're doing ! " Slithey called out . " Forget it , " Barney said . " We can run up a new nighty . This is great . Now you change , Slithey . Hate turns to burning love . Very good . . . " " Look what he 's doing ! " Amory Blestead said . " Cut . That 's good . We 'll print that . I said cut . . . Ottar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene is over ! " " Wow ! " one of the grips said enthusiastically . " Someone stop them ! " " Why  --  they seem to be enjoying it  --  and so am I. "  | There was a great ripping sound of torn cloth , cut through by Slithey 's happy giggle . " That 's enough , " Barney said sharply . " Just the shoulder strap , I 'm afraid this has gone too far . Ottar  --  not that ! " " Yippee ! " someone said , and after that there was just a long silence broken only by Ottar 's steam-engine breathing . Barney finally broke the spell of fascinated attention by walking over and slamming shut the doors . From the other side came a high-pitched , happy shriek . He turned and saw Gino bent over the camera . " What are you doing ? " he shouted . " Cut ! " " Cut , sure , " Gino said , straightening up slowly from behind the camera . " Did n't you hear me say cut last time ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distracted . " " Do you mean . . . the camera was running all the time ? " " All the time , " Gino said with a very wide smile . " I think you 've got something really new here in cinema verite , Mr. Hendrickson . " Barney looked at the closed doors and fumbled out a cigarette . " You might say that . Though I do n't know if we 'll be able to show the uncut version anywhere out of Scandinavia . " " Dr. Masters could use it . " " I know a guy in Beverly Hills who rents out stag movies , he 'd buy a print , " Amory said . There was a moment of silence as happy laughter echoed through the closed doors . " And he even got a bottle of whiskey in there , " one of the carpenters said dismally.  | " One thing I really like about the eleventh century , " Barney said , spearing a large chunk of white meat with his fork , " is the sea 4 iod . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution or 1A , hat ? " " It is probably because what you are eating is not sea food from the eleventh century . " " Do n't try to sell me that . This is n't any of that frozen TV dinner stuff we brought along . Look , the clouds are breaking up , if it stays like this we can shoot the rest of the homecoming today . " The front of the mess tent was rolled up , which gave a clear view across the fields , with a bit of ocean visible beyond . Professor I Jewett pointed to it . " The fish in the ocean here are identical with those of the twentieth century , to all practical purposes . But the trilobite on your plate is of a totally different order and era , brought back by the weekend parties from Old Catalina . " " That 's what all the dripping boxes were about . " He looked suspiciously at the meat on his plate . " Just a minute  --  this thing I 'm eating  --  it has nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " No , " the professor said . " You must remember we changed periods when it was decided that members of the company should spend two days a week in a different time , so that work here would I , e continuous . Santa Catalina is a perfect holiday spot , Mr. Chang verified that , but he was slightly put out by the local life . That was my mistake . I left him in the Devonian period , when amphibian lift was beginning to emerge from the sea , totally harmless crea-  | tures such as the lung fish for the most part . But there were things in the water . . . " " Eyes and teeth . We heard . " " So I considered the Cambrian a wiser choice for our weekenders . Nothing in the ocean to bother the bathers that is larger than the harmless trilobite . " " So you 've used the word again . What is it ? " " An extinct arthropod . A form of life generally classed somewhere between the crustaceans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the one you 're eating is the largest . A sort of two-foot long , seagoing wood louse . " Barney dropped his fork and took a long swallow of coffee . " That was a delicious lunch , " he said . " Now if you do n't mind , could we talk about the colony in Vinland . Have you found it yet ? " " My news is n't too good . " " After the trilobite anything is good . Tell me . " " You must understand that my detailed knowledge of the period is limited . But Dr. Lyn is well versed on the history and he has all the records in the original sagas about the Vinland discoveries and settlements , and I have been following his instructions . It was difficult at times to find a suitable arrival location , the coast of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia is irregular to say the least , but we have been successful at this . The motorboat has been used extensively , so that I can assure you that the search has been carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you found ? " " Nothing . " " That 's the sort of news I like to hear , " Barney said , pushing his plate of french-fried trilobite farther away . " Get the Doc over here , if you do n't mind . I want to hear more about this . " " It is true , " Jens Lyn said in his gloomiest , north Baltic manner . " There are no Norse settlements in North America . It is most disturbing . We have searched all the possible sites from the tenth to the thirteenth century and have found nothing . " " What made you think that there was anything to find ? " Lyn 's nostrils flared . " May I remind you that , since the discovery of the Vinland Map , there has been little doubt that the Norse did  | explore and settle in North America . It is recorded that in II2I Bishop Eirik Gnuppsson went on a mission to Vinland . The sagas describe the many journeys there and the settlements that were made . Only the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovering the location was the purpose of our recent explorations . In theory we had thousands of miles of coast to explore , since the authorities differ widely as to the locations of Helluland and Markland mentioned in the sagas . Gathorne-Hardy identifies the Si raums f jord as Long Island Sound , and places Hop in the estuary of the Hudson River . But other authorities think the landings took place farther north , Storm and Babcock think favorably of Labrador and Newfoundland , and Mowat has actually pinpointed the location of Hop ? " " Stop , " Barney said . " I do not care about the theories . Did you or did you , ; not just get through telling me that you had found no set dements or evidence of any kind ? " " I did , but ... " " Then all of the authorities are completely wrong ? " " Well . . . yes , " Lyn said , sitting down and looking very unhappy . " Do n't let it bother you , Doc , " Barney said , holding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " You can write a book about it , then you 'll be the new authority . What is more important is  --  where do we go from here ? May I remind those of you who have not read the script lately that it is titled Viking Columbus and is the saga of the discovery of North America and the founding of the first settlement there . So what do we do ? We had planned to move the company over to the Viking settlements and shoot the last part of the picture there . But no settlements . What comes next ? " Jens Lyn chewed his knuckle a moment , then looked up . " We could go to the west coast of Norway . There are Norse settlements there , and it looks . not unlike the Newfoundland coast at places . " " Do they have many Indians we can hire for the big battle scenes ? " Barney asked . " None at all . " " Then that 's out . Maybe we better ask our local man . " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a steaming heap of trilobites in the far corner . " Go over and disturb his lunch , Jens , tell him he can have seconds and thirds later . " " You want Ottar ? " the Viking asked , stamping over and dropping onto the bench . " What do you know about Vinland ? " Barney said to him . " Nothing . " " You mean you 've never heard of it ? " " Sure I heard the skald make poems about it , and I talked to Leif Eriksson about his trip . I 've never seen it , do n't know anything . One year I go to Iceland then go to Vinland , get very rich . " ' With what ? Gold ? Silver ? " " Wood , " Ottar said , with contempt for anyone who did not know such an obvious thing . " For the Greenland settlements , " Jens Lyn explained . " They are always terribly short of wood of any kind , and in particular the hardwoods needed for shipbuilding . A load of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , there 's your answer , " Barney said , rising . " As soon as we finish shooting here we pay off Ottar and he sails to Vinland . We jump ahead in time and meet him . We film the departure , some ocean shots to do for the trip , then his arrival . They throw up a few shacks for a settlement , we pay some wampum to the local tribe to burn them down and the picture is finished . " " Good idea . Plenty wood in Vinland , " Ottar said . Jens Lyn started to protest , then shrugged . " Who am I to complain . If he is fool enough to do it , to enable you to make a picture ? who am I to quibble . There is no known saga about a visit of someone named Ottar to Vinland , but since there seems to be no evidence to the veracity of the other sagas I do not think I can complain . " " Finish lunch now , " Ottar said . Barney went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armful of folders . " I did n't want to bother you while you were eating , " she said . ' Why not ? After what I just ate my digestion will never be the same again . Do you know what trilobites are ? "  | " Sure . Big squiggly things that we net on Old Catalina . It 's a lot of fun . You catch them at night with a flashlight then have a barbecue with beer . You should ? " " No I should n't . What did you want to see me about ? " " It 's the time cards and the records , the weekends in particular . You see everyone here has been taking their weekend time , what would be their Saturdays and their Sundays , on Old Catalina ? everyone except you , that is . You have n't had a day off in the five weeks we 've been here . " " Do n't suffer for me , Betty darling . I 'm not going to relax until this picture is in the can . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divers would like to stay more than two days nt a time . They have asked for four and said they will give up next weekend and work right through . My records are loused up as it is and this will wreck merry hell with them . What can I do ? " " Walk with me over to Ottar 's house , I can use the exercise . We 'll go along the beach . " Barney thought in silence for a minute as they came down to the shore . " Here 's what . Forget all the days of the week jazz and work it by number alone . Anyone who works five days in a row gets the following two off . If they want four days together then they have to work ten days straight , then have days eleven through fourteen off . Their day records will be in your books and on the time cards , since they 're punching in here and in Catalina both . Since two days or four days away means only a five-minute ride on the time platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day as far as I 'm concerned  --  and that is all that counts . You do your record-keeping like that , and I 'll straighten it out with 1 .. M. and the payroll department when we get back . " They were almost to the headland that bounded the cove near Ottar 's house when the jeep bounced down the track to the beach behind them , its horn blowing steadily . " Now what ? " Barney asked . " Trouble , it has to be trouble . No one ever rushes up to give me good news . " He stood , looking unhappy , while they waited for the jeep to arrive . Dallas was driving , and he braked to a stop without kicking too many rocks around . " Some kind of ship coming into the bay , " Dallas said . " They passed on the word and everyone is looking for you . "  | " Well you found me . What is it , more Viking raiders like the last time ? " " All I know I told , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was right about the trouble , " Barney said , climbing into the jeep . " You get back to the camp , Betty , in case there is any roughhouse . " They saw the ship as soon as they came around the headland , a large vessel with a broad sail , coming in briskly before the following wind . The film company people were on the hill behind the house , staying together , but all of the locals had run down to the beach , where they were waving their arms and shouting . " More murder , " Barney said . " And there 's my paparazzo cameraman on the spot ready to capture all the gore in technicolor . Get down there and let 's see if we can stop it this time . " Gino had set his camera up on the beach where he could shoot both the welcoming committee and the arriving ship . That things were better than Barney had thought was obvious when they got closer , because all the northmen were laughing and waving , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have rushed there as soon as he had heard of the arrival , was knee-deep in the water , shouting loudly . As the ship neared the shore the big sail was lowered , but the vessel had enough way to beach itself , scraping up the gravel and shuddering to a halt . A tall man with an immense red beard , who had been at the steering oar , ran forward and leaped into the surf near Ottar . They shouted greetings and embraced each other strongly . " Zoom in on the bear-hugging , " Barney called out to Gino . " And I wo n't have to get a release or pay a cent to any of them , " he muttered happily to himself as he watched the busy scene . The film people were drifting down to the shore now that it was obvious there would be no violence . Kegs of ale were being rolled out by the housecarls . Barney walked over and joined Jens Lyn , who was watching Ottar and the newcomer smite each other on the biceps , with shouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Barney asked .  | " They are old friends and they are telling one another how glad they are to meet again . " " That 's obvious enough . Who 's Redbeard ? " " Ottar called him Thorhall , so it may be Thorhall Gamlisson from Iceland . He and Ottar used to go viking together and Ottar always talked about him in a very friendly manner . " " What 's all the shouting about now ? " " Thorhall is saying how glad he is that Ottar wanted to buy his ship because he , Thorhall , is looking forward to going back to Norway and he can use Ottar 's longship for that . He 's asking now for the other half of the money . " Ottar spat out a single , loud , sharp-edged word . " I know that one , " Barney said . " We 've been here long enough to pick up at least that much of the language . " The shouting was louder and was beginning to get a nasty tone to it . " Ottar is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his head because he never bought any ship . Thorhall says that Ottar was singing in a different manner three months ago when he came and accepted hospitality and bought the ship . Ottar is sure now that Thorhall is possessed because he has n't been off this island for over a year , and he suggests that a hole be made in Thorhall 's head to let some of the bad spirits out . Thorhall now suggests that as soon as he gets his ax he 'll show which head to open ... " Something clicked in Barney 's mind and he roused himself from the spectator attitude that had possessed him while he watched the two heavyweights square off and prepare for a murderous slugging match . " Stop ! " he shouted , but they ignored him completely . He tried gain in Old Norse , " Nemit sta5arl " 2 with the same result . " Fire couple of shots into the air , " he called over to Dallas . " Break this thing up before it gets started . " Tex fired at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the water . The two Vikings turned , their persimal differences forgotten for the moment . Barney hurried over . Evil spirits . 2 Stop ! ( You , plural. )  | " Ottar , listen to me , I think I know what this is all about . " " I know what 's it about , " Ottar rumbled , clenching one sledgehammer-sized fist . " Nobody calls Ottar a ? " " It 's not as bad as it sounds  --  just a difference of opinion . " Ile tugged at Ottar 's arm without budging him a fraction of an inch . " Doc , take Thorhall up to the house and buy him a couple of beers while I talk to Ottar . " Dallas fired a few more shots to keep the conversation going and eventually the two men were separated and Thorhall hurried off for a drink . " Could you sail to Vinland in your own ship ? " Barney asked . Ottar , still angry , had to blink and shake his head for a few seconds before he knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ship ? " he finally said . Barney patiently repeated the question and Ottar shook his head in a very positive no . " Stupid question , " he said . " Longships for raiding , up rivers , along the shore . No good in big seas . For going across the ocean you must have a knorr . This is knorr . " The differences were obvious now that Barney was looking for them . Where the dragon-prowed Viking ship was long and narrow , this knorr was wide and stood high out of the water  --  and was at least a hundred feet long . It appeared a sound vessel in every respect . " Could you go to Vinland in this ship ? " Barney asked . " Sure , " Ottar said , glancing up toward Thorhall and clenching his fists . " Then why do n't you buy it from Thorhall ? " " You too ! " Ottar roared at Barney . " Wait  --  hold on , just listen . If I kick in part of the money , can you afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marks . " " Yachting is an expensive hobby . Can you buy it ? " " Could be . " " That 's agreed then . If he says you bought it a couple of months ago then you must have  --  do n't hit me ! I 'll give you the money and  | the Prof will take you back to Iceland to make the deal and things will be all okay . " " What you talking about ? " Barney turned to Jens Lyn , who had listened to the entire conVcrsation . " You 're following me , are n't you , Jens ? We agreed this u , rning that Ottar was to sail to Vinland . He tells me now he ceds a different ship for the job . Thorhall says he came and bought his one two months ago . So he must have done it . So let 's arrange nick for him to do it  --  before this thing gets any more compliated . Take Dallas along for protection and explain the whole ing to Hewett . You better use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to Iceland a couple of months ago , buy the ship , rrange for it to get here today , then get right back . Should n't take ou more than a half an hour . Pick up some marks from the cashier o buy the ship with . And do n't forget to talk to Thorhall before ou go and find out how much Ottar paid so you can bring the ' gilt amount . " " What you are saying is a paradox , " Jens said . " I do n't believe this s possible ? " " It does n't matter what you believe . You 're on salary . Just do it . I 'll oil Thorhall up so he 'll be in a better mood when you get back . " The jeep pulled away and Barney went to liven up the dispirited rinking party . The northmen stayed carefully in two groups , the cwcomers behind their leader , and there were many black looks ncl very little drinking . Gino came up with a bottle he had pulled out of his lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked . " Real grappa from the Id country . I ca n't drink the local brew . " " Your stuff is almost as bad , " Barney told him . " But try Thorhall , tell probably like it . " Gino pulled out the corncob cork and took a long drag , then ) wld it out to Thorhall . " Drekkit ! " he said in passable Old Norse , veri1 ' velkomnir til Orkneyja. " 3 The red-bearded Viking accepted the hospitality , took a drink , coughed , looked closely at the bottle then drank again . e " Drink ! " . . . " and welcome to the Orkney Islands . "  | The jeep returned in less than the half an hour Barney had estimated , but there had still been enough time to get the party rolling , the ale flowing and most of the grappa finished . There was a marked pause in the joviality when Ottar strode over to them . Thorhall stood up quickly and put his back to the wall , but Ottar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a moment the difficulty was over , everyone relaxed and the party really got rolling . " How did it go ? " Barney asked Jens Lyn , who climbed from the jeep with much more care than Ottar had shown . In the few minutes he had been away he had grown a three-day beard and developed great black pouches under his bloodshot eyes . " We found Thorhall easily enough , " he said hoarsely , " and received an enthusiastic reception and had no difficulty purchasing the ship . But we could not leave without a celebration , it went on day and night , and it was more than two days before Ottar fell asleep at the table and we could carry him out and bring him back . Look at him , still drinking , how does he do it ? " Jens shuddered . " Clean living and plenty of fresh air , " Barney said . The shouting and happy northern oaths were growing louder and Ottar showed no signs of weakening under the renewed partying pleasures . " It looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be working today , so we might as well call a meeting and lay our plans for the filming in Vinland and aboard this ship ? what did you call it ? " " A knorr . Nominative , her er knorrur , accusative , um knorr ? ' " Stop ! Remember , I do n't tell you how to make movies . I want to take a look at the knorr , she appears steady enough for a camera , and see how many scenes we can use it in . Then we 'll have to make plans for meeting in Vinland , keeping track of the ship somehow . There 's plenty of work to do . We 're over the hump and on the downgrade now  --  if nothing else goes wrong . " A gull screamed loudly and Barney quickly reached out and knocked on the stained wood of the knorr 's hull .  | " I kill you , you mannhundr , i throw water in my face ! " Ottar shouted . " Cut , " Barney said , then walked down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , Stay away from that sail  --  I ' 11 kill the first man that lays a hand on her . Full sail ! I can smell land , I tell you . Do n't give up hope . ' Now that is what you 're supposed to say . ' I'here 's nothing at all about water in your speech . " " He threw the water on purpose , " Ottar said angrily . " Of course he did . You 're at sea , miles from land , in the middle of a storm , the storm blows the spray into your face . That must happen to you all the time at sea . You do n't get angry every time it happens and call the ocean bad names , now do you ? " " Not at sea . On dry land in front of my house . " There was no point in explaining again about how they were making a picture , and how the picture was supposed to be real , and ! tow the actors must think of it as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times too often . Movies meant nothing to this chunk of Viking virility . What did mean anything to him ? Eating , drinking and the simpler pleasures . And pride . " I 'm surprised that you let a little thing like some water bother you , " Barney said , then turned to the propman . " Give me a full bucket , will you Eddie , right in the kisser . " " Whatever you say , Mr. Hendrickson . " Eddie took a long-arm swing and hurled the contents of the bucket into the air stream from the wind machine , which blew the solid spray into Barney 's face . t An Old Norse term of insult that can be translated as " man-dog " but is closer in meaning to the German schweinhund.  | " Great , " he said , trying to keep his jaw from shaking . " Very refreshing . I do n't mind water in my face . " His smile had a ghastly set to it because he was half frozen to death . The September evenings in the Orkneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing air cut through his wet clothes like a knife . " Throw water on me ! " Ottar ordered . " I 'll show you about water . " " Coming up  --  and do n't forget your lines . " Barney stepped back out of camera range and the projectionist called over to him : " Reel is almost empty on the back projection , Mr. Hendrickson . " " Rewind it then , hurry up or we 'll be here all night . " The heaving , storm-tossed sea vanished from the back projection screen and the company relaxed . The propmen , on their platform next to the knorr , switched on the electric pump to fill their barrel with more sea water . Ottar stood alone , at the steering oar of the beached ship , and frowned angrily at the world . The big spotlights made a brilliantly lit stage of the knorr and the bit of beach beside it ; the rest of the world was in darkness . " Give me a cigarette , " Barney said to his secretary , " mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hendrickson , " the projectionist shouted . " Great . Positions everyone , camera . " The two propmen threw their weight onto the long levers so that the bit of false decking that Ottar stood on pitched and tossed . " Action . " With jaws clamped , Ottar stared into the teeth of the gale , fighting the steering oar that a man out of sight below was trying to pull out of his hands . " Stay away from the sail ! " he shouted . " By Thor I 'll kill any man that touches the sail . " The water sprayed over him and he laughed coldly . " I do n't mind the water  --  I like water ! Full sail  --  I can smell land . Keep hope ! " " Cut , " Barney ordered . " He 's a great ad libber , " Charley Chang said . That was n't quite the way I wrote it . " " We 'll leave it in , Charley . Any time he gets that close I call it a bull's-eye . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wraps it up for today . Morning call at seven-thirty so we can get the early light . Jens , Amory  --  I want to see you up here before you go . "  | They stood in the waist of the ship , near the big mast , and Barney kicked the deck with his heel . " Can this thing really make it to North America ? " he asked . " There is no doubt of it , " Jens Lyn said . " These Norse knorr were better ocean-going vessels  --  and faster ones  --  than the ones Columbus had , or the Spanish and British ships that sailed to the new world five hundred years later . The history of these ships is well recorded in the sagas . " " Remember , we 've come to doubt some of the sagas of late ? " " There is other evidence . In 1932 a replica of one of these craft , just sixty feet long , made the westward passage along one of the routes Columbus used  --  and improved on Columbus ' best time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about these vessels , for instance it is believed that they could only run before the wind with their large , square sail . Yet they could  --  they can  --  sail within five points of the wind . In fact , most interesting , the point of sailing is called beita , from which we derive the modern term of beating ' up to windward . " " I 'll take your word for it . What 's that stench ? " " The cargo , " Jens said , pointing to the large mounds with tightlashed coverings that stood along the deck . " These ships do not have holds , so all the cargo is carried on deck . " " What 's the cargo  --  Limburger cheese ? " " No , mostly food , cattle feed , ale , that sort of thing . The odor comes from the hide tarpaulins that are waterproofed with seal-oil tar and butter . " " Very ingenious . " Barney pointed into the dark mouth of the open well behind the mast . " What happened to the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to get to Vinland or we have no picture . I want every precaution taken to make sure of that . Amory said a pump would be an improvement  --  so where is it ? " " Ottar refused to have it , " Jens said . " He was very suspicious of it and was afraid it would break and he would n't know how to fix it . You can say one thing for the system they use , one man standing in the well and filling a bucket and another throwing it overboard with this wooden arm , it may be crude but it always works . "  | " As long as they have buckets and men , which I 'm sure they 'll have enough of . All right , I 'll buy that . I do n't want to teach Ottar his business  --  I just want to make sure he gets there . Where is this navigation thing you rigged , Amory ? " " It 's sealed inside the hull where it ca n't be tampered with , and there 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Will it work ? " " I do n't see why not . These northmen are very good navigators in their own right . Their sea passages are usually very short so they set their course and sail from a landmark astern to one ahead . They know how the ocean currents run and the habits of the sea birds so they can follow them to land . In addition to which they can estimate their latitude very closely by the height of the North Star above the horizon . Any assistance we give them should fit within the system they already use , so it can be an additional help  --  but one that would n't cause a tragedy if it failed . The most obvious aid would seem to be a simple magnetic compass , but that would be too foreign to them , and a compass is particularly difficult to use this far north where there are so many magnetic anomalies and where the difference between true north and magnetic north is so marked . " " That was what you did n't do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gyrocompass into the stern up against the hull here , along with a load of new long-life nicad batteries . We 'll turn it on when they leave and it should run at least a month before the batteries poop out . The gyrocompass is one of the new microminiaturized , no-tumble , no-precession things developed for rockets . Then right here , set into the rail by the steersman , is the compass repeater . " Barney looked in through the thick glass covering at the white arrow clearly visible against the black dial . The dial was completely blank except for a single large white spot . " I hope this means more to Ottar than it does to me , " he said . " He likes it a great deal , " Amory said . " In fact he is quite enthusiastic . Maybe if I draw a sketch it would be clearer . " He took a felt-tipped pen and a notepad from his pocket and quickly made a simple drawing .  | " The dotted line represents sixty degrees north latitude , and you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail to reach Cape Farewell here on the tip of Greenland , sailing due west and estimating the height of the North Star to keep him on the latitude . What we will do is set the gyrocompass so that it always points to Cape Farewell . When the pointer on the repeater dial touches the spot  --  and they both are luminescent and glow at night  --  the ship is headed in the right direction . They will be guided right to the tip of Greenland . " " Where they are going to spend the winter with some of Ottar 's relatives . Fine so far  --  but what happens in the spring when they have to go on ? This sixty-degree course will take them right into Hudson Bay , " " We will have to reset the compass , " Amory said . " Ottar will wait for us and we 'll put in new batteries and point the compass at the Straight of Belle Isle , right here . He should have enough faith in the instrument by then to follow it  --  even though his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East Greenland Current does flow in the same direction and he is familiar with that . he 'll have no trouble reaching either the coast of Labrador or Newfoundland . " " He 'll find Vinland all right , " Barney said . " But how do we find him ? " " There is a radio responder sealed in with the batteries . It will automatically send back a signal when it detects our radio signal .  | Then it is a simple matter of our using the radio direction finder . " " Sounds foolproof . Let 's hope it is . " Barney looked along the lowbulwarked deck and up at the thin mast . " I would n't even want to sail this thing across the bay , but then I 'm no Viking . Tomorrow 's the day . We 've done all the shooting we need to here . Launch the ship in the morning and we 'll run it in and out of the harbor a few times , shoot from the shore and from aboard ship . Then turn on your homing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , Amory , or we 're all going to stay in Vinland and set up housekeeping with the Indians . If I ca n't bring back this picture with me there 's just no point in going back . " Gino popped his head up out of the bailing well like a jackin-the-box and waved . " They can run it up now , I 'm ready . " Barney turned to Ottar , who leaned negligently on the tiller of the steer-board , and said , " Pass the word , will you . " The tired seamen grumbled darkly as they heaved once more on the windlass . They had been running the big square sail up and down and tacking about the bay since dawn , while the shiphandling sequences were being shot . As the drum of the windlass turned , the oiled walrus-hide rope creaked through the hole in the top of the mast , hauling up the dead weight of the bulky woolen sail , made even heavier by the seal-hide strips that had been sewed on to give it shape . Gino trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose . " The time is late , " Ottar said . " If we sail today we better sail soon . " We 're just about finished , " Barney told him . " I want to get a good shot of you leaving the bay , and that can be the last one . " " You shot that shot this morning , sailing into dawn you said . " " That was from the shore . Now I want to get you and Slithey at the tiller as you sail from your home into the unknown . . . " " No woman at no tiller on my ship . " " She does n't have to steer the thing . She 'll just stand by you , maybe hold your arm , that 's not much to ask . " Ottar shouted a flood of orders as the sail reached the top of the mast . The halyard that had pulled it up was secured to act as a  | backstay and unfastened from the drum of the windlass , then the anchor rope was attached in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Gino  --  the anchor was hauled up and pulled aboard , a seaweed-hung kilik made from a large stone held in a framework of wooden rods . The ship was beginning to gather way as the wind filled the sail and Barney hurried the camera into position . " Slithey , " he called out . " Onstage , and make it fast . " It was n't easy to get from the fore to the rear deck of the knorr when she was fully loaded . Since there were no holds , and only two tiny sleeping cabins , not only was the cargo packed on deck , but in and around it were over forty people , six stunted cows and a lashed-down bull , a small flock of sheep , and two goats that stood high on the peak of the cargo . The bellowing , baaing and shouting made it hard to think . Slithey staggered her way through all of this and Barney helped her up onto the tiny deck . She was wearing a white gown with a low-cut kirtle , and looked very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosy by the wind . " Stand up there next to Ottar , " Barney told her , then moved himself out of camera range . " Camera . " " Good shot of the back of their heads , " Gino said . " Ottar , " Barney shouted , " for Thor 's sake will you turn around , you 're facing the wrong way . " " Facing the right way to steer , " Ottar said stubbornly , holding onto the handle of the steer-board that came across the deck from the side , and facing full astern toward the vanishing land . " When leaving land always look at it , making sure of direction . That is the way it is done . " With a certain amount of pleading , cajoling  --  and bribery  --  Barney managed to get Ottar and Slithey to the far side of the handle where Ottar had to steer by looking over his shoulder . Slithey stood next to him , her hand resting on the wood next to his , and they got their shots of the receding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ottar relievedly went back to the correct position . " I put you ashore around the point , " he said .  | " Suits , " Barney said . " I 'll get on the radio and have one of the trucks waiting for us . " Slinging the camera overboard was the only tricky part , and Barney stayed aboard after the others had disembarked , waiting until it was safely ashore . " See you in Vinland , " he said , putting out his hand . " Have a good trip . " " Sure , " Ottar said , crushing Barney 's hand in his . " You find a good spot for me . Water , grass for animals , plenty hardwood trees . " " I 'll do my best , " Barney said , shaking the blood back into his whitened fingers . The Viking did not waste any time . As soon as Barney had jumped ashore he ordered , with relieved shouts and loud curses , that the beitass be rigged in position . This long pole fitted into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the sail so that it bellied into the wind . The ship pulled free of the land for the last time and headed for the open sea , the shouts and animal sounds fading into the distance . " They better make it , " Barney said , half aloud . " They just had better make it . " He turned away abruptly and climbed into the truck . " Get me to the time platform  --  and step on it , " he told the driver . He could eliminate at least half of his fears at once by finding out if the ship would make a safe arrival in Iceland . The time machine did not simplify his problems , but it at least made the waiting and nail-chewing period a good deal shorter . The camp was in a turmoil as they drove up , with the tents being struck and everything loaded for the move to the new location , but Barney had no eyes for it ; he tapped impatiently on the window frame . The entire operation was waste motion if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car while it was still braking to a stop at the time platform . The jeep was already aboard and Tex and Jens Lyn were watching the professor charge the vremeatron batteries . " Where 's Dallas ? " Barney asked . Tex pointed with his thumb . " In the can . " " At a time like this ! " " We can go without him , " Tex said . " It does n't need the two of  | us for this job . All we have to do is deliver Ottar 's winter ration of whiskey once we know he arrived okay . " " You 'll do what I say . I want two men along for protection , just in case . I do n't want any slip-ups . Here he comes now  --  get going . " Barney stepped away from the time platfolm as the professor activated the field . As always  --  from the observer 's point of view  --  the voyage seemed to take no more than a fraction of a second . The platform vanished and reappeared again a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hewett was sealed into his instrumentation shack , while the rest were in the jeep , which had its top up and side curtains attached . Almost a foot of snow blanketed everything , and a flurry of airborne snow blew out of the vremeatron 's field and coated the grass around it . " Well ? " Barney shouted . " What happened ? Come out of there and report . " Dallas climbed down from the jeep and trudged over through the snow . " That Iceland , " he said . " What a climate they got there in October . " " Save the weather report . Are Ottar and the ship all right ? " " Everything 's fine . The ship is up on the shore for the winter , and when we left Ottar and his uncle were getting smashed on the booze we brought . For a while there we worried he would never show , the Prof had to make four jumps to find him . Seems he stopped for some time in the Faeroes . Between you and me I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thirst had n't got the better of him . Once you get hooked on the distilled stuff , the homebrew does n't seem so hot . " Barney relaxed , for the first time in a long time he realized , as the tension faded . He even managed a slight smile . " Good . Now let 's get the company moved while we still have some daylight at this end . " He climbed aboard the time platform , walking carefully in the jeep 's tracks so he would n't get his shoes full of melting snow , and opened the door of the control room . " Got enough juice for another jump ? " he asked . " With the motor-generator going the batteries are charged at all times , a great improvement . " " Then take us ahead in time to next spring , the year 1005 ,  | and land us at a good spot in Newfoundland , one of the sites you and Lyn searched when you were looking for the Viking settlements . " I know just the place , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ideal location . " He set up the coordinates on the board and activated the vremeatron . There was the now familiar sensation of temporal displacement and the time platform settled onto a rocky shore . Waves broke , almost over them , and a smother of spray hissed down into the snow . A dark cliff loomed above , crumbling and sinister . " What do you call this ? " Barney shouted above the boom of the breaking waves . " Wrong coordinates , " the professor called back . " A slight mistake . This is a different site . " " You had to tell me ! Let 's go before we wash out to sea . " The second time jump brought them to a grassy meadow that overlooked a small bay . Tall trees marched up the bowl of the hills around them in solid ranks , and down through the meadow to the sea there twisted a clear and swift-running brook . " This is more like it , " Barney said as the others climbed out of the jeep . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sniffed the air and smiled . " I remember this well , one of the first sites we checked . This is Epaves Bay , really an arm of Sacred Bay on the northernmost tip of Newfoundland . That is the Strait of Belle Isle out there . The reason we investigated this site ? " " Great . Looks like just what we want . And is n't the gadget in Ottar 's ship zeroed in on this strait ? " " That is correct . " " Then this is the spot for us . " Barney bent and picked up a handful of waterlogged snow from the platform and began forming it into a ball . " We 'll leave the area down by the mouth of the stream there for Ottar . Then set our camp up over there to the right , at the top of the meadow . It looks flat enough to keep the twentieth century off camera . Let 's go . Back to move camp . And I want this slush shoveled off first so we do n't have anyone breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lace on his boot and the target was too broad to resist . Barney hurled his snowball square into the middle of the taut denim . " Here we go , Vikings , " he said happily . " Let 's go settle Vinland. "  | All the world was gray , silent , damp , pressing in on them . The fob muffled everything , soaking up sound as well as sight so that the ocean before them was an unseen presence until a low wave ap peared , breaking silently into froth as it rushed up the slope of the sandy beach almost to their feet . The truck , no more than ten feel away , was only a dark shape in the mist . " Give it another try , " Barney said , squinting into the damp wall of blankness . Dallas , protected from the weather by an immense black ponchc and wide-brimmed Stetson , raised the carbon dioxide pressure flasl with the foghorn attached and opened the valve . The moaning blare of sound throbbed out across the water , still echoing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you hear that ? " Barney asked . Dallas cocked his head and listened . " Nothing , just the waves . ' " I swear I heard splashing , like someone rowing . Give it another blast , and keep it up , every minute , and listen closely in between . ' The foghorn sounded again as Barney trudged up the slope to the canvas-shrouded army truck and looked into the back . " An ) change ? " he asked . Amory Blestead shook his head no without turning away from the radio receiver . He had earphones clamped to his head and way slowly turning the knob of the directional loop antenna on top of the set . It rotated in one direction , then in the other , and Amor ) looked up and tapped the pointer on the base of the loop . " As far as I can tell the ship has n't moved , " he said . " The bear ing is still the same . They 're probably waiting for the fog to lift . ' " How far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've told you a hundred times I can tell direction but not range with this setup . I ca n't read anything from the signal strength of the responder , could be a mile , could be fifty . The volume has picked up since we first heard it three days ago , so they 're nearer , but that 's all I know . And I ca n't work out the distance from the bearings because there are too many variables . We 've been cutting back and forth so I ca n't use the truck 's speedometer to get a baseline , and the Viking ship must have moved ? " " You 've convinced me . That 's what you ca n't tell me  --  but what can you tell me ? " " The same as before . The ship sailed from Greenland eighteen days ago . I aligned the gyrocompass with the Strait of Belle Isle , put in new batteries and turned on the responder and tested it , and we watched them leave . " " You and Lyn told me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worrying a hangnail with his teeth . " We said it might take only four days , but if the weather got bad , the winds changed or anything like that , it could take a lot longer . And it has . But we have picked up a signal from the responder , which means they 've made the crossing safely . " " That was two days ago  --  what have you done for me lately ? " " Speaking as an old friend , Barney , this time traveling is doing absolutely nothing for your nerves . We 're supposed to be making a film , remember ? All this other stuff we do is above and beyond the call of duty  --  not that anyone is complaining . But off with the pressure and make it easier on all of us , as well as yourself . " " You 're right , you 're right , " Barney said , which was about as close as he could ever come to an apology . " But two days  --  the waiting gets to you after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about . With this fog and no wind to speak of , laying off an unknown coast  --  they 're not going to do any moving about . There 's no point in rowing around if you do n't know where you 're going . Right now , according to the direction finder , we are as close to them as we can get on dry land and when the fog lifts we can guide them in ? " " Hey ! " Dallas shouted from the beach , " I hear something , out there in the water . "  | Barney skittered and half slid down the slope to the beach . Dallas had his hand cupped to his ear , listening intently . " Quiet , " he said , " and see if you can hear it . Out there in the fog . I swear I heard water splashing , like rowing , and voices talking . " A wave broke and receded , and for a moment there was a hushed silence  --  and the slapping of oars could be plainly heard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice even louder . " Over here  --  this way ! " Dallas shouted too , the foghorn forgotten for the moment as a dark shape loomed out of the fog over the sea . " It 's the boat , " Dallas said , " the one they had slung on deck . " They called and waved as a sudden rift opened in the mist , giving them a clear view of the craft and its occupants . The boat was made of some kind of dark skins and the three men in it were wearing fur parkas with the hoods thrown back , uncovering their long black hair . " They 're not Vikings , " Tex said , waving his arm so that his black poncho flapped . " Who are they ? " When he did this the two men in the rear dug their round paddles into the water , but the man who was kneeling in the front whipped his arm forward and something flashed through the air towards Dallas . " They got me ! " Dallas shouted and fell over on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . The foghorn hit the beach next to him and the valve opened and the sound blared , roaring out across the water . When it did the men in the boat reversed their paddling with vigor and within a few strokes had vanished again into the fog . Only a few seconds had passed from the time they appeared until the instant they vanished , and Barney stood , stunned by the impact , deafened by the wave of sound . It made thinking difficult and he had to stop it before he turned to Dallas , who still lay , unmoving , on his back , looking as dead as a kipper . " Pull this thing out , will you ? " Dallas said in a calm voice . " I ' 11 hurt you  --  kill you  --  I ca n't . . . " " It 's not as bad as it looks . But make sure you pull up and do n't push down . "  | Barney gingerly tugged on the wooden handle of the spear and it came up easily enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally had to brace his feet and pull hard with both hands . It came free and tore a great strip of rubberized cloth from the poncho . Dallas sat up and lifted the poncho and ripped open his jacket and shirt . " Look at that , " he said , pointing to a red scratch on his ribs . " Another couple of inches to the right and it would have ventilated me . That hook was digging into me when I moved and felt a lot worse than it looks now , let me tell you . " He touched the sharp barb that projected from the ivory head of the spear . " What happened ? " Amory called out , running down the slope from the truck . " What 's that ? Was n't there a boat ? " Dallas stood and tucked his shirt back in . " We have been contacted by the locals , " he said . " Looks like the Indians or the Eskimos or somebody got here before the Vikings . " " Are you hurt bad ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name on it . " He chuckled and looked closely at the weapon . " Nice job of carving and good balance . " " I do n't like this , " Barney said , groping out a damp cigarette . " Did n't I have enough trouble as it was ? I just hope they do n't find the Viking ship . " " I hope they do , " Dallas said with relish . " I do n't think they would give Ottar much trouble . " " What I wanted to tell you , " Amory said , " from up there in the truck you can see the fog breaking up , and the sun coming through in patches . " " And about time , " Barney said , dragging deeply on the cigarette so that it fizzled and crackled . Once the sun began burning away the mist it cleared quickly , helped by the west wind that blew steadily in their faces . Within a half hour it had lifted completely and there , clearly visible about a mile offshore , was Ottar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast on that thing , " he said . " Once they look this way they 'll see the truck . " Dallas kept triggering the CO2 cylinder until it finally squawked  | and died , and it had the desired effect . They could see the big sail narrow , then widen again as it was pushed around , and the white bone of foam appeared at the bow as the ship gathered way . There was no sign of the skin boat , which seemed to have vanished as suddenly as it had appeared . A few hundred yards offshore the knorr turned and hove to , sail flapping , rocking in the gentle swell . There was a great deal of arm waving and incomprehensible shouting . " Come on , " Barney shouted . " Come ashore . Why do n't you beach that thing ? " " They must have their reasons , " Amory said . " The kind of shore here or something . " " Well how do they expect me to get out there ? " " Swim maybe , " Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog-paddle over and give them a message . " " Zook , " Amory pointed , " they 've got a second boat aboard . " The knorr 's own boat , a twenty-foot-long miniature of the mother ship , was still visible on deck , but a smaller boat was being dropped over the side . " Something familiar about that thing , " Dallas said . Barney squinted at it . " You 're dead right . It looks just like the one the redskins had . " Two men climbed into the bobbing craft and began to row toward the shore . Ottar was in the bow , waving his paddle at them , and a few moments later he and his companions beached the skin boat and splashed ashore . " Welcome to Vinland , " Barney said . " How was the trip ? " " Coast here no good , no grass for the animals , trees no good , " Ottar said . " Did you find a good place ? " " The best , down the coast a few miles , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Greenland ? " " Wind the wrong way , very slow . Plenty of floating ice and seal and we saw two skmlling.1 They were killing seals and tried to l Barbarians . Specially used about the natives of Greenland and North America .  | row away but we went after them , and when they threw spears we killed them . Ate their seals . Took their boat . " " I know what you mean , we just met some of their relatives . " " Where 's this good place you found ? " " Right down the coast , around the headland and past the islands  --  you ca n't miss it . Here , take Amory back in the ship with you , he 'll show you the place . " " Not me , " Amory said , raising his hands and backing away . " I just look at boats and I get green . My stomach would be turned inside out and I 'd be dead three minutes after I left the shore . " With the regular soldier 's innate capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way up the slope when Barney turned toward him . " I 'm a truck driver , " Dallas said . " I 'll be waiting in the cab . " " All employees , loyal and true , " Barney said coldly . " I get the message , boys , do n't repeat it . All right , Amory , tell the truck driver to get to the camp . We 'll come in the ship as fast as we can and get Ottar 's people ashore , and maybe someday soon we can start making a movie again . Wake up Gino and tell him to get up on the hill , that spot we picked out , and shoot the ship when it comes in . And make sure those tire tracks along the beach are smoothed over . " " Right , Barney , just as you say . I wish I could go in your place , but me and ships . . . " " Yes , sure . Get going . " Barney got soaked getting into the boat , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been amputated below the knees . The boat , just seal skins stretched over a bent-wood frame , was wobbly and skittered over the water like a great bug and he had to squat in the bottom and hold onto the sides for support . When they reached the knorr he could n't get out of the lurching craft and over the high side of the ship until strong hands reached down and hauled him up like a sack of grain . " Hananit ! SWustu handartokin , " 2 Ottar roared , and his men shouted back happily as they ran to swing the ship about for the 2 " Come on ! The last bit of work . "  | last leg of her voyage . Barney retreated to the aft deck so he would n't be trampled in the rush of activity . The seamen were shifting the beitass pole and the women screamed as they scattered out of the way , while the tethered sheep could only protest noisily when they were kicked aside . The crowded deck area resembled a seething farmyard , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of all the hubbub one of the women was hunkered over milking a cow into a wooden bucket . When the ship turned , the wind carried the odor of the bilges to Barney and the barnyard resemblance was even more apparent . Once they were under way things settled down and even the animals returned quietly to their feed . The following wind not only filled the sail but it drove most of the odors ahead of the ship and the air on the rear deck was fresh and clear . The cutwater at the bow hissed through the long Atlantic swells , churning up a rounded , foaming bow wave that rushed along the sides of the ship . Riding light as a cork over the sea , the knorr was a graceful and practical vessel , at home in her true element . " Land looks good , " Ottar said , steering with a light touch on the tiller bar , as he pointed with his free hand toward the shore , where large trees and patches of meadow were beginning to appear . " Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " it 's even better there . " They were passing the islands that stood outside the bay and the animals caught the scent of the fresh grass and set up a clamor . The bull , hobbled and tied , pulled at its rope and bellowed and the women were shouting with joy while the men were singing . The voyage was coming to an end and the landfall was a good one . Even Barney felt the excitement as Epaves Bay opened up before them , with the tall trees rising up the hills to the blueness of the skies , and the fresh spring green of the grass meadows by the stream . Then he picked out the dark spot of his cameraman and the jeep on the slope and he remembered the film . He knelt behind the bulwark and stayed low and out of sight as he pulled himself over to a horned Viking helmet that was tied by a thong to a hole in one of the timbers . Only when this was settled clammily on his head did he raise up high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving the ship at full speed toward the mouth of the stream and all aboard were shouting with excitement . The knorr scraped the sandy bottom , was lifted clear by a wave and carried forward , then touched bottom again and shuddered to a halt . Without bothering to lower sail , the crew and passengers were leaping into the surf and wading ashore , laughing with joy , splashing through the stream and into the meadow beyond . Ottar tore up a great handful of the knee-high grass , smelt it , then chewed a bit of it . Some of the others were rolling on the ground , taking an animal pleasure in the solid earth after all the days aboard the ship . " Great ! " Barney shouted , " absolutely great . The landing in Vinland after months at sea , the first settlers in the new world . A great shot , a great historical shot . " He made his way through the frenzied animals to the bow and stood up where he could be seen by the cameraman and waved his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " he shouted . " Get down here . " His voice could n't carry but the gesture was unmistakable . Gino stood up from behind the camera and waved back , then began to load the camera into the jeep . A few minutes later it churned along the beach and Barney jumped down from the ship and ran to meet it . " Hold it , " he called to Dallas , who was driving . " Swing around and get up on that bank there , directly opposite the stream . Gino , set the camera up on the top so we can get a head-on shot of the ship coming in , people running off , right into the camera , streaming by on both sides . " " Absolutely a tremendous picture , " Gino said , " the way they came out of the ship . Give me ten minutes . " " You got it . It 'll take longer than that to set the shot up again . Hold it , " he ordered Dallas , who was starting to swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What bottle ? " Dallas asked , with open and innocent eyes . " The bottle you always got with you , come on . A loan , you 'll get it back later . " The stunt man reluctantly produced a black-labeled , one-quarterempty bottle of whiskey from under the seat .  | ' Well , well , " Barney said coldly . " Been getting into the private stock . " " I ran out , an accident , I 'll pay it back . " " And I thought I had the only key to this stuff . The things the Army taught people ! Get moving . " He stuck the bottle inside his jacket and walked back to Ottar , who was kneeling by the stream and snuffling up water from his cupped hands . " Get them back aboard , will you , " Barney said . " We want to shoot the landing again , from much closer up . " Ottar looked up and blinked , wiping the water from his flowing beard with the back of his hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on land . They wo n't go back onto the ship . " " They will if you tell them to . " " Why should I tell them to ? A nuts idea . " " You tell them to because you 're back on the job . Here 's some salary . " He passed the bottle to Ottar , who smiled broadly and raised it to his lips . Barney finished convincing him while he drank . It was n't easy to get them back aboard , even for Ottar . He finally lost his temper , something he did readily , stretched one man on the sand with a blow to the chest and kicked two of the women in the right direction . After this , though there was much grumbling and shouting complaint , they pulled themselves aboard and unshipped the oars . The effort of dragging the knorr free quieted the rest of the rebellion . Onshore , as soon as the camera was unloaded , Barney sent the jeep racing back to the camp . It had returned , before the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the rear seat filled with cases of beer , boxes of cheese , and canned hams . " Dump it out , " Barney ordered , " about ten yards beyond the camera , and build it up high so they can see it . Break out the hams so they will know what they are . Bring me a ham and a can of beer . " " Here they come , " Gino said . " Tremendous , absolutely fantastic . " At full tilt the knorr raced across the bay , until the big square sail loomed up above them , driving into the mouth of the stream with a great splashing of spray . Barney was n't sure if the enthusiasm  | would carry through this second landing and he was n't taking any chances . " Oil " he shouted at the top of his lungs . " Svinakjot , of ok ostr ! " 3 They got the message . After almost three weeks on a cold ration of hard bread and dried fish they roared with enthusiasm . The reaction this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival . They fought to get ashore , trampling each other into the shallows , and raced by the camera to get at the food and drink . " Cut , " Barney said , " but do n't go away . As soon as they stoke up I want to get them unloading the wildstock . " Ottar came up , a halfconsumed ham in one fist and the bottle in the other . " Do you think this will do for your camp ? " Barney asked . Ottar looked around and nodded happily . " Good grass , good water . Plenty of wood on the shore for burning . Plenty of trees with hard wood over there for cutting . Fish , hunt , this is a good place . Where 's Gudrid ? Where 's everybody ? " " Taking a day off , " Barney told him , " back on Old Catalina . A day off with pay , big party , barbecue , the works . " " Why parry ? " " Because I 'm generous and like to see people happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because it saves money . I 've been waiting here for you with a skeleton staff for three weeks . Everyone else at the party will be gone only one day . " " Want to see Gudrid . " " Slithey you mean . And I imagine she wants to see you too . " " Been a long time . " " You 're a man of simple pleasures , Ottar . At least finish your ham first and remember that this is a historical moment . You have just arrived in the New World . " " You nuts , Barney . Same old world , just a place name of Vinland . Looks like good trees here . " " I 'll remember those historical words , " Barney said . 3 " Ale ! " . . . " Pork , ale and cheese ! "  | " I do n't feel so good this morning , " Slithey said , loosening the large gilt buckle on her belt . " It must be the air here or the climate or something . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sympathy . " The air . Of course it could n't be that Viking barbecue on the beach last night with roasted clams and blue mussels over a driftwood fire and six cases of beer gone through . " She did n't answer him , but there was a deepening of the green tinge to her peaches and cream skin . He shook another two pills into the rattling handful he already had and held them out to her . " Here , take these , and I 'll get you a glass of water . " " So many , " she said weakly . " I do n't think I can get them down . " " You better , we have a day 's shooting ahead of us . This is Dr. I Iendrickson 's guaranteed morning-after and hangover cure . Aspirin for the headache , Dramamine for the nausea , bicarbonate for the heartburn , Benzedrine for the depression and two glasses of water for the dehydration . It never fails .

" I 'm allergic to mussels so I went to bed early . " She held up the clay 's call sheet . " I 've got a query for you . " She ran her finger down the list . " Artists , okay . . . stand-ins , okay . . . camera department , okay . . . props . They want to know if you want blood with the collapsible dagger ? " " Of course I do  --  we 're not shooting this film for the kiddy matinee . " He stood and pulled his jacket on . " Let 's go , Slithey. "  | " I 'll be with you in a moment , " she said in a faint voice . " Ten minutes , no more , you 're in the first scene . " It was a clear day and the sun had already cleared the ridge behind them and was casting long shadows from the sod huts and birch-bark-roofed lean-tos in the meadow below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue smoke rose straight up from the hole in the ridge of the largest building . " I hope Ottar is in better shape than his leading lady , " Barney said , squinting across the water of the bay . " Are those rocks there , just to the left of the island , Betty  --  or is it a boat ? " " I do n't have my glasses with me . " " It could be the motorboat  --  see it 's closer . And it 's about time they decided to come back . " Betty had to run to keep up with his long strides down the slope toward the shore , skirting a huddle of cud-chewing cows . The boat was clearly visible now and they could hear the faint pop-pop of its motor across the water . Most of the company was waiting on the shore near the knorr and Gino was setting up the camera . " Looks like the explorers are coming home , " he called out to Barney , and pointed at the boat . " I can see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone else can stay on camera . We 're going to shoot this scene as soon as I 've talked to them . " Barney waited , almost at the water 's edge as the boat came in . Tex was in the stern steering the outboard and Jens Lyn sat in front of him . Both men had good growths of beard and a decidedly scruffy look . " Well ? " Barney asked , even before the boat touched shore . " What news ? " Lyn shook his head with unconcealed Scandinavian gloom . " Nothing , " he said , " anywhere along the coast . We went as far as we could with the gasoline we had , but found no one . " " Impossible . I saw those Indians with my own eyes  --  and Ottar killed a couple more . They have to be around somewhere . " Jens climbed ashore and stretched . " I would like to find them as much as you would . This is a unique opportunity for research . The construction of their boats and the carving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are members of the almost unknown Cape Dorset culture . We know comparatively little about these people , just some facts gleaned from digging on archeological sites , and a few hints from the sagas . As far as we can ascertain the last of them seem to have vanished about the end of this century , the eleventh century . . . " " I 'm not interested in your unique opportunity for research but in my unique opportunity to finish this picture . We need Indians in it  --  where are they ? You must have seen some signs of them ? " " We did discover some camps on the shore , but they were deserted . The Cape Dorset are a migratory people , following the seal herds for the most part , and the schools of cod . I feel that , at this time of year , they may have moved farther north . " Tex heaved the motorboat 's bow up on the beach , then sat down on it . " I do n't want to tell the Doc here his business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tex cleared his throat and spat into the water . This was obviously a difference of opinion they had had before . " What is it ? Out with it , " Barney ordered . Tex scratched the dark stubble on his jaw and spoke , not without a certain reluctance . " Look , the Doc is right . We did n't see anything or anybody except some old campsites and piles of seal bones . But , well , I think they 're out there somewhere , close by , and they been watching us all the time . It would n't be hard to do . You can hear this lawnmower engine five miles away . If they 're seal hunters , like the Doc says , they could lay low when they heard us coming and we 'd never see a thing . I think they 're out there . " " Do you have any evidence to support this theory ? " Barney asked . Tex writhed unhappily and scowled . " I do n't want to hear no laughing or anything , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unarmed combat . " One thing I 'm never going to do , Tex , is laugh at you , " he said sincerely . " Well . . . it 's like this . We used to feel it in the jungle , like someone was looking at you . Half the time someone was . Bang ,  | a sniper . I know the feeling . And I been getting it all the time we been out . They 're out there , somewhere close , so help me they are . " Barney considered the information , and cracked his knuckles . " Yes , I suppose you 're right , but I do n't see how it 's going to help us . We 'll talk about it during lunch , see if we can figure something out . We need those Indians . " Nothing went right with the scene , which was probably Barney 's fault . His mind was n't on it . It should have been simple enough to shoot , since it was mostly action . Orlyg , played by Val @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , but he has secretly fallen in love with Gudrid , who is afraid to tell Thor because of the trouble it will cause . His passion becomes too great however , and , since Gudrid has told him she can love no other man while Thor is alive , he resolves in a moment of love-inflamed madness to slay Thor . He hides behind the ship and attacks Thor when he passes . Thor at first can not believe it , however he does believe it when Orlyg stabs him in the arm . Then , with only one arm and barehanded , Thor goes on to win the battle and kill Orlyg . " All right , " Barney called out , his temper worn thin . " We 're going to try it again and this time I 'd be very obliged if you could manage to get it right and remember your lines and everything , because we 're running out of blood and clean shirts . Positions . Orlyg , behind the boat , Thor start down the beach toward him , camera , action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look faintly surprised when de Carlo jumped out at him . " Ho , Orlyg , " he said woodenly . " What are you doing here , what does this mean . . . mikli boinn ! i Look at that ! " " Cut ! " Barney shouted . " That 's not your line , you know better than that . . . " He shut up abruptly as he looked out into the bay where Ottar was pointing . One after another , small , dark boats were coming into sight from behind the island and soundlessly paddling toward the shore . " Axir , sver6 ! " 2 Ottar ordered , and looked around for a weapon . " Hold it , " Barney ordered . " No weapons and no fighting . We 1 " Great Odin ! " 2 " Axes , swords ! "  | want to keep this friendly if we can , find something to trade with them . Those are potential extras out there and I do n't want them frightened off . Tex , keep your gun handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble you finish it .. " A pleasure . " " But do n't start any yourself , and that 's an order . Gino , are you catching them ? " " In the bag . If you 'll clear the twentieth-century types off the set I 'll shoot the whole arrival , the landing , the works . " " You heard him , move . Off camera . Lyn  --  get into Viking rig quick so you can get down there and translate . " " How can I ? Not a single word of their language is known . " " You 'll pick it up . You 're translator  --  so translate . We need a white flag or something to show them we 're friendly . " " We got a white shield here , " one of the propmen said . " That 'll do , give it to Ottar . " The little boats slowed as they neared the beach , nine of them in all , with two or three men in each boat . They were wary , most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as though they were going to attack . Some of the Norse women came down to the beach to see what was happening and their presence seemed to reassure the men in the boats , because they came closer . Jens Lyn hurried up , lacing on his leather jacket . " Talk to them , " Barney said , " but stay behind Ottar so it looks like he 's doing all the work . " The Cape Dorset came close , rocking up and down in the swell , and there was a good deal of loud shouting back and forth . " Using up a lot of film on this , " Gino said . " Keep it going , we can cut out what we do n't need . Move along the shore for a better angle when they come in . If they come in . We got to find something to attract them , something to trade with them . " " Guns and firewater , " de Carlo said . " That 's what they always trade to the Indians in the Westerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well enough with what they got . " He looked around for inspiration and saw a corner of the commissary trailer sticking out from behind Ottar 's  | house , the largest of the sod buildings . " That 's an idea , " he said , and went over to it . Clyde Rawlston was leaning on it scribbling on a piece of paper . " I thought you were doing additional dialogue with Charley ? " Barney said . " I find working on the script interferes with my poetry , so I went back to cooking . " " A dedicated artist . What do you have in this thing ? " " Coffee , tea , doughnuts , cheese sandwiches , the usual stuff . " " I do n't see the redskins getting excited over that . Anything else ? " " Ice cream . " " That should do it . Dish it out into some of those Viking crockery pots and I 'll send someone up for it . I 'll bet those guys got a sweet tooth just like anyone else . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the shore where some of the aborigines were standing in the surf by now , still too wary to come onto the beach , and ladled it into their hands after eating some herself . Either the ice cream , or Slithey 's hormones , turned the trick , because within a few minutes the skin boats were beached and the dark-haired strangers were mixing with the northmen . Barney stopped just outside of camera range and studied them . " They look more like Eskimos than Indians , " he said to himself . " But a few feathers and some war paint will fix that . " Though they had the flat faces and typical Asiatic features of the Eskimo , they were bigger men , erect and powerful-looking , almost as tall as the Vikings . Their clothing was made of stitched sealskin , thrown open now in the heat of the spring day to show their bronze skin . They talked rapidly among themselves in highpitched voices , and now that they had landed safely they seemed to have forgotten their earlier fear and examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the most ; it was obviously a sailing vessel , but infinitely bigger than anything they had seen or imagined before . Barney caught Jens Lyn 's eye and waved him over . " Flow are you coming ? Will they do some work for us ? "  | " Are you mad ? I think  --  I 'm not sure mind you  --  that I have mastered two words of their language . Unn-nah appears to mean yes , and henne signifies no . " " Keep working . We 'll need all these guys and more for the Indian attack scenes . " There seemed to be a general mixing along the shore now , as some of the northmen investigated the bundles in the boats and the Dorset opened them to display their sealskins . The more curious of the newcomers had wandered in among the houses , peering closely at everything and talking excitedly to each other with their piping voices . One of them , still clutching a stone-headed spear , noticed Gino behind the camera and went over and looked into the lens in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around quickly when he heard a bellow followed by shrill screams . A cow had wandered across the boggy meadow that bordered the woods and the bull had followed her . Though small , the bull was a mean and surly beast , with a cast in one eye that gave it an even more evil appearance . It was allowed to roam freely and had been chased from the movie encampment more than once . It shook its head and bellowed again . " Ottar , " Barney shouted . " Get that beast out of here before it upsets the Indians . " It had n't upset the Cape Dorset  --  it had frightened them witless . They had never seen a roaring and snorting beast like this before and were rigid with fear . Ottar grabbed up a length of pole from the shore and ran , shouting , at the bull . It scraped at the ground with a hoof , lowered its head and charged Ottar . He stepped aside , called it a short and foul Old Norse name , then banged it across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired effect . Instead of wheeling to get at its tormenter , the animal bellowed and charged toward the Cape Dorset , linking their dark and unfamiliar shapes with the present disturbance . The newcomers shrieked and ran . The panic was catching and someone shouted that the skrxlling were attacking and the northmen looked for their weapons . Two of the terrified Dorset were trapped in among the buildings and they ran to Ottar 's house and tried to force their way in , but the  | door was bolted . Ottar rushed to defend his home and when one of the men turned , with his spear raised , Ottar brought the pole down on his head , cracking the pole in two and crushing the man 's skull at the same time . Within sixty seconds the scuffle was over . The bull , the cause of it all , had splashed through the brook and was calmly eating grass in the meadow on the other side . Driven by furiously wielded paddles the skin boats were heading toward the open sea , while many of the packs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the housecarls had an arrow through his hand . Two of the Cape Dorset , including the one Ottar had hit , were dead . " Madonna mia , " Gino said , straightening up from behind the camera and wiping his forehead on his sleeve . " What tempers these people got . Worse than Siciliani . " " It is nothing but a stupid waste , " Jens said . He was sitting on the ground holding his stomach with both hands . " They were all frightened , just like children , the emotions of children and the bodies of men . So they kill each other . The waste of it all . " " But it makes good film , " Barney said . " And we 're not here to interfere with the local customs . What happened to you  --  get kicked in the stomach during the stampede ? " " Not interfere with the local customs , very humorous . You disrupt these people 's lives completely for your cinematic drivel , then you avoid the consequences of your actions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamped tightly together . Barney looked down and gaped at the spreading red patch between Lyn 's fingers . " You 've been hurt , " he said , unbelievingly , then spun about . " Tex  --  the first-aid box , quick ! " " Why the concern about me ? I saw you looking at that housecarl with the wounded hand  --  and that did not seem to bother you . The Norse were reputed to sew up their wounds with carpenter 's thread after a battle . Why do n't you get me some thread ? " " Take it easy , Jens , you 've been hurt . We 'll take care of you . " Tex ran up with the first-aid box and put it on the ground next to Jens , kneeling at the wounded man 's side . " What happened ? " he asked in a quiet , surprisingly gentle voice . " It was a spear , " Jens said . " So quickly , I never realized . I was  | between the man and the boats . He was panicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , then there was just this stab of pain and he was past and gone . " " Let me look at it . I 've seen plenty before , bayonet wounds in New Guinea . " His voice was professional and calm , and when he pulled at Jens ' hands they loosened and came away ; with a quick slash of his knife he cut open the bloodstained clothing . " Not bad , " he said , eyeing the red wound . " Nice clean puncture into the guts . Below the stomach and it does n't look deep enough to have got at anything else . Hospital case . They 'll sew up the holes , put in some abdominal drains and fill you full of antibiotics . Try and treat it in the field and you 'll be dead of peritonitis in a couple of days . " " You are being damn frank , " Lyn said , but he smiled . " Always , " Tex said , taking out a morphine Syrette and cracking it open . " A guy knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Helps him , helps everyone else . " He gave the injection with practiced swiftness . " Are you sure the nurse can not treat it here ? I do n't wish to return yet . . . " " Full salary and bonus , " Barney said cheeringly . " And a private room in the hospital  --  do n't worry about a thing . " " It is not money I am concerned with , Mr. Hendrickson . Contrary to your beliefs , there are other things in the world beside a buck . It is what I am learning here that counts . One page of my notes is worth more than every reel of your celluloid monstrosity . " Barney smiled , trying to change the subject . " They do n't make film out of celluloid any more , Doc . Safety film , ca n't burn . " Tex shook sulpha powder onto the wound and applied a pressure bandage . " You must ask the doctor to come here , " Lyn said , anxiously . " Have his opinion about my leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will never return here , never . " Almost eagerly , as if to remember everything , he looked around at the bay and the houses and the people . Tex caught Barney 's eye , gave a quick , negative shake of the head , and jerked his thumb toward the company camp . " I 'm going for the truck , and I 'll pass  | the word to the Prof to warm up the platform . Someone ought to bandage that Viking 's hand and give him a bottle of penicillin pills . " " Bring the nurse back with you , " Barney said . " I 'll stay here with Jens . " " Let me tell you what I have found out , just by chance , " Jens said , laying his hand on Barney 's arm . " I heard Ottar talking to one of his men about the compass repeater on the ship , and they pronounced it their own way , so that it sounded like usas-notra . It shocked me . There is a word in the Icelandic sagas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has never been identified . It is called the hitsasnotra . Do you understand ? It is possible that the word compass repeater ' has entered the language as husasnotra . If so , then the impact of our arrival in the eleventh century is greater than any of us imagined . All the possibilities of this must be studied . I can not return now . " " That 's interesting , what you say , Jens . " Barney looked toward the camp but the truck was n't in sight yet . " You ought to write that up , a scientific paper , that sort of thing . " " Fool ! You have no idea what I am talking about . For you the vremeatron exists only as a device to be prostituted to make a trashy film ? " " Do n't be so free with the insults , " Barney said , trying not to lose his temper with the wounded man . " No one was rushing to help Hewett until we gave him the money . If it had n't been for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books at U.C.L.A. and would n't have a single one of the facts and figures that you think are so important . I do n't run your job down  --  do n't run down mine . I 've heard this prostitution thing before , and it does n't wash . Wars prostitute scientists , but all the big inventions seem to get made when there 's a war to pay for them . " " Wars do n't pay for basic research , and that is where the real developments are made . " " Begging your pardon , but wars keep the enemy and the bombs far enough away so that the basic researchers have the time and the freedom to do their research . " " A glib answer , but not a satisfactory one . No matter what you  | say , time travel is being used to produce a cheap picture , and any historical nuggets of truth will be found only by accident . " " Not quite right , " Barney said , sighing inwardly as he finally heard the truck 's engine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've helped it . You 've had a pretty free hand . And in making this picture we have invested in the vremeatron so that it is now a working proposition . With the stuff you already have you should be able to talk any foundation into financing another time platform and letting you research to your heart 's content . " " I 'll do just that . " " But not for a while , yet . " The truck braked to a stop nearby . " We have the professor tied up exclusively for a couple of years , just until we get our investment back of course . " " Of course , " Jens said bitterly , watching them unload a stretcher from the truck . " Profits first and culture be damned . " " That 's the name of the game , " Barney said , watching as the philologist was carefully slid into the truck . " You ca n't stop the world and get off , so you just have to learn to live on it . "  | " Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ottar bellowed . " For Odin and Fria  --  follow me ! " He held his shield before him as he threw the door open , and two arrows thudded into it . Shouting with rage , he spun his ax and charged out of the burning building . Slithey , waving a sword , followed him , as did Val de Carlo , blowing loudly on the lurhorn , then all of the others . " Cut . Print that ! " Barney shouted and dropped down into his safari chair . " That winds it up gang . Go get your lunch so they can pack up the kitchen . " The propmen were spraying foam onto the trough of burning oil and it stank abominably . All the lights except one went out and Gino had the camera open , taking out the film . Everything was under control . Barney waited until the rush was over , then went outside too . Ottar was sitting on an upended barrel , folding the arrows back into his shield . " Watch this , arrows coming , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The springs whipped the concealed arrows into position with a thunk-thunk . " A wonderful invention , " Barney said . " We 've finished the shooting for now , Ottar , so I 'm going to move the company ahead to next spring . Do you think you 'll have the palisade completed by then ? " " Easy . You keep your bargain , Ottar keeps his . We can cut logs for wall easy with the steel saws and axes you leave . But you leave food for the winter so we can eat . " " I 'll get the supplies first before we move the company . Is everything clear ? Any questions ? "  | " Clear , clear , " Ottar mumbled , concentrating on getting the arrows back inside the shield . Barney looked at him suspiciously . " I 'm sure you remember it all , but just for the record 's sake let 's run through it once more , quickly . We leave you the food , all the cereals and dried and canned stuff I can get from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend the summer and fall laying down food for the winter , so you can take the time to build some more shells of log buildings and a log wall around the camp . If what the Doc said is right you should n't be bothered by the Cape Dorset until the spring when the pack ice closes in near the shore here and the seals band together and raise pups on it . That 's when the hunters come , they 'll all be farther north now . And even if they bother you before then you should be okay behind the log wall . " " Kill them , cut them up . " " Try not to , will you please ? Ninety percent of this film has been shot and I 'd feel better if you did n't get yourself slaughtered before we finished it . We 'll check up on you in February and March , then bring the company as soon as we know the redskins are close by . Give them some trade goods to pay them to launch an attack on the stockade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Agreed ? " " And Jack Daniels whiskey . " " That 's in your contract . . . " A brassy moan drowned his words , rising and falling unevenly . " Must you ? " Barney asked Val de Carlo , who had the length of the lurhorn curled around his body , the nodulated flat plate of the opening over his shoulder , and was blowing on it . This is a wild horn , " Val said . " Listen . " He licked his lips and applied them to the mouthpiece , and , with much puffing and cheek reddening , produced a barely recognizable version of The Music Goes ' Round and ' Round . " " Stick to acting , " Barney said . " You have no future as a musician . You know , I keep thinking I 've seen that kind of horn somewhere before , outside of a museum I mean . " " They 've got it on every pack of Danish butter . It 's a trade mark . " " Maybe that 's where . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would love it . "  | " He might at that . " Barney squinted as an idea hit him , then snapped his fingers . " That 's what I was thinking about , the Spider man . He plays all kinds of weirdo instruments in that beat joint the Fungus Grotto . I heard him once , backed up with a brass section and a drum . " Val nodded . " I 've been there . He 's supposed to be the only jazz tuba player in captivity . It 's the most terrible noise I ever heard . " " It 's not that bad  --  and it might be just what we want . It gives me a thought . " Ottar thunked his arrows in and out and Barney leaned against the wall listening to the lurhorn until Dallas pulled up in the jeep . " Ready to go , " he reported . " All the commissary people are waiting and a couple of grips who volunteered because they wanted to see if Hollywood was still there . " " Enough to move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot will have gone home by now . " " More than enough . " " Let 's go . " One of the big trailer trucks had backed onto the platform and a dozen men were lounging around it . Professor Hewett had the door to the control cabin tied open and Barney looked in . " Saturday afternoon , and cut it as close as you can . " " To the microsecond . We shall arrive precisely after the moment the platform left on the last trip . " It took an effort of will for Barney to realize that , despite all that had happened during the previous months , it was still Saturday afternoon in Hollywood , the same day on which they had begun the operation . The weekend crowds were jamming up on the freeways , the supermarket parking lots were full , and at the top of Benedict Canyon Drive , behind his private golf course on the top floor of his mansion , L.M. Greenspan was suffering his phony heart attack . For a moment Barney considered telephoning him with a progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours had passed for L.M. and he would n't be worrying yet . Best to let sleeping studio owners lie . Maybe he should ring up the hospital and see how Jens Lyn was doing , it had been weeks since  --  no it had n't , just  | minutes here . He probably was n't even at the hospital yet . Time travel took a lot of getting used to . " It 's a scorcher , " one of the cooks said . " I shoulda brought my sunglasses . " The high sound-stage doors were rolled back , and when the time platform appeared all the men winced at the sudden onslaught of subtropical light . The northern Newfoundland sky was always a pale blue and the sun never burned down like this . Barney moved the men out of the way while the big diesel truck rumbled to life , then clanked down from the time platform . There was a holiday air about the occasion as they climbed into the truck and rolled through the empty studio streets . At the commissary warehouse the holiday ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio guard said , spinning his club on its thong . " But I 've never seen you before , and even if I had I could n't let you into this warehouse , no sir . " " This paper . . . " " I 've seen the paper , but I have my orders . " " Give me a war ax , " one of the grips shouted . " I 'll get that door open ! " " Kill ! Kill ! " another called out . They had been too long in the eleventh century and had picked up some of the Vikings ' simple solutions to most problems . " Do n't come any closer ! " the guard ordered , stepping away and dropping his hand toward his gun . " All right you jokers , enough of that , " Barney ordered . " Just sit quiet while I straighten this out . Where 's your phone ? " he asked the guard . Barney took a chance that someone might be there and called the administration building first . He hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there , undoubtedly cooking the books in private . " Sam , " he said , " it 's good to talk to you again , how 've you been ... What ? . . . Sorry , I forgot . It 's just been a couple of hours for you , natch , but it 's been months for me . . . No , of course I have n't been drinking , I 've been shooting the film . . . That 's right , it 's almost complete . . . Sam , no . . . do n't get excited . . . This  | is no more a one-day picture than the script was a one-hour script . We 've been working hard . Look , I 'll explain it all later , but right now I want you to help me . I want you to talk to one of the studio guards , a real thick-headed job , must be a new man . Tell him to unlock the commissary warehouse so we can clean out all the dry cereals and canned stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry already , this is trade goods for the natives . Pay for the extras .. . Sam , what do you mean you have to think about it . . . if we can pay them off in Quaker Oats instead of greenbacks what possible difference can it make ? " It was n't easy , it never was with Sam , but he was finally convinced . Sam  --  who hated to spend money even if it was only Quaker Oats  --  took his temper out on the guard , who emerged from the phone booth red-faced and angry . By five-thirty the truck was loaded , and by a quarter to six it was back aboard the time platform . Barney checked to make sure that everyone was aboard , then poked his head into Hewett 's control tubby . " Take it away , Prof , but let me get clear first . " " Am I to understand that you are not returning with us ? " " Correct . I have a bit of business here . You can unload these people and the supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of hours , say about ten o'clock . If I 'm not here I 'll ring you on the warehouse phone over there and let you know what 's happening . " Hewett was feeling waspish . " I seem to be running a specie of temporal taxi , and I am not quite certain that I enjoy it . My understanding was that we would go the eleventh century to make your film , then return . Instead I seem to be operating a constant shuttle service . . . " Relax , Prof , we 're coming down the home stretch . Do you think I would lose a couple of hours like this if I was n't sure of the production ? We do one more time jump , finish the picture up and that is that . All over but the shouting . " Barney stood by the door and watched the platform vanish into the past . Back to the wilds of primitive Canada , chapped lips and cold rain . Let them . He was going to take a couple of hours off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , but that was n't going to stop him from enjoying himself as well . He could n't really relax yet , not until the film was in the can , but the end was in sight and he had been driving himself for months . The first order of business was going to be a first-class , deluxe dinner at Chasen 's , that much at least he owed himself . There was no point in getting to the Fungus Grotto before nine o'clock at the very earliest . There was an unreality about being back in California , and in the twentieth century . Things seemed to move too fast , there were too many garish colors and the stink of exhaust fumes made his head ache . Rube ! Dinner  --  with drinks before , brandy after and champagne in the middle  --  helped , and he was feeling no pain when the cab dropped him in front of the club at a little after nine . He even managed not to be offended by the bilious green doorway with the red skulls and crossbones on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he pushed open the door . " Beware that all who enter the Fungus Grotto do so at their own risk . Beware . . . " The recorded voice cut off as he closed the door and felt his way down the ill-lit and black-velvet-lined stairwell . A curtain of glowing plastic bones was the last barrier before the inner sanctum of the club itself . He had been here before , so the novelty of the decor did not impress him . It had not impressed him the first time either , being just a cut above  --  or below  --  the ghost house at a carnival . Green lights flickered , rubber cobwebs hung in the corners and the chairs were shaped like giant toadstools . He had the room to himself . " A Bloody Mary , " he told the vampire-garbed waiter . " Is the Spiderman here yet ? " " I fink he 's in ' a dressing room , " the creature mumbled around its plastic fangs . " Tell him I want to see him , Barney Hendrickson of Climactic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blackgarbed , scuttling figure with large dark glasses . " Long time no see , man , " he said , letting his dank fingers flap against Barney 's palm . " How'z the pix biz ? " he sank into a chair . " Keeping body and soul together . Tell me , Spider , is it true you scored a couple of films ? "  | " It is true I did the music for a ragged piece of class-X crap name of Teen-age Beatniks ' Hophead Rumble , but I keep hoping people will forget about it . Why you ask ? Ca n't be you 're interested in the poor old Spiderman ? " " Might be , Spinneke , just might be . Do you think you could write the music for a picture and record it with your own group ? " " Anything 's possible , Dad . But that takes time , we got commitments . " " Do n't worry about the time , I 'll fix it so you wo n't miss a single show . I thought you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a stirring story of the Vikings . You 've heard of them ? " " Cert . Hairy cats with axes , go around chopping people . " " That 's roughly it . Primitive stuff , strong . They have a kind of brass horn and that gave me the idea . An all brass score complete with drums , hammering away with primitive savagery . " " Real cool . " " Think you can handle it ? " " A natural . " " Good . Here 's a C as a down payment . " Barney took five twenties from his billfold and dropped them onto the table . Spiderman 's fingers oozed across the black cloth and absorbed them . " Let 's grab your boys and go around to the studio now and I 'll give you the scoop . You 'll be back here inside an hour . " Where else they would be during that hour of twentieth-century time Barney did not trouble to say . " No can do . Doody and I just fake up until the rest come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We ca n't split before then . " The Bloody Mary slid down smoothly and Barney looked at his watch and convinced himself there was no point in going away and coming back again , and 3 A.M. on Sunday morning would still be okay because they had until Monday to turn the film in . It was all going to work out . Spiderman slid back into the recesses of the club , and at ten Barney got on the phone and talked to Professor Hewett and arranged a new appointment for three , then went back to his table and relaxed , as much as he could relax with the hot  | tuba , brass section and amplified drums . The Bloody Marys helped . At two o'clock he stirred himself and went out for a breath of air that was n't solid with cigarette smoke and vibrating with wailing rhythms . He even managed to arrange for two cabs to come to the club just after three . Things were working out very well . It was close to four before they pulled up in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down staring at his watch . " Very precise , " he snapped . " Not too bad , Prof old boy , " Barney said , slapping him on the back , then turning to help pull the bass drum out of the cab . Then , in single file , they marched into the warehouse , with Doody on the trombone playing " Colonel Bogey . " " What 's the raft ? " Spiderman asked , bleary-eyed and tired . " Transportation . Just climb aboard . We 'll just be gone a few minutes from here , that I promise . " Barney smiled slyly behind his hand as he said it . " Enough already , " Spiderman said , pulling the trombone away from Doody 's fluttering lips . Doody kept playing for at least five seconds before he realized he was n't making a sound . " Flying on pot , " Spiderman explained . Hewett snorted as the funereally robed musicians climbed aboard the time platform , then went into the control cubicle to start the vremeatron . " Is this the waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cramped quarters . " Get out you oaf ! " the professor snapped , and Doody mumbled something and tried to oblige . But as he turned , the slide extended from his trombone and swiped along the top of a row of exposed electronic tubes . Two of them popped and fizzled sparkily . " Yow ! " Doody said , and dropped the instrument . Its brass length fell across the exposed innards of the tubes and sparks jumped as the circuits shorted . All of the lights on the controls went out . Barney was completely sober in less than a second . He pulled the musician out of the instrument room and herded him , and all the others , to the far end of the platform .  | " How is it , Professor ? " he asked softly when he came back , but there was no answer . He did n't ask again but only looked on as Hewett tore off inspection hatches and hurled the broken tubes out of the door . He sent the musicians away after he received a grudging " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if it would be at least a couple of hours before the vremeatron would be fixed . By nine o'clock Sunday morning Professor Hewett admitted that the repairs would probably take most of the day , not including the time needed to find replacement tubes on a Sunday in Los Angeles . Barney , hollowly , said that , after all , they had plenty of time . After all the picture was n't due until the following morning . Late Sunday night Barney fell asleep for the first time , but he woke up with a start after only a few minutes and could not get back to sleep again . At 5 A.M. on Monday morning the professor announced that the rewiring was complete and that he was going to sleep for an hour . After that he would leave and try to obtain the missing tubes . At 9 A.M. Barney phoned and discovered that the representatives of the bank had arrived and were waiting for him . He gurgled and hung up . At nine-thirty the phone rang , and when he picked it up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being turned upside down trying to locate him , and that L.M. himself had personally talked to her and asked her if she knew where Mr. Hendrickson was . Barney hung up on her too . At ten-thirty he knew it was hopeless . Hewett had not returned , nor had he phoned . And even if he arrived at that moment it was too late . The picture could not possibly be finished in time . It was all over . He had tried , and he had failed . Walking over  | to L.M. 's office was like trodding the last mile  --  which it really was . He hesitated outside L.M. 's door , considered suicide as an alternative , decided he did not have the guts , then pushed the door open .
