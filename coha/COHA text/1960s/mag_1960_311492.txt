THE first siren whoosh of the commercial jetliner not only changed man 's notion of time and travel by shrinking the earth some 40% , but set off an earth-bound revolution that is transforming the whole faade and function of the jet age 's gateway : the airport . Nations and cities are taking a searching second look at the airports that served the piston-plane age - and finding them wanting . The result is an immense worldwide building boom to adapt them to the new and challenging problems-for pilots , passengers and cities - of the 600 m.p.h. jet planes . In the U.S. new or better airports are blossoming in Seattle , Miami , San Francisco , New Orleans , Chicago , St. Louis , Los Angeles-and dozens of other airports are also undergoing major face-liftings . New runways are being hacked out of the wilderness in Asia and South America , and the travel-worn airports of Paris , Amsterdam and Mexico City , familiar to thousands of U.S. tourists , will soon sport a trim , unfamiliar look . <P> Prototype : Idlewild . The most glittering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York International Airport at Idlewild , the gateway to the U.S. ( an estimated 8,550,000 air travelers this year ) . Because Idlewild is one of the world 's busiest airports ( an average of 640 landings and takeoffs a day ) and a technological primer of jet age forethought , it has become the prototype and laboratory for many of the world 's changing airports . This week ten officials of Aeroflot , the Soviet civil airline , will poke through every nook and cranny of Idlewild on a restricted tour of U.S. airports , searching for ideas to take back home . Cologne is building an instrument-landing runway with narrow-gauge lighting patterned after Idlewild 's . Frankfurt has jet-terminal improvements scheduled , but is waiting to see how Idlewild 's new facilities work . <P> Built in 1942 on land reclaimed from Jamaica Bay and what was once a golf course , Idlewild has become a vast , gleaming concrete-and-glass tiara ( see color covering 4,900 acres and representing an investment of $330 million . Much more than merely a big new airport , it typifies a whole new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete that it has two dramatic societies and an animal-port where anything from parakeets ( 50 a day ) to lions ( $5 a day ) can be boarded . <P> Underground Airport . For all its glitter , Idlewild will have plenty of competition before the airport boom abates . Many of the new airports boast functional rather than beautiful buildings , must first use their money for such expensive necessities as lengthening runways-at $1,000 a ft. - to meet the 10,500-ft. jet requirements . But some airports with money to spare are experimenting with concepts as dramatic in jet age design as Idlewild 's . <P> Among them : <P> Dulles International Airport , due to open near Washington , D.C. in 1961 , is radically different in concept . Unlike most airports , it will have no passageways reaching out onto the apron to detract from its lofty , templelike terminal designed by Architect Eero Saarinen . Instead of jets coming up to terminal fingers , passengers will simply walk into giant " mobile lounges " that will move them out to the jets .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
