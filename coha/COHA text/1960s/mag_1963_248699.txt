Along a rural road in western Colombia early this month , some 40 men dressed as soldiers swarmed out from behind roadside boulders and halted an oncoming auto . Brandishing rifles and submachine guns , the men in uniform - bandits in disguise - ordered the three frightened riders out of the car , marched them to a nearby abandoned house , and tied them up . That done , the bandits returned to their hiding place be side the road . <P> During the next half-hour or so , the bandits halted a loaded passenger bus and three government trucks carrying road workers . Each time the captors herded their prisoners back to the house . Then , after systematically robbing them , the bandits cold-bloodedly beat and hacked 42 male prisoners to death with clubs and machetes . Several men and women were spared and later released ; others managed to escape . In the town of Manzanares the day after the massacre , 24 of the victims were buried in a mass funeral . <P> The massacre was unmistakably the work of a bandit gang led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A onetime army private who flunked out of military police school , Aranguren wears an army captain 's uniform , plans his attacks like grand military campaigns . To help assure his getaway after the slaughter , Aranguren had his men cut telephone lines to surrounding towns . <P> Last week 2,000 soldiers and policemen , aided by air force helicopters , were searching for the Aranguren gang . A detachment of troops caught up with the bandits one evening , but after an hour-long exchange of gunfire , darkness fell and the gang escaped . At week 's end Aranguren was still at large , although authorities had offered rewards totaling 130,000 pesos ( $13,000 ) for information leading to his capture . <P> The Aranguren massacre was one of the bloodiest in Colombia 's 15-year agony of backlands violence , which has cost well over 200,000 lives . What began in 1948 as partisan warfare between Liberals and Conservatives has degenerated over the years into banditry and blood lust virtually devoid of any political meaning . The senseless slaughter goes on although the Liberal and Conservative parties agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Conservative , has pressed the search for known bandits ; but the campaign to hunt them down appears to make some bandit chieftains all the more savage . Until the roadside massacre , Aranguren usually released his robbery victims , but after slaughtering the 42 men , he gave the survivors an ominous warning to carry away with them : " It will happen again .
