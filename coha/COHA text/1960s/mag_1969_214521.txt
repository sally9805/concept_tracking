ONE of America 's proud traditions is the citizens ' army . Another is the freedom of the nation 's education institutions . Set up to guarantee the former , the Reserve Officers Training Corps is now under attack as a violation of the latter . To idealistic students and professors , ROTC has come to symbolize the university 's " complicity " in alleged U.S. militarism , particularly the Viet Nam war . As such , it provides radical students with a highly visible target The ROTC , in fact , is a key target for the next wave of campus protests . <P> In theory , this should not seriously bother the Pentagon . " Rotsee , " as collegians call it , remains highly popular . It supplies 50% of the Army 's officers , 20% of the Navy 's and 35% of the Air Force 's . Army ROTC alone now enrolls 151,000 students on 268 campuses ( v. 54 for the Navy and 208 for the Air Force ) . Many students are so eager for ROTC that next year the Army will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is committed to two years ' active service as a second lieutenant . One attraction : he can boost his grades by taking relatively easy ROTC courses that carry as much as 30 hours of credit toward his B.A. degree . If he serves four years , he can get his entire undergraduate education paid for by the Army , plus $50 a month allowance . Now that draft deferments have ended for graduate students , ROTC looks like a bargain . <P> Violence Y. Reason . All the same , the Pentagon is understandably alarmed by the anti-ROTC movement . Though ROTC is thriving at some state universities and Catholic colleges , it is simultaneously being banished from the Ivy League , a major source of precisely the kind of citizen-officers who might normally leaven the military with needed intellect and imagination . By faculty vote , ROTC will be stripped of academic credit and relegated to an extracurricular activity at Yale and Harvard . Dartmouth is considering whether to reduce the number of ROTC courses that qualify for credit or to drop credit altogether if ROTC is not moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations are pending at Cornell and Stanford . <P> Many critics fault ROTC on strictly academic grounds . As they see it , such boring trade-school courses as " military staff operations " have no more business being part of the college curriculum than the officer-instructors sent by the Pentagon-who must be accorded the rank and privileges of a full professor-have being part of the faculty . While overlooking the presence of similar non-military courses ( accounting , physical education ) , the critics also tend to forget that universities themselves approve the ROTC instructors , many of whom are rising young officers who take graduate courses on the side . At Columbia , for example , one ROTC officer currently has 90 hours ' credit in teaching ghetto children . The critics do have one important point : the intellectual respectability of ROTC courses varies wildly from school to school , partly because the quality of the teachers and the credit hours vary just as wildly .
