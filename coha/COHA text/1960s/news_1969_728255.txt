txt MOSCOW There is a mood of expectation here , bolstered by last week 's cautious but conciliatory Warsaw Pact communiqu ? , that the European Communist nations , despite East German qualms , are moving closer to a genuine dialogue with West Germany 's new Government headed by Chancellor Willy Brandt . Ever since Mr. Brandt took office in October , the Communist nations of Europe have been arguing over what to do about his offers to bury the hatchet , how fast to move toward talks , and on what terms . The summit which took place here on Wednesday and Thursday had been preceded by long private discussion on the subject among the interested states . The communiqu ? , not unexpectedly , was a compromise document . It had good things , to say about public opinion in West Germany but warned that neoNazis are on the rampage also . The signal to Bonn was that the bloc was interested in better relations but was not rushing to accept Mr. Brandt 's proposals . Communiqu ? Cautious The overriding caution of the communiqu ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warsaw Pact nations move quickly into an early round of talks with the NATO members on reducing tensions and with Bonn on ending the special cold war that has existed in Central and Eastern Europe . But the communiqu ? ' s caution was probably as equally annoying to Walter Ulbricht of East Germany . In short , the communiqu ? was a document that apparently was designed to leave all options open for future discussions with Bonn . The key compromise paragraph said that the changes in West Germany indicated " the growth of tendencies directed at a realistic policy of cooperation and mutual understanding among states . " Lacking the transcript of what went on in private among the Chiefs of State and parties , observers here could only surmise the spectrum of opinion that was apparent behind the closed doors . Rumania , the only East European state , other than Russia , to have diplomatic relations with West Germany , could have been expected to stress the positive side of the new Brandt Government  --  its signing of the nonproliferation treaty , its offer to participate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half way to recognize the existence of two German states . The East Germans would have argued that hasty steps for conciliation with West Germany would be unproductive . They would undermine the unity of the Warsaw Pact which has been built up largely out of fear of West Germany and it would cause problems for Mr. Ulbricht with his population which has been kept behind the Berlin wall and unable to have much communication with West Berlin and West Germany . Very Wary ? Mr. Ulbricht has shown himself through the years to be very wary of any of his Warsaw Pact allies seeking to improve relations with Bonn before West Germany recognizes East Germany formally . This is because , unlike the other East European countries , he does not rule a national entity but rather a politically contrived state . Whenever tensions are lowered in Europe between East and West , Mr. Ulbricht has felt pressure on his regime to loosen its internal restrictions . A move for better relations with Bonn by the entire bloc could cause internal chaos and a drive for unity with West Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " extremes " of East Germany and Rumania can be heard the voices of Poland 's Wladyslaw Gomulka and Hungary 's Janos Kadar who would like to step up trade and technological relations with West Germany and put diplomatic ties on a normal basis . Reflections of this middle of the road view came in the Communist press last week . For example , Smena of Bratislava , a Czechoslovak Communist youth newspaper , noted " a thawing of international relations in Europe and all over the world . It linked the process with what it termed " growing signs of a realistic policy in Bonn . " an allusion to Chancellor Brandt 's overtures to the Soviet bloc . The West German reaction to the Moscow communiqu ? was that it represented " the most conciliatory stance towards the Federal Republic in recent years " and " the best that one could expect at this time . " Looking further into the future , the NATO ministers , who held their own conference last week , said they would be " receptive " to the idea of talks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East bloc adopted a favorable attitude on such issues as Berlin , troop reductions in Europe , and the relationship between the two Germanys . Soviet leaders , of course , hold the final word on Pact relations with Bonn and the rest of the NATO bloc and as the communiqu ? indicated , Moscow does not want to disturb Mr. Ulbricht further . There was no direct effort to push him into talks with West Germany , nor to call for better relations between the two halves of Germany . Nor was there any effort to prevent the coming dialogue . The Russians , in fact , will be testing the soil in a very short time when they begin talks with the West Germans on a nonaggression pact which inevitably would be regarded as a symbolic show of eased tensions if such an accord could be signed . -S ? 122,7. e.A.Ft.LO GWEIEL7EMMELT ?
