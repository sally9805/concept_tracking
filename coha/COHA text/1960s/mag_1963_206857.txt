As a dedicated Tunisian nationalist , President Habib Bourguiba , 59 , is a popular hero to most of the millions who have followed him since independence was won in 1956 . But Bourguiba also has his deadly enemies . Last week a determined group of the latter almost succeeded in assassinating Tunisia 's stocky chieftain . <P> The plotters actually made two attempts on Bourguiba 's life . The first try failed on Dec. 15 because Bourguiba did not spend the night at his Presidential Palace at Carthage , near Tunis . The plotters next laid their plans for midnight . Dec. 21 , and even Bourguiba 's personal bodyguard agreed to lead the killers to the President 's bedside . <P> No Replacement . A few hours before midnight , a Tunisian army non-com burst in upon a Defense Ministry official and blurted the details of the plot . That night , and on following days , more than a hundred plotters were jailed . They proved to be a handful of dissident army officers and some disgruntled landowners . But the hard core seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salah ben Youssef , who lost a bitter struggle for control of Neo-Destour , Tunisia 's only political party , and went into exile in 1955 . When Ben Youssef was murdered in West Germany in 1961 , his followers back home blamed Bourguiba agents , swore vengeance on Tunisia 's boss himself . <P> The plotters ' only plan , apparently , was to slay the President . Said Bourguiba : " After my death the country would have been in a state of total anarchy . The plotters thought only of eliminating me , not replacing me . " <P> Crowds gathered to hear official speeches of indignation at the attempt on Bourguiba 's life . There seemed little doubt that he still held the nation 's basic loyalty , but even his closest friends were concerned at the recent signs of unrest caused by three successive years of drought and an unemployment level of 400,000 out of a population of 4,000,000 . <P> Bourguiba is also aware of the muttering of many about the three expensive new palaces he has recently built . These " belong to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive " speech . He added with some bitterness : " There is a tendency to forget that I spent 30 years in French jails for my country . " <P> Knocked Heads . In his efforts to reshape Tunisia as a modern nation , Bourguiba has had to knock heads together . Inevitably , some army officers resent the backseat role he gives the military . And Moslem religious leaders are angered by his attempt to abolish the day-long fasts of the month of Ramadan , and by his emancipation of women . <P> A U.S. investigating committee in 1961 agreed that Bourguiba was making the right moves to solve Tunisia 's economic ills , but warned that he might be asking too great sacrifices of his people . After last week 's brush with death , Bourguiba may go forward a bit more slowly , and can undoubtedly draw some support from the fact that last month the U.S. finally agreed to grant Tunisia $180 million in economic aid over the next three years .               @ @ @ @ @ @
