When a Lockheed Electra plunged 62 persons to their death in Boston Harbor fortnight ago , Administrator Elwood R. Quesada of the Federal Aviation Agency pointed the finger of blame at the flocks of starlings that populate the runway areas of Boston 's Logan International Airport . Last week investigators found preliminary proof to indict the starlings , indicated that a flock of 10,000 to 20,000 starlings slammed into the Electra 25 seconds after it left the ground . <P> The plane 's four Allison turboprop engines were recovered from the water , shipped to General Motors ' Allison division in Indianapolis . There , Civil Aeronautics Board crash detectives began taking them apart piece by piece . They found evidence that the No. 1 or outboard engine on the left wing had been shut down and feathered by the pilot , indicating that he was coping with an emergency . CAB believes that the three other engines were delivering power , or at least some measure of power , when the plane crashed . <P> In the compressor chamber of the No. 1 engine , investigators found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers from starlings . Starling remains were also found in the No. 2 engine ; the innards of No. 3 and No. 4 had not yet been examined . But flesh-eating crabs were found in the nacelles of all four engines , suggesting that they had been scavenging starling remains . <P> Tests in the past have shown that birds drawn into Allison engines through the 2-ft. - wide air scoops cause flameouts about 50% of the time-a danger that experts believe is also shared by the pure jets . Said Quesada : " There is absolutely no evidence that the Boston accident was in any way whatsoever associated with the type of structural failure that caused two previous Electra crashes . Any airplane encountering a massive flock of birds at low altitude , when its air speed is critical , is going to have trouble . "
