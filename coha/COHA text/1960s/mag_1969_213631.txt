James LeBlanc , 32 and white , has been a heroin addict for ten years , dur ing which he has thrice been convicted of larceny . Each time he robbed , he says , it was to buy a fix . Now he is in New York City 's Beth Israel Medical Center where , seven days a week , he takes an orange drink laced with gradually increasing doses of methadone . <P> Enrique Blanco , a 29-year-old Puerto Rican , has been through that routine and now goes five days a week to a storefront clinic run by Beth Israel 's Morris J. Bernstein Institute . There he takes a maintenance dose of methadone and leaves , in exchange , a sample of his urine ; on Fridays he receives a apa of two methadone drinks to take over the weekend . <P> William White , 30 and black , goes to one of Harlem Hospital 's community clinics , where his daily methadone dosage is being stepped up to his ultimate maintenance level . He is in a pilot program designed to see whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who knows that methadone itself is an addicting drug , the immediate and inevitable question is : Why is it being given to these real ( but fictitiously named ) drug addicts ? Many reputable physicians have despaired of getting any substantial number of hard core heroin addicts to kick the habit even after long-term confinement and psychiatric treatment - 80% to 90% soon relapse . So the doctors have concluded that the best thing to do is to fight fire with fire . <P> Rough Challenge . The idea originated with a husband-wife team , Dr. Vincent P. Dole , a specialist in metabolic research at Rockefeller University , and Dr. Marie Nyswander , a psychiatrist . As a substitute for heroin , which may cost the addict $50 a day and is virtually certain to lead him to crime , they hit upon methadone . It is a synthetic painkiller , widely prescribed for cancer patients and for people who have undergone surgery . Such prescriptions are not renewable , since it is undeniably addicting . But physical dependence on methadone is less stubborn than that on heroin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not experience either euphoric highs or hellish lows . Moreover , methadone costs only about 10$ a dose , in bulk . <P> The exact mechanism by which methadone works is not known , but it involves tolerance and cross-tolerance , or blockade . The patients who take carefully stepped-up doses of methadone be come tolerant in the sense that they observe no outward effect from it . Presumably because methadone works on the same brain centers as heroin , it induces a cross-tolerance to heroin and blocks its effects . A methadone patient can be challenged with a massive mainline fix and show no response-except enormous relief at the knowledge that now he can take it or leave it alone . He can watch his old friends shooting horse and feel no desire to join them .
