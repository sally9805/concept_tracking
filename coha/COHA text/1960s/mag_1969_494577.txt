Allies For Hire Southeast Asia policy is unravelling fast , and the sight is n't pretty . SEATO , short for Southeast Asia Treaty Organization , was the creation of the late John Foster Dulles . It was a bust from the start , but that only encouraged former Secretary of State Dean Rusk to run up a sweater for it , a fantastically expensive sweater which , unravelled , reveals the falsies underneath . SEATO was America 's chosen instrument for carrying out its Vietnam policy ? one reason why India , Burma and Indonesia all refused to join . Pakistan did join , and then withheld support and even sympathy from the American venture in Vietnam . That left only Thailand and the Philippines as SEATO 's active Asian members . But how active ? Though the Treaty was signed in Manila , in September 1954 , the Philippines government has sent no troops to Vietnam and denies this country unrestricted use of the American bases in the Philippines for prosecuting the war . In 1962 , Secretary Rusk made a new , separate , bilateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in 1965 this was followed by a further , furtive military commitment to the Thais . It was not enough for them . In the following year Thais exacted a huge , further price for sending 12,000 soldiers to Vietnam . The Thai example was swiftly emulated by South Korea , a nation whose salvation in 1950-53 cost 33,629 American lives . The South Korean government dispatched 55,000 troops to Vietnam , but it demanded in return major military and economic concessions in addition to the continuing presence of 50,000 American soldiers in Korea . Those wretched procurements of " allies " in Vietnam moved Senator Fulbright to say the other day that " all we did was go out and hire the soldiers , " which he calls " the ultimate in corruption , for us to make deals like this in pursuit of an illusory policy all designed to prove to the world that we have great support in Vietnam , which we do not have at all . " We certainly did pay " a very high price for it ; " and the price will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-year contracts . Senator Stuart Symington 's Foreign Relations subcommittee has dug out some of the financial costs of Asian allies in Vietnam ( the 8000 Americans and 506 New Zealanders pay their own way ) . But the subcommittee 's investigations so far as they have gone do n't say what the total tag will be . It may easily turn out to be $5 billion . Having 12,000 Thai soldiers in Vietnam is costing the US $1 billion .. The price of the 55,000 South Korean troops is " classified . " Why it should be classified is also classified information . One has to assume that what the American public does n't know is good for it . Senator Fulbright inferred that the Pentagon has clammed up " only to keep it from us in the committee . " But the figure for the Thais suggests that the Koreans ca n't be costing much less than $4 billion . At least it 's nice to know that South Korea 's " Tiger " division in Vietnam wear tiger patches on their uniforms , and have special permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2200 noncombat Filipinos who were dispatched to Vietnam as a " Civic Action Guard " cost about $38 million . For this they constructed a " Potemkin village , " a false-front showpiece for visiting VIPs to laud ; and they built a few roads . Other than that , they are reported to shave been " very active " in the PX . Until the big Vietnam bonanza opened up for them , in 1966 , Thailand had already had about $1.1 billion in economic and military aid from the US , the Philippines had received about $2 billion , and Korea $7 billion . But the invitation ' to help out in Vietnam ? which they were theoretically supposed to do anyway under SEATO and other mutual defense treaties ? roused fresh expectations , which were not disappointed . As well as arms and logistic support and pay for its troops in Vietnam , Thailand got as part of the new deal further military assistance to its armed forces back home , and more economic aid . The military assistance includes Hawk missiles and F-5 jet fighters , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and American military advisers in Thailand have discovered the Thai armed forces are n't up to maintaining them . The Koreans did even better than the Thais ; after all , they were contributing four times more troops in Vietnam . To get those troops , complete with tiger growls , the United States had to promise to " completely equip " three Korean divisions as well as " modernizing " 17 army divisions and one marine division , in Korea ; equip three additional reserve divisions in Korea , to replace the troops being sent to Vietnam ; under the military assistance program ( MAP ) , buy Korean ( with dollars ) instead of buying American ; build South Korea an ammunitions factory , in Korea ; and supply " anti-infiltration equipment " against the North Koreans , and communications facilities " to maintain continuous contact between Seoul and its forces in Vietnam . " On top of that , Seoul demanded a share of American aid money that is being spent in Vietnam on relief of refugees and so forth ; it was agreed that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea as far as possible . Likewise , Korean contractors were promised " every opportunity to participate in Vietnam reconstruction , " including employing " Korean technicians and workers . " But all this was after all only a share of the US aid going to Vietnam ; Seoul therefore also requested and got extra aid funds and military assistance , for Korea . The latter cost American taxpayers $ioo million last year , which did n't prevent the South Korean deputy premier asking Secretary Rogers , this year , for three more squadrons of F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers . Deputy Premier Park Choong Hoon also proposed that later these should be replaced by more up-to-date F-5 planes which , he pointed out , Thailand and Taiwan had been promised . Naturally , the US is committed to equipping , supporting and paying the 55,000 Korean troops in Vietnam . The Filipinos who are benefiting from American military spending include even the " Huks , " the semi-communist guerrillas in the Philippines . The Huks are getting " as much as $1 million a year " out of Clark Air Force Base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homicide , details of which took up over 14 pages of testimony before the Symington subcommittee , but were deleted from the published hearings . But that is n't all the Philippines is getting . In addition to the $38 million for its " Civic Action Guard " in Vietnam , the government of the Philippines has been given 22 F-5s , and receives $22.5 million annually as military assistance . Despite this , and although the Philippines is a founding member of SEATO , American aircraft taking part in the Vietnam war ca n't use their own base at Clark , for fear that Hanoi , or Peking , or Russia , or someone , might attack the Philippines in retaliation . This fear is made the rationalization for giving the Philippines a squadron of its own fighter planes . The Pentagon 's argument moved Senator Symington to sarcasm . " I imagine that danger scares you all pretty bad , " he told General Francis G. Gideon . " What would you do as they enemy attackers went by places like Okinawa ? Wave at them ? " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sums up the matter . " As we look at these problems around the world , time and time again with country after country , we pay and we pay and we pay , and we commit and we commit and we commit . " No matter , we can afford it . But look what it buys . After Haynsworth The Supreme Court has been one Justice short since last spring , and will remain so at least through January . Having expressed regret that the Senate rejected his nomination of Judge Clement F. Haynsworth , Jr. , the President let it be known that he would not send up another name before mid-January , after the second session of this Congress has convened . The delay is inevitable . The Senate is deep in the tax bill just now . It could scarcely find time before Christmas for the hearing and floor action that are necessary even on the least controversial of nominees . In rejecting him by a more decisive margin than anyone had expected ( 55 to 45 ) , the Senate did not disgrace , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It merely assured the people that nominees for the Supreme Court will be held to the highest ethical standards , higher even than at least one present member of the Court has in the past lived by . The present member of the Court whose behavior has been put under something of a cloud is Justice Douglas , who has maintained extra-judicial connections , chiefly with foundations . Since the point of the Haynsworth case was not so much that Judge Haynsworth failed to disqualify himself in certain cases , but that he engaged in activities that gave rise to his disqualification problems , a Senate that rejected his nomination would be hard put now to confirm Justice Douglas . But no one would dream of trying to impeach Judge Haynsworth , or of otherwise driving him off the bench , for no culpable transgressions are in question . On the basis of what is now known , any move to impeach Justice Douglas would be similarly uncalled for . Representative Gerald Ford of Michigan , the Republican minority leader in the House , says he is conducting an investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Assuming that Mr. Ford uncovers nothing new , his only responsible course is to withdraw the threat , and soon .
