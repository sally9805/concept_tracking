It was astronomy week in Washington , but the astronomers who reported to the American Physical Society and the National Academy of Sciences seemed to be losing ground . For each problem that they solve , they have discovered a new mystery . One of the most intriguing of the new sky puzzles , Radio Astronomers Alex Smith and Thomas Carr of the University of Florida told the Physical Society , is posed by a brief question : What 's happening on Jupiter ? Radio signals that once came from the distant planet in regularly spaced bursts are now being received at 1.3-sec. longer intervals . " This is almost as surprising as if the city of Washington had begun to drift across the earth at the rate of ten degrees of longitude ( 530 miles ) per year , " said Dr. Smith . <P> The visible surface of Jupiter is a thick cloud-deck streaked with east-west bands . Its other conspicuous feature is the Great Red Spot , which has been observed since 1831 and is generally thought to be some kind of cloud floating high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Smith , the Spot changed its period of rotation at about the same time the sources of radio signals changed . This may mean that the Spot and the signal are connected in some way . Planets can not slow their rotation without some outside influence , and there is no influence known to be working on Jupiter . But Jupiter 's radio waves may be controlled by its magnetic field , which might conceivably change direction because of some influence deep in the planet 's unknown interior . How this change could affect the Great Red Spot , Dr. Smith does not know .
