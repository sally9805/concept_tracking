Chicago 's Abbott Laboratories , like most firms in the aggressively competitive drug industry , observes the most stringent plant security : work areas are grilled off and guarded , gates open only briefly for shift changes and deliveries , employee parcels are scrutinized . It is impossible , however , to police minds and memories . Abbott is seeking an injunction against two former employees , claiming that they memorized the formula for its highly successful Sucaryl , an artificial sweetener , and duplicated it in a competing product . <P> Abbott is only one of a growing number of companies with such security problems . Last week , at an American Management Association conference in Manhattan , businessmen were startled to hear statistics showing that industrial espionage has risen 50% in recent years . Corporate losses through spying and the theft of goods and processes now run to $2 billion yearly . <P> Telltale Carbons . The rise is due partly to increased job mobility ; workers unavoidably take knowledge with them from company to company . Another cause is the fierce competition built up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are introduced every year , at a cost of more than $6 billion in research and development expenditures . Under such costly pressures , many companies find it valuable to learn surreptitiously what new competitive products lie ahead or where another company does its test-marketing . <P> Espionage is heaviest in the electronics , chemical , drug , petroleum and toy industries , but some of it goes on almost everywhere . In a Harvard business-school survey of executives , 25% replied that " spying or other types of undercover information collection had recently been discovered " in their industry ; the survey also found that executives under 50 are less concerned than their elders about the ethics of pirating and spying . Some firms go so far as to hire professional spies , plant informers inside other companies , bribe or blackmail employees for information , tap telephones , even sort rubbish . " I 'm picking up a couple of barrels of trash a night now , " a California private detective admitted last week . " The way they use these carbons only once now , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is underhand , of course : many companies regularly instruct salesmen and other fieldworkers to report back any news and gossip , also sift trade journals , advertisements and Government reports for additional wisps of information . <P> Two-Way Mirror . The rise in spies , along with increasing theft and embezzlements , has produced stronger counterespionage as well as more frequent lawsuits . In what has become a benchmark decision , B.F. Goodrich Co. recently won an injunction forbidding a Goodrich space-suit engineer who had gone over to International Latex to use knowledge gained at Goodrich on his new space-suit work . So far , Du Pont has legally gagged a chemical engineer who knew its chloride process for making titanium dioxide paints when he left for American Potash &; Chemical ; a court order prohibits him from working on titanium dioxide processes .
