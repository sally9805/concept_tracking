At New York 's Madison Square Gar den last week , a stylish terrier named Ch . Glamoor Good News padded off with the best-in-show award at the annual Westminster Kennel Club show . <P> In recent years the event usually meant bad news for the New York Knick erbockers . Invariably , some sportswriter would point out that once again the pooches drew more spectators to the Garden than did the Knicks , the dogs of the National Basketball Association . <P> But not this season . While last week 's dog show played to a sedate audience of 8,000 , the Knicks turned away at least that many ticket seekers three nights earlier , when they defeated the Baltimore Bullets , leaders in the N.B.A. 's Eastern Division , 106-100 before a sell out crowd of 19,500 . The difference is that the Knicks are now playing as though they were the top dogs in the league . As of last week , the streaking New Yorkers had won 19 straight games at home and 27 out of their last 31 starts . <P> Simple Shuffle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forward Bill Bradley , apparently in the belief that only a former Rhodes scholar could articulate the secret of the team 's success . " I 've never seen a team pull together the way this one is now , " said Bradley . " Pulling together is n't just an effort of will . The important thing is that we 're getting to know one another - - personally and in terms of the way we play . " Injuries hurt the team but , preaches Bradley , " adversity tends to make a team pull together . Everyone thought we 'd be down , crippled . That 's where pride comes in . I admit I 'm sort of a believer in intangibles . " <P> Knick Coach Red Holzman believes in tangibles , like the trade he made two months ago that sent Center Walt Bellamy and Guard Howard Komives to the Detroit Pistons for Forward Dave DeBusschere . At the time , the Knicks were fifth in the Eastern Division with an 18-17 record . Many of the team 's troubles revolved around Bellamy , who slouched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark , playing won derfully one night and indifferently the next . DeBusschere 's arrival allowed gan gly Willis Reed to move from the cor ner to his old position at center , where he has performed inspiringly every night since , scoring at a rate of 25 points a game . With that simple shuffle , every thing went click for the Knicks . <P> For Bradley , whose skimpy 8-point average was a major disappointment for the Knicks last season , everything is suddenly clicking on the Scoreboard . <P> The three-time Princeton All-America once said that the emphasis on shooting in the pros was " overdone . " Brad ley is now gunning from all angles , has scored 20-plus points in four of the last seven games . Even so , the fact that not a single Knick is among the top-ten scorers in the league attests to Bradley 's philosophy of the intangible . <P> The team 's remarkable winning streak is a tough act to follow-even for a dog show . Nonetheless , as the new New York Intangibles closed to within three games of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one goal : winning the very tangible $10,000 that would go to each player on the team that leads both divisions and wins the N.B.A. championship .
