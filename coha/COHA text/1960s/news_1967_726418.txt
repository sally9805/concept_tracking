txt Letters to the Editors of The Times Letters to the Editor of The Times Churchmen 's Stand on Middle East To the Editor : As an Israeli I would like to register my perception of , and amazement at , the selective reaction of some church spokesmen to the recent events in the Middle East . Following the inexplicable genocide of World War II , the emergence of a " world conscience " has been a sustaining force to Israelis . Though not in time to prevent the annihilation of six million Jews , it has subsequently shown a faint pulse and promise to relentlessly hover over human affairs . That this promise was not fulfilled in the Middle East prior to June 5 is quite clear . Had the fortunes of the recent war been different and public assurances of Arab leaders concerning the life posture of nearly three million Jews in Israel been realized , the reassertion of a " world conscience " would have been once again of little help to those who could have been victims of its impotence . Most distressing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the internationalization of Jerusalem . Christianity , with an arsenal of " principles " of peace , brotherhood , love and ecumenism at its disposal , could have assuredly approached the problems of the Middle East and even Jerusalem with these rather than attempt through the political device of internationalization to wrest the holy city from the Jews or the Arabs . Christian Interests Of the entire spectrum of problems the Middle East conflict raises , some churchmen choose to concern themselves most enthusiastically with what amounts to their immediate interests . Perhaps Caesar 's dictum might be helpful in this context : " What touches us ourself shall be last served . " It should be remembered that whatever the Christian interests may be in Jerusalem , the ? city is in 1967 a political unit of the Middle East . I would urge that all religious groups concerned join in a constructive discussion about the Middle East , employing principles such as peace , tolerance ; forgiveness , pacific settlement , economic , social and political development and modernization . Action within such a framework should help realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most immediate benefit would be a secure holy city . Under an honorable peace and the serenity that would follow , holy places would be as secure under indigenous political frameworks as the sites of the Fatima revelation in Portugal , St. Peter 's Cathedral under the Papal authority in the midst of Italy , and others . EFRAIM TORGOVNIK Assistant Professor of Political Science University of Rhode Island Kingston , R. I. , June 28 , 1967 ? Aid for Egypt To the Editor : Many tragedies have visited the Middle East in recent months and weeks . Some of these could have been averted by a more understanding American policy . When the United Arab Republic requested renewal of the sale of wheat for counterpart funds , the American Government replied that it would do so on condition that part of payment be made in hard currency , while knowing full well that hard currency reserves in the U.A.R. were in the most critical condition . Now the only remaining source of U.A.R. hard currency sales lies in the cotton crop . The crop is threatened by the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no significant defense can be made because of the almost complete lack ' of insecticide which must be obtained from abroad with hard currency . Surely this is the time for the American Government to respond to humanitarian needs by making available at once supplies of insecticide to the U.A.R. Because off the present situation , this can probably not be accomplished directly , but surely the needed materials can be supplied through some appropriate international agency . I would hope , as I know many others do , that similar arrangements could be made for food supplies . Something must be done to preserve the fast-eroding friendship for America which even now still exists in the Arab world . EDWARD L. B. TERRACE Assistant Curator of Egyptian Art , Museum of Fine Arts Boston , June 28 , 1967 ? To Try Negligence Cases To the Editor : Ernst Wolfgang 's suggestion " To Overhaul the Jury System " ( July 3 ) , points up imperfections most of which inhere in the system itself . Hence they can not be eliminated without abolishing jury trials altogether . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal discipline will not tolerate the substitution of a one-man ( judge ) tribunal , even in civil cases . It is feasible , however , and I believe it would be acceptable , ? to assign to special tribunals , consisting of a jurist , a layman and a physician , all negligence cases , constituting the bulk of litigation . Such a juridical forum of experienced personnel can dispatch cases with a speed relatively equal to that of a court without a jury ; yet a collective , mixed judgment , as in the conventional jury trial , is retained . The jurist would supply requisite legal learning ; the leavening impact of lay thinking would be provided by the nonprofessional member ; and the physician would offer impartial medical guidance  --  not that advocacy by opposing medical " experts " which presents so unedifying a spectacle under the prevailing system . This proposal , if incorporated in the State Constitution now being drafted in Albany , would obviate most of the defects of present practices and procedures . SAMUEL H. NOFSTADTER New York , July 5 , 1967 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? Young Republicans To the Editor : In general , I would agree with your analysis of the Young Republican National Convention contained in your editorial of June 27 . You correctly indicate that the convention was dominated by an arch-conservative syndicate of Reagan supporters . However , there was a substantial group of moderate delegates who conducted vigorous but unsuccessful battles to defeat the syndicate candidate for convention chairman and a right to a moderate platform including support of the United States-Soviet consular treaty . The moderate delegates , about 40 per cent of the total , also led a rousing reception for Mrs. George Romney , who substituted for her husband . Thus the moderates discharged their responsibility to steer the convention toward the mainstream of Republican thought . WILLIAM H. NICKERSON President New York City Young Republican Club Falmouth , Mass. , June 27 , 1967 ? Guardians ' Fee To the Editor : The proposal to consolidate the Surrogate 's Court with the Supreme Court was rejected by the Judiciary Committee of the New York State Constitutional Convention ( whose chairman was the Presiding Justice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported to the full convention for a final decision by it . Such consolidation would not accomplish its declared aim of doing away with the appointment of special guardians in estates . Consolidation would only serve to place the eventual power of appointment of guardians in the hands of the then presiding justices of each Appellate Division of the Supreme Court . In fact , at the present time each presiding justice now has and does exercise such power to appoint referees to examine accountings of estates of incompetent persons . If the claim be true that the burden of unreasonably high fees of guardians of decedents ' estates is borne principally by the widows and orphans of decedents , then the same claim can , in fairness , be made with respect to fees of guardians appointed by the Appellate Division to examine accountings of estates of incompetent persons . Fees of guardians appointed by the Appellate Division are fixed by ex parte Supreme Court orders ( i.e. , without notice to anyone ) , based on some unpublished and obscure formula keyed to the sum of money owned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of work involved . In the Surrogate 's Court , on the other hand , an opportunity is given to the attorney for the estate to question the amount of the fee sought by the guardian . The function of guardians is to protect the interests of persons whose interests are not otherwise being protected by any of the mutes who are before the court in a particular proceeding . The only . way . to leoteet the public against the abuses of unreasonable fees would be : That fees be fixed by the Legislature based on a formula taking into account the stum  --  involved , time expended and results achieved ( which could be modified by the court on notice to all parties ) ; Require the fees of guardians in all courts to be publicized by publication , and docketing , in a special docket book open to inspection by the public ; or in the alternative : Create the salaried office of . public guardian , much like the present . office of public administrator or district attorney . The Surrogate 's Court is a specialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of work by reason of training and experience , much like the Tax Court of the United States . Consolidation of this court with the Supreme Court would only deprive the public of the expertise of the Surrogates and Surrogate 's Courts , and would in no , , way benefit the public . ALEX J. SOLED New York , June 28 , 1967 ? Greek Censorship To the Editor : Your . June 30 editorial " Aristophanes in Trouble " well illustrates the inanity of the present-day Fascist rulers of unfortunate Greece . However , owing to the strict censorship , no Greek in Greece will read it , and the calamity is that the vast majority of the Greek people have come to believe that the miserable junta that rules over them has the support of the United States Government . Communist propaganda . has spread the rumor and the people tend to believe it , the more so as the . rulers do not seek to deny it , feeling that it bolsters their prestige . This would explain the apparent docility with which the people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. PEZAS New York , June 29 , 1967 ? City 's Resident Birds To the Editor : Much as the Audubon Society hates to admit it , Russell Baker gave too much credit to the birds in his column June 29 about the misguided swal- . low who thought New York might be a nice change from Capistrano . It did n't take long for Mr. Baker 's swallow to see . his mistake and blow town , but a lot of other birds are n't so smart . A dedicated bird-watcher can still see 250 or more different species in the city , if he pokes . around all boroughs at all hours and seasons . At the height of spring migration there have been as many as 100 species reported in a single day in Central Park  --  which is one of the reasons we want to keep trees and meadows there , instead of . building cafes or stables .
