Soviet scientists have not yet taught shrimps to whistle , but Radio Moscow last week reported an even more fantastic feat . Geologists in northern Siberia , it recounted breathlessly , dug up a pair of salamanders that had been frozen for 5,000 years , thawed them out and fed them berries and mosquitoes from their hands . One of the prehistoric newts ( tritons ) scampered happily about for three weeks before it died ; it was then bottled and sent to a Moscow University laboratory . Its comrade lived for several months in a museum . <P> Radio Moscow , which said the tale of two tritons was based on an account in a Soviet literary magazine , even suggested that the discovery might have momentous implications for space flight . If newts could survive all that time , why not deepfreeze Soviet cosmonauts and thus eliminate the need for food during their long voyages through the universe ? <P> Radio Moscow 's story blew up a storm of cables and telephone calls from Western newsmen panting after all the newty details . And , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front pages of most U.S. newspapers , which since Sputnik I have tended to overplay far-out Soviet scientific claims . Then a Russian scientist debunked the story . Professor Gleb Lozino-Lozinsky. head of the space biology laboratory at the Leningrad Institute of Cytology , disclosed that it had been lifted from a children 's book , and " has nothing to do with science . " Snapped he : " The author of this tale should be punished . " From Radio Moscow : Siberian silence .
