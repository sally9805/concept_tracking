The Lower Depths ( Toho ) is a fascinating minor work by a continually amazing major artist : Japan 's Akira Kurosawa . Filmed in 1957 , Depths is presented simply as a Japanization of Maxim Gorky 's classic proletarian comedy , but in fact the film has a hissing demonic energy and a vast life-welcoming humor that are unmistakably Kurosawa 's own . <P> <P> Like the play , the picture does not rigorously develop a plot . It establishes a milieu , a geography of moral failure , an ultimate , absolute flophouse . And in this flophouse it engenders characters as straw breeds lice : a smalltime crook , a sentimental whore , a police spy who regularly gets beaten by his wife , an alcoholic actor , a slugnutty wrestler , a landlord and landlady like two scorpions in a bottle , and watching them all a funny little old man who laughs and laughs and shakes his head and says , " Oh , the way people live ! " <P> The old man , interpreted with earthy humor and shining grace by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other characters turn to him as men turn instinctively to a light in darkness . He is a holy idiot , a saint who is wanted by the police . He looks like a lamb , he looks like a dragon . Unhuman understanding blazes in his eyes-or is it merely the firelight reflected ? Prophetic wisdom flames from his mouth-or is he simply playing the oracle ? " Lies are not always evil , nor is the truth always good . . . Blessed are those who believe in something , even if it is nothing . . . You should n't forget what you love . The things you love are the things you live for . " <P> Played like a play-the action takes place on one set , one quarter of the film was shot in one take-the picture nevertheless never turns stagy , never stops moving as a movie must . Occasionally , a scene is boring , but usually because it intends to suggest the tedium of stagnation , the sameness of life and death in the viscous depths of hopelessness . Occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crudely exciting . And in one brief episode , a hilarious Oriental hoedown in which four flophouse characters do what looks like a medieval Japanese version of the Twist , Kurosawa is so far out the rickshas do n't run there any more .
