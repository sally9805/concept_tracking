In the complex field of patents , everyday products have often inspired memorable decisions . The shredded-wheat biscuit became a courtroom cause celebre in 1938 , when the Supreme Court set precedent by ruling that Kellogg could make the same biscuit as Nabisco , whose patent had expired and whose link to the shredded-wheat name had faded . The pink color of Pepto-Bismol was at issue in 1959 , when a federal court in New York ruled that the pink had a " functional " purpose and therefore could be copied . Last week the Supreme Court handed down a decision of such broad impact that it overturned unfair-competition doctrines in all 50 states and set a precedent that will affect U.S. industry for years to come . The subject of the dispute was a pole lamp , one of those floor-to-ceiling devices that adorn the modern home . <P> The Supreme Court 's unanimous ruling was based on a conflict between Sears , Roebuck and Chicago 's Stiffel Co. , the originator of the pole lamp . Stiff el 's sales sagged after Sears , in 1957 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about half the price ; the company took the matter to court . A federal court found Sears guilty of unfair competition , not because of a patent infringement but under an Illinois common law that forbids exact copying of another 's goods . In fact , ruled the court , Stiffel 's pole lamp was not really unique enough to be protected by patent at all ; it then invalidated Stiffel 's patent . <P> The Supreme Court went a step farther . It affirmed the lower court 's in validation of Stiffel 's patent , but ruled that Sears was erroneously blamed for unfair competition . Its reasoning : once the patent on a product no longer exists , anyone has the right to make an exact copy-and should not be restrained from doing so by state unfair-competition laws . The court thus overruled all the states ' protective laws , except against outright fraud , and declared open season on any products not protected by patents or trade names . Consumer groups hailed the ruling as heralding lower prices , but manufacturers were not so ecstatic . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition , believe that companies will be less likely to work on new and original designs if they can be copied as soon as they hit the market .
