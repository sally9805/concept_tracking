She felt her heart pound , but she swallowed it and rushed into bed . Then she felt it ! Oh , God ! It was glorious ! Her whole body felt weightless . Her head was heavy , yet light as air . She was going to sleep . . . sleep . . . oh , the beautiful little red doll ! " <P> Next morning Jennifer awoke refreshed and radiantly ready for another day of drudgery in the tinsel mines .
