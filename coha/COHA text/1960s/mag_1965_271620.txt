With 69,200 Americans committed on land , at sea and in the air to the conflict in Viet Nam and another 31,600 enforcing a precarious peace in the Dominican Republic , the U.S. is a nation at war . And its leader is proving himself one of the most remarkable of all wartime Presidents . <P> Rarely has the presidency been so personalized . To Lyndon Baines John son , it is " my " Security Council and " my " intelligence bulletin . Referring to air strikes against North Viet Nam , he told aides : " I could have bombed again last night , but I did n't . " Of the U.S. effort in Viet Nam , he said : " I thank the Lord that I 've got men who want to go with me , from McNamara right down to the littlest private who 's carrying a gun . " Of Communist intransigence in Viet Nam , he cried : " They actually thought pressure on an American President would get so great that he 'd pull out of Viet Nam . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pulling out . " <P> " I Do n't Expect to Duck . " For Lyndon Johnson , the days run into nights and the nights into days . " Some days , " he said , " I suddenly realize at 5 o'clock that I have n't had lunch . " Frequently , he is still on the telephone at 4 a.m . He manages his afternoon naps but no longer has time for swims in the White House pool . Instead of the relaxing Cutty Sark and soda , he now sips root beer or a no-calorie orange drink in his Oval Office . There are deep , dark circles beneath his eyes , and his voice is hoarse . Last week he paused briefly to gaze at a White House bust of another wartime President - Abraham Lincoln - and compassion was stamped on his own weary features . <P> But he never stops or even slows down . To reporters accompanying him on backyard walks , to dinner guests , to aides who sit at his bedside at night , to Latin American leaders , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains and defends his decisions . " When you duck , dodge , hesitate and shimmy , every man and his dog give you a kick , " he said . " I expect to get kicked , but I do n't expect to duck . " Replying to complaints about his decision to send troops into the Dominican Republic , Johnson snapped : " I realize I am running the risk of being called a gunboat diplomat , but that is nothing compared to what I 'd be called if the Dominican Republic went down the drain . " <P> On the Air . The President has taken to using television the way other men use the telephone . In the past two weeks he has appeared six times-usually on the spur of the moment , to such an extent that harried network executives pleaded for warnings further in advance . A typical performance came at 9:58 p.m. on Sunday , May 2 . Johnson gave the networks less than three hours ' notice . No one knew what his subject was going to be . Only CBS carried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson 's meatiest statements about the Dominican Republic .
