With total predictability , the names of this year 's Pulitzer prizewinners* were emblazoned in the nation 's press last week . As usual , the awards evoked everything from applause to astonishment ( see next story ) . Ironically , what made the big news was a Pulitzer non-prizewinner . <P> By unanimous vote , the Pulitzer Advisory Board handed the " distinguished biography " award ( $500 ) to William A. Swanberg 's Citizen Hearst ( Scribner ; $7.50 ) , a meticulously impartial study of the Hearst publishing empire 's progenitor . Instead of ratifying the board 's choice , however , trustees of New York 's Columbia University chose to overrule it by awarding no biography prize at all . <P> Popping a Precedent . Never before in Pulitzer history have Columbia 's trustees vetoed a board recommendation , + and never before have the annual Pulitzer prizes failed to anoint a biographer . To compound the mystery , the trustees popped their veto without bothering to inform anyone-even the advisory board-in advance . Then , as questions flew , the trustees took refuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustees were within their rights . By the letter of Joseph Pulitzer 's will , which founded the annual prize contest , Swanberg 's biography seems patently disqualified on subject matter alone : William Randolph Hearst was hardly noted for teaching " patriotic and unselfish services to the people . " But if such literal considerations guided the trustees , they stood on shaky ground . They had , after all , endorsed the board 's decision to bestow the drama prize on How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying , a Broadway musical that for all its merits as a polished farce hardly meets Joseph Pulitzer 's injunction to " represent in marked fashion the educational value and power of the stage . " <P> The advisory board took defeat gracefully . With a nice impartiality , Columbia 's President Grayson Kirk voted for the Swanberg book in his capacity as an advisory board member , then voted against it as a trustee . " I do n't see why the trustees should be a rubber stamp , " said Board Member-and Atlanta Constitution Publisher-Ralph McGill . <P> Classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of Advisory Board Members Kenneth MacDonald , editor of the Des Moines Register and Tribune , and Editor Erwin D. Canham of the Christian Science Monitor . " My idea , " said Canham , " is whether this is a good biography , not passing judgment on Mr. Hearst himself . Maybe this category ought to be redefined . " <P> Maybe . But no such suggestion came from Loser Swanberg , or from his publisher . Both watched with satisfaction as sales of Citizen Hearst spurted , helped along by deliberately ambiguous ads : " We are delighted to hear that the Pulitzer Prize Advisory Board decided that this biography was the best published last year .
