He is a sight : a one-man Happening in steel-rimmed glasses , World War I Army tunic , orange-and-black-striped pants , drooping mustache , scraggly goatee , fuzzy-wuzzy hairdo . And he is a sound : a wild , free , singing sound that assaults the frontiers of jazz . " My mu sic , " says Charles Lloyd , " has shocks . People need shocks to carry them on shocks on a glorious level . " Last week the Charles Lloyd Quartet had shocks aplenty for the rockers at Fillmore Auditorium , San Francisco 's hangar-sized discotheque . Though modern jazz normally goes over with teen agers like a 9 p.m. curfew , Lloyd 's passionate attack held them spellbound . Wrapping his gangling frame around his tenor saxophone , he explored the full range of the instrument , ricocheting be tween hoarse blats and urgent bleats , pouring out great churning whirlpools of sound . Dipping and bobbing as he played , he flew off on melodic tangents that were by turns coy and playful , ten der and savage . Then , taking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and misty moods of a man looking back on sunnier days . Love Vibrations . Lloyd is the newest prophet of New Wave jazz - the freeform explorations made familiar by such saxmen as John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman . His rapport with his sidemen , especially inventive Pianist Keith Jarrett , verges on the extrasensory . The quartet 's appeal is that , for all its flights of fancy , its fractured rhythms and criss-crossing harmonies , its music makes sense . Free of the pedantry and obscurantism that plagues the avantgarde , it delivers the happy news that there can be order in the New Wave 's chaos . <P> Unlike his grim-faced contemporaries , Lloyd is not at odds with the square world . Communication is his prime concern , and he achieves it by drawing freely on a wide variety of styles-from calypso to hootchy-kootchy , from Bartok to Indian ragas . When he tries to describe what he is doing , though , his talk tends to get lost in shifting rhythms . " Music is like breathing , " he says . " When one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , T 'm here , ' there 's something quite cosmic about it . We 're all here . All in harmony . Only the chords are different . I play about the unity of everything . The love , the totality-like bringing everyone together in a joyous dance . I play love vibrations . " <P> Few Get Through . The essence of jazz , Lloyd feels , is a delicate blend of " warmth of the heart and the cool of the head . " The warmth he learned while nurturing his " primitive roots " in Memphis . The cool came later when he studied composition at the University of Southern California , steeping himself in Bartok , Stravinsky and the impression- ists by day , slipping off to play jam sessions by night . After earning a master 's degree in 1961 , he joined the Chico Hamilton Quintet and switched from alto to tenor sax because " it seemed to be the voice I was hearing . It can be such a bitch , but with it you can draw a line of prancing dolphins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
