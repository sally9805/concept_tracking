Many a U.S. citizen has mixed feelings about General of the Army Douglas Mac-Arthur . But to Filipinos , MacArthur is a hero without flaw . " I shall return , " he promised in retreat before the Japanese in the first dark days of 1942 ; and he kept his promise when U.S. troops stormed back into the Philippines in 1944 . He returned again in 1946 to watch as the U.S. , after nearly 50 years of beneficent colonial tutelage , bestowed independence on the Philippines . Last week , to help Filipinos celebrate their 15th anniversary of freedom , the old soldier , a frail but erect 81 , returned for what he himself admitted was a last " sentimental journey . " <P> A great shout went up as MacArthur stepped out of the White House 707 at Manila 's airport , dressed in the spare khaki uniform of another era , wearing the faded , frayed cap he made famous . His salute trembled ever so slightly , but he had lost none of his flair for the Ciceronian phrase . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Here I have lived my greatest moments . Here I have my greatest memories . " <P> Overwhelming Role . With that , he climbed into a Cadillac to receive the greatest reception in Manila 's history . An estimated 2,000.000 wildly cheering Filipinos lined the ten-mile route from the airport to Manila 's Malacanan Palace , where MacArthur and his wife Jean were to stay . Even MacArthur , never one to view his own role in history lightly , seemed impressed . " Overwhelming , " he gasped . Bands greeted him with Old Soldiers Never Die , the venerable barracks tune he applied to himself when Truman recalled him from Korea in 1951 for defiantly insisting that the war should be carried to the Red Chinese mainland . <P> Addressing Filipino lawmakers later in the week , MacArthur indicated that he was still of the same mind . The failure of the United Nations forces to win the Korean war was " a major disaster for the free world , " he said . " With victory within our grasp and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more then than against Japan , we failed to see it through . Had we done so , we would have destroyed Red China 's capability of waging modern war for generations to come . " <P> Field Marshal Napoleon . MacArthur first came to the Philippines in 1903 as a second lieutenant fresh out of West Point . ( His father , General Arthur MacArthur , served as last military governor of the islands . ) The lieutenant spent a year engineering sea walls , wharves and roads , came back briefly in 1923 and then in 1928 as a brigadier general commanding all U.S. troops in the Philippines . In 1935 MacArthur finished up a five-year stint as the youngest U.S. Army chief of staff . His next job : Philippines military adviser , with the rank of field marshal in the Philippine army . Foreseeing the coming world conflict , MacArthur raced to build up the Philippine army with a singlemindedness that earned him the mocking title " Napoleon of Luzon " from U.S. detractors - until the war came and with it MacArthur 's finest hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the islands lay prostrate . <P>
