Reformers have argued for years that the ultimate weapon of the poverty war should be a program of guaranteed work for every adult willing and physically able to hold a job . Last summer 's urban violence gave new impetus to the idea . The Urban Coalition-a group of business , labor , political , religious and civil rights leaders-backed the proposal , and a bipartisan group of Senate liberals fought for legislation to implement it . But the Johnson Administration actively opposed the bill . <P> Last week Lyndon Johnson surprisingly came out hard for making the U.S. Government the employer of last resort for the " halfmillion hard-core unemployed in our principal cities . " In his television interview , he declared : " I am going to call in the businessmen of America and say one of two things has to happen : you have to help me go out and find jobs for these people , or we are going to find jobs in the Government for them . I think it will have to be done , as expensive as it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The unsuccessful Senate bill would have provided $2.8 billion for two years to employ 500,000 . Congress gave just $1.77 billion to the entire poverty program for the current fiscal year , and that only after a rough fight . If Johnson seriously pushes a major new job scheme in an election year when taxes and Government spending are already high on the agenda of bitter issues , he can expect a more grinding scrap on Capitol Hill than he had in 1967.
