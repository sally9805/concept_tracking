In White House executive offices and at the Treasury , Administration economists last week were quietly celebrating a victory that seemed too good to be true : by all accepted standards , the longstanding threat of inflation appeared to be whipped . Success in a series of key battles , the economists agreed , is winning the war against price upcreep . Ahead for the U.S .. said these prophets with only a pinch of caution , is a new era of steady growth and price stability . <P> Their confidence was based on the belief that , for the first time in a generation , U.S. fiscal ( budget ) and monetary ( credit ) policy are pulling in tandem rather than in opposite directions . Money supply and growth demands of the economy seem to be approaching balance . On one side of the bright new equation is the hefty $4.2 billion surplus forecast for fiscal 1961 by the Treasury , biggest projected surplus since the Truman Administration 's $8.4 billion in 1948 . And on the other side is the slowly achieved success of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most easily managed proportions since the ' 20s : about 30% ( $140.2 billion ) of the U.S. gross national product . <P> " If we had not had the ' tight money ' some of the Democrats were hollering about . " said a Treasury economist , " today we would have prices 5% higher than they are ; we could be in an inflationary crisis , and we would be in the middle of a foreign run on gold . " <P> Monetary and fiscal policy have found some powerful new allies in holding down inflation . One is the psychology of the consuming public ; buyers plainly intend to buy at their price or not at all . Another new force is sharp foreign competition . For the first time since the 1920s , U.S. labor and management are facing efficient , hustling overseas competition . Price cutting abroad and buyer resistance at home , say the economists , are forcing labor and management to recognize some hard facts about the danger in ever-rising wages and prices . <P> Most heartening proof of stability , as the economists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price index-down two-tenths of a point in the past year . Another sign , but less significant because it covers more luxuries and services : the Labor Department 's consumer price index shows that living costs dipped slightly in January ( one-tenth of 1% ) for the second consecutive month-the first time since 1956 that decreases have come back to back . <P> <P> Does the braking of inflation call for any change in policies ? Not as the Treasury sees it . Said a top Treasury man : " If we sit back and enjoy it , we 're whipped again . "
