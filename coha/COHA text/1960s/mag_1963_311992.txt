Arriving in Bonn just 13 days after President Kennedy 's triumphant visit , Charles de Gaulle made no effort to enter a popularity contest . Both French and Germans legitimately emphasized that the two-day trip was only a " work ing visit " as stipulated by the brand-new Franco-German Friendship Treaty . As far as protocol and the public were concerned , it was even a kind of unvisit - no parades , no crowds , none of the pageantry so dear to the heart of De Gaulle . <P> The Bonn press predicted that De Gaulle would try to whip the Germans into line in case they had got too friendly toward the U.S. He was not as crude as that .

De Gaulle kept stressing the mystique of Europe , while Erhard tried to talk economics but found that the General was as little interested in such matters as the Chancellor . As for the Franco-German treaty , De Gaulle managed to sound both hopeful and casual . " Treaties , " he said with a shrug , " are like roses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
