txt Senator Barry Goldwater said today that the time might well have come for " a real realignment " of the political parties into " two new teams . " He suggested that they be called the Liberals and the Conservatives . At a news conference , the Arizona Republican also accused President Johnson of uttering " complete lies " in the Presidential election campaign . He charged that " so-called Republicans " like Governor Rockefeller of New York had contributed to the wide margin by which the party 's ticket was beaten Nov. 3 . Other Republicans whom he blamed were Gov . George Romney of Michigan and Senators Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania and Thomas H. Kuchel of California . The Senator also lauded Dean Burch 's performance as Republican National Chairman and absolved him of any blame for the election losses .

Statements Surprise Aides Flanking the 1964 Presidential nominee during the news conference were Representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , executive director of the National Committee , and Mr. Burch . Mr. Goldwater 's closest political associates , who had been coupling vacations with political strategy meetings at this Caribbean resort for several days , were clearly ' , surprised by the scope of his comments , especially his call for a reshuffling of the major parties . Asserting that a trend toward realignment had started in the Hoover-Smith election of 1928 , Mr. Goldwater said it could well have ripened in his own unsuccessful contest with President Johnson . " The time has come to choose up two new teams and get going , " he said . Mr. Goldwater said that he had given the question of realignment deep thought since the election . Now , " thorough . nationWide surveys " - Will be taken to measure what is behind " the decided shifts " in party strength , he said . In an unusual pattern of voting this year , normally Republican business leaders and suburban communities went Democratic while heretofore Democratic Southern states went Re-publican , Mr. Goldwater said . that the " real " reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth studies " that " are going to cost money . " In cataloguing the trend , Mr. Goldwater raised and answered certain questions . He wondered aloud : " If a Republican was a Republican 20 , years ago , what has changed him ? " Then he said : " This year , obviously , millions of Republicans decided socialism and centraldecided socialized government is all right . I want.to find out why this , all of ' a sudden , has been embraced by so many . " What most urgently needs to be pinned down , he insisted , is whether " the time has come for a real realignment of the parties . " His oWn judgment , he said , is that it has . As for labels , - he continued , , " the Democratic party would by nature become Liberal and 1 the Republican party , by and large , the Conservative party . " I Mr. Goldwater 's caustic references to Mr. Johnson- and certain Republicans , came in a I short review of why ' he thought the Democratic ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much effect the refusal of Rocke-I feller , Romney , Scott , KuchelI and other so-called Republi- ! cans " to support the national : ticket had in the campaign , he I said . Had they helped like former Vice President Richard M. Nixon and Gov . William W. Scranton Of Pennsylvania , " it might . not have changed the outcome , but the party would have lost by a smaller margin , " he went on . All , all , he said that the campaign had been a " dry " one , highlighted by- Democratic falsehoods and " the greatest use of - Federal power in a campaign in the history of the country , marking a very dangerous turn in elections . " As for Mr. Johnson , winner of the biggest popular vote majority in history , Mr. Goldwater said : " He . waged a c.  - -  empaign of fear . He went around saying if I was elected we would go to war and people would lose thair Social Security . " Those were complete lies , and he knew it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Goldwater also said these things ? : cHe does not b re-ard himself or anyone else as titular head of the ? Republican party , but he intends to have a : - voice . in its leadership . He said the leadership of a party out of - power " goes- ' naturally " to the leadership of the minority in both houses of Congress . 13He is " not looking for " the Presidential nomination in 1968 , and " anybody who tries to guess now what the party will do in 1968 has to be an idiot . " ilThe RepUblican ? party is now " the party of the people " and the country should be told " why big industry suddenly finds itself sleeping with the people Democratic leaders who are out to destroy private , enterprise . " With regard to the squabble among . Republicans over their party 's national leadership , Mr. Goldwater said that Mr. Burch 's election as chairman for a fouryear - term vats , in effect , " a contract , and I would expect the Republican party to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing fight in his party as " an argument . " He labeled those demanding new leadership " a handful of discontented ones " and expressed confidence that Mr. Burch 's stewardship would be upheld at a National Committee meeting in January . In his 45-minute session with reporters on the sun-baked veranda of the Half Moon Hotel 's golf club , Mr. Goldwater calmly answered much of the criticism fellow Republicans have been leveling at him . As to his statement Nov. 4 conceding defeat , he said he realized that some Republican leaders considered it too belligerent and But I was only b commentine on the Presidential-election , " he declared . " I saw no reason at the end of that thing to hold a general wake . " " If they want to think I contributed to their defeat , fine ? they might also have contributed to mine , " he said . Mr. Goldwater 's meeting with reporters , his first since the post-election statement of concession in Phoenix , Ariz. , came 24 hours after he informed newsmen that he would have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without explanation , a member of the Senator 's party invited reporters to a question-and-answer session at the half-way point in Mr. Goldwater 's golf game . At 1 P.M. he joined the reporters at the golf club overlooking the Caribbean . The Senator , looking rugged and relaxed , was dressed in blue tennis shoes , white wool socks , red slacks , . a white polo shirt and a floppy wool hat . After sipping a glass of beer and exchanging pleasantries with friends , he said , " Shoot . " He then proceeded to deal with questions ranging from his future in the Republican party to his reasons for receiving Deputy Prime Minister of Jamaica in bare feet . The barefoot issue had been raised in a letter signed " Disgusted " that was published today in The Daily Gleaner , a local newspaper . A reporter for The Gleaner asked if it was true , as " Disgusted ' , had charged , that " Mr. Goldwater 's opinion of our country is shown by the fact that he could not even bother to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his respects . " Not at all , " the Senator snapped , He said that he and Mr. Sangster were old personal friends . Mr. Goldwater also assured Senator Scott , and others who had been demanding an accounting of all the campaign funds raised and spent , that " they will get an audit . " " The party is entitled to an audit , " he said . " I hope there is not any suspicion of dishonesty in the demands for such an accounting . " The Senator stoutly defended Mr. Burch 's stewardship of the National Committee and absalved him of any blame for the party 's defeat . " A national chairman has nothing to do with the conduct of the campaign , " he said . Noting that the chairman 's job was organizational and administrative , he said , " I have never seen the Republican party as well organized . I have never seen funds raised so easily or so properly accounted for and so wisely spent in a campaign : " When his news conference ended , Mr. Goldwater went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b course , as originally planned . Mr. Goldwater and the other Republican leaders expect to return to Washington tomorrow .
