txt The strictest measures to conserve water in many years were ordered yesterday by Mayor Wagner . They will leave the streets dirty , may cause lawns to turn brown , should silence thousand of dripping faucets , change the tooth-brushing habits of the young  --  and save a minimum of 50 million gallons a day . The Mayor acted after Armand D'Angelo , Commissioner of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity , reported to him that a critical shortage would develop by late summer if the Northeast 's 44-month drought continued . The city 's reservoirs held 192.6 billion gallons yesterday , or 40.4 per cent of their capacity of 476.5 billion gallons . On the same date in 1962 , 1963 and 1964 the percentages were , respectively , 80.3 , 64.1 and 79.6 . The average daily consumption is 1.25 billion gallons . Even after the spring runoff is completed on June 1 , the storage system is expected to be at only 65 per cent of capacity . Last year on that date it stood at 89 per cent . Restriction on Hosing Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to water their lawns and gardens with hoses or automatic sprinklers except for six hours a week  --  from 6 to 9 A.M. and from 8 to 11 P.M. on Saturdays . The cleaning of sidewalks with hoses is also prohibited . Violators can be fined up to $50 . Commissioner D'Angelo said that rainfall would in all likelihoo &be; adequate for lawns until late June . After that , he said , even in the event of an extraordinarily hot and dry summer , he had been informed by the New York Botanical Garden that weekly soakings would be enough to keep grass alive and healthy . " They said it might turn a bit brown , though , " Mr. D'Angelo added . In recent summers the watering of lawns and gardens was permitted during specified hours three days a week . For a few weeks in the 1954 shortage it was forbidden entirely . No More Backyard Pools Children will also be affected by the new regulations . The filling of backyard wading pools is forbidden , and the Board of Education was asked to start a program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest of saving water . The Department of Sanitation was ordered to stop flushing the ' streets with drinking water . Mr. ' D'Angelo said he had been in- , formed that no attempt would ' be made to do the job with Hud-il River water , which was ; used in 1949 and 1950 , because it corrodes sewer pipes and other utilities . The Department of Water Supply will put steel harnesses on many of its 90,000 hydrants to prevent their being opened on hot summer afternoons by children and adults trying to cool ' off . All fire trucks carry cutters that can remove the device in three seconds , Mr. D'Angelo said . The Park Department was told to use less water on Its lawns , gardens and golf courses and to turn off continuous-flow drinking fountains . The Transit Authority was asked to halve the amount of water used to wash subway cars and buses . And the Hons .. , ing Authority , the city 's largest ' landlord , was asked to take " all appropriate measures " to conserve water . City departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un- ! der their control . This regulation does not affect private dwellings , but Mr. D'Angelo : said it would be a good Idea for them , too . Upstate communities , which ! draw 77 million gallons a day from the city 's reservoirs , were ! asked to conform to the new ; regulations . Summing up , Mr. Wagner ' urged the public " to exercise ' prudence " in the use of water . He indicated that he was ready , ) if the shortage became critical , to call for additional restric- : tions . Mr. D'Angelo made his report after he toured the watershed ; area with a staff of engineers . He announced that a prelimi-I nary study of local weather patterns would be made by Dr.1 James Miller of the New York I University School of Meteorol-I ogy and Oceanography . It has ! been suggested that for reasons ! not yet understood an era of : abundant rainfall is coming to ; a close .                 @ @ @ @
