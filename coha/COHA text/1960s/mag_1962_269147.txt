It was Benny Goodman 's toughest audience . As he led his red-coated band into the opening strains of Let 's Dance , the 4,600 people crammed into Moscow 's Soviet Army Sports Palace divided their attention between him and the figure seated in the government box : Nikita Khrushchev . By his presence , Nikita gave official approval to a brand of music that the Communists have often reviled as decadent . Russian cats were hip enough to know that Benny was really otstaly ( out-of-date ) , but Khrushchev declared himself bewildered . " I enjoyed it , " he said as he left , but added : " I do n't dance myself , so I do n't understand these things too well . " <P> Jazz was not the only field in which Khrushchev proved himself a square . He was equally perplexed and bothered by the swingingest development in recent Western history-the fabulous growth of the Common Market . The same day as the Goodman session , in a 40-minute tirade that was really an involuntary tribute to the market 's success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Common Market , he declared piously , could not , of course , threaten the mighty Communist bloc , but it was designed to keep the emerging states in Africa and Asia in subservience as Europe 's " agrarian appendages . " <P> Like any other world politician who is fresh out of ideas , Nikita then turned to the U.N . To counter the market 's " aggressive policy , " he called for an international , U.N.-sponsored trade organization in which " economically underdeveloped countries can uphold their interests and resist the international union of capitalist monopolies . " <P> Both Common Market headquarters and Washington dismissed Khrushchev 's demand as a " diversion " that betrayed Russia 's concern over the West 's economic vitality as compared with its own weakness . One of Russia 's great economic defeats was dramatized last week when Moscow boosted meat prices 30% and butter prices 25%-the sharpest cost-of-living increase in Russia since World War II . Said Nikita : . " I would n't say that this was pleasant for the people . " But he argued that the move was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materially interested in increasing their output " because prices were so low . But the government claimed it could not divert funds from defense for farm incentive payments or purchase needed equipment , because the U.S. is " harboring plans for a surprise nuclear rocket attack on the Soviet Union " - hence the cost must be passed on to the housewife . <P> Given the new prices , a minimum-wage earner in Russia must work five hours for a pound of butter , as against 42 minutes in the U.S. The Russian must work four hours for a pound of meat , as against 46 minutes in the U.S. The political consequences of these figures , at home and abroad , might be vast . They suggest that Russia can not afford to produce both guns and butter . They also show that the revolutionary regime , whose basic appeal was to the " masses " and their hunger for a better life , today still can not fully satisfy that hunger in its own land .               @ @ @ @ @ @
