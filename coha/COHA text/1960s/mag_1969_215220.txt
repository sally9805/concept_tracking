The faces are familiar . He has , at various times in his career , been a Texas convict on the run ( The Chase ) , a Southern rail boss ( This Property Is Condemned ) , a hung-up Hollywood star ( Inside Daisy Clover ) , and the harried young husband in Barefoot in the Park - the kind of guy who looks as if he parts his hair with a carpenter 's level . Yet , partly as a result of his own sense of willful independence , major stardom has eluded Robert Redford . At least until now , with two Redford films in the theaters and a third coming . <P> As Sundance in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , Redford plays a cool , sardonic renegade with a deliberate and precise sense of irony . As an eager young skier in Downhill Racer , he smoothly combines naivete and monomaniacal ambition . But his most impressive role is to come . In the new film Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here ! , he appears as a cold-blooded sheriff and gives his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of what should be many Robert Redford vintage years . <P> One Big Battle . He looks ready . With melancholy eyes and a guileless face only partially coarsened by a Sundance Kid mustache , he is reminiscent of the more or less traditional Hollywood matinee idol . The resemblance ends right there . He rejects the Hollywood scene , and his conversation is a pressagent 's nightmare . " Let 's face it , " he confides with the sort of intensity that adds volumes to every sentence . " If you want to get anything done in Hollywood , you 've got to fight . It 's just one big battle out there , and I do n't need that . " If Redford can virtually write his own ticket now , it was a privilege won only after long wrangles with agents and legal battles over suitable roles with studios . " I work it this way , " he says . " If I do n't like it , I do n't do it . " <P> It 's been that way ever since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on a solitary expedition of discovery . It took him to art school in Paris , carried him through the rest of the Continent , and deposited him with a bump back in the States 13 months later . " It was a black period for me , " he recalls . " I did n't know what the hell I wanted to do , except get out of California . I 'd grown up there , but I always had this image in my head of living in New York . So I took off for the East with some idea of being an artist . When anybody asked me what I wanted to be-whatever that means , anyway-I 'd tell them I wanted to be an art director . That seemed to be a pretty dodgy thing to do . "
