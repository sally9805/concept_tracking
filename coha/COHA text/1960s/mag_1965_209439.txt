The Blackout <P> Sir : If you look at certain pictures of blacked-out New York City , you can see very plainly , hovering over the city , a flying saucer . Obviously the power failure Nov. 19 was only a preliminary to a massive invasion by alien forces bent on destroying the human race . You must be relieved to know it was n't Russian sabotage at all . <P> HAROLD F. WHITNEY Boston <P> Sir : Your story , which struck me as superficial , omitted mention of the fact that the telephones were working . No doubt you are aware that telephones are powered by electricity-and Mother Bell was prepared . Similar efforts were made successfully by the radio stations . Other public utilities were found sadly wanting , including the bus system and the fraternity of New York taxi drivers , who were either unwilling to take fares or overcharged them ; they deserve public contempt . <P> ERIC HOLZER New York <P> Sir : The " brown-robed Franciscan friar " who was directing traffic was no amateur . Before joining the order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " New York 's finest . " <P> FR . PATRICK ADAMS , O.F.M. St. Francis Monastery New York City <P> On Death <P> Sir : I congratulate you on your perceptive and timely Essay " On Death as a Constant Companion " Nov. 12 . You show that the answer of religion to doubts about death does not satisfy modern man , and that philosophy and science have done no better . I remind you of parapsychology , or psychical research , which attempts the scientific study of phenomena not yet understood by physical principles . Most research done in this field deals with extrasensory perception , but there are also investigators , like me , who are concerned with studies that may throw light on whether or not human personality or some aspect of it survives bodily death . Whether or not the facts allow us to say that we have evidence for survival after death , as held for instance by Psychologist Gardner Murphy , they do indicate that the problem of survival is open to scientific inquiry . <P> W. G. ROLL Psychical Research Foundation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born in Shanghai of missionary parents . As a boy I became interested in heaven as depicted in Revelations . I saw nothing jolly in harping and singing praises forever and ever . But I knew God as my friend and was sure He would provide something better and funnier for small folks to do-like sliding down waterfalls in the River of Life or letting my tree-climbing sister climb the Tree of Life . Now I am 77 . My hope each evening is that I may have the bliss of falling forever into a deep , dreamless sleep . To me there is no lure in any imaginable sort of " eternal life . " The greatest happiness I have ever enjoyed would pall into unspeakable boredom in vastly less than fourscore years , let alone " eternity . " <P> J. ADDISON SMITH Seattle <P> Sir : Even in an age when oversimplification often passes for understanding , your shallow condensation of Albert Camus and existentialism is remarkable . TIME has summarily dismissed one of the great yea-sayers of the 20th century . <P> LEROY MILLER MARC SHELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Santayana summed it up : " There is no cure for birth and death save to enjoy the interval .
