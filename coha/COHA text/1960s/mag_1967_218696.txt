THE NEW FACE OF BUDDHA by Jerrold Schecter. 300 pages . Coward-Mc-Cann. $6.95 . <P> <P> Some 2,500 years after the death of its founder , Siddhartha Gautama , Asian Buddhism has come to life in ways that puzzle and often confound Westerners . Gautama taught the denial of self , a reverence for life and a search for the Middle Way to noninvolvement . Yet his modern disciples are everywhere involved in the turmoil of their times . In Ceylon , a Buddhist monk assassinated one Prime Minister , and Buddhist ward politicians turned another out of office . In Viet Nam , the grisly silhouette of a Buddhist toppling in flames of protest has symbolized the Buddhists ' own private wars against one Saigon government after another . <P> Buddha 's new look is that of a politician . This book , which grew out of a TIME cover story ( Dec. 11 , 1964 ) , is by Tokyo Bureau Chief Jerrold Schecter , 34 , who did much of the research for the story . It is the first comprehensive , country-by-country attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arena . <P> Headed Off at the Pass . If in Japan , Ceylon and Viet Nam the Buddhists are on the march , in Communist China and Burma they have been headed off at the pass . Peking has assiduously emasculated Buddhism in China , emptying it of its religious content while retaining its temples as shrines to the " cultural creativity of the Chinese people under the feudal empires of the past . " General Ne Win of Burma has used arrest and intimidation to undercut the young monks who crave political power , at the same time borrowing Buddhist principles to shape his " Burmese Way to Socialism . " <P> Buddhism in Viet Nam is accorded Schecter 's closest scrutiny and lengthiest appraisal . From the last days of President Diem , who fatally underestimated the power of the political monks , to the past year 's Buddhist uprisings , which Premier Nguyen Cao Ky expertly quelled with a combination of " tenacity and guile , " the book reconstructs the sorties to the barricades in Viet Nam . There , as elsewhere in Asia , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition and transition in Asian life . " <P> <P> Because Buddhism has for so long been " the ultimate source of Asian values , " says Schecter , it was inevitable that the pressures of colonialism and modernization would stretch the faith into new shapes . One of the strangest shapes may some day emerge from the confrontation between Buddhism and science ; the Vietnamese Buddhists hope eventually to create a Buddhist university whose curriculum would include engineering , mathematics and medicine , but today that prospect seems close to fantasy . At present , Buddhism is less concerned with adopting Western ways than with providing a kind of " cultural defense " against them . Part of that defense rests on an identification with the forces of Asian nationalism .
