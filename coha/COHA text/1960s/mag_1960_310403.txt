For eight centuries , regulations have proliferated as fast as the ivy at Britain 's tradition-loving Oxford University . Still technically on Oxford 's books are Latin-couched laws forbidding gladiators , rope dancers and deer hunting on the premises . More irritating , because still enforced . are such medieval regulations as the one that imposes a midnight curfew on all undergraduates . Fighting the rules is generally futile . It is Oxford legend that when one modern undergraduate demanded the pint of ale to which he was entitled when taking examinations , the university proctors duly presented him with his tankard-together with a stiff fine for not wearing a sword , another moldy statute he had overlooked in his researches . <P> Last week , though still proliferating . Oxford 's rules took an uncharacteristically liberal turn . Henceforth , decreed the proctors , undergraduates may " smoke in public in academic dress , ' ' and " women students may entertain men in their lodgings until 10 p.m. rather than 7 p.m .. provided college authorities are willing . " But with their usual imperturbability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public anyway , and girls seemingly prefer the 7 p.m. blue law . Said one proper fresh-woman : " I take my bath at ten , and I should hate to be seen in curlers . I would rather be seen nude than in curlers . " Last real progress at Oxford in the eyes of most undergraduettes : a 1930s decision that they need not move their beds into the hall while entertaining men .
