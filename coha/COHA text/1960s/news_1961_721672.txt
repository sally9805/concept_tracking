txt The visitor . entered Enter and clumped softly a Visitor , across the floor in his Smoking canvas-and-rubber galoshes with their clicking bu , ckles . The belt of his fleece-lined coat.was unfastened . and the buckle swung to and fro . From the narrow area between the front edge of his blue woolen cap , pulled well down over his ears , and the top of his red muffler protruded a shining new corncob pipe With a square-cut stem bound with a band of brass . Smoke was coming from the bowl , which wobbled dangerously at the end of its elegant stem . It was , of course , our man with the unlikely name ' of Balboa Prawn . Mr. Prawn removed Lack fleece-lined mittens , of Quality stuffed them into a Deplored pocket , pressed the corncob against the pipestem and jiggled the assembly experimentally . Ashes and a few burning tobacco flakes flew forth . The corncob bowl still wobbled . The pipe , said Mr. Prawn , was a deluxe model , cost a dollar and the only reason he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corncob he could find in the neighborhood . Used to be , he said , that the finest corncob made , with a real bone mouthpiece , cost a quarter and held together , for years , whereas his new dollar model was falling apart . Signs of the times , Those Late Mr. Prawn said , just Mail like the mail service , Deliveries which ? he added  --  was , what he had come to discuss . He was intrigued , said Mr. P. , by some recent letters to the editor from William L , Shirer and others about the mail service . Apparently , Mr. Prawn said , not only have mail deliveries been reduced from two a day to one , but also in some areas the one delivery is getting later and later . Mr. Prawn 's pipe hissed gently . He wished to report , Mr. P. continued , on his experience with one of the " extra " or temporary letter carriers who had served him occasionally during the 1960 holiday season . As everybody knows , Mr. P. said , - local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holidays , to carry holiday mail. ? A student known to him , said Mr. P. , appeared at his door one morning bearing a large sack of mail and , it being extremely cold , Mr. P. said , he invited him in for a warming cup of coffee . He was surprised to Leisurely find , Mr. P. said , that Pace not only did the young Requested temporary mail carrier have time for a cup of coffee , but that he also was under instructions from the carriers who regularly worked that route not to return to the post office until just before its 6 o'clock closing time . The problem seemed to be , said Mr. P. , that the vacationing students actually were able to deliver the mail in something less than half the time the regular letter carriers were in the habit of delivering it , and that the regulars did not care to have their fleet-footed helpers popping back into the post office in the middle of the day for more mail . Now in all fairness Long Pull to the regular letter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match on his thumbnail , it should be noted that they probably had been carrying letters for years and had settled on what was a reasonable delivery pace . Young , agile college students unquestionably could whisk the mail around the routes in record time for a week or so , Mr. Prawn observed , but it was debatable whether or not they could or would keep up the same rate month after month . Still , he said , he found himself brooding over the discovery that his young friend had to watch television for a couple of hours in the afternoons in order not to spoil the day for the older carriers . The moral of all ' Forecast : this , Mr. Prawn said , Little probably was that Change those citizens ' who are complaining about the mail service are not likely to see any improvement in the immediate future . Great changes in anything rarely occur , Mr. P. said , Without great expenditures of money . The mass of Government employes ( " the untouchables , " Mr. P. called them ) like the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way at their own time and hence the outlook for faster mail service seemed pretty ' remote .
