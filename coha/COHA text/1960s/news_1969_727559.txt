txt The dismissal of Columbia University 's board of trustees was requested yesterday by 12 Columbia students of conservative leanings in a suit filed in State Supreme Court . The students , who denied they were extremists , said the disruptive outbreaks at Columbia last spring had stemmed from a lenient and vacillating attitude toward radicals , and from a pro-leftist bias in hiring faculty members . As a result , they said , " there is serious and imminent danger of renewed outbreaks " and they cited occasions since last September in which radicals had disrupted classes . They said Columbia 's failure to maintain a " stale of tranquility " required for study and // ? ? ? teaching was a breach of contract for which they held the trustees.acco un tab le . The suit called upon the court to appoint either a new board of trustees or a board of monitors " to safeguard the interests of nonradical and conservative students . " Demanding an injunction " against political discrimination in the hiring of faculty members , " the suit said : " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unremitting leftwing slant of all courses of political , social , economic and other current nature , offered by Columbia University , a large number of impressionable students have been radicalized and turned into fanatic devotees of left-wing causes , who are unable to appreciate points of view differing from their own and unwilling to respect the rights of students who disagree with them .
