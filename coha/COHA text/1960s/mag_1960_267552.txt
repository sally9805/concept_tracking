The great question that stalks the ' 60s is whether the U.S. has the plan and purpose to hold its lead against the threats of the Soviet Union . The President of the U.S. devoutly believes that the nation has both . Last week three top businessmen and a leading educator , all veterans of public service , publicly disagreed . <P> Manhattan Investment Banker Robert <P> Abercrombie Lovett , 64 , Truman Administration Under Secretary of State ( 1947-49 ) and Defense Secretary ( 1951-53 ) , laid down the common theme in an exchange with Washington 's Senator Henry M. Jackson during the initial session of Jackson 's promising new subcommittee on National Policy Machinery . <P> Jackson : I want to ask , Mr. Lovett , whether in your judgment the threat now confronting our country is sufficiently serious to require a greater effort than we are now making . <P> Lovett : In general terms , Mr. Chairman , my answer to that would be yes . While I am not familiar with the details of the military requirements ... it seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things other than sheer military end-products themselves-our position in the world , the psychological image which we present to the world as a whole . I feel that we are doing less than our best . " <P> <P> Republican Lovett elaborated on his broad statement of the issue in a carefully thought-out statement : " National security depends on many things . Some of them , to be sure , are material things . But the more important ones are matters of national spirit . It depends on our belief in the future ; it depends greatly on our sense of values ; and it depends on our willingness to give up a little of today in order to have a tomorrow . While the challenges of the moment are most serious in a policymaking sense , I see no reason for black despair or for defeatist doubts . We can do whatever we have to do in order to survive and to meet any form of economic or political competition we are likely to face . All this we can do with one proviso : we must be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blunt-spoken Robert C. Sprague , Massachusetts electrical manufacturer , co-chairman of the 1957 Gaither Committee study of U.S. defenses ( which the Administration refuses to make public-TIME , Dec. 2 , 1957 ) , declared that the U.S. must be awakened to the scope of the overall Russian threat . " There is only one man in the United States that can do this effectively , and that is the President , " said Sprague , a Republican . " I believe , and this is a personal belief , that the danger is more serious than the President has expressed himself to the American public . " <P> Maine 's Senator Edmund S. Muskie : " I gather that you consider our present military program inadequate to the needs ? " <P> Sprague : That is correct , Senator . <P> Muskie : And I gather further that you consider the deficiencies a threat to our survival ? <P> <P> Sprague : I do .
