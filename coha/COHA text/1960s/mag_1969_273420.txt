If French films have a flair for love , the Italian cinema has a zest for decadence . Most major Italian directors have their own highly personal vision of spiritual and psychological deterioration , whether it be as flamboyant as Fellini 's , as operatic as Visconti 's or as brooding as Antonioni 's . Now Salvatore Samperi , 25 , continues the tradition with Grazie Zia , a bit of caustic surrealism that dazzles with the energy of youth while it is disappointing with excesses of inexperience . <P> Charge on Wheels . Samperi 's protagonist is a lunatic adolescent named Alvise ( Lou Castel ) , who spends most of his time scooting about in a motorized wheelchair . Alvise , the doctors tell his father , shows no positive physical symptoms . Still , his parents airily dismiss the suggestion that the paralysis could be psychosomatic and leave on a business trip , entrusting Alvise to the care of his Aunt Lea ( Lisa Gastoni ) . Zia Lea , a lithe beauty with raven hair and a creamy complexion , is vaguely dissatisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to take a more than consanguine interest in her antic charge on wheels . <P> Alvise , aware of Lea 's fascination , mocks her with feigned madness and vague promises until she rejects her lover , resigns her position as a doctor at a large hospital and finally renounces all her dignity . Lea becomes " It " in a series of progressively debasing games devised by Alvise . She searches frantically for a hidden ring , plays the roles of comic-book characters and chases Alvise blindfolded as he forces her to tumble into a cesspool . " You know I 'll never make love to you , " Alvise taunts her , but Lea 's passion is so great that her nephew seduces her into the ultimate game-Mercy Killing . She cleans and grooms him carefully , knots his tie and , as Alvise watches smilingly , injects him with a fatal dose of poison . As his body lies slumped in the wheelchair , Lea walks slowly up the stairs to her bedroom and sits in front of her dressing table , applying eye shadow . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owes much to others . Alvise 's energetic forays in his wheelchair are photographed in a manner heavily reminiscent of Robert Aldrich 's What Ever Happened to Baby Jane ? Like Roman Polanski , Samperi likes to use objects as characters ( a necktie , a rifle , a vase ) , and his consuming interest in role playing and destruction through domination is almost pure Pinter . Unlike Pinter , however , Samperi fails to draw his characters in full proportion . Even if the viewer can accept Alvise 's sadistic madness , he can never be sure just what it is in Lea that drives her so insanely to her nephew . <P> First films hold a special fascination , however , and Grazie is a handsome accomplishment as an augury of things to come from Samperi . Although he dwells too long on Signora Gastoni 's admirable legs and thighs , Samperi generally demonstrates a knowledge and feeling for camera movement that is far beyond his years . Even more important , he has attacked his subject with energy and wit-qualities that , throughout most of Grazie Zia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
