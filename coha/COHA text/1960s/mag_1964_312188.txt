Last spring the rest of the U.S. settled back to watch the South suffer : if the civil rights bill failed to pass in Congress , people reasoned , frustrated Negroes certainly would step up their revolution ; if it did pass , Southern whites certainly would resist every effort to test the new law . Either way , violence would spread . Yet , as it turned out at summer 's end , it was the North that had been racked by riots . And - with the ignoble exceptions of Alabama and Mississippi - the South 's racial summer added up to a surprising plus . Items : <P> GEORGIA . The one case of raw violence was the nighttime murder of Negro Educator Lemuel Penn on a Georgia highway . Public parks and beaches , as well as many hotels and motels , were integrated . Six more school districts were integrated without incident . About 48,000 Negroes registered to vote . <P> TENNESSEE . Nashville , Memphis and Knoxville accepted the public accommodations provision of the civil rights bill gracefully . Fourteen school districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls . <P> NORTH CAROLINA . Even before the Civil Rights Act , the state had desegregated most of its public accommodations . For the first time , Wake Forest College added Negro football players to its freshman team . Western Carolina College boasted a Negro basketball star . Two Ku Klux Klansmen were given stiff jail terms for trying to burn a Negro church . Twenty-one school districts were integrated . More than 240,000 Negroes registered to vote . <P> SOUTH CAROLINA . For the first time , Negroes and whites attended school together as 15 districts were integrated . Public accommodations were not really tested in the state . Negro voter registration grew by 32,000 . <P> ARKANSAS . Little Rock , scene of massive trouble over school integration in 1957 , complied with the new civil rights law . Eight school districts were integrated , and the number of Negro students in previously white schools-though still a mere 898-was double that of a year ago . <P> LOUISIANA . A Negro was shot after trying to eat at a lunch stand , but most of the better New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became private clubs rather than welcome Negroes . After a long court battle , stubbornly segregationist St. Helena Parish gave up , integrated its schools . Louisiana State University and New Orleans kindergartens also opened their doors to Negroes . Negro voter registration , however , was virtually stalled ; fewer than 1,000 signed up . <P> VIRGINIA . Resistance to integration took place almost entirely in the courts . Of Virginia 's 128 public school divisions , 80 are now integrated , 25 of them for the first time . Negro voting registration grew briskly after the elimination of the state 's poll tax , may top 140,000-a jump of 20,000 this year . <P> FLORIDA . Police , Ku Klux Klansmen and white gangs beat Negroes who tried to integrate St. Augustine restaurants , churches and beaches , and there was scattered violence in Jacksonville . Otherwise , Florida was generally calm . Negro enrollment in integrated schools grew from 5,000 to 8,000 . Negro voting registration almost doubled , stands at about 300,000.                @ @ @ @ @
