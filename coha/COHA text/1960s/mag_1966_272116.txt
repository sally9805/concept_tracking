Since its installation in the funereal Peace Palace donated by Andrew Carnegie shortly before World War I , the World Court in The Hague has been a graveyard of political illusions . Lacking an effective executive to enforce its decisions , hamstrung by conflicting bilateral treaties , and limited to advisory opinions on issues of worldwide import , the Court of International Justice is like a traffic cop without a whistle . <P> Yet nations with grievances still flock to it in hopes of getting moral backing for their causes. * In 1960 , Liberia and Ethiopia asked the court for a judgment on South Africa 's repressive racial apartheid . Last week , after six years of painful deliberation , 6,000 pages of evidence and a legal cost to all sides of almost $18 million , the court decided not to take up apartheid at all , dismissed the case on a technicality . <P> No Legal Right . The case centered on a mandate conferred on South Africa by the League of Nations in 1920 . South Africa was to oversee the neighboring former German territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the League of Nations and later the United Nations . As " interested parties " representing the 36 in dependent states of black Africa , Ethiopia and Liberia claimed that South Africa had violated its mandate by imposing racial separation on the territory 's 400,000 nonwhites . A victory for Liberia and Ethiopia would have paved the way for an appeal to the United Nations and possibly sanctions against South Africa . Instead , the court ruled by an 8-7 vote last week that the two countries had no " legal right or interest " in their claim and therefore were not eligible for a judgment . Two members of the court , Nigeria and South Africa , were appointed for the case . Their votes were predictable . But the permanent judges voted without political pattern . In favor of dismissing the case were Britain , France , Italy , Poland , Greece and Australia ( whose representative , as the court 's president , voted twice to break a 7-7 tie ) . Against : the U.S. , the Soviet Union , Nationalist China , Mexico , Senegal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whites in southern Africa . South Africa can continue to go its apartheid way in South West Africa . Rhodesia 's Ian Smith can take new heart in his independence fight against Britain . And the Portuguese can rest easier about their white-minority rule in Mozambique and Angola . <P> For black Africans , the effect was traumatic . At the U.N. , Ghana Ambassador F. S. Arkhurst , chairman ( for July ) of the bloc that speaks for much of black Africa , named a subcommittee to explore the group 's next action . " It is evident that no reasonable accommodation is possible , " Arkhurst warned . " Violence can not be ruled out . " In Kenya , President Jomo Kenyatta 's party called for " militant and violent " revolution in South West Africa . In Tanzania , Political Exile Peter Nanyemba , the bearded , fiery-eyed chief of the South West Africa People 's Organization , told newsmen that his country had no alternative " but to rise in arms and bring about our liberation .
