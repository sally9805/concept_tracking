When it fought with U.N . forces in the Congo , the Nigerian army 's 5th Battalion took special pride in its rigid military discipline . That was only three years ago , but as far as Nigeria is concerned , it is the remote past . Last week the 5th 's proud tradition collapsed in an orgy of mass savagery that rivaled anything the Congo had ever known . <P> The root , as usual , was the tribal rivalry that has been tearing the nation apart all year . The men of the 5th are mostly Hausas of the Moslem North , which has been carrying on a vendetta against the thousands of Christian Ibos who have come from the Eastern Region to live . Aroused by reports that Hausas had been mistreated in the East , the soldiers surged out of their barracks to exact vengeance . They got it . <P> Blood Curses . The massacre began at the airport near the 5th Battalion 's home city of Kano . A Lagos-bound jet had just arrived from London , and as the Kano passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormed in , brandishing a rifle and demanding " Ina Nyammari ? " - Hausa for " Where are the damned Ibos ? " There were Ibos among the customs officials , and they dropped their chalk and fled , only to be shot down in the main terminal by other soldiers . Screaming the blood curses of a Moslem holy war , the Hausa troops turned the airport into a shambles , bayoneting Ibo workers in the bar , gunning them down in the corridors , and hauling Ibo passengers off the plane to be lined up and shot . <P> From the airport , the troops fanned out through downtown Kano , hunting down Ibos in bars , hotels and on the streets . One contingent drove their Land Rovers to the railroad station , where more than 100 Ibos were waiting for a train , and cut them down with automatic-weapons fire . <P> The soldiers did not have to do all the killing . They were soon joined by thousands of Hausa civilians , who rampaged through the city armed with stones , cutlasses , machetes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heathen ! " and " Allah ! " , the mobs and troops invaded the sabon gari ( strangers ' quarter ) , ransacking , looting and burning Ibo homes and stores and murdering their owners . <P> Garbage Trucks . All night long and into the morning the massacre went on . Then , tired but fulfilled , the Hausas drifted back to their homes and bar racks to get some breakfast and sleep . Municipal garbage trucks were sent out to collect the dead and dump them into mass graves outside the city . The death toll will never be known , but it was at least 1,000 . <P> Somehow , several thousand Ibos survived the orgy , and all had the same thought : to get out of the North . Many were packed onto a Southbound train . The management of large companies operating in Kano chartered every available plane . All told , 1,400 Ibos were flown out of Kano alone last week . <P> <P> One officer of the 5th dismissed the whole thing as a prank , but there was no assurance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised a tense meeting of the Kano Chamber of Commerce that all was under control , he was hooted down . " Assurances are no longer any good , " retorted one local business leader .
