txt " On Strike -- A.F.L. - C 1.0 " proclaims a sign carried by a slim , youthful farm hand as he trudges back and forth before the gate of a 1,400-acre peach and plum farm near here . The fat m hand 's lonely vigil is part of a stepped-up effort by the big labor federations to organize farm workers Pickets also are pat tiding before other farms here in the rich San Joaquin Vallet , which alone produces more faim wealth than 46 of the 50 states . Success here could lead to similar drives elsewhere The federation probably would move next into other Western states and possibly at the same time into Texas and Louisiana . where ninny farmers use migrant or low-paid labor , says Norman Smith , who runs the Stockton headquarters of the federation 's Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee . Some Distance From Its Goal The A.W.O.C. still is some distance from its chief goal here in the valley : Recognition as bargaining agent for the farm hands But the committee claims that its pressure has led to scattered wage increases through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have induced many domestic workers to stay away from valley farms And the existence of picketing has prevented farmers from importing Mexican labor to help with the harvesting . The result , for many farmers , has been the loss of sizable shares of their crops In 1951 , the U.S. and Mexico signed an agreement setting up rules for the importation of Mexican farm workers for limited periods . Before Mexican workers can be brought into any U S. t , tate , state officials must certify that farmers need the workers to prevent loss of crops But state officials can not permit the Mexicans to work on farms where a labor dispute exists And California 's Supreme Court in January ruled that organizational picketing , in effect , is a labor dispute . If the A IV.O.C. moves into other states , such as Texas , where Mexican labor is commonly used , it doubtless will try to exclude the imported fern hands , just as it has here The primate targets of the A W.O.C. are the domestic migratory workers , who move with the crops If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will spread union sentiment into many other states as they move on . Then , too the committee officials figure the domestic migratory workers , who number about 40,000 , are more likely candidates for unionization than year-round farm employes , who generally are better paid . Many Do n't Pa ! , Dues On the other hand , the mobility of the migratory workers makes it difficult to put together a cohesive union . And the poverty of many of these sr ? orkers makes them dubious dues payers . The A.W.O.C. is trying to collect dues of 32 a month from the workers it signs up here , but many members are not paying . Previous efforts to organize farm workers have foundered on these and other difficulties . But Mr. Smith of the A.W O.C. claims things will be different this time . " This is the first massive , nationally-supported effort to organize farm labor , " he contends . The A W 0 C so far has spent $150,000 in its California drive , according to Mr. Smith . Groups of farmers here set rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detei mined to avoid nargaining with the A W O.C. over these rates . For the present . they 're trying to muster as many non-union farm hands as possible to prevent crop losses at the struck farms . They 're also working for changes in the rules barring Mexican workers from such farms . The strikes are called and pickets begin to march when farms approach harvest note . These times vary , depending on the crop . Farms growing peaches , plums and tomatoes , all now ready to be harvested , are now struck here in the valley . Later this year , as harvest times arrive for other fruit and vegetable crops , the A.W.O.C. says it plans further strikes . Some Pay Rates Rise The A.W.O.C. refuses to estimate how many farm hands it has signed up , but claims the total is growing every day . Few farmers are skeptical about the strength of the organizing effort ; some have raised pay rates in an effort to keep strikes from cutting off their labor supply . In the cherry-growing area near Stockton , about 150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hefty crop lffases . At Fred Podeata 's farm 15 miles east of Stockton , for example , pickets patrolled for two weeks and prevented the harvesting of about two-thirds of a cherry crop valued at $300,000 , Mr Podesta says . Instead of an anticipated profit of $58,000 , Mr. Podesta will wind up with a loss Of $80,000 , his accountants estimate .
