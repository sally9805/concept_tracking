Palmiro Togliatti will be remembered as the Communist leader who came closer than any other to seizing power for the Reds in Western Europe - and failed . <P> His first chance came when he returned to Italy from Moscow after World War II and resumed leadership of the party he had helped found . Italy 's Reds , who had played a big part in the resistance , were well armed , and To gliatti might have seized power if he had risked civil war . He did not , and Stalin later sneered , " Togliatti will never make a revolution . He 's a professor . " <P> His next chance came when he tried to win at the polls in the 1948 election . The Communists polled 30% of the popular vote , and were turned back by the strong leadership of Alcide de Gasperi , Italy 's great Christian Democratic Premier , who was backed by the forceful anti-Communist intervention of Pope Pius XII . <P> Thereafter " II Migliore " ( The Best ) , as his comrades called Togliatti , presided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to win over a great many of Italy 's intellectuals and artists , who make it a point of honor to be at least cafe Communists - and sometimes more than that . Without ever coming really close to power again , the Italian Communist Party exerted a continuing influence - sometimes merely a veto - in Italian politics . <P> Embattled Shopkeepers . Writhing , maneuvering and often split , the party tried to adjust to the new Communist world that was born with Stalin 's death . Though he had been an ardent follower of Stalin - and had even at Stalin 's orders betrayed the Italian Socialists to the Fascist police - Togliatti now enthusiastically embraced " polycentrism " - that is , the right of each national Communist Party to follow its own course . When criticized from the outside , Togliatti would merely give a vastly expressive shrug : " Siamo italiani We are Italians . " <P> Freed from the damaging image of the Oriental despot in the Kremlin , Togliatti tried harder than ever to make Communism look as respectable as his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long before Khrushchev invented goulash Communism , Togliatti invented spaghetti Communism . He no longer concentrated the Red appeal only on the masses , but turned to shopkeepers battling supermarket competition , housewives trying to balance the family budget , and small businessmen in need of tax relief . <P> After the Russians brutally crushed the Hungarian uprising , Togliatti was deserted by his longtime allies , Pietro Nenni 's left-wing Socialists . When Nenni last year joined the ruling Christian Democrats in the unstable center-left coalition government , the move in effect isolated the Communists . But Togliatti kept predicting that the coalition would fail to solve Italy 's economic problems , that the Communists would benefit in the end .
