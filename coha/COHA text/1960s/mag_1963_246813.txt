One of the least known men on Wall Street is slight , balding Charles Allen Jr. , 60 . His investment banking house , Allen &; Co. , belongs to no stock exchanges , seldom joins in a syndicate deal with other houses . But few men on the street have as much wealth and power as this former brokerage-house runner . As the major and often controlling stockholder of half a dozen important companies-in steel , shipbuilding , chemicals , drugs , insurance and other industries-Allen &; Co. supervises their financing , advises their managements , and devises new ways for them to profit . <P> Last week Charlie Allen qualified as Wall Street 's most happy fella . Ogden Corp. , which he controls and has transformed from a loose holding company into a carefully diversified profitmaker , reported nine-month earnings up 260% to $2,000,000 . Other companies in which he holds a big interest-Colorado Fuel &; Iron , American Bosch Arma , Warner Bros . Pictures , Teleregister-were also doing well . The star performer was his Mexico City drugmaker , Syntex . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January to $249 last week . With a controlling 25% of the stock , Allen has earned a paper profit of $12 million on that one company this year . <P> Quick Turns . How does Allen pick the winners ? " I have hunches , " he once explained , " a feeling backed by common sense . I never buy anything without that feeling-and of course there is always luck , most everything is luck . " But not all . A lone wolf , who operates with his brother Herbert as his only partner , he sizes up a situation 's profit potential and often commits his capital in a matter of hours . If the deal goes sour , he gets out just as fast . The decision to buy into Syntex , which he first read about in FORTUNE , came within half an hour after Allen had analyzed its balance sheet . <P> Syntex had been doing modestly well extracting male and female hormones from the barbasco ( giant Mexican yam ) and supplying them in bulk to other drug firms . Its bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Allen also had Syntex place greater emphasis on its own brand-name ethical drugs , which now account for nearly 80% of its business . Profits last year rose more than fourfold , to $3.7 million . <P> At Ogden , Allen staved off an attempt to liquidate the company 's assets a decade ago , has diversified it into plumbing supplies and filters , also bought New Orleans ' Avondale Shipyards , now the nation 's most profitable big shipbuilder . Generally , Allen gives management a free hand , but he also roots out failures . Says Ogden Vice Chairman Maurice Sindeband : " If things are going badly , he will come around and ask , ' Why are n't you making any money ? ' " <P> Back from the Crash . Bronx-born Charlie Allen left high school to start at the bottom in Wall Street . At 19 , with $1,000 in savings , he opened his own bond trading business , was later joined by his younger brothers Harold and Herbert . By 1929 they had " nickeled-and-dimed " their way to their first million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's instinct for profit has served so well since then that , his personal worth is close to $500 million .
