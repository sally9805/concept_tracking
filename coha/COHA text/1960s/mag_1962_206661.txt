There are still some 800 cases of typhoid in the U.S. every year , and in most instances no latter-day Typhoid Mary ( 1870-1938 ) can be called to account . The culprit is usually grandma . The indictment was made last week by Dr. Joseph E. Smadel of the National Institutes of Health as he got the Lasker Award for clinical research . Typhoid , <P> Dr. Smadel explained , was relatively common until half a century ago , and about 2% of the victims who recovered became carriers , harboring the bacilli in a mysterious quiescent phase . Some of those carriers eventually became grandmothers . <P> Most of the current typhoid cases , said Dr. Smadel. occur in groups within a single family after grandma has moved in to help care for a younger generation . If grandfather is with her , he is not likely to have much to do with food handling . But grandma takes over in the kitchen . If she is careless about bathroom cleanliness ( the bacilli are transmitted from fecal matter only through food and drink ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typhoid . Their acute illnesses can be cured with chloramphenicol ( Chloromycetin ) . After this modern treatment so few become carriers , they create a negligible problem for the future . But grandma 's long-standing carrier condition requires intensive and difficult treatment , which most of the elderly women refuse . It will take another generation . Dr. Smadel suggested , for typhoid in the U.S. to die out .
