At a recent meeting of an Alabama legislative committee where one of Governor George Wallace 's power-grabbing ' bills was under hot debate , State Sen. Vaughan Hill Robison curled his lip and asked angrily , " On what meat does this little Caesar feed ? " The question is easily answered . George Wallace , who is a hungry fighter , feeds on the meat of ambition , and with good effect : he is the strongest politician to come out of the South since the death of the Old Kingfish , Huey Long , twenty-nine years ago . One Should immediately make a distinction , however : Huey Long was never a racist and George Wallace , at least verbally , is little else . Looking further at this distinction , one may become anxious for the cause of tolerance . Long , who based his appeal on economics ( " Every man a king " ) , could have polled between 3 and 4 million votes in 1935 , according , to ' a secret ' survey conducted by the National Democratic Committee , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1964 , ignoring economics and concentrating solely on race , Wallace could have : polled about 35 million in the nation as a whole , and could have taken 18 per cent of the Southern vote , just 2 per cent less than Goldwater ( Gallup poll ) . Wallace , unlike Long , reached this position in almost one bound . He was only a circuit judge before die became Governor of Alabama , and he has been Governor for less than two years . Not always popular with other Southern governors ( Georgia 's Sanders seems to ' delight in insulting him ) , Wallace 's appeal among the ' Southern middle class " and farmers is so potent that he is sometimes referred to as the " Governor of Dixie . " And because of his surprisingly successful forays into the North as a buccaneering Presidential candidate Wallace , at least for the moment , can claim to be the third-ranking- power in American campaign politics . A youthful politician-44 years old and with the vigor of a former amateur champion boxer , which he is ? Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is impatient almost to the point of neurosis . He loathes the confining details of the governorship , ' the office consultations , the paper work , the necessary patronage chats with back-country supporters . He has national ambitions . Since last November , he has been out of Alabama more than he has been at home , spreading the gospel of segregation , and consumed by what Marquis Childs calls " an almost-messianic sense of his own mission to free the South of the hated Yankee domina. don . " He is full of remarks that have an ante-bellum ring : " We are Part of the United States , Why do n't they treat us as part of the United States ? We are not a colony . " For the moment , however , Wallace has boxed himself in . Although he has frequently warned that unless one of the two . major parties becomes conservative enough ' to merit his support , immediately after the November election he will take steps to start a third party , the threat is empty . Third parties are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on suicidal vendettas or for far-out reformers with programs . Wallace is neither . Third parties are for visionaries , willing to see their careers decline as their causes are absorbed by one of the two major parties . Wallace is not of that temper . All over the state billboards display Goldwater 's smiling face beside the legend : " Alabama , the door of the Republican party is open to you . " Wallace helped open the door , whether he meant to or not . His showings in Wisconsin , Indiana and Maryland clinched Goldwater 's nomination in San Francisco . After all , if a newcomer like Wallace could get " them " to turn out like that , think what Goldwater could do ! Then . with Goldwater in the running , those who had been encouraging Wallace to make a serious try to get on the ballot in a dozen  --  or sixteen or thirty-five  --  states , suddenly found their interest shifting . Even Georgia 's ex-segregationist Governor Marvin Griffin , for months one of W'allace 's staunchest supporters , announced that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had done what he set out to do ? " conservatize both parties . " But an ' intimate friend has said , that he quit the race " because he could n't get a single Southern governor or Congressman to go ' along with his candidacy . " And a powerful enemy maintains that it was " because H. L. Hunt and some of his other money pals told him they were going for Goldwater instead , and for him to get out . " However compelling his reasons for dropping the race , they were not sufficient to make him do so gracefully . When Goldwater came to Alabama recently , he was chauffeured around by Wallace 's chief muscle man and head of the state police , Col. Albert Lingo himself . But Wallace had " previous engagements " outside the state . Wallace has handed Alabama to Goldwater . The unpledged slate of electors  --  which supposedly were to be given to the Governor  --  pushed Lyndon Johnson 's slate of the ballot . With Wallace now out of the race , the only meaningful slate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a shambles , a demoralized and scattered flock . Wallace did that . State Sen. Bob Gilchrist , a frequent opponent of Wallace but an objective appraiser of the Governor 's power , admits : " I do n't know ten young DemOctober 26 , 1964 , ocratic politicians in the state who would make a , speech for Johnson . I ? o n't know that I would . It would do us more harm than . good . " ' Rep. Carl Elliott , who was turned out of office by Alabama voters this year because he was on Wallace 's blacklist , talks about having to rebuild the Alabama Democratic Party from the bottom up . He means rebuild without Wallace , but that will be hard to do . A Birmingham political writer ? who calls the Governor " the most phenomenal politician to come out of Alabama in my lifetime " ? rememhers the Labor Day program last year when Wallace shared the speakers ' platform with two Congressmen , Sen. John Sparkman , Burg . Gen. Luther Terry , and several big men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he finagled it around so that he could On hand were ' about 4,000 people . When Wallace finished speaking to them and left , all but about 400 left with him , yelling encouragements to him in this fight with the " feds " and forming a spontaneous motorcade of honor for his trip out of town . That was last year . This year , probably not even 400 would have remained to hear Spark- , man and the others ( When Wallace came back from his electioneering in Wisconsin , a motorcade of 300 cars made the 100-mile trip from Birminghaan to Montgomery to welcome him at the airport . ) Letters to the editors of Alabama newspapers commonly refer ' to Wallace as " our beloved Governor . " Grover Hall , editor of the Montgomery Advertiser and a close friend of the Governor 's , does not exaggerate when he says that " the man on the street is a religious supporter of Governor Wallace . " Yet even a man of Wallace 's staggering popularity must expect to lose some support when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wallace now has the reputation  --  for debt and ' taxation , favoritism , hypocrisy and ruthlessness . Wallace 's capacity for revenge is well known . Shortly after President Kennedy 's assassination , Judge Roy Mayhall of Jasper , chairman of the Alabama Democratic Committee , made an impassioned talk to a Young Democrats meeting at which he laid down the theme that " we are all to blame for his ' death . " Wallace , who had been in Dallas the week before the assassination visiting H. L. Hunt and damning the administration in ' speeches before right-wing groups , was incensed by Mayhall 's charge . For days ' thereafter , visitors to Wallace 's office were brought up sharp with the question , " Do you think I helped kill Kennedy ? " When a visitor assured Wallace that he did not so think , Wallace would flare back , " Well , Judge ? Mayhall thinks I did . " Brooding on this fancied accusation , Wallace finally decided to unseat Mayhall , a circuit judge of high repute for twenty-one years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve his vengeance . There are those in Alabama who , knowing Wallace 's sensitivity to slight , ' think his present rage against Lyndon Johnson may stem from the time of the Kennedy funeral . On ' that occasion , Johnson held a reception and Wallace went through the receiving line . Johnson pumped Wallace 's hand industriously enough ? but the new President 's eyes were on Governor Rockefeller , the next man in line . Johnson failed to look Wallace in the eyel The little Alabamian considered this a calculated insult and returned home fuming . One of Wallace 's most intense grudges whirls around Oregon 's Sen. Wayne Morse who , during last year 's school integration uproar , called Wallace a " punk . " The Governor retorted that he would " rather be a punk than a pink , " and suggested that Morse " should have his head examined . " Morse promptly made public a private file of the Veterans Administration which showed that Wallace was on 10 per cent disability for combat-induced " psychoneurosis , " and added that " since Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would seem to be appropriate for him to volunteer to be examined ( by a psychiatrist ) at this time . " Wallace came back with the remark that Mrs. Luce must have been right , that Morse had been kicked in ' the head by a horse . It was an undignified exchange , and one might have expected both men , when their tempers went down , to try to forget it . It has n't been that way with Wallace . He never loses an opportunity to drag Morse into a discussion for further vilification , remarking on occasion : " Well , at least I have a paper that certifies I have 90 per cent of my 267 faculties , which is more than Wayne Morse can claim . " Carl Elliott , who lost in a Congressional lovr-man race ( nine running for only eight places ) , was done in when shortly before the primary 600,000 sample ballots displaying Wallace 's slogan " Stand Up for Alabama " ? and omitting Elliott 's name ? were distributed across the state . Behind this maneuver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alabama , whose member groups included the White Citizens Council , the Ku Klux Klan , the John Birch ' Society and some Republicans Wallace claims he had nothing to do with this scheme , but people in Elliott 's camp , knowing Wallace 's animosity toward their " liberal " leader , find the disclaimer unconvincing . Sometimes it seems almost that Wallace seeks revenge where he has no grievance . When he was ready to take his unpledged slate of electors to the people for a vole , he let it be known that if he found Republicans voting against it in any sizable numbers , he would settle their hash by redistricting the state . This was a profound threat to the Republicans because , since the state had not been redistricted after its loss of a Congressional seat following a. drop in population , both Democratic and GOP candidates were running at large for the eight seats . In that situation , the Republicans had a very good chance of winning several of the contests  --  and , with a powerful shove from Goldwater 's popularity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wallace 's slate , even with most of the big city newspapers against him on this issue , carried the state by an impressive 5-to-1 ratio . It was a show of popularity such as no Alabama governor in modern times can point to , but apparently Wallace harbored the notion that his victory could have been still larger if some Republicans had not voted against him He went ahead and called a special session and had the state redistricted . Now no more than one or two of the GOP candidates are given a chance to win in their districts , and the Republicans are understand ably angry . Those who insist that Wallace runs Alabama with the iron fist of b-anana republic politico , point to 268 the fact that he pretests himself with two spy systems  --  one for politics , the other for social action . The network of politital informers is made up of thirty officials , each assigned his special county- or two counties , and instructed to report directly to Wallace any behind-thescenes political activity he uncovers . The other secret force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work directly under ' Colonel Lingo . They compile files on civil rights workers , newspaper reporters covering civil rights activities , and " subversives and anyone else who might cause us trouble , " as Lingo puts it . Wallace 's fame rests entirely on his role as the standard-bearer of segregation , and that is the great irony of his career . For in truth , although Wallace has carried the message of segregation ( sometimes thinly disguised as anti-federalism ) north to the Canadian border , east to the Potomac , and west to the Negroless steppes of West Texas , no Southern politician has ever practiced segregation less successfully . His failures began in 1958 when , in a dispute over Negro voter registration , Wallace , then a circuit judge , refused to surrender the registration records to federal officials . Federal District Judge Frank Johnson , Jr , told him to hand over the records or go to jail for contempt . Wallace denounces anyone who says he gave up the records as " an integratin ' , scalawaggin ' , carpetbag-gin ' liar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson threatened to lock Wallace up in the federal penitentiary for five years  --  long enough to prevent his running for governor in 1962 ? if he did n't produce the records , and that Wallace , to escape the contempt conviction , went contritely to Johnson 's house at night . The judge , an old law-school classmate of Wallace , is too much a gentleman to go into ' details but he has said that Wallace obeyed the court in a " devious " manner . The first time that Wallace ran for governor , in 1958 , he was so moderate on the race question that one saw only Wallace bumper stickers in many Negro districts . In that campaign the Ku Klux Klan came out for John Patterson , and Wallace spent a good part of his time talking against the Klan . ( Four years later , Wallace had the K.K.K , work ing for Min , out tearing clown other politicians ' signs ) It was only after the 1958 defeat that Wallace decided to go all the way as a segregationist On election night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told friends , " They outniggered me that time , but they 'll never do it again . " And , in a sense , no other politician has been able to out-nigger him ? in words . But as his defeated opponent , Ryan De Graffenreid , remarked when Wallace moved into the Governor 's mansion in 1963 , still breathing fire and brimstone : " It 's been the same pattern in every state where you have a loud-mouth , rabble-rousing Governor . They have brought the walls of segregation tumbling down on their heads . " De Graffenreid was a prophet . In his inaugural address last year Wallace promised " segregation today , segregation tomorrow , segregation forever . " But forever lasted only five months , and today Alabama 's ' schools are among the most desegregated in the South , . All the state universities are integrated , as are all the big city public school systems , and several rural systems too . Alabama is the only state forced to operate under a specific ? tate-wide court order to desegregate . Oxford , Miss. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ala. , under George Wallace , was . only ? a farce . Wallace rolled out all the dramatic props  --  national guard , state troopers , edicts ? but nothing clicked , either on the college or public school level . The most he got for his theatrics was the complaint from local ' school boards in Huntsville , Mobile and elsewhere  --  who wanted to integrate and get on with their business  --  that this was interference of precisely the sort that Wallace found so deplorable when the federal ' government engaged in it . The Alabama Journal , one of the few newspapers to oppose Wallace consistently , editorialized at the time : , It appears that our governor holds the Southeastern Conference title for the most desegregation in the shortest time . How long will his fire-andfall-back tactics fool the people ? Just as the people in London were soothed by the sound of anti-air-craft guns firing at nothing in the early stages of the Blitz  --  a calculated ruse to convince them that Britain was fighting back , thus to The NATION bolster their morale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanks . The people love it , sad to say . One Alabama college president , appraising Wallace 's " successful failure " as a segregationist , said , " I would term the Governor a pseudo-demagogue because lie really does n't believe what he says about the race question . He uses it only as a technique to get the vote of the non-sophisticated white man . " Just last month Wallace summoned the Alabama legislature into another special session  --  a one-day affair to cost the state $7,000 ? in a last-ditch try to initiate a nationwide constitutional convention for the purpose of passing an amendment that would give the states sole control over schools . Not even Wallace feels that this is anything but another grandstand play . Thirty-seven states would have to join Alabama in seeking the convention , ' and then three-fourths of the states would have to approve the amendment . No attempt to amend the Constitution in that manner has ever been successful . In addition to an impassioned attack on integration , Wallace planned his winning race for the governorship around promises to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , he sent the liquor agents packing , and they were good riddance . Liquor stores in Alabama are state-owned , and the liquor agents  --  there were usually about 100 ? had nothing to do but drift around from store to store , talking up one brand or another . They were paid by the major distilleries , not by the state , and they were paid well  --  one of them drew $52,000 the last year he was on the job . The liquor agents had been appointed by the Governors , so the arrangement was one giant payola  --  and recognized as such by almost everyone in Alabama . For wiping out the liquor-agent system , , Wallace was widely applauded , though this manner of do-mg it drove all the major distilleries out of the state . ( You can get Old Houndstooth or Bathtub Bonded in Alabama , but do n't look for Canadian Club or Johnny Walker . ) Alabama was on the way to clean government . Or was it Before long , capitol watchbirds began to hear that one friend of Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plies to the state , that another friend was getting wealthy selling macadam to the state ' highway department . Then , a few weeks ago , the U. S. Bureau of Roads charged that in exchange for contracts Wallace was requiring road contractors to hire as ' agents " friends of the administration ? including Robert Shelton , grand dragon of the Klan in Alabama Wallace 's response was in character Washington , he said , was trying to smear him because he was fighting all the godless left wingers up there . It was a childishly petulant response to a situation that could cost Alabama millions of dollars in federal aid . If the Bureau of Roads proves its ' charges , it will have to withdraw all projected funds for highway engineering costs , and in addition it will sue for recovery of funds spent during the suspect period . The degree of Wallace 's gratitude to the federal government for its part in the road program may be noted all over the state on signs that glow in the dark along the new interstate highways . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Progressive Alabama 's History . . . . " Flanking these proud words are reproductions of the Confederate flag and the Alabama flag . Missing is the United States flag  --  missing , also , any mention of what every literate Alabamian knows , that the federal gov.ernment is paying for 90 per cent of the construction . ' In winning Alabama 's highest office Wallace also promised that there would be no more waste of state money . His inaugural speech Contained the sentence : " The big wheeling cocktail party boys ' have gotten word that their free whisky and boat rides are over . " And so they were . Whisky is n't served in the Wallace mansion . And one of the state 's two yachts has been sold . But Alabama found that there is more than one way to skin a state 's kitty . Wallace , who had decried the seven plane air fleet that had accumulated under previous governors , paid a quarter-million dollars for a Lockheed Lodestar to carry him on out-of-state speaking engagements . He takes with him on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizable public relations staff and several important appointed officials . They are not inexpensive ventures , especially since the Governor is fond of making television appearances . No full accounting of his campaign expenses has ever been made . Wallace claims that they were , all covered by free-will contributions . The quality in Alabama politics that may eventually prove Wallace 's downfall is the very rebelliousness which he encourages and which his career is based on Alabamians are given to rebelling even against rebels . Winston County in northwest Alabama disliked the idea of secede ing from the Union , yet felt it could not stay in the Union while surrounded by the Confederacy , so instead it seceded from the Confederacy and set up the Free State of Winston ( briefly , for the Confederacy crushed it ) . The same spirit is found today in a tough and uninhibited group of Alabama legisla-tors , Wallace has several times proposed to the legislature that it increase his powers , but this minority group of Senators  --  using the filibuster with crushing effect  --  has so far held him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted in filibuster , while Wallace 's pet - bills stacked up . At the most intense period , the rebel Senators talked back at Wallace for 108 straight hours . When they resumed their filibustering in the special session , Wallace , infuriated , went on state-wide television ? at state expense ? to arouse public opinion against his opponents . He named four of them and said that if they wanted to oppose him they should have gone up to join the " Communists and beatniks " who attacked him during his Wisconsin campaign , By identifying only four of his enemies , Wallace was no doubt trying to minimize the size of the recalcitrant bloc . Actually there were  --  depending on the issue ? between nine and twelve Senators who could be counted on to block Wallace 's more extravagant moves . He was beaten on the following important issues : eSuccession . Wallace wants to ' continue in office for a second term , but by Alabama law , the Governor can not do so . In fact , he must wait a year after his term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law changed . He was beaten once by filibuster , and a second time by vote . It is now generally conceded that the succession bill is dead . Enemies of Wallace may rejoice at this rebuff , but it means that , deprived of a second term as Governor , he will almoSt certainly run for the U. S. Senate against the moderate Lister Hill in 1968 . He will be urged to this by intimates who believe their man shows up best in national politics . " I keep telling George he ' does n't want to be Governor again , " Montgomery editor Grover Hall said recently . " He wants to get some . specialty like the Common Market and run for the Senate . He belongs to the nation . " Patronage . ' In a greedy grab for personal power , Wallace introduced House Bill 9 , the . " lawyer hiring bill , " which would have given him sole discretion in the hiring of attorneys for the state 's highway program . Under this bill he could have hired as many lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary , and taken the money from the education and highway funds . Wallace was hungry for this bill , and when nine ' Senators stood firm against it , Finance Commissioner ' Seymore Trammell went to work , He telephoned the dissidents and told them he was going to see that road funds to their counties were cut ' off . For rural legislators that is a fearful threat , but only one of the nine backed down , ' and the bill was drowned in the filibuster . cSegtegation . As part of his campaign to keep the Negroes in their place , Wallace introduced a bill which would have given him sole authority to name the county registrar committees . As it stands now , the commissioner of agriculture , the state auditor and the Governor each appoints one member to each of the three-man county boards . The implications of this bill are easily estimated by recalling that last February , M. L. Bearden , chairman of the Birmingham board of registrars , told the Justice Department that Wallace had tried to get the state auditor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's complaint ? Bearden was registering Negroes . Wallace said that his appointee on the Birmingham board had registered no Negroes , whereas Bearden was turning the board over to the NAACP . Wallace 's registrar bill died in the log jam created by the filibuster . cEducation . Wallace made two grabs for control of the state colleges , both senior and junior . One bill would have ended the present system by which the University of Alabama board of trustees is self-perpetuating , each board choosing its own replacements . Wallace would have transferred the power of appointment to himself , and would no doubt have used it to straighten out people whom he frequently refers to as " pseudo-intellectuals . " He is reputed to have said that he would fire University of Alabama President Frank Rose " in a minute " if he controlled - the regents . ( Rose ' supported the comparatively moderate De Graffenreid in the last gubernatorial race . ) Economically , Alabama is in a mess . Its budget droops beneath a $365 million bonded indebtedness ? all piled up since 1951 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is anticipated that the state highway department will soon be allocating one-third of its income ( from gasoline tax , etc. ) for debt . Alabama has reached the point where it pays $40,000 a day in interest alone  --  interest on bonds that were issued without a vote of the people . In a special session , Wallace rammed through a $100 million bond issue for highways , amortized in such a way that not one penny will be repaid until four years after he has left office . Interest on those bonds will total more than half the principal . The Governor had said he needed only $60 million for highways , but he got $100 million . The extra $40 million , as one practical legislator put it , " he used to buy us with county roads " Typical of the economic sorcery that guides the state 's finances is the undirected and confused junior college and trade-schools program . This was Wallace 's baby , and he got the legislature to vote him $15 million to build five junior colleges and five trade schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were voting him . As it turned out , the number ' of schools was n't written into the bill , and by the time Wallace 's floor lieutenants and friends had been rewarded with structures , the program had ballooned to twenty-eight junior colleges and trade schools . Wallace had to go back to the legislature for another $15 million . That made $30 million for building , and not one cent for operation . Let the next governor worry about operation . State Senator Gilchrist , a leader of the filibusterers , describes Wallace as " a liberal in every way outside of the federal-state relationship . He has the borrow-tax-spend philosophy of a liberal He has borrowed , taxed and spent more money in his term than in any other two-year period of Alabama history . " A Montgomery newsman , a close observer of Wallace 's administration , agrees : " Except for his race relations , Wallace is way out in left field " Wallace has increased old-age assistance ( now $80 a month , quite high for the South ) , eased the requirements for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal old folks ' medical-aid program , raised teachers ' salaries , raised the budget for public schools by 22 per cent , and the budget for higher education by 26 per cent . These were smart political moves . One of the ' pillars in ex-Governor Big Jim Folsorn 's old political machine was the State 's 110,000 pensioners . Wallace , a former Folsom field strategist , went out for that bloc support and has no doubt got it . These moves an Wallace 's part do sound rather liberal , but in fact the liberalism of a program depends on who pays for it . In Alabama , the consumer pays . Alabama is one of the three or four greediest consumer-tax states in the nation . Its sales tax is now 4 per cent , and most Alabama cities add on another 2 per cent . That 's across the board  --  groceries and medicine and newspapers included . ( The Farm Bureau ? which along with the banking and insurance lobbies is one of the three politically most potent groups in the state  --  admires the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material its members buy  --  farm machinery , seed , fertilizer , etc. ? is exempt . ) To raise the money he wanted , Wallace has allowed another penny to_the be put On the sales tax  --  although for weeks in advance he swore to organized labor that he would not sign the bill to increase the tax . Wallace had proposed a tax on utilities , a tax on insurance premiums , and a bill providing for the reverSion of property to the state in cases where there are no legal heirs . But October 26 , 1964 these were just put up to make the poor man feel better ; as Wallace must have known , they did n't have a chance of passing ( only the estate bill got as far as a floor vote ) . It is generally felt that Wallace used them as bogies to scare banks , insurance companies and power companies into supporting the increased sales tax . The critical moment in Wallace 's career may very well be at hand . Beneath the great , garish , flapping circus tent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , notwithstanding his own opinion of himself ( " I am the law " ) , far from politically omnipotent . His several major efforts to gain more power through the legislature were all defeated . and he has met with embarrassing reversals in other areas . He invited the Governors of Arkansas , Louisiana , Mississippi and Florida to meet with him in New Orleans to prepare ultimatums for the Democratic convention . The support he got from them was , at best , divided ; Faubus of Arkansas and Bryant of Florida side-stepped his appeal for solidarity . The half-attained walkout of the Alabama delegation at Atlantic City was , according to Wallace 's plans , supposed to be joined by the delegations of North Carolina , South Carolina , Louisiana and Arkansas . That fell through . The day before the convention opened Wallace , through his henchmen , invited the delegates from all thirteen Southern states to a strategy session . Almost at once it became apparent that the session would be conspicuously ill-attended and Wallace tried to have it called off . The time was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : except for the Alabama delegation , the hall was almost empty . A fetv weeks ago , Wallace called his unpledged electors together and asked them to resign so that a pro-Johnson group could be named in their place  --  to be almost certainly defeated by Goldwater electors . Surprisingly , however , his own handpicked group balked at resigning . Finally , if Wallace continues on his present approach to popularity , he will eventually find himself helplessly entangled in a one-issue appeal , which even some of the most dedicated ' Southerners outside of Alabama are tiring of , and which , conceivably , even Alabamians will eventually find tiresome . Sen. Sam Ervin , Jr , of North Carolina , who co-managed the civil rights filibuster with Georgia Sen. Richard Russell , called Wallace " The chief alder and abettor of those ' who would pass such bad legislation as this civil rights bill . " Russell added , " Any realist knows that the ' separate but equal ' doctrine is finished . " At heart , Wallace is a populist . He grew up poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1937 . Grateful for what the New Deal was doing for rickety Alabamians , Wallace was a devout follower of Franklin Roosevelt . When he graduated from law ' school , times were so hard he got a job driving a truck . Some of his early married life was lived in a renovated chicken coop . When he became a legislator , he did not forget his background . He sponsored a number of progressive bills and pushed them through . And as recently as the early 1950s , he was stumping the state for progressive Big Jim Folsom , and damning the rich folk who opposed Big Jim 's aims . Then Wallace , like the great but tragic populist Tom Watson half a century ago , decided he could not really get to the top and stay there by dealing in economic problems  --  that he would have to bow to what Watson bitterly had called " the inevitable nigger question " Wallace , too , acts as though it were inevitable . A close friend asked him recently if he did not think that eventually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk become more adjusted to the law , perhaps he would have to modify his position toward the Negro , as Sen. Russell Long had done . No , said Wallace , he could not do that . In fact , he added , the Southern white would have to think increasingly in teems of bloc vs bloc , and fight it out at the polls that way . If national politics has a place for a man with that rigidity , then Governor Wallace , with his proven ability to rally the masses , may have a fine future ahead But for his type there is no middle ground , and if he has guessed wrong , then he can at best hope to be placed beside that old broken musketeer , Ross Barnett , in Dixie 's wax museum .
