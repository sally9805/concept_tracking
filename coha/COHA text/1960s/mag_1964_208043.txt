Women 's magazine editors are usually pleased when their product appeals to large audiences . Their advertising directors , on the other hand , like to argue that the space they sell is surrounded by editorial copy that appeals to a very select crew . In competing with TV 's undiscriminating mass appeal , they lean hard on their publication 's selectivity . <P> When the ad department of Redbook Magazine began a campaign in trade publications and the financial sections of newspapers , it boldly set stringent limits on the editorial product that bills itself " for young adults . " Said each of the ads : " Some girls are too old for Redbook. 18 to 34 : These are the Redbook Years . " In the accompanying cartoons .

But it also managed to reach many of those old ladies of 34 and up whom Redbook says it does not want-even though they comprise about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers . The reaction was scornful . " Since I 'm rapidly approaching the ripe old age of 46 , " wrote one subscriber , " I guess you do n't want me . So you may be assured I have subscribed for the last time . " From the mature perspective of 38 years , another reader informed the magazine : " I do n't think I 'll bother tottering up to the newsstand for any more copies .

" We are edited solely for the women in the 18-to-34 age group , " insisted Advertising Director Arthur Stein , himself a superannuated 52 . " If we had some way to tell them to go away and stop reading the magazine after that , we would do it . " With these blunt words , Redbook Editor Robert Stein , 40 , and no kin to Arthur , expressed full agreement . While Adman Stein is straightforwardly encouraging older readers to take it on the lam , Editor Stein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running large amounts of fiction on the theory that elderly females ca n't stomach the stuff . Says he with ill-concealed admiration : " The ads are a quicker method . "
