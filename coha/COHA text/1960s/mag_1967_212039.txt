IN the twilight of his long and laudable career , Bernard Baruch was invariably characterized as an adviser to Presidents or a park-bench philosopher who doled out wisdom from a seat in Central Park or Lafayette Square . Admirers tended to forget-Baruch never did-that in the forenoon of that career , he had also been one of Wall Street 's craftiest speculators . Baruch could be bearish or bullish . He once sold Amalgamated Copper short and realized $700,000 when Amalgamated reduced a dividend , causing its overpriced stock to tumble . Another time , alerted by a newspaperman that Commodore Schley had beaten the Spanish at Santiago , virtually ending the Spanish-American War , Baruch spent July 4 , 1898 , on the cable buying U.S. stocks in the London market . Next day he made a neat profit when the New York Stock Exchange reopened following the holiday and prices shot upwards on word of the victory . Baruch was proud to have been a speculator , but he cringed at the implications the term came to carry . " Modern usage , " he noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' speculator ' a synonym for gambler and plunger . Actually the word comes from the Latin speculari , which means to spy out and observe . I have defined a speculator as a man who observes the future and acts before it occurs . " <P> The trouble with that definition and the reason why the word has fallen into even deeper disrepute was noted as far back as 1905 . Handing down the opinion in the case of Chicago Board of Trade v. Christie Grain , in which the court ruled that commodities trading and the Board of Trade served a legitimate purpose , Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes sagely commented that when competent men engage in speculation , it is " the self-adjustment of society to the probable . " But he added that its pervasive peril surfaces when " the success of the strong induces imitation by the weak , and incompetent persons bring themselves to ruin . " Incompetent speculators lack , somehow , the sang-froid of an emotionless Baruch or the attributes of another successful pre-Depression speculator , Joseph P. Kennedy . Old Joe succeeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived the crash , suggested a friend , because he possessed " a passion for facts , a complete lack of sentiment and a marvelous sense of timing . " <P> <P> Broadway as Well as Wall Street <P> At present , lacking these qualifications , many an incompetent has more opportunity than ever to achieve ruin . Speculation in the prospering U.S. has become not merely an easy but an enviable thing to do . For little money down and years to pay the balance , an Iowa farmer or Rhode Island schoolteacher can acquire without seeing it a small strip of Florida that is bound to quadruple in value-or so the salesmen hint , using a Will Rogers slogan , " Buy land , they 're not makin ' it any more . " Art has become as much of a speculative exercise as an esthetic experience ; collectors have bought millions of dollars worth of art works , often in hope that the purchase will increase in value as the artist becomes better known . Amateurs can also dabble in oil-well exploration , beef cattle , race horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and precious gems on the chance that Oliver Wendell Holmes 's probable will occur .
