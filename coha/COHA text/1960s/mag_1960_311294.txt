The controlled newspapers and magazines of the Soviet Union ridiculed the Western craze for flying saucers . But ever since the first Sputnik , the Russians have indulged in their own kind of science fiction about possible visitors from outer space . One Aleksandr Kazantsev theorized that the great Tunguska depression in Siberia , actually caused by the fall of a meteor in 1908 , had really resulted from the explosion of a nuclear-powered spaceship attempting to land on earth . Reputable Soviet meteor experts and astronomers ridiculed Kazantsev 's theory and accused him of being a charlatan and a cheap sensationalist , but his theories continued to turn up in the Literary Gazette , the publication of the Soviet Writers Union . Last week the Gazette opened its pages to Valentin Rich and Mikhail Chernenkov , who made Kazantsev 's imagination seem earthbound indeed . Starting from the premise that earth can not possibly be the only inhabited planet in the universe , the co-authors searched for evidence that the world has been visited in times past by " cosmonauts " from outer space , and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Bible . <P> They concluded that the famed " Baalbek verandah " in Lebanon-a vast and ancient platform of huge stone slabs-may have been the launching site for the return trip of cosmonauts from another world . Though discounting the Bible as a source of revealed religion , Writers Rich and Chernenkov eagerly accept it as a historical document . References to angels descending to earth , they decided , may refer to travelers from outer space , " just as some hundreds of years ago the first Spaniards were taken for gods by the Indians . " Such Biblical figures as Enoch and Elijah , who " reportedly " ascended to heaven , may have been sample earthlings taken back in the cosmonauts ' spaceship . <P> Further , " the attention of modern man familiar with the discoveries of nuclear physics must be struck by the Biblical description of Sodom and Gomorrah . " The Soviet co-authors " transcribed " the Biblical passage into modern language and decided that the columns of smoke , the fire and brimstone that destroyed the cities resulted from the blast " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged to blow up dumps of extra nuclear fuel after first warning the surrounding inhabitants " to flee . Those who looked back ( e.g. , Lot 's wife ) " were blinded and perished . " A little nervously , the Literary Gazette prefaced this saucer-eyed silliness with the caveat that it " stands on the borderline of daring scientific guesswork and scientific fantasy .
