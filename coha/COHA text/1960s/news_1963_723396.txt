txt Washington The shakedown cruise is over for the Alliance for Progress aid program in Latin America . Leaky seams in the hemisphere ship of state have been located in its first two years of trial . Some repairs have been made , and the prospect- for the next eight years of the 10-year program is moderately hopeful from Washington 's point ? of view . There is disappointment here , though , that the alliance has not yet achieved the momentum , the political mystique , the economic dynamism that the Marshall Plan had by this time in Europe following World War II . Enemies Identified In Latin America , there is disillusionment that the first two years of the alliance did not produce the miracles officials mistakenly felt they were led to believe would occur . The alliance 's three most serious enemies have been identified during this first two- . year period  --  United States bureaucracy , Latin American apathy , and Castro communism . The latter has taken the alliance as its chief target , much as the Soviet Union did when it tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10,000,000 , - 000-aid program to Latin America for the next decade is wrapped up in a few quick figures cited by President Kennedy . He issued an official statement at Hyannis Port , Mass. , on the Alliance for Progress this weekend on the second anniversary ( Aug. 17 ) of the signing ' of the Charter of Punta del Este in which all 20 countries of the hemisphere , Cuba excepted , agreed to hasten social and economic reforms . Since the beginning of the aid program , some $2,049,000 , - 000 has been committed , though not all yet spent , in aid of various kinds to Latin America . Progress Listed " The advances made in the first two years are only a start but they are impressive , " said Mr. Kennedy . " Some 140,000 new housing units have been constructed , slum - clearing projects have begun , there are 8,200 new school classrooms , more than 700 new water systems have been built . . ? . Land reform and tax reform measures have been adopted by many countries , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,000,000 schoolbooks have been distributed . " Two common-market agreements are gaining new impetus , a revolutionary step has been taken to stabilize the price of coffee in world markets . More than 9,000,000 children are being fed in 18 countries in a Food-for-Peace program , road construction , especially in some agricultural areas , is proceeding ahead rapidly . " These are the more pleasant items to consider , even though it is recognized here they are a mere drop in the bucket for Latin America 's 200,000,000 population , most of whom have not yet been touched by the alliance . Among . the other somber facts tempering optimism here are the following : ? There is continued resistance of wealthier Latin Americans to social reforms and increasing the average $247 per capita income . ? Even though the Castro image and mystique is believed to be diminishing in Latin America , as his association with the Soviet Union deepens , the Castro-Communist campaign of infiltration , subversion , and violence is being increased . ? It is believed now by officials in Washington that Soviet Premier Nikita S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolster his argument with Communist China . It may have the reverse effect in some Latin American countries . His appearance in Cuba , though , would impress some Latin Americans with his daring , emphasizine how the Soviet Union has snatched Cuba from the United States sphere of influence . It is not likely to make the Kennedy administration happy unless Mr. Khrushchev overdoes it . Criticisms Heard ? Many Latin American officials are complaining about United States requirements for detailed plans of economic and construction programs , not comprehending that approval by the United States Congress hinges on at least the appearance of monies wisely administered and spent . ? There are critics of the alliance in the United States as well . Much of the United States business community believes there is too much emphasis on state rather than private enterprise , though this is countered with the claim that a certain amount of state enterprise is needed to stimulate undeveloped economies , and that private enterprise is being financed with alliance funds . ? Still another criticism is that too much of alliance funds are going into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without apparently setting up jobs which in turn would yield wages which would yield taxes with which to maintain these roads , schools , hospitals , water , and sewage systems .
