Despite North Korea 's obvious attempt to win prestige through belligerence , many in the top echelons of U.S. government felt that the hijacking of the Pueblo had an ominous connection with the war in Viet Nam . As the London Economist observed : " The North Koreans are trying to divert American attention from what could be a decisive battle in Viet Nam . " That battle , shaping up around the U.S. Marine base of Khe Sanh in South Viet Nam 's northwest corner , could be the biggest of the war . The Communists would not only like to distract U.S. attention and resources from that battle but also combine the humiliation of the Pueblo 's seizure with a U.S. defeat , or at least a major bloodletting . Such a one-two punch , they might well hope , would destroy the U.S. will to continue the war . <P> Khe Sanh has been dug out of the red clay of a plateau that is ringed by high hills thick with trees and bamboo . Some 15 miles south of the DMZ and only ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies directly athwart the easiest infiltration routes into South Viet Nam . To eliminate the roadblock , the North Vietnamese have ranged an estimated 20,000 men directly around Khe Sanh , have at least another 20,000 in reserve in Laos and immediately north of the DMZ , all located within 20 miles of the post . Together , they constitute the largest and best-equipped military force that North Viet Nam has ever concentrated on a single battleground . <P> Khe Sanh , moreover , lies within range of Hanoi 's big Russian-made 152-mm. howitzers emplaced in North Viet Nam and Laos . High-speed trails have been cut eastward from Laos into South Viet Nam to supply the Communist besiegers , who are heavily armed with portable howitzers and mortars . To ensure easier access to the new trails , the Communists last week overran the Royal Laotian border outpost of Ban Houei Sane and put its 2,000 defenders to flight . <P> Familiar Aim . To meet the threat to Khe Sanh , General William Westmoreland has built up the base 's garrison to more than 5,000 Marines in a hasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic throughout Viet Nam . Other allied units shifted nearer the scene of the impending battle to be ready if needed , including a 1st Cavalry ( airmobile ) brigade helicoptered to Phu Bai , only 45 minutes ' flying time from Khe Sanh . For what looked more and more like the first classic conventional battle on a major scale of the Viet Nam war , Westmoreland has deployed some 45,000 men to meet the 40,000 North Vietnamese closing in on Khe Sanh.
