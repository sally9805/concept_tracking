ASPEN : HEAVEN It happened in Aspen , Colorado : The cold winter sun had disappeared behind Ajax Mountain when the young man skied down the slope in a breakneck schuss , trailing a streamer of powdery white snow . As he neared the foot of the mountain , he slowed himself with a series of precise turns and then , with a ski pole dangling from one wrist , reached into a pocket for a comb and proceeded to slick hack his hair . He kept on skiing , right into the residential district . The cocktail hour was at hand , and he was late . To say that Aspen is probably the most cosmopolitan small town in America is pure understatement . Where else , residents ask , do you see Grosse Point and Newport society matrons , wearing full-length mink , gold-lame stretch pants and heavy ski boots , doing the Twist in the crowded barroom of a Victorian hotel , while at a table nearby a bearded ski bum from Brooklyn plays chess with a Hollywood star ? Perhaps it is unfair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifier is needed , and the best qualifier is Wintertime Aspen . In the off-seasons  --  April fifteenth through mid-June and September thirtieth until Thanksgiving  --  Aspen is a placid community tucked away inconspicuously at the base of 11300-foot Ajax Mountain , in the upper reaches of Western Colorado 's Roaring Fork Valley . Its 1500 year-round residents take a breather earned in the season just past , and a deep breath of anticipation for the one that lies ahead . Oh , a few fishermen and hunters may drop by en route to Independence Pass , but for the most part these belong to that group distastefully described by inn-keepers as " sleeping-bag types . " In the summertime culture is king . Soul-weary organization men meet in the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies to read and discuss the ideas of Locke , Rousseau and Freud and to hear from such dignitaries as Supreme Court justices Hugo Black and William J. Brennan Jr. , Ambassador Adlai Stevenson and President Lee DuBridge of the California Institute of Technology . Noted musicians  --  Isaac Stern , Darius Milhaud , Mme. Rosina Llievinne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in the summer Music Festival ; many of them stay on till fall to give private lessons to advanced students . But in the winter months a peculiar madness overcomes Aspen . Winter is the time of deep powdery snow in the high country , and deep powdery snow is the life substance of skiers . Days are governed by the schedules of the lifts that transport skiers from down here to up there : nine A.M. to four P.M. All that goes before , or after , is incidental to the dubious business of steering one 's self down a snowy incline while balanced on an expensive pair of well-waxed , parallel boards . To save skiers the bother of coming down for lunch , an expensive restaurant called the Sundeck was built atop Ajax Mountain . Cocktail time is reckoned from the hour when the lifts shut down until midnight . This is not to suggest that the sociable hours end at the stroke of twelve . Aspen 's dozen bars close at two in the morning , but party time often lasts until dawn in the posh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinner ? It 's squeezed in during the cocktail hour  --  sometimes . The town 's sixty lodges and inns owe their success to the legions of skiers ( 45,000 last year ) who visit Aspen 's slopes during the winter . Cross-country buses pull into town with ski-filled canvas pouches strapped to their rear ends . A week is the usual stay , with a number of skiers staying on for two weeks , sometimes three . They bring with them not only their skis , imported boots and bulky sweaters , but also the wherewithal for a rousing good time . Aspen is only too happy to oblige . To understand Aspen , you have to understand its history . It was founded in the summer of 1878 by a band of prospectors who trekked across Independence Pass from Leadville in search of silver and gold . These were not the wild-and-woolly Westerners of legend , as a pioneer 's daughter , Miss Louise Berg , hastens to explain : " They were honest , God-fearing people of education . . . . We never had any lynchings here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years the population of Aspen boomed to 15,000 , a figure never since equaled . Then , in 1893 , when Aspen silver mines were producing about SI0,000,000 a year , came the demonetization of silver , and the bottom dropped out of the silver market . For the next half century Aspen dozed with little more than its memories of the past to sustain it . In 1945 Chicago industrialist Walter Paepcke joined forces with Fried Pfeifer , an ex-ski trooper who had been stationed at nearby Camp Hale , Colorado , in organizing the Aspen Skiing Corporation . They built lifts and cleared the slopes . Paepcke bought up key properties , leased others and began restoration of the town . At the same time he started the development of Aspen as a cultural center . Aspen made its mark with the intellectuals of the world in 1949 , when the International Goethe Convocation was held there to celebrate the bicentennial of the German poet 's birth . The following year the Institute for Humanistic Studies was established . Celebrities began to settle in Aspen among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred Glidden ( Luke Short ) , and designer-painter Herbert Bayer . Even before Paepcke 's death in 1960 , murmurs of discontent were being heard in the little town on the Roaring Fork . Some of the old-timers did n't want Aspen to become a major resort ; quiet little towns were already too scarce , they argued . But they were outvoted by the new-corners , who had problems of their own  --  how , for example , to be commercial without being too commercial and attracting riffraff . Bayer , a member of the Aspen Zoning and Planning Commission , put it like this : " We want the better-type visitor , not the two-day tourist . " As one means of attracting sophisticated types , Bayer 's commission put through stiff new zoning rules , banned neon signs and forbade inns to put up signs larger than ten square feet . Geography helps to keep small spenders away from Aspen . The closest large city is Denver-210 miles northeast , via State Highway 82 and U.S. Highway 6 , and across two major mountain passes-11,992-foot Loveland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop the determined skier of limited means . Such a skier was David Michael , a onetime Fulbright scholar who now is justice of the peace in Aspen ( part time ) and an up-and-corning abstract painter ( full time ) . Before coming to Aspen to live four years ago , Michael , a native Georgian , worked for a map company in Denver . " A bunch of us used to get off work Friday night , drive like mad through the snow to get here and then catch few hours ' sleep in the car before the lifts opened next morning , " he recalls . " We 'd ski all day , carouse all Saturday night , and then ski all day Sunday and drive back to Denver Sunday night . I 'm afraid we really were n't at our best Monday morning when it came time to go to work. - Other youngsters , whose names have n't yet appeared in the Social Register , and who are n't really trying to get in , manage to gravitate to Aspen . They are variously known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bums . They come to Aspen to work for ridiculously low wages as busboys and barmaids ( two dollars a night is par ) , but since night life does not begin until the lifts shut down , they have plenty of free time for skiing . One who might be classified as a student on sabbatical is Charla Winn , twenty-three , a pretty blonde who is somewhere between her sophomore and senior years at the University of California , Berkeley ; she is n't sure just where between her sophomore and senior years . Every time she gets close to graduation , " I panic and change my major or something . " Her current major is philosophy , but she has been out of school almost a year . Charla is a barmaid at the Golden Horn , one of the better-known night spots in Aspen . There , in a dark , smoky basement resembling a prohibition speakeasy , a room resounding with hot jazz and the cacophony of a hundred shouted conversations , she delivers drinks to the customers ' tables , She works until two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early the next day to ski . Why does she ski ? She 's not quite sure of that either , except that she thinks it 's great sport . one that takes every bit of concentration and energy you can give it . " Now Charla is not a ski bum . She likes Aspen for itself and not just for its white slopes ; where else . she asks , can a girl walk home from work at two in the morning with perfect safety ? A true ski bum is a fanatic who places the quality of the snow above all else . Innkeeper Jack Cammack , a onetime ice-cream manufacturer who came to Aspen two years ago because it looked like a good business bet , tells how two busboys once walked out on him right in the middle of breakfast . " They suddenly decided the snow was n't all they thought it should be ; they took off for Sun Valley or someplace . " Cammack , a skier himself in a restrained sort of way , owns the Aspen Inn , a new 5500,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain . When he came to Aspen , a controversy was still raging over the wisdom of an earlier decision not to compete for the Winter Olympics . " It would have put Aspen on the map , sure , " he admits , " but does Aspen need it ? " Like Cammack , many of Aspen 's substantial citizens agree that Aspen does n't need to be on the map . To them , the town is a hideaway with a special kind of charm that would be lost if it ever became too popular . They want to cater to skiers , of course , but only to those skiers who can afford to pamper rich tastes . One of Aspen 's few concessions to the masses is the annual Winterskoal , or Salute to Winter , held in January . It is nothing more or less than a winter carnival , but the word " carnival " does not suit the character assumed by Aspen . During Winterskoal there are organized ski races and the usual unorganized night life . Often celebrities will slip into town to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshal Dillon , " was on hand for the 1962 Winterskoal ; he came on condition that there would be no publicity on his visit , and that was fine with a town that is awed by nobody . For those in the public eye , a sojourn in Aspen provides a tonic of temporary anonymity , a spiritual marshaling yard for the campaigns that lie ahead . In other words  --  they can think out loud without having to look over their shoulders in fear a newspaperman is within earshot ; they can stroll down Main Street without having to run a grinning , glad-handed gauntlet of favor seekers . Many of President Kennedy 's New Frontiersmen seem to find this aspect of Aspen particularly refreshing . The President 's brother , Atty . Gen. Robert Kennedy , spent a relaxed week in Aspen last fall . Other recent visitors : Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara , one of his assistants , Paul H. Nitze , and Federal Aviation Administrator Najeeb E. Halaby . In fairness it must be admitted that William E. Stevenson , the new ambassador to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a resident of Aspen , and executive vice president of the Institute of Humanistic Studies , when his diplomatic appointment came through last December . The only semblance of high society in Aspen is the so-called " Red Mountain set , " a reference to artists and executives who have homes on Red Mountain just north of town . These are not homes in the usual sense ; they are 540,000 to $100,000 dwellings that , in many cases , serve only as mountain retreats for their wealthy owners . Just below the Red Mountain set on the social ladder is " the Jet Set , " a younger crowd . But social rules are n't rigid in Aspen . The people who come to ski and see know they belong , or they would n't be there . A few tradespeople are accepted in Aspen society , and this seems to be one of the charms of the town . Mrs. Tukey Jonas , proprietor of The Centerline , an interior-decorating salon , explains , " Go to a party here , and , just as often as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of in the corner , talking literature with the town barber . That would n't go in the East . Things are more informal here , more fun .. . more Aspen . "
