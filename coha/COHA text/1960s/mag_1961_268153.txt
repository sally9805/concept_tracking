The New York Herald Tribune daubed a swastika on its front page and led a guided tour through the concentration camps of Nazi Germany . The New York Daily News bought a full-page ad in the competitive Trib to deliver " an urgent message about the Eichmann trial to every responsible person in the United States . " The message : read all about the trial in the News . EICHMANN is INNOCENT , proclaimed New York 's radio station WNEW in a full-page teaser ad in the New York Post and the Journal-American . Then , having hooked the reader , the ad continued in small print " . . . until proven guilty " - and announced that WNEW was sending Telford Taylor , chief prosecutor of the war crimes trials in Nrnberg , to watch the proof unfold . <P> More than 500 correspondents from 40 countries flocked to Jerusalem last week for the decade 's most publicized trial . From West Germany came Europe 's largest single platoon : 45 newsmen . Japan and East Germany each sent six , Russia two , Nigeria one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for the occasion : U.S. Novelist Irwin ( The Young Lions ) Shaw , whose " incisive understanding of the Nazi mentality " was under contract to Hearst ; Indian Poet Dom Moraes , representing Encounter , a British magazine ; U.S. Banker Ira Hirschmann for Look . <P> Short of granting interviews with Eichmann , the Israeli government outdid itself to accommodate the visitors . Censorship was lifted on all trial copy . In and around the courtroom building gleamed $350,000 worth of new transmission facilities , including banks of teletypes staffed by Jerusalem housewives hastily recruited and trained . Each guest was equipped with a headset radio on which he could follow the trial in four languages-French , English , German , Hebrew . If a reporter missed anything , he could refer to a daily mimeographed record of the court proceedings-also in four languages , plus a summary in Yiddish . Even the trial 's stern security measures were gracefully applied : one radio newsman who surrendered a broken tape recorder for police inspection got it back repaired . <P> All the Stops . Long before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trial , the Eichmann case was heralded , exploited , rehashed and explored with exhaustive thoroughness . In the U.S. , papers that did not serialize Eichmann 's life or revisit the Third Reich ranged far afield to fill space . Some went hunting for concentration camp survivors ; the Denver Post interviewed 25-year-old Robert Kaye , who served when he was seven as Eichmann 's orderly in a camp near Mannheim . Hearst 's tabloid New York Mirror interviewed a bevy of teenagers in Queens , among them an 18-year-old rock-'n-roll singer who felt that death for Eichmann " might be letting him off too easy . " From " J.C. , " a man who spent 15 years in jail for a murder he did not commit , Gossip Columnist Hy Gardner solicited the " worst punishment " for Eichmann : isolation for life , with nothing to read but the Bible . Gossip Columnist Walter Winchell coined another word : " Eichmonster . " Wrote the San Francisco Chronicle 's TV Columnist Terence O'Flaherty : " I am waiting with a kind of cold horror , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are attending in person . "
