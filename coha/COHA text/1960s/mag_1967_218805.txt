Somebody with an adding machine has come up with the fascinating fact that there now are exactly 102 major-league professional sports teams in the U.S. The boom in pro sports may be great stuff for the ticket printers , pennant makers and hot-dog vendors , but it is pretty baffling to most ordinary people . Just who are the Anaheim Amigos and the Seattle Supersonics ? * And what are the Los Angeles Kings doing on top of the National Hockey League ? <P> In no other sport has expansion caused such confusion as it has in hockey . Last year there were six teams ; this year there are twelve-with new clubs in St. Louis , Pittsburgh , Philadelphia , Minnesota and Oakland , as well as Los Angeles . All of the new teams , regardless of geographical location , are lumped together into a West Division , while all the oldsters , including the Chicago Black Hawks , are regarded as East . Regular-season team schedules go from October through March with 74 games , and what will happen when the Stanley Cup play-offs finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplate . <P> Even Non-Canadians . For starters , the first and third teams in each division will play a best-of-seven series against each other . So will the second and fourth teams . The winners will then play a second best-of-seven series , and the survivors of that-if they can still stand up on their skates by then-will meet in still another best-of-seven series of games for the Cup . By then , it will probably be after Labor Day ; kids will be back in school and some big-league baseball team will be taking orders for World Series tickets . <P> " Nobody seems to know quite what to expect-unless it 's the unexpected , " Montreal Gazette Columnist Dink Carroll wrote last month , when action in the expanded league got under way . Unexpected is certainly the word for what has happened since . The Chicago Black Hawks , who won the N.H.L. race by 17 points last year , have managed only three victories in twelve games this year , rank dead last in the East Division . Next , there is the curious collapse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Wings goalie , who only three seasons ago was the N.H.L. 's Rookie of the Year ; last week , after giving up 18 goals in three games , Crozier quit the sport . <P> Then there is the performance of the new teams . Stocked with castoffs , minor leaguers and even non-Canadians ( five Americans , two Britons , one Pole ) , they were hardly expected to furnish much competition for the old , established clubs ; experts estimated that it would take at least five years for the West Division to reach parity with the East . Over the past two weeks , West teams have played twelve games against the East-winning four and tying two . Last week , with an unsung goalie named Wayne Rutledge stopping 37 shots short of the net , the surprising Los Angeles Kings upset the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-1 , and thereby tied the Maple Leafs with 17 points for first place in the overall N.H.L. standings . <P> <P> New pro basketball teams , the Amigos in the American Basketball Association ( which is also new ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
