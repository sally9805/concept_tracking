Italy 's President Giovanni Gronchi , 72 , was all aglow with anticipation . In flying off to Moscow , Christian Democrat Gronchi had overridden the protests of his ministers , had so vexed the Vatican that Italy 's Alfredo Cardinal Ottaviani had publicly denounced " men of high responsibility in the West " for their readiness " to shake the hand that slapped Christ in the face . " But to restless Giovanni Gronchi , who believes in " an opening to the left , " the Moscow trip seemed a prime chance to prove his mediating talents and to make Italy something more than just a junior partner in the Western alliance . <P> At Moscow Airport things got off to a bumpy start . Turning to Italian Foreign Minister Giuseppe Pella , whom the Russians regard as " hopelessly " pro-Western , Nikita Khrushchev began to twit him on the Alitalia DC-6B in which the Gronchi party had arrived . Said Khrushchev : " Since you buy your airplanes abroad , you should know that ours go much faster . Why do n't you buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aback , Pella began to argue that Russian jets actually cost more than the U.S.-made DC-6B ( an obsolescent type on U.S. airlines ) . Khrushchev dismissed the point with a proverb : " When fish is cheap , it 's always rotten . " <P> The Timekeepers . The real trouble began when Gronchi and Pella , in fashionable Italian style , arrived 15 minutes late for a business session with Khrushchev and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko , found the Russians scowling heavily at their watches . When Gronchi suggested that the summit meeting should take up reunification of Germany through free elections , Khrushchev broke in to growl that his utmost concession on Germany would be to guarantee Berlin as a " free city " once the West withdrew its troops . Things were not helped even when Gronchi presented Khrushchev with a 16th century bust of Marcus Aurelius . <P> That evening , at a big Italian embassy reception , Khrushchev made it clear that he had abandoned all hope of capitalizing on Gronchi 's vague visions of a more " flexible " Italian foreign policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Russia would not relax its hold over Communist East Germany ( " The situation created by World War II can not be changed without a war " ) ; he was not interested in West German views ( " We can not accept conditions from men who were beaten at Stalingrad " ) , then launched into a series of unfavorable comparisons between Italy and Russia . <P> " Our soldiers have been in Italy as allies . " he said . " Yours tried to come to our country as enemies. * That we can never forget . " Cooling down , Khrushchev talked of how in 42 years Russia has become " the first country in the world of culture . We have no poor , no unemployed . In capitalism , the smartest man is the one with the most dollars . Here he is the one with the most talents . Think it over , Mr. President , and join the Communist Party . " <P> Money &; the Moon . Icily , Gronchi retorted : " I would like to present Premier Khrushchev with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace , he will enter the Christian Democratic Party . " Khrushchev ( angrily ) : Which party gives most to the people ? Our flag has reached the moon . And you ? What have you done ?
