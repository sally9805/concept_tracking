In The Netherlands , which takes its welfare-state benefits seriously , a conscientious civil servant in the village of Diepenveen ( pop . 4,018 ) decided to go out and inform a local farm hand named Hendrik Bally in person that the government , now that he had turned 65 , would henceforth pay him a pension of 81 guilders ( $21.31 ) a month . <P> The civil servant found a man dressed in unspeakable rags , and so thin that his ribs seemed about to burst out of his skin . His boss , Farmer Abraham Kolkman , 72 , curtly explained that Bally was nearly deaf and blind , volunteered to sign the pension papers himself . Then suddenly Bally spoke up to contradict his master for the first time in 50 long years . " I can sign my name , " he said . " It 's my money . " And that very night he ran away . <P> <P> Last week , dressed in the first pair of pajamas he had ever had and wearing a new hearing aid and spectacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bally told reporters his eerie story . Back in 1910 , Bally , a 15-year-old orphan , was shipped off to Farmer Kolkman 's place to work for a bed in the attic and 2.50 guilders ( 65 ) a week . In those days the guilder went far , and young Bally never complained . By the time the first World War broke out , he was too deaf to be called up , and since his eyesight had also begun to fail , he soon stopped keeping track of the war news . He learned about World War II only because Farmer Kolkman docked him an extra 50 Dutch cents for the higher price of tobacco - and he learned about peace when the surcharge ended . <P> Still at his 1910 wage of 65 a week , Bally never got a day off , nor was he ever allowed to go into town six miles away . <P> When the master 's retarded son got married and then had a baby , the family decided to cut down on Bally 's rations to even out the family budget . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbage . Still , Bally had one great pleasure-his Bible , which he could read whenever Madame Kolkman , as a mark of special favor , allowed him to use her glasses . <P> On the night he ran away , Farmer Kolkman had decided to punish Bally for his impertinence in front of the government man by withholding Madame Kolkman 's glasses indefinitely . After 50 years , this was too much for Bally to bear . <P> When the newspapers spread Bally 's story , Farmer Kolkman could not understand the fuss . " Hendrik never asked for a raise , " he said . " He had his Sunday suit , and every morning we gave him an egg . He did n't want any more . " As for Bally himself , now that he had glasses of his own , he had taken a look at newspapers again , and could not find much of interest in them . " It 's like the old days , " he said . " They still quarrel . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
