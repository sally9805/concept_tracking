The old three-story house stands on the corner of Spring and Mott streets in Manhattan 's fading Little Italy . Inside , the furnishings are spare-some benches and tables , a cupboard . But if the house lacks furniture , it does have marvels of decor . There is a room lined with towering cases of gilded bric-a-brac . In another room , shallow honeycombs of orange-crate cabinetry are filled with carefully posed objects-chair legs , a broken wheel , a bowling pin . parts of a table pedestal , a banister , some toilet seats-all gleaming goldly . The owner of this hammer-and-nails Fort Knox is Scavenger-Sculptress Louise Nevelson , 61 . <P> Nevelson sculptures ( they might more accurately be called assemblages ) are displayed in museums all over the world , fetch from $500 ( for a small box of surprises ) to $25,000 for a whole flabbergasting wall . This week Buffalo 's Albright-Knox Art Gallery acquired Nevelson 's Royal Game from Manhattan 's Martha Jackson Gallery . Price for the 5-ft. by 4-ft. work , which is the gift of Museum President Seymour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3,000 grand prize in the first Sculpture International of the Torcuato Di Telia Institute 's Center of Visual Arts in Buenos Aires , where she exhibited five pieces . In June , she was one of four artists chosen to represent the U.S. at the 31st Biennale in Venice . Louise Nevelson 's three rooms of " wall furniture " - one in gold , one in white , and one in the traditional Nevelson black-were the first things to greet visitors at the U.S. pavilion , and one of the few real sensations of the entire Biennale . <P> Pizzeria Studio . Nevelson " walls " ' might go nicely in certain modern commercial structures , but so far she has refused requests to do office-building lobbies . " Someone once told me , ' Think how many people would see your work in an office building : 100,000 a day . ' And I said , look , dear , I am not interested , because those 100,000 people are blind . " <P> But she is pondering a commission to embellish a wall for the New York State Theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There people will look . " <P> Louise Nevelson is an imposing , muscular woman with eyes like augers . Besides the three rooms of golden debris in her house , she maintains two more studios near by-one in a former pizzeria , where she does her " dirty work , my black things , " and one a few doors away for her white work . Her material is wood , shaped for utilitarian purposes-and salvaged by her from dumps and antique shops , or donated by friendly driftwood gatherers . For tools she uses an electric band saw , files , and a hammer . <P> Sculptress Nevelson made her first real splash four years ago with sinister black-massed woodworks , given such titles as Moon Dial and Cathedral in the Sky . She denies that she is presently in a gold period , although most of her work , after being lacquered with several coats to seal the wood , is lavishly spray-bombed with a metallic product called Spray-O-Namel.                    @
