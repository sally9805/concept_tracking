There are soldiers who are armed but not loved <P> Mostly lost with their weapons in their hands <P> In the barracks they learn the old lesson <P> Of dying for the country and living for nothing . <P> There is hunger on the great plantations <P> And desperation marching through the streets <P> But still they take the flower as their strongest refrain <P> And believe that flowers can overcome the cannon . <P> When he wrote those words and set them to music last month , Brazilian Composer Geraldo Vandr had more than a song in his heart . He comes from the nation 's impoverished Northeast , and he gave voice in Caminhando ( Walking ) to the growing impatience of millions of Brazilians with the way the military is running-or not running-the country . Overnight Caminhando became a hit . Taunting the regime , Brazilians sang it in the streets , hummed it in the favelas , and pushed it for an international prize . <P> The military hated the words . " A subversive lyric , " said General Luis de Franca Oliveira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical cadence of the Mao Tse-tung type that can easily serve as the anthem for student street demonstrations . " In a fit of anger , police in Rio 's main street arrested one group of youths merely for listening to Caminhando outside a record shop . <P> Without Miracles . That ridiculous act reflects the tension that grips Brazil these days . A vast majority of Brazilians applauded the overthrow of Leftist Joao Goulart in 1964 , and the cleanup started by the new military-backed regime of General Humberto Castello Branco was obviously necessary . When War Minister Arthur Costa e Silva was elected President by Congress in 1966 , Brazilians listened to his promise to " humanize " the bureaucracy , promote a " Year of Education " and declare war on inflation . He did manage to slash the annual rate of inflation from 40% to 25% . The nation 's gross national product edged up by 5% . Brazil 's trade in coffee , cotton and other agricultural products came into balance . <P> But Costa e Silva held down the cost of living at great cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracles , " the President says . " I prefer a sure and measured success . " Maybe some miracles are needed . Brazil should be taking off economically ; it is barely holding its own . Education is a shambles : half of the population remains illiterate , and there is no room at the university for two of every three students who pass the entrance exam . Workers who earn only $40 a month must spend a fourth of that on bus fares to get to their jobs . <P> Continuing censorship , the military 's failure to fulfill its promise of popular elections , the denial of political rights to hundreds of politicians and intellectuals have turned the public sour and left the country edgy . Here is a report on the situation from TIME Correspondent William Forbis :
