The TV scene is unmistakably the old Ponderosa . As the Cartwright family digs in to defend the ranch against a band of rustlers , there is a clatter of hoofs . Suddenly one of the boys shouts : " Nie strzelaj , Hoss ! To szeryf ! " That 's dubbed-in Polish for " Do n't shoot , Hoss ! It 's the sheriff ! " <P> It 's also Bonanza , Polish-style . Like most other East European TV establishments , Poland is cutting away from Soviet television imports and is filling its tube with U.S. shows . Dr. Kildare is so popular in Poland that Communist Party meetings are no longer held on Wednesday nights . Perry Mason argues his cases in eloquent Serbo-Croatian in Yugoslavia . Rawhide rides hard in Rumania , and Alfred Hitchcock is a chilling success in Bulgaria . <P> Blurbs &; Swipes . Apart from U.S. shows , however , the Iron Curtain countries still come on strong with dialectic . Television 's purpose , sums up the Hungarian theoretical journal Tarsadalmi Szemle , is " agitation and propaganda in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a typical recent night 's fare in Budapest kicked off with a blurb on the activities of red-scarfed youth groups . Then followed a 15-minute commentary on Southeast Asia by an official of the party newspaper , and an unillustrated and soporific 45-minute autobiography by a 70-year-old Communist militant . <P> The rest of the evening included a static sports roundup ( a ten-minute speech by an athletic functionary , scenes of a factory woman doing calisthenics ) , a performance of Chekhov 's Platonov 's Loves , Thirty Minutes with the Hungarian Railway Philharmonic , and a half-hour newscast , with headlines read by a tight-lipped blonde . As with the rest of East European television , Hungary 's news presentation carries virtually no film footage , nor even voice reports from foreign correspondents . The lead item usually updates what the satellite networks call America 's " dirty aggressive war against the brave , peace-loving Vietnamese . " And often there will be a swipe at " the revanchist Kiesinger-Strauss government in Bonn . " <P> The degree of party chauvinism ranges from country to country . East Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the thickest propaganda . Every week , for example , it puts on a Meet the Press-type show starring the same man-Old Propaganda Czar Gerhard Eisler , now 70 . Otherwise , East Germans get their TV entertainment from Fussball ( soccer ) coverage , old movies , and-for viewers within range of West German channels-a few U.S. series . <P> Peaches &; Sympathy . The lowest-keyed and slickest propagandists are the Czechs , who employ their innovative cinematic techniques for programs on the virtues of working in the peach-canning or fertilizer industries . The Czechs also have the liveliest commercials . One holiday-season spot shows the last-minute buying rush , and cuts to a popular actor looking dispiritedly into his empty wallet . Then a bleached , beehived blonde sympathizes : " Do n't worry about money : buy a camera on the installment plan from Foto-Kino. "
