txt The Swedish film " I Am Curious Yellow " was banned altogether in Norway and , for a while , Belgium . It was censored in France and Germany and will be cut for showing in England . Only in Denmark , Sweden  --  and the U.S. , beginning today ? is it being shown uncut . The 120 minutes of screening time depict the hero and heroine in abundant nudity , various scenes of intercourse ( including one in the crook of a tree ) and more exotic sexual play . It has a dream sequence in which the heroine castrates her lover . There also is a good bit of ponderous political debate . The U.S. Customs Office sought to prevent the film 's entry into this country , and a jury found it obscene in a New York Federal Court . A Court of Appeals reluctantly concluded that it could n't be banned , however , relying . on guidelines of Supreme Court decisions . The Appeals Court voted two to one to release the film uncut , saying , " The sexual content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seen in any other film produced for general viewing . " Judge Henry J. Friendly was explicit too in saying that he was reluctantly concurring " with no little distaste . " For and Against Some viewers may be pleased , others perplexed or angered , but the showing of " I Am Curious ? Yellow " seems to qualify as a significant event . Those who tilt against all forms of censorship see it as marking the emergence of the U.S. as a leader in free speech and expression . To quite another group , the film is the final confirmation of a disaster they have long seen brewing . The growing permissiveness of American society , they maintain , has finally reached total depravity . For or against , it is difficult to argue with one observation : Tile barriers are coming down . In the off-Broadway play entitled " Dionysus in ' 69 , " five nude men and four naked girls celebrate a Greek rite by slithering over one another and romping through the audience . Last week a New York City producer announced plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamy - novel " Portnoy 's Complaint " has climbed rapidly to the top of best-seller lists ( the author says the book is a deliberate effort to elevate obscenity " to the level of a subject " for serious art ) . And as the barriers fall , the debate over what the relaxation means , how far it should go and why it is happening is intensifying . Father John Culkin , an ardent student of Marshall and director of the Center for Communications at New York 's respected Fordham University , sees the anticensorship explosion as rooted in American Puritanism , Shakedown Cruise " We 're reaping a reaction to the very repressive atmosphere we 've maintained in our families , churches and schools , " Father Culkin says . " Calvin and those creeps left us very uptight . We were n't allowed to have bodies . And what we 're going through now is a shakedown cruise exploring a new morality . " The cause of such rapid change , says , Father Culkin , echoing Mr. , is the growth of the electronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a century for styles and mores to change significantly , because information spread so slowly . Now the latest vogue from the miniskirt to accounts of the off-beat lives of the " swingers " is flashed across the nation by television . But if the media seem to reflect a new sexuality , Americans actually are n't changing their mores radically , according to Paul Gebhard , director of the Institute for Sex Research ( formerly the Kinsey Institute ) . However , Mr. Gebhard says his interviewers have found a striking readiness to tolerate discussion and airing of the so-called revolution . " Where there has been a revolution is In censorship , " he says . " The trend toward liberalization of what 's allowed in the media has been going on since World War I. " Mr. Gebhard points out that court decisions have accelerated the trend in the past decade . The underground marker ' in erotic books has nearly disappeared , he ' says . The legagtransformation of dirty books into " literaturia was lamented ironically in an article by Jerome H. Doolittle in Esquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from France appear in book stores volume by volume . " Fanny Hill " and the Henry Miller and William Burroughs books went fairly early . Vanishing Treasures " My only remaining comfort was the thought that I was still the only kid on the block to own such hard-core items as ' The Roman Orgy , ' ' The Pleasure Thieves ' and ' Houses of Joy , ' " Mr. Doolittle wrote . But then came " The Olympia Reader , " a massive collection of stories that contained his own favorites and many other erotic tales . Mr. Doolittle was encountering what one student of censorship and the courts calls " the grapes of Roth . " The Supreme Court in 1957 upheld the obscenity conviction of Samuel Roth , a New York book dealer . In doing so , the court laid down what have come to be the boundaries within which publishers and film makers can operate . ' The Roth case , and later decisions that made slight clarifications , established that obscenity could be proved only if " . . . to the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest " and the work is found to be " utterly without redeeming social importance . " The Appeals judges cleared " I Am Curious ? Yellow " because it included serious social and political themes . The vagueness of just what constitutes " redeeming social impo ? tance " has produced many successful legal defenses of books and films which somewhere concern themselves with matters other than sex . " As long as children are excluded from access , we can . win with almost anything now , " says Richard Painn , the New York attorney who , negotiated " I Am Curious  --  Yellow " past the - Customs Office . Ephraim London , an attorney , who lass won six such cases in appeals to the Supreme ' Court , says only a movie " with out-and-out. intercourse and no pretense of having any social value " is in peril before the courts now . ? Barney Rosset , president of Grove Press , which is distributing " I Am Curious  --  Yellow " in the U.S. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , if it were n't for sex , We 'd depopulate the entire human race , " he says . Mr. Rosset , in fact , argues , " There 's no such thing as pornography . Things can be erotic , and they can be good or bad ( in quality ) , but Ijust do n't believe in censorship . " The argument over what is pornographic , or " prurient , " has been raging for decades . For D. H .. Lawrence , author of " Lady Chatterley 's LoVer , " pornography was not vivid sexual descriptiOn but " the attempt to insult sex , to do dirt on it . " . That , he said , was " unpardonable " and cause for censorship . Mr. Rosset finds prurient interest in the TV commercial where a Scandinavian girl , pitching for No ; ema , purrs , " Take it off , take it all off . " Declares Mr. Rosset , " She 's saying , ' Hurry up and shave with this stuff so we can go to bed . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad all the time . " He groups such appeals " With the dirty postcards and traveling salesmen 's jokes that D. H. Lawrence found offensive . HOwever , Mr. Rosset would n't censor the commercial  --  or anything else . Convincing Point Lawyer London recalls his first censorship cane . A state prosecutor wanted to proscribe the film " The Bicycle Thief " because it depicted a little boy urinating . " I made it very clear that the whole state would be thrown into scandal if they insisted that the sight of this lad urinating aroused their prurient interests , " he says . " That was all it took . " " NO girl was ever ruined by a book , " said Jimmy Walker , the free-wheeling mayor of New York City during the Roaring Twenties . But the advocates of censorship do n't agree . Father Morton Hill , a New York priest who went on a hunger strike several years ago in connection with his campaign to clean up magazine stands , says erotic literature " incites to violence , drug usage , promiscuity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the organization called Morality in Media ( which is still fighting the showing of " I Am Curious ? Yellow " ) , says the new era of permissiveness is breaking every barrier of decency . " It 's eating away at the moral fiber of America , ' Rabbi Neumann says . ? Actually , there has been little research into the effects of erotic material on its consumers . The Institute for-Sex Research challenges the assumption that the circulation of pornography inevitably leads to an increase in sex crimes . On the contrary , interviewers found that persons classified as potential sex offenders are less responsive to erotica - than a normal " control " ' - group . The prospective rapists , voyeurists and exhibitionists did n't have the - patience to plod through make-believe sexual experiences . In a 1953 study on comparative sexual , behavior in men and women , Kinsey researchers found that men were more stimulated than women by " hard-core " pornography . But women were at least as responaiye as men to the more artistic type of sexual material now current in films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by " raw " pictures of sexual acts , compared with 77% of the men . But 48% of the women , responded to erotic scenes in films , , compared with 36% of the men , and 60% of the females found erotic passages in novels stimulating , against 59% of the men . Mr. Gebhard , the director of the Institute for Sex Research , speculates that current liberalizing trends might be making both men and women more equal now in response to erotica . And he says that the " bombardment with sexual stimulus " that now is commonplace may be conditioning consumers to take erotica for granted . " I think a young man now is no more aroused by a pretty girl in a miniskirt than my grandfather was by the sight of a well-turned ankle , " he says . Dr. William Masters , co-author of " Human Sexual Response , " says he has n't found any great influence in pornography on people 's lives . Ned Polsky , a sociologist at the Stony Brook campus of - the State University of New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive role as a " safety valve , " allowing the indulgence of antisocial sex desires without damage to the family structure . The Youth Wave Several theoreticians find a relationship between falling censorship barriers and the widening " generation gap . " John Gagnon , also a Stony Brook sociologist , says that some young people use sex as an instrument of rebellion against a wide variety - of social institutions . He finds particularly relevant a scene in " I Am Curious  --  Yellow " in which the young couple make love on a balustrade in front of the royal palace in Stockholm . Fordham 's Father Culkin says young people are exposed to all the problems of the world through their exposure to increasingly candid films , television shows and publications . Thus , he says , they find that such sins as unmarried sex , stealing and lying " just do n't account for all our problems  --  they say , ' Well , what about war ? ' And then they write their own moral codes . " To be sure , not all bans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie " The Killing of Sister George . " A similar raid was made on a New York City theater showing " Muthers . " A district attorney charged that this film depicted " masturbation , lesbianism , incest , sodomy and perversion . " Some observers suspect that Puritanism may reassert itself . Margaret Mead , the anthropologist , insists that Puritanism never really vanished . " All this business about clothes on and clothes off is really the same thing , " she says . " It 's only the older folks , the Puritans , who get excited about this sort of thing and get kicks out of it . "
