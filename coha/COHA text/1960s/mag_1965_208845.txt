THE MAKEPEACE EXPERIMENT by Abram Tertz. 191 pages . Pantheon. $3.95 . <P> Abram Tertz ( The Trial Begins ; Fantastic Stories ) is a famous Russian novelist who has never been published in Russia . To stay alive he is compelled to conceal his identity from all but a few intimates , smuggle his manuscripts out of the country for publication abroad . Readers of this witty , surrealistic satire on dictators in general and the Soviet system in particular will readily see the reason for his caution . <P> Comrade Leonard Makepeace is a provincial bicycle mechanic with a passion for the Marxian notion that man ( and society ) is perfectible on earth . This passion he dissipates happily in tavern talk until he meets a delectable but distant schoolmistress from Lenin grad . Rejected in love , he goes after power and one day discovers in a volume of Indian theosophy the technique of " mental magnetism . " He realizes he can make anybody do anything . <P> Replacement for God . Society can best be perfected , Lenny decides , by making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the party leaders of the town pick him as their leader . To ensure his popular support , he makes the townspeople believe that red peppers are steak , that the local river is flowing with champagne . Heady with power , he declares his town an independent state and begins to build monuments to his own magnificence . The labor is supplied by the townspeople , who go singing to work under his hypnotic command and really want nothing more . When government forces are dispatched to oust him , he magnetically muddles their minds and they get lost in a nearby wood . <P> In his omnipotence , Lenny concludes that he has replaced God . What this amounts to is the withering away of the state . Lenny dismisses the police . If a man is tempted to rape , a boy to an act of vandalism , Lenny scotches the impulse by a mere moment 's concentration . Soon there is nothing left but Lenny-who thinks he is perfect . Actually , he 's real sick , and his sickness erupts in the society he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street ; men brawl . At the last , an invasion of radio-guided Soviet government tanks , impervious to Lenny 's mental magnetism , restores order-Soviet order . Exclaims the narrator : " Things could n't be worse ! " <P> Prayer for Redemption . Author Tertz 's aim is " to be truthful with the aid of the absurd and the fantastic . " In his Orwellian fairy tale , Tertz twits Stalin and the cult of personality , Khrushchev and the cult of propaganda , the military mind , the herd instinct , and all the dizzy isms of contemporary Soviet life . He is intensely critical of human arrogance and folly , yet somehow views it all with detachment , as if from another point . <P> In the last chapter , it becomes clear what that point is . In the character of an old priest who prays for the redemption of all the Russians , Author Tertz says : " He was only a village priest , but one thing he knew : that even if his church were the last on earth , he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continue to work for the salvation of impious men-continue to work like an ox , like a laborer , like a king-like the Lord God Himself .
