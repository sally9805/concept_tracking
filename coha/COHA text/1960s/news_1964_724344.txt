txt Washington , Nov. 9 ( P ) - The United States Supreme court today put into effect a Supreme Court justice 's statement of 14 years ago that juries must be selected without regard to color ? Negroes must not be intentionally included or excluded . The tribunal did so in refus- 1 ing to hear an appeal from a lower federal court ruling that Louisiana violated the rights of Woodman J. Collins , a Negro . The grand jury that indicted Collins on a charge of raping a white woman was selected from a panel of 20 with six Negroes purposely included . Louisiana Denied Appeal The tribunal , which has often made clear its belief that must not be systematic- ' ally excluded from juries , made no comment in refusing unanimously to bear Louisiana 's appeal from a ruling that Negroes must not be purposely included . The United States Circuit court in New Orleans had relied in large part on a comment in a 1950 decision by Justice Stanley F. Reed , now retired . In that decision barring exclusion of Negroes from juries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have charges against him considered by a jury in the selection of which there has been neither inclusion nor exclusion because of race . " New Trial Possible After the grand jury indicted him , Collins was convicted and sentenced to execution . Today 's decision leaves the way open for Louisiana to impanel another grand jury and retry Collins , who remains in the state penitentiary . Louisiana 's Atty . Gen. Jack Gremillion asked the high court : Row could a constitutional jury be formed if members of various races are not intentionally included in the list from which jurors are to be drawn by lot ? The state 's Supreme court had agreed with this view . The United States Circuit court , in disagreeing , said the conscious taking into account of race or color as the basis for jury selection would have " an opposite and somewhat paradoxical effect " of denying a defendant equal protection . It said Negroes on the jury might be too conscious of this aspect to vote for acquittal of a member of their race .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
