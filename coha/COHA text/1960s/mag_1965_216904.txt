What he wanted out of life , said Novelist John O'Hara when he started writing a column for Long Island 's Newsday and its syndicate last year , was to be as " indispensable to historians of the future as Dickens was to the historians of the 19th century . " Newsday , which paid O'Hara $1,000 a column , found him to be something less than a Dickens and quite dispensable . Largely because 27 newspapers have dropped his column , Newsday dropped him-after exactly one year . " I regard him as an outrage as a columnist , " says Larry Fanning , executive editor of the Chicago Daily News , undoubtedly speaking for many of those who dumped O'Hara . " He turned his column into a personal pulpit , which bored me and bored our readers . " <P> Drub-a-drub-drub . As a preacher , O'Hara ran heavily to bile . He played on a vast range of peeves-from the present times ( " The Age of the Jerk " ) to a movie producer who had hard words for one of his scripts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . O'Hara has no use for President Johnson ( " An uninspiring , uninspired man , whom no one loathes and no one loves " ) , or Bobby Kennedy ( " There is something pathetic about a man who turns on the charm when he has none " ) , or the general run of newspapermen ( " Only the game of politics contains more men who are afflicted with venality , envy and gutlessness " ) . In the course of a year 's column writing , he also managed to drub Hubert Humphrey , Elizabeth Taylor , John F. Kennedy , Dean Rusk , Pearl Bailey , James Baldwin , Bishop James Pike , balletomanes , Abraham Lincoln , Sukarno and Frank Sinatra , to name a few . <P> He had kind words for Henry Cabot Lodge , Charles de Gaulle , and Goldwater supporters . " I think it 's time that the Lawrence Welk people had their say , " wrote O'Hara . " The Lester Lanin and Dizzy Gillespie people have been on too long . When the country is in trouble , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence Welk people who can be depended upon , all the way . " <P> Fired all the Same . O'Hara had some special ink for the men who canceled him . " When syndication is involved , " he wrote in his final column , " a bush-league editor likes to king it on his remote little throne . His paper may be paying something like $15 a week for a column , but the editor can play big shot by ' firing ' a writer he has never met , is not likely to meet , and never should meet . The editor has convinced himself that he , like my movie producer , can bang out as good a column if he had the time . " For all that , O'Hara ruefully admitted : " For the tenth time , I am an unemployed newspaperman. "
