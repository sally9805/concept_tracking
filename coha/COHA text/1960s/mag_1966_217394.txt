There are apartment houses that ban pets , others that ban children , but the newest trend in Southern California is the apartment house that bans-of all groups-married couples . " The singles , the swingers , the young professional people are everywhere , " explains Developer Howard Ruby , whose South Bay Club Apartments in the Torrance section of Los Angeles has been such a success that he is now putting up two more apartment houses with pads for singles only . " Generally , the apartment business developers were n't building for them and the landlords distrusted them , sure they would damage the place or skip the rent . " <P> There 's little risk of rent-skipping at South Bay , a $3,000,000 , 248-unit complex housing 500 single stewardesses , doctors , teachers , engineers , secretaries and salesmen . Not only must applicants fight their way up through South Bay 's long waiting list but , once in , they simply do not want to leave-even though they must pay rents from $125 for an efficiency to $260 for a two-bedroom pad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparable apartment houses , which are suffering an average vacancy rate of 15% , but South Bay is full up and turning away about 25 new applicants a week . <P> Almost from the day it opened , South Bay has gloried in its swinger reputation , and none of those who have moved in have any intention of letting the club down-least of all to outsiders . " It 's exciting for a girl with all those men around , " coos Social Worker Mary Lee Coe . " There 's some student atmosphere - only much sexier than any college 's . " A secretary adds saucily : " This is a good place to be bad . " New male arrivals have been known to hide the fact that they go to church , until they find they can safely be both unconventional and accepted . <P> What keeps the singles at South Bay hopping is a rigorous round of athletic and social activities . Besides a weekly dance , cocktail party and dinner , there are three tennis courts , two swimming pools , an outdoor communal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a party room , and almost nightly discussion groups earnestly debating Viet Nam , drug addiction and civil rights . <P> " Here , intimacy , in the humanist sense , develops , " says Teacher Ron Wood . And inevitably , with intimacy comes romance , and sometimes marriage . Newlyweds can stay on in the singles ' paradise until they find an apartment of their own somewhere in the outside world . Then they pack up and leave , abandoning their pads to the eager singles at the top of the waiting list .
