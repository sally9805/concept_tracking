In 1946 , Justice Felix Frankfurter warned his Supreme Court colleagues against meddling with the apportion ment of political voting districts . <P> " Courts , " he said , " ought not to enter this political thicket . " Frankfurter 's ad vice was heeded until last year , when the court set forth its historic one-man , one-vote rule for congressional and state legislative elections . Those decisions landed all courts in the thicket - and so thick was the grove that it seemed to many that the Supreme Court was not even trying to pick its way out . Last week the court hardly clarified matters . In four terse de cisions , it : <P> Upheld a lower federal court order requiring New York to hold a special legislative election on Nov. 2 . The elec tion will be held under " Plan A , " the first of four reapportionment plans passed last December by a lame-duck Republican legislature . The State Su preme court voided all four , noting specifically that Plan A violated a state constitutional provision against a lower house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overturned that ruling on the grounds that some reapportionment action must be taken . <P> It ordered the special election under Plan A , with the provision that the new legislature draft another apportion ment plan acceptable under the state constitution . Plan A has been violently denounced by Democrats as favorable to Republicans , who lost control of the legislature last year for the first time in 30 years . <P> Required California to reapportion its state senate along population lines by July 1 . Otherwise , the job will be done by a three-judge federal panel . <P> The Supreme Court ruling , which re jected an appeal by Democratic Gov governor Pat Brown , had the effect of reversing five statewide referendums since 1926 . <P> Decided , at least for the time being , a dispute between a federal court and the Illinois Supreme Court . Last Jan uary , the federal court reapportioned state senate districts ; if its orders were not followed , it said , all state senators would have to run at large in 1966 ( as did all representatives in 1964 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while agreeing that the present appor tionment was unconstitutional , asserted its own jurisdiction , gave the senate until this July 1 to realign itself . The federal court refused to yield jurisdiction . But the Supreme Court ordered the federal court to step aside and give the Illinois bench " a reasonable time " to achieve reapportionment. - Declined to rule on the constitutionality of an Idaho reapportionment plan , adopted by the legislature last March , and passed the question back to a three-judge federal court .
