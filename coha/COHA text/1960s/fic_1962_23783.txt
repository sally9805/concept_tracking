THE HOSTAGE A Story by MAY DIKEMAN W E WANTED to slink in the back door , " was how we explained choosing Staten Island when we came back to New York after a year of exile in Georgia , where my husband had tried his uncle 's textbook and religious press . Basically , I think we made our decisions , like many very young couples , in negative tropism to all those who said , forgivingly , " Well , they 're young . " But our feeling for New Zuider Beach itself was positive . That is , it reminded us of Europe , where we had never been ; and the first time we drove round the reduplicated letter S of its streets  --  really one serpentine road , but each curve named , Anemone Street running east , Coral Cove west , Nautilus east  --  we were on vacation , and it was early morning . As usual , we had a sound rationale : winterized beach houses , added-onto , like mosquelike Russian churches , were available and cheap , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad yet ; the few we did see , over the barricade of fences and mutual scrutiny , we noted as exhibits , by species ( children : towheads ; elderly : eccentric ) , and they would n't come into our lives any more than thezinnias and the dry-docked rowboats in the yards . Even after we moved there , Anemone Street was an enchanted place in the early morning , and again in the evening , when there was no sound but birds , and shade purified the colors of the asbestos siding , turquoise and salmon , and the Italian gardens of soldier-height dahlias in drill formation . Since it was only like this that my husband ever saw it , I could not explain to him ? nor since she also went to work , even to my neighbor , Mrs. Shroeder , a huge , sunlike woman shining on the just and the unjust  --  what happened during the day , when the people came out . Strangely enough , Mrs. Mercer herself , the catalyst of all the malign elements , was the one neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly see at all , and when it was too late in any case . I would only see the chartreuse and tomato-red stripes of her deck chair in her garden ; or catch a back view of her , shielding her head with her Staten Island Advance ( as if recumbency and shade were her requisites for survival ) and always , to judge from accounts and events , plotting against me . Of Mr. Chesney , across the street , who took care of the children while his wife went to work , and of Johnny the butcher , I saw all too much , and the blatancy of their intentions I found not merely annoying , since at twenty-lour my vanity was so boundless 61 as to be spiritual , but deeply saddening . Mr. Chesney 's sons , Gary and Steve , the only available playmates for my three-year-old Victoria , and Mrs. Mercer 's balefully handsome adolescent grandson Arthur , gave me nameless apprehensions . My husband and Mrs. Shroeder tried to interpret . " A place like this accretes a lot of people who just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , who had the technique of insuring his privacy by seeking locations among those with whom rapport was safely out of the question . Mrs. Shroeder , over her garden hedge , herself a marvel of landscaping  --  for with all her size she was always waved , ironed , manicured , a mountain of flawless detail  --  was , in a rich Hoboken voice , more voluble . " Old man Chesney and Johnny need to be put in their place , " she said . " To me , I 'm fat , fair , and forty , I 've outgrown your troubles . But when my girl Gail is home on vacation , Johnny in particular has that look in his eye that means business , which I do not like . Gail is n't safe buying a cube steak ! But what ails Mrs. Mercer , now , is not so simple . Mrs. Mercer I have known a long time . I ca n't say she is my bosom friend , we are n't friends like you and I are friends , I just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , suddenly I was without chick nor child . The old man and I went our separate ways . Then Gail goes to college . So I commenced trying to be neighborly to Mrs. Mercer . I would take her a batch of my cheese straws , or I would stretch her curtains . " " But what does Mrs. Mercer have against me ? " I asked Mrs. Shroeder . " Is she jealous ? " " She ran he peculiar , " admitted Mrs. Shroeder . " You know , she 's a great sufferer . She 's got angina and arthritis , and it seems what would benefit the one is death to the other . To her , it follows that the neighborhood should be at her beck and call . Then she gives a home to Arthur her grandson , who , I do n't say he is bad , but he was borderline . I mean , he is not on dope , but he is no Eagle Scout . Granted , it is no strawberry festival . But she 's got many finicky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was in her garden . " " I never even saw her ! " I cried . Born on Long Island , May Dikeman now lives with her three children on Manhattan . She is a novelist and painter ; her first story in this magazine was " The Polarizing Force " ( May 1961 ) . " I said to her ! " said Mrs. Shroeder . " I said , listen , you have got that woman wrong , she 's not that type of girl . Then she said she would make you come to her . " " What did she mean , make me come to her ? " I " I doubt that she meant anything particular , " said Mrs. Shroeder , hopefully . " Because what could she mean , she would make you come to her . I mean , you 're not a snob , but you 're not going to crawl . If she means she 's going to ask you to tea , that 's some invitation ! I think she 's getting to be a case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel for her sufferings . She 's a great brooder . She is not on terms with her son . He married a girl beneath him . Then the grandson , Arthur , was in a place which , it was n't a reform school , but which was more or less to prevent , let 's say . So Mercer gets the custody for her golden years . That 's some pension . So I feel for her . Besides , we 've got a bond in the same landlady . I said to Mrs. Mercer , in a winterized beach house , it 's a case of divided we fall ! The three of us have the same landlady , it should be a bond . A bond could be one thing the landlady provides for us ! " W E HAD not been living on Anemone Street long when I found I was pregnant with our second child . During the first couple of months I was constantly drowsy , and Victoria took to straying from our yard . She got the habit of telling me Gary made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home crying that Gary had put her in a well , and her hair was damp . The midsummer heat at New Zuider Beach was stunning , with the sandy street mirroring the yards of giant flowers glowing in translucent poison-sugar colors . I fought sleep all the time . When I yielded to a doze , I came to to find Victoria gone again . One morning after Victoria had gone out to play , a policeman came to our door . " She 's been run over , " I thought . I could not even feel anything until he asked me if the Georgia car out front were ours . Delayed reaction made me sick , and unable to handle it as I might possibly have been able to do otherwise . The policeman said the department had had a call from a neighbor who said our car was blocking traffic . I pointed out that everybody parked their cars out front , and there was no traffic . The policeman got irritated , and said perhaps he could just not happen to see a car with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag and they got a complaint , he had to give a summons . The hardest part for us was that an issue on which we were procrastinating was forced . Interference with our active resolves never made its desperate , as a prod at our inertia could . We had n't been able to decide what to do about the car , which needed overhauling . What we could n't decide what to do with , we always kept . When forced to do something , we always got rid of it . On the evening that our old car was towed away , we stood on our steps and watched , speaking abstractly , with tight throats , of that special pathetic fallacy of the machine age , the American tendency to sentimentalize cars , for any trait we derided which we found in ourselves , we called American . Victoria , in her pajamas , sobbed . " Oh , dear ! " I exclaimed , as the front end rose in the air , " it looks like a dead turtle . Oh , is n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should have gotten our plates changed , " said my husband , with a masochistic male fairness . When we were in bed that night , Mrs. Shroeder called me on the phone . She did this often , and really became a part of our marriage . My husband said he got to sleep easily with her voice running like a motor from the phone I held in the pillow while I fooled with his hair and gazed up at the old swing hooks in the board ceiling , for our bedroom was an enclosed porch . " Mrs. H. , do I feel terrible about your earl " she began . " Oh , the little Vicky , she cried . If it was Mrs. Mercer that called , it was a terrible thing , that 's what I 've been unable to figure . Be cause one day the mailman told me he tore his pants on your fender . Oh , the world was coming to an end , damage to his uniform he had to pay . He was up on the wrong side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tonight , I said to Mrs. Mercer , ' Listen , to me it 's a shame the young couple should lose their car , ' and I watched her for her reaction . Her face did not turn red in any way , and she said it again . She said , ' She 'll come to me ! She 'll come to me ! ' Now , this is very puzzling ! " I was unable to resist rousing my husband to relay this to him . " Senile , " he muttered , without opening his eyes . " But who do you think it was , Mrs. Mercer or the mailman ? " I insisted . " The mailman , " he said , arbitrarily , as he did when Victoria tried riddles on him . T El E summer focused into fall , my morning sickness and fatigue transformed into the euphoria of the mid-months . But the neighborhood problems increased . Even the tiny , white-haired , brown Italian couple who loaned me their hedge clippers  --  when they asked me to ask my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to explain the difficulty of asking this , or anything , of a cat  --  looked aggrieved , although they replied courteously in an Italian saying like , " When it rains , everywhere is wet . " One morning I took Victoria to the beach , and Johnny the butcher drove his car onto the sand and asked to take us for a drive . I felt a sanctuary in my pregnancy , and was not alarmed , but the incident spoiled our excursion . As I led Victoria away , Johnny , switching sportingly to sales promotion , called , " I can give you a good buy in a **27;1761;TOOLONG combination , missus ! " In the afternoon , I got Victoria to take a nap , and lay down myself . The sense of some-body nearby woke me , and I saw Mrs. Mercer 's grandson Arthur outside the window , in the path between our house and Mrs. Shroeder 's , testing " What are you doing there ? " I said A STORY BY MAY DIKEMAN more thing , a maternity skirt of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I rushed out , as if I had been unavoidably delayed , and called Victoria , without expecting her to answer . I went around to the front to check the Chesneys ' yard , and called again . Gary and Steve were playing by themselves . Mr. Chesney , loafing around his side steps , as usual , said they had not seen Victoria . I went on down Anemone , calling . A couple of neighbors remarked , as I passed , that they had not seen her . One woman described a different child to me . After covering Anemone the long way , I went back the other way , but the other end of the street was only a short way from our house , and I saw the empty yards before I came to them . I went around the corner to Coral Cove Street , still calling , " Victoria ! " I saw a group of children in a front yard on Coral Cove , but Victoria was not with them . One little girl , who used the word " sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you looking For your sister ? " I did not want to question the children , because watching the slow process of their recalling , fabricating , deciding whether they wanted to soothe or agitate me , and whether it had been five minutes or two hours since they had seen Victoria , was going to be too much for me now , and would waste time . Because I had been off Anemone for a few minutes , it now seemed even likely Victoria would be there , in full view . But as soon as I rounded the corner back into Anemone Street , still calling her , and saw the streets clarified and oil-colored with evening , the houses somehow all roofs , the strangeness stunned me , as if I had gotten off at an unknown railroad station ; a sign in a porch window , " Notary Public , " seemed to be in a foreign language . The women who had said they had n't seen her said , " Did you find her ? Did n't you find her ? " A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her again ? " Gary and Steve ran behind me down the street , imitating my calling , but they called " Gloria ! Gloria ! " The baby I was carrying felt very hard , a dead weight like a coconut . I ran to New Zuider Lane , the street of empty lots and a few stores between the long serpent of the beach-house streets and the beach itself . Staggering down the middle of the Lane was a familiar beach character , a young man who carried two armfuls of three-foot-high stacks of baseball cards , scarcely able to walk , yet never dropping a card . My fear made his very harmlessness sinister . I ran up to him and said , " Have you seen my little girl ? " Johnny the butcher came hurrying out of his store , his face awestruck for the first time at the impiety I had committed , for if he did not respect women nor maternity , he had a medieval peasant 's reverence for mental defectiveness . " Missus , missus ! " he cried in protest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have you seen my Victoria ? " I said . If he had seen her since I had , this made me feel close to him ; I understood why parents forgive a suspect , as if any hand that had touched her , even in violence , I might retroactively stay by pardon . " I 'll get my car , " said Johnny . The idea of search with a car for a small child seemed to give her up . But with every other possibility now scratched off , exposing my underlying fear , I ran for the beach , wondering how I could not have run first to the beach . " Oh , why did n't I go to the beach first , " I gasped as I ran . The asphalt road broke off in big crumbles at the sagging security fence , and I ran through the gateway onto the open pink sand , where armatures of driftwood crawled , saluted , or prayed , and an apple-juice can , bricks , mop heads of seaweed , and potato-chip bags lay . Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay the dark honeycomb of the channel . I watched the kinesis of the beer-colored honeycomb that went nowhere and showed nothing , until I lost focus . I turned and ran back , fast enough to cut my breath off , although the baby seemed to be pushing me backwards , as desperately as if I had arranged to meet Victoria on Anemone Street at dusk , and was late , hearing my own voice , a wild voice , echoing , " Toria ! Toria ! " from the sky , The roofs now plotted a solid graph with one star showing above them . " Did you look on Coral Cove ? " said the women . " Did you look at Chesneys ' ? " " If something had happened to her , Gary would have come and told us , " said Mr. Chesney , proudly . Mrs. Shroeder 's car pulled into Anemone Street . " Mrs. H. , she 's somewhere , " she said , capably . " I mean she could not have gone far . She 's good . Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I saw doubt and panic come over Mrs. Shroeder 's blue eyes . " Mrs. Shroeder , do you know where there 's a well ? " I cried . " You do right to be careful of a girl , " said Mr. Chesney . " I know a wishing well in Dongan Hills , " said Mrs. Shroeder . " Because the world is full of degenerates , " said Mr. Chesney , " and especially in this here particular neighborhood . " Lights went on in three of the beach houses , making it night . I saw Mrs. Mercer 's shadow on the lit-up window of her kitchen 64 THE HOSTAGE door . " I 'm going to call the police . " I said . " Well , it might n't be a bad idea , just as a precaution , " said Mrs. Shroeder . She was almost whispering to keep her voice calm . I ran into my house . In the house , the difference between no Victoria and Victoria seemed an optical effect , adjustable by a maneuver , a hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor in here and Victoria gone closed to the absolute partition which sealed without thickness , like sheet steel . Life and death were operable , but neither could ever annihilate nor ever duplicate Victoria . As I dialed the phone . the baby kicked , and I wondered if a boy or another girl could he more unlike Victoria , and I knew I would not be able , in two months , to look at either . " No , " whispered . " I do n't want to see him , I do n't want to see her . " When the voice answered , " Policeman , " I knew I had no hope . He said , " Describe the child . " I said , " She has dark-blond hair and hazel eyes , She had on a yellow T-shirt ? " My teeth chattered as I said " yellow T-shirt , " and I had to speak very slowly to enunciate the rest . " A blue windbreaker , and navy shorts . She had white socks and tan sandals . She had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the dark lot at the end of the street  --  a white sock , the pink barrette . " Well get a car out , " said the policeman . M Y LEGS gave as I hung up , and I fell , knocking myself , then got up instantly and ran back out into the street . Mrs. Shroeder came running toward inc. holding a cup of tea , half of it already spilled down her , clattering the cup in the saucer . " We 'll conduct a door-to-door search ! " she said . " With system ! " " I 've already asked at every house , " I said . Suddenly I turned and rushed for the Mercers ' house , and knocked on the kitchen door , Mrs. Mercer immediately opened it . Only braced by our cold war , as if we cherish hostilities to nerve ourselves for life , could I have spoken then in this controlled and courteous voice . " Mrs. Mercer , " I said , " have you seen my Victoria ? " While P was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that I found her , For her lostness to have filled the whole night , making the sky noxious , the local Don Juans abductors . Weak at her power over me , the possibility struck me of a love that might contain all her absences and returns , binding them in a constant salutation , so that instead of " She is mine , " I could say , " She is " ; but I knew this vision came from our reunion  --  we are ready to give when we have retrieved . " Yes , she 's here , she was just coming home , " said Mrs. Mercer , in a formally polite whine . She was only a little gray-headed housedress , lamed as the bee with the stinger shot . Victoria went into a loud burst of tears . " Mommy , Mrs. Mercer made me , " she cried . " She made me stay ! " In a faint , high voice , I only said , " Oh Vicky , I was so worried about you . " Mrs. Mercer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door where Mrs. Shroeder stood with clasped hands . " I asked her was she allowed to be here , and she said she was allowed . She watched the cartoons . She watched Porky Pig . I asked her did she have her supper , and she said she did n't have her supper . I gave her cereal and the had apple sauce and graham crackers , which I figured could n't hurt her . " " Thank you , Mrs. Mercer , " I called . " Mrs. H. , " said Mrs. Shroeder , in her heavy whisper . " Am I relieved . Was I sick . Oh , Mrs. H. , you do n't suppose ? I mean , we saw her , she was standing there looking out , while you were tearing up and down , in your condition , screaming your lungs out . Could it be any person would see a dog suffer as you were suffering , in your condition ? " I told Mrs. Shroeder we would never know for sure . As if superstitiously , I abstained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the strength and determination of reclamation . I knew that we were going to move , and that meanwhile Victoria would never be out of my sight . My husband and I had been married just long enough to have reached the stage ( perhaps what is called mature adjustment ) when I asked him for nothing unless it were life and death to me , and , while ordinarily passive , he would act dynamically on these rare requests . When he came in that night , the first thing I said was , " We 've got to move . " He gave me one look , and replied , " I 'll get us an apartment in Manhattan . I 'll find one in a week . " After that , I gave him the story . Of course he asked at once if she were all right . My account was one of those " But you ca n't imagine what I went through ! " stories . Of Mrs. Mercer , I kept repeating lavishly , " I was n't aware of her existence ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I got to bed , I curled myself around the baby I had tried to outrun all evening , whom I now knew to be the son I wanted , but dead . I lay on my side , and the hard globe of the baby sank like an anchor to the mattress . I pushed it , and the baby pushed back . Just as I went into grateful sleep , Mrs. Shroeder phoned . " Mrs. H. , my mind is in a turmoil , " she began . Is she such a snake in the grass ? There you were , tearing up Anemone and down Coral Cove , in your condition ! Oh ! Could it be she did it with malice ? Because that would be very wrong . I mean , that was not right ! Granted she is a great sufferer . Angina and arthritis is no party ! If 1 had a son and I did n't speak to him , it would be a heartbreak in my life I wo n't deny . So I tried to make myself of service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work , oh , it is 1 that do the dirty work ! But I thought she was good , she could be good . So 1 felt pity . But what gets me , Mercer said she would make you come ! Vicky said Mrs. Mercer made her stay ! " I tried to explain to Mrs. Shroeder that Vicky was at the age of making this excuse . I went on trying to spare Mrs. Mercer as if I knew another side , which of course I did not . " If Mercer had not said she would make you come , " said Mrs. Shroeder . " I am in a distracted state . I am going around in a squirrel cage . What is there left in the world ? What has happened to New Zuider Beach ? " M Y H U S B A ND had said he would find us an apartment within a week , and he found one at noon on Wednesday , four railroad rooms in the Village . Just as we had reveled in our beach community idea the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apartment living , united with our neighbors only by the echo of our plumbing , our TV 's and high-fi 's , our inscrutable thumps , the freedom of not knowing if the woman upstairs had dropped something or dropped dead . Now that the time limit was set , I lived secure in a state of emergency , exacting regulations I could never have sustained indefinitely , and Vicky , awestruck for the first time , stayed obediently within the bounds of our yard . We moved early in the morning , so early on such a morning that New Zuider Beach was enchanted into the scene we had driven through on that vacation morning , and even I felt wistful , as we feel wistful for the illusions of which we have been disabused . As we drove down Anemone in the conquest of the injured , I thought , as if I had conferred a spurned benefice , " We asked nothing but to be left alone . Nothingl " A few neighbors waved , the little old Italian couple said something like , " In spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something very wise in halian , " I said . " It loses in translation , " said my husband . Mrs. Shroeder was taking her morning swim at this time ( all old Islanders swam morning and evening as routinely as they might take tub baths ) and we drove round New Zuidcr Lane to find her to say good-by . We saw her coining across the dawn-lit sand , her tan bathing suit giving the imposing effect that she was nude , wearing only the towel draped like a cape over one shoulder , a monstrous goddess of victory , the ripples chiseled in her wet hair , " I have done some thinking ! " she hailed us . " Have I been a fool ! No more . That was vicious . That was pure viciousness , that she could stand and watch you traipse up Anemone and down Nautilus , in your condition !
