We were drinking Nescafe in the cool , overfurnished par  --  lor of an elderly refugee schoolteacher . A horde of charm  --  ing , bouncing small children had been pushed out to make room for serious grown-hp talk . The children all seemed to be the same age and were , oddly , the teacher 's own sons and daughters and his grandchildren . His wife van  --  ished , as is correct . His bright 22-year-old daughter , al  --  ready the mother of four , crouched outside the door like a beggar , holding a bit of white cloth over her face , and listened . In 1961 , I had made a long tour of the UNRWA ( Uni  --  ted Nations Relief and Works Agency ) Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon , West Jordan and the Gaza Strip , and I had been at this camp near Jericho before . It is dis  --  heartening . The world believes , because it is constantly told , that the Palestinian refugees have lived in physical misery for nineteen years . Middle-class refugees will con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those who remain in the camps , owned nothing at home and are no worse off now than before . The majority of refugees , edu  --  cated , skilled , semi-skilled , live outside the camps and manage like any other Arabs . The refugees ' misery is in the head . They are sick in their minds from a diet of propaganda , official Arab dogma and homemade fantasy , which they have gobbled for nine teen years . Schooled in self-pity , encouraged to believe they are the world 's unique victims of injustice , they have never been allowed to forget the daydream past or to settle for the real future . Since the third Arab-Israel war hardly touched them , they learned nothing from it . The schoolteacher was tired of fire eating and disabused with Nasser . But the rest of the company , three husky chicken farmers , men in their late 20s , a tall , pale , ele  --  gantly put together student from Amman University , and a cocky grammar schoolboy , were as devoted to Nasser as ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) thought a peace treaty between Jordan and Israel would be a good thing , the young men felt that Nasser must de ride They had personal problems from the war . The chicken farmers lacked transport . The schoolteacher said his wife was running out of kerosene for cooking . The grammar schoolboy 's matriculation exams at Ramallah had been in  --  terrupted ; when would the Israelis arrange for him to finish ? The university student was worried that the Israelis would compel him to repeat his second year instead of continuing straight into his third year , as was fair , at Hebrew University in Jerusalem . He was stunned to hear that Hebrew University teaches in Hebrew . I kept pointing out , in the face of these complaints , that the shooting had ended only ten days earlier Then , as on remembered cue , we went into the fantasy phase of conversation It consists of recounting how many acres of fine fields and orchards , what splendid houses , were left behind in Palestine and stolen by the Jews . There is competition in fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the inhabitants of any camp you usu  --  ally arrive at a total larger than the whole recovered arable land of Israel . One very nice man in another camp told me that he had owned 11,000 acres of citrus groves : legend has it that once the Sultan of Turkey owned that much land in Palestine and sold it to the Rothschilds . But I think this ownership fantasy is the real human core of the Pales  --  tinian refugee problem , as opposed to the unreal Arab propaganda problem . Half the refugees are under 18 years of age ; Pales  --  tine is a myth taught in school and at home . I do not think that any of these people truly want to return to Israel  --  not unless the Israelis will give them the country , improved by decades of labor , and obligingly jump in the sea . What the refugees really want is money for their imagined lost possessions . They do n't seem to know that , repeatedly since 1949 , the Israeli Government has offered compensa  --  tion , sometimes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . Nor , apparently , do they know that these offers have always been angrily rejected on their behalf by the Arab governments . To accept compensation would be to end the Palestine Refugee Problem . The com  --  pensation is there and waiting , but it will never satisfy these people because it is based on fact , not fantasy . If your father owned a recorded 5 acres of land , and you believe he owned 500 acres , you are bound to feel bitter and cheated by an exact repayment . " Why ca n't we go on a bus to see Israel ? " the schoolboy asked . He was the best linguist . " What is it like ? " How to put it quickly , in our limited mutual supply of words ? " Everyone works very hard , " I said . That is the basic de  --  scription of Israel . " Works very hard ? ' ' he repeated with horror , and was annoyed when I laughed . " What do you think about the English and American planes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A he . There were none . " " Every Arab believes it . There were . The planes helped the Israelis . What about the oil blockade ? " Translations into Arabic for the chicken farmers and the teacher , who understood no English . " I think it will hurt the Arabs most . How will they live if they do n't sell oil ? " " Russians will buy the oil , " the boy said proudly , " and Ar India and Vietnam . Arabs will not suffer . " " What would have happened to the Jews if the Arabs had won ? " I was taking a little Gallup poll on that one . The university student translated and the six men muttered together for some time . " Very terrible , " the boy summed up . " All dead . " Out of the blue , remarks of the schoolteacher were translated . " Eshkol and Dayan are very good . " " Why does he say that ? " " Because all is peaceful , " the university student said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " King Hussein is very good , " the boy interrupted . " We like him very much now he went to Cairo to see Nasser " Repeated in Arabic ; general nodding agreement . The schoolteacher looked weary and offered more coffee and cigarettes . " Educated refugees make money and have a good life , " the university student observed suddenly . " In Amman we go to our classes with girls . That is very good . Can I go back to Ammann University because I can not speak Hebrew ? " The visiting males filed out , thus freeing the bright 22 ? year-old daughter from veiled exile by the door . She spoke passionately ; I feared that I had offended some mysterious female code . " What does she say ? " I asked the boy , a friend of the family and too young to require a woman 's hidden face and silence . He grinned , embarrassed by her outburst . " She says : Finish Nasser . Finish Shukairy . Finish Hus  --  sein . Enough . Enough . Peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women have no voice in Arab politics . THE TOMBS OF BEN SUC ' TOO BLIND STUPID TO SEE ' With this admonition still in my ears I drove down to Bien Hoa with a friendly AID man who was to deliver me to my host . In his fresh cords and neat tie he could have been catching the 8 24 from White Plains  --  except for the pistol I spotted in his attache case . Ben Suc lay heavily on my mind and it turned out that my companion had been in charge of the refugees on January 8 when the operation began . My acquaintance of the evening before might have been pleased by the AID man 's compassion : " Ben Suc was about the nicest , lushest village you ever saw There were shade trees and big houses with the roofs , strong cattle and hard ferry landings so the people could bathe on the banks of the river . " He asserted , how  --  ever , that the 3,800 villagers were " mostly VC families , and had been for twenty-five years " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was that no refugee camp could be set up before  --  hand . to do so would have tipped the hand of the planners . The " refugees " ( Webster says . " Refugee . . . one who flees to a place of safety " ) with their animals and be  --  longings found themselves transported initially to shel  --  ters holding ten families , each family in 10 x 20 feet . " Several hundred people . " he said , have " filtered back " to the Ben Suc area , although it is now a Free Fire Zone ( anything moving is an unquestioned target ) in which they " must take their chances . " Ben Suc is not a " secure area . " What then , I asked , was accomplished ? He replied that an assembly point had been " denied " to a VC battalion and that a significant VC Headquarters may have fallen as well He had n't seen the refugees since six days after the investing of Ben Suc ( " I was n't on that job too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be better than before . Also , " the Vietnamese , unlike Europeans , are very capable refugees . " When I arrived in Bien Boa , I discovered that my old friend was now a very important AID man in Third Corps ( twelve provinces ) operations . And he , too ,
