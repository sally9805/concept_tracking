txt ? Robert R. Gilruth , director of the Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston , implied today that nothing had happened during the recently completed Apollo 7 space mission to " preclude " orbiting the moon on the next American space flight in December . He cautioned , however , in a news conference at President Johnson 's ranch near here at noon , that the results of the Apollo , 7 flight were not the " only determinant " of whether the United States would attempt a lunar orbit by Christmas on the Apollo 8 flight . Timetable May Move Up If a successful lunar orbit is made in December , it could accelerate the timetable for a landing attempt on the moon from September of 1969 to July of that year . Dr. Gilruth mentioned the vibration problem with an engine in the Saturn 5 booster rocket during the Apollo 6 mission last April as one of a number of problems that still had to be solved completely before a lunar orbit could be attempted . He said that " a number of engineering changes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vibration difficulty , but that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had not yet made the final decision to try the lunar orbit . This decision would not be // made until Nov. 10 , he said . He said , nevertheless , that the Apollo 7 flight , which used the smaller Saturn HI booster , " did all the things that were expected of it " and that nothing had happened that would " preclude doing almost anything " during the next space mission . Mr. Gilruth 's remarks also were taken as encouraging by informed observers , who said that technicians at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration currently thought they had solved the vibration problem in the Saturn 5 booster . The three contemplated alternatives for the Apollo 8 flight , now scheduled for launching on Dec , 21 , are to make a deep penetration of space up to 4,000 miles from the earth , to loop around the moon at a distance of about 1,000 miles , or to orbit it 10 times at a distance of about 60 miles . The orbital mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites for the planned lunar landing . Medals to Astronauts Before the news conference , in a. converted aluminum hanger near the airstrip beside the ranch house , the President , looking relaxed in a tan western-style suit , awarded NASA exceptional service medals to the three astronauts who completed the 11-day Apollo 7 mission on Oct. 22 . They are : Capt . Walter M. Schirra Jr . of the Navy , who made his third space flight in the Apollo 7 ; Lieut . Col. Donn F. Eisele , en Air Force officer , and Walter Cunningham , a civilian . Mr. Johnson also awarded a NASA distinguished service medal to James E. Webb , the former administrator who retired earlier this fall . Films of Earth From Space Slides of views of various parts of the earth from 120 , to 279 miles in space and a movie film of the astronauts floating about the capsule in the weightlessness of space were then shown . In one film , sequence , Captain Schirra mixed the morning orange juice , by spinning a plastic bag filled with water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then retrieved it when the bag floated weightlessly . In another sequence , Colonel Eisele took the components of his lunch out of a paper box and stacked them in the air around him . Captain Schirra , whose attitude towards directions from the ground controllers brought him considerable publicity during the space flight , pointed out the smoke stacks of Birmingham in one slide view of Alabama . He commented that the smoke trails showed " what man can do to a beautiful climate by polluting the atmosphere . " Upholds His Decisions In the news conference later , he apologized for his testiness during the pace flight , but he maintained that his decisions to disregard directions from the ground in some instances were correct . " I do apologize to everyone for some of my remarks as they were phrased , " he said , " but not for my decisions . " He also said that the air in he spaceship had made the efects of a cold he contracted worse and that he did not be'ieve astronauts should be pernitted to fly with colds . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was under way , and he had appeared in perfect health at the launching on Oct. 11 . " It the medical profession could predict a cold they could cure one , " he remarked .
