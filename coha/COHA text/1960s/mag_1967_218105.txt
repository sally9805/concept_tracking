The new year was scarcely three weeks old , and its step on Wall Street seemed springy indeed . With a burst of daily trading that surprised brokers-a daily average of 9,544,000 shares v. 7,500,000 last year-chart lines for the New York Stock Exchange pointed almost steadily upward . Boosted at midweek by a one-day gain of 10.41 points , the Dow-Jones industrial average finished the week 12.03 points higher than it began . Overall , the industrials had risen 61.47 since the year began , stood at week 's end at 847.16 , or as high again as they were last August . Some brokers predicted that the industrial average , which dropped out of the 900s last May , might burst back in again by March . <P> Ranging Progress . What impressed the experts was that the advance ranged across just about every sector of the market . In 14 consecutive sessions , gains by individual stocks outnumbered the declines , and many a stock in the course of the week hit a new high , not merely for 1967 but for 1966 as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Gamble and even beleaguered A.T . &; T. went up ; so did glamor stocks Itek , Scientific Data and Ampex . Where there were big drops , there was an obvious reason . American Broadcasting Co. fell 141 points following an announcement in Washington by the Justice Department that it would oppose the merger of ABC and International Telephone &; Telegraph ( ITT , on the other hand , finished the week 1 point ahead ) . <P> There were many apparent reasons for the rise . One was the fact that investors who sold short in December for tax purposes now had to cover . Short-interest holdings-including large blocs in Douglas , RCA , Sperry Rand , Fairchild Camera and Gulf &; Western-hit a 35-year high in December . The short-interest total began dropping-it was 2,000,000 shares lower at the beginning of last week-as the short sellers began covering themselves in a rising market . Buying also were mutual funds , which had kept about $3 billion liquid and ready during an uncertain autumn and now moved in with some of it to pick up favorites . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not all due to internal causes . Much of it has come since President John son 's State of the Union message ; along with such bitter pills as higher taxes , the President also promised such palliatives as easier money and spoke against the wartime wage and price controls that Wall Street fears . In addition , last week came predictions from Washington that last year 's sharp rise in consumer prices was likely to ease off this year , which also pleases the Street . By March , if the market does indeed roll into the 900s on its own momentum , there seemed a likelihood that a stable economy might keep it rolling .
