Fair play may be the rule on the football field , but in the announcer 's booth it is the sponsor who calls the plays . During a recent ABC telecast of a game between Southern Methodist and Texas A. &; M. , the announcers referred to the S.M.U. team as the " Horses , " the " Colts " and the " Ponies " - but never by their accepted nickname , the Mustangs . Reason : one of the show 's sponsors was the Chevrolet Camaro , which is in direct competition with the Ford Mustang . <P> The most widespread abuse , however , is an old sucker play that might be called the double reverse runaround . Each network runs a post-game show that reports final scores of other contests and , like everything else in TV , the advertising revenue for these " wrap-ups " is dependent upon ratings . Thus in the fourth quarter of a televised football game , announcers conveniently neglect to give the scores of other games lest they discourage viewers from staying tuned for the wrapup . <P> Equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aired at the same time on another network ; the fear is that the rival might have a game more worth watching , and that the viewer , God forbid , would flip the dial . Late in one recent game an ABC announcer cried : " Here 's another final in . . . It 's - oh , I 'm sorry , I 'm not supposed to give any more scores . "
