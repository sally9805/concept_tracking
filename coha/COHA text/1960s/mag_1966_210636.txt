William Earl Casper Jr. , 35 , used to be a fat , sick Congregationalist , who won a lot of money playing golf . He is now a slim , healthy Mormon . Nothing else has changed . Last week , at San Francisco 's Olympic Country Club golf course , Billy won the U.S. Open for the second time-without even trying to win . <P> In his own words , he was " just trying to finish second . " By the time the fourth round was half over , Arnold Palmer had a seven-stroke lead , and seemed certain to break Ben Hogan 's 18-year-old Open record of 276 for 72 holes . Casper , Dave Marr , Tony Lema and Jack Nicklaus were battling for the runner-up purse of $12,500 . Then , in one of the most shocking turnabouts in sports history , Palmer blew 1 ) his lead , 2 ) his cool and 3 ) the tournament . <P> Nobody got particularly excited when Palmer bogeyed Olympic 's par-four tenth hole , cutting his lead over Casper to six strokes-especially after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody got alarmed when Arnie lost a second stroke at the par-three 13th . After the 14th , with four holes to go , he still had a five-stroke lead . Then , with incredible swiftness , disaster struck . On the par-three , 150-yd. 15th hole , Palmer 's No. 7 iron shot strayed off line and caught a yawning sand trap to the right of the green . He bogeyed the hole , and lost two strokes when Casper curled a downhill , 30-ft. putt smack into the center of the cup for a birdie . <P> Visibly rattled and muttering to himself , Palmer stepped up to the 16th tee , and proceeded to bounce his drive off a tree into the high grass . His second shot , a No. 3 iron , crawled less than 100 yds. through the rough . He had to hit a No. 9 iron just to get the ball back on the fairway . A stray No. 3 wood left Arnie trapped just off the green ; he had to explode to within 4 ft. of the rim and sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever made . " Another birdie by Casper cut Palmer 's lead to one stroke , and that stroke vanished when Arnie missed a 10-ft. putt on the 17th hole . Both golfers parred the 18th , and for the 24th time in 72 years the U.S. Open went into a playoff . <P> Beating Arnold Palmer in an Open play-off is no longer news ; he has been involved in three and lost them all . Casper did it spectacularly . Once the " fat young man " of the pro tour , now slimmed down 45 Ibs. ( to 180 Ibs. on his 5-ft. 11-in. frame ) on an antiallergy diet that includes such entres as buffalo steak and mooseburgers , Billy was converted to Mormonism last Jan. 1 and spent the night before the play-off attending a church " fireside " 35 miles from San Francisco . Next day he fired his fourth subpar round of the tournament-a one under 69-to beat Palmer by four strokes for the $25,000 winner 's purse . " Ten percent of it will go to the Mormon Church , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $12,500 that Billy had originally been shooting for : " Ten percent of it will go to my business manager .
