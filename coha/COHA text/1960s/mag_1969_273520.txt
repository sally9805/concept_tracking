Stage-door Janies have always been more demonstrative than stage-door Johnnies . Juvenal railed bitterly against flirtatious Roman ladies in whose eyes any gladiator , however ugly , was " transformed into a Hyacinthus . " No Ziegfeld girl ever inspired a male reaction remotely comparable to the mass hysteria of Sinatra 's swooners in the 1940s or Elvis Presley 's frantic fanatics in the 1950s . Such adulatory demonstrations were mild , however , compared with those of a new and even more liberated breed of female hero-worshipers . They are the " groupies . " Their heroes are rock musicians-and their worship knows no bounds . <P> Frank Zappa , leader of a wel known rock group that calls itself the Mothers of Invention , defines a groupie simply as " a girl who goes to bed with members of rock-and-roll bands . " Zappa , a 28-year-old musician with a sociological bent , notes : " Every trade has its groupies . Some chicks dig truck drivers . Some go for men in uniform-the early camp followers . Ours go for rock musicians . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday 's hysterical fans and today 's groupies is that the groupies-also known as " rock geishas " - usually manage to fulfill their erotic fantasies . Says Anna ( few groupies use last names , perhaps out of kindness to their families ) , a pretty , 25-year-old San Franciscan : " A girl is a groupie only if she has numerous relationships . A groupie will maybe sleep with three people all in one night from one group-from the equipment man to whoever is the most important . " <P> Class Strata . Though everyone on the rock scene is aware of the groupie phenomenon , it is next to impossible to know how many there are-mainly because rock stars , like most young men , tend to brag about their conquests . They come , says Zappa , " from any home that has contact with rock and roll and with radio and records . That 's everybody . " Zappa contends that there are thousands of them , ranging in age all the way from 50 ( " Although they have to look damned good at that age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Their appeal is obvious . Says " the Bear , " a 280-lb. singer and harmonica player for a Los Angeles group called the Canned Heat : " I 've got an old lady now , so I do n't mess around when I 'm in L. A. But when I 'm on the road , it 's different . I mean , here are these chicks padding around the hotel corridors after you , and it 's great . " Some musicians , however , profess to find them a nuisance . Mothers Manager Dick Barber complains that groupies are in such ready supply that it is " pretty hard " to get rock bands to morning practices or recording sessions , " and sometimes hard to get them on the bandstand at night . " Josephine Mori , public relations girl for a rock record company called Elektra , calls groupies " piranhas " and says : " They have no appreciation of the person they go to bed with . " Marty Pichinson , a drummer with a rock band known as the Revelles , disputes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing . " Going to bed with a girl is nice , " he says . " But sometimes you just want to have a pillow fight with the guys . "
