txt New math could be very important to Britain . Many youngsters here tend to get progressively discouraged with the old math . By the time they reach the top grades of school , many happily drop the subject altogether . One result is that 1,100 places in pure science and 500 in engineering go begging each year in British universities . Meanwhile , something like 7,000 qualified young people who want to study art or economics ca n't find a place . Even among science students , the majority opt for biology or zoology wherever possible . It would seem that only when new math multiplies will Britain begin to produce as many top physicists and engineers as it needs in this technological age . Britain is in for more belt-tightening . But for once it is n't economic . Immediately after Easter safety belts become compulsory on all new cars in Britain . But wearing them will not be compulsory either for drivers or passengers . In a masterful understatement , Transport Minister Barbara Castle says enforcement would be too difficult . Another anomaly is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax but those installed later by a dealer or service station do not . The Chancellor of the Exchequer may clear up this inconsistency in his April budget . It 's been proposed that a tax incentive should be given to all who add safety belts to their cars  --  perhaps a small rebate off the cost of the vehicle license . So far no one is proposing rewards for snapping on those seat belts . 0 Hovercraft transport  --  smooth and rapid over land and sea ? is catching on fast in Britain . Spring , 1963 , promises an important milestone . British Rail 's Seaspeed will open its Hovercraft service across the English Channel . British Rail now is hard at work piling up operational experience with two 35-seater Hovercraft ( SR-N6 S ) . They are humming over routes from Portsmouth and Southampton to the Isle of Wight and expected to haul 100,000 passengers this year . At the same time Seaspeed is planning new " ports " for the big new Hovercrafts that will operate the cross-channel service . Dover to Calais is the traditional link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seaspeed is considering an Essex terminal east of Southend , near the mouth of the Thames . The big Hovercrafts ( SR-N4 ) will carry 250 passengers and 30 cars across the channel at speeds reaching 75 knots . Time for the Southend to Calais journey would be 45 minutes .. 0 Between now and 1971 Britons the king in the counting house . " counting out the money . " At least they will be learning how to count the new coins that will begin to roll in ' 71 when Britain switches to the decimal system . The government is going to help with the learning . Lessons in the new money will be given on television , radio , films , and in the press . And all those who have cash dealings with the public will also be trained to help . Like France , which shifted to the new franc , Britain will pass through a period of " associability " ? an awkward time when the new , lighter bronze pennies , 2-penny , 5-penny and 10-penny pieces will jingle alongside the old and heavier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece is expected to replace the frail 10-shilling note now in use . The House of Commons has voted to accept the pound sterling as the major unit for the new currency . The decimal coinage bill now goes to the House of Lords . It could hold up the legislation for a year . But it is n't expected to do so . To the tourist from abroad who struggles with Britain 's present system , mastering decimal coinage looks like child 's play for a people who feel quite at home amid guinea , pound , and half a crown . Trends ? ? ? In another two years Londoners should be able to pick up their telephones and dial across the Atlantic . Postmaster General Edward Short says he plans to introduce subscriber dialing from London phones to the United States and Canada next year . Londoners can already dial direct to Paris , Brussels , and other European cities . Extension of the service to Australia , New Zealand , and South Africa is under consideration . During 1970 the transatlantic dial service is scheduled to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liverpool , and Manchester .
