txt Richard M. Nixon declared yesterday that the Republican party must choose centrist , leadership that will " make a , place for all responsible points of view . " from conservative to . liberal , while rejecting rightwing extremism . Asking again for a cooling off period among Republicans , Mr. Nixon declared that " the blood is still too hot and we'rei ' too close to the disaster " of Nov. 3 to take the right steps toward arranging new party ' leadership . He said that " the , first of the year would be the time to decide " on such steps . Ideologically , the Republican ( future has got to be near the center of the political spectrum , he said , and its leaders must be moderates who can draw conservatives and liberals into coalition . " The center does not try to read anybody out of the party , " he remarked . " But the farther you go in either direction , the greater the inclination to read others out  --  to say , ' It 's my way or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannibalism , " he warned the party to avoid another massive ideological split of : the sort that marked its San Francisco convention. : Mr. Nixon charged that after their victory there , the conservatives were unreasonable in " purging " the party apparatus of liberals . " The election  - -  will s be badly interpreted if it - is interpreted as a rejection Of - conservatism ' , " the former Vice President dedared . " It was a rejection - of reaction , a rejection of racism , a rejection of extremism . " He added that he did not believe the defeated candidate , Senator Barry GoldWater , had stood for those things , although he said some of the Goldwater supporters had . ? Mr. Nixon aimed , barbs at those on " the totalitarian right , the John Birchers and the Minutemen , " and at racists and professional civil rights . agitators " - all of whom he said take a rule-or-ruin attitude in the hot pursuit of their fixed ideologies , Conservative Strength . " There is a strong conservative wing of the Republican party , " Mr. Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councils , and the liberal wing deserves a party voice , but neither can dominate or dictate ? the center must lead . " He saw no one in the party more on " dead center " than himself , and he said . he would devote all his " spare time- to the political area " but he called proposals that he become ' the national chairman " ridiculous . " Mr. Nixon said he believed the Republican- ... party-. lase " through *forever twith any *illusions " that there might:be-political geld. in the " backlash issue , " Richard M. Nixon said the , G.O.P. must ; renounce the right-wing extremists and make a place for all " responsible points of view . " a reaction of , whites . against gains by Negroes . ' " There were those who thought the party future might be in an anti-civil rights sposi tion , he said in an interview at his office here . " Now that 's finished , and it 's very much to the good . " " I think you 're going to see both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removing . the blackwhite issue from national partisan politics . " Pointing out- that politicians realized that the morality of an issue and- its Nete , getting potential were sometimes at variance , he said that the morality of the - civil rights issue and its political appeal were the same ? for justice and against racism . Mr. Nixon noted that the Republican ' party had " lost votes in some Southern states in which it had been gaining strength " before this year , such as North Carolina , Virginia , Florida and Tennessee . " In . Tennessee we would have elected two Senators if we had had some Negro Notes , " he said . Urgency Emphasized The man who led the Republican party to within a hairbreadth of a popular-vote majority for the . Presidency in 190 ( Mr. Nixon got 34,108,546 votes to 34,227,096 for John F. Kennedy ) now occupies a 24thfloor law office at 20 Broad Street , in the heart of the financial ' district . The office is three doors from the Federal Hall national historic site . at Broad and Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Nixon devoted much of the 75-minute interview to detailing the urgent need for political moderation'in a nuclear age . For almost 50 minutes he sat tipped back in his tilting swivel chair , both feet on his desk . On a - table behind him in the buff-walled office were silverframed autographed pictures of some of theworid 's greatstatesmen and royal persons . " I 'm going to write about moderation , " he said , with the fingers of one hand tip to tip with those of the other . " But how do you make moderation exciting ? Extremism is exciting , but moderation seems dull , bland , Pabhun-like . It 's got to become . a cause . " In the world in which we live today extremism  --  peace at any cost or victory at any price  --  will destroy freedom because it will destroy the world . " A no-risk policy and an allrisk policy are both wrong . What we . have to do is to take the responsible risks . " Declaring that " Republicans need an intellectual base , " Mr. Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960 were Democratic-oriented and the professors of political science ? were nearly all down that line , and they 're tremendously potent poeple . " " We 've got to get through to the eggheads , " Mr. Nixon said . " The intellectual above everything else , like Aristotle , should be the reasonable man who takes the hard , tedious road of finding the right position , which may not get the easy plaudits of the snap judgment . We 're sometimes the kind of people who say , ' Let 's burn the schoolhouee down ' or ' ban the damn book , ' but that is not the way in our kind of world . " " We 've got to point out to young people that it takes guts to he responsible , to reject the far right and the far left , " he continued . " It takes courage to reject the wild cheering of the extremes . " Moratorium Urged Mr. Nixon counted it a good thing that civil rights leaders had alerted the nation to the need for redress of grievances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any means to the end and say they 'll violate the , law to redress 100 years of grievances , " they encourage counterviolations by racists . " We 've got to put emphasis on the means , and intellectuals should lead the way in this , " he said . Stating that the defeated Republican Presidential candidate might be going through a difficult post-election period he suggested that " Barry Goldwater deserves a moratorium on kicking him for a while . " " But the Goldwater people have to be reasonable , " he said . " They were unreasonable after San Francisco in purging the National Committee of some of the liberals . " Asked who occupied the Republican center , Mr. Nixon listed Gov . William W. Scranton ( " not a rule-or-ruin type ; a unifier " ) , Gov . George W. Romney ( " slightly to the left of center , but primarily a centrist and a free enterpriser " ) , and most of the Governors and many Congressmen . " Rockefeller is on the liberal side , but in some respects he pulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ruled him out of national leadership . " I respect the right of dissent , " he said , " but Republicans . in recent years have had a cannibalistic instinct Some on the left in the party react the same way as ' the extreme right : ' If we ca n't have it our way , we 're going to sit it out . ' " My quarrel with Rockefeller is not his principles . The party needs its liberals . The quarrel has to do with a basic fundamental political fact : A man who runs for the - 'nomination , pledges his support for the winner and then takes a walk , can not come back and say he wants to be the leader . If that happens , you reward a man in effect for deserting the party after he himself has sought ' the l prize ? " Where does Mr. Nixon himself stand in a party needing moderate leaders ? " I 'm perhaps at dead center , " he said .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
