The muu muu has gone mod and turned into a granny . It happened in Los Angeles , and within a month grannies had shown up on Wilshire Boulevard in broad daylight , at the Beatles concert in the Hollywood Bowl , at Disneyland and U.C.L.A. <P> A granny is not a grandmother but a garment : a dress that covers the wearer from neck to ankle , a kind of nipped-in Mother Hubbard gussied up with Victorian furbelows and bows . Real-life grannies would not be caught dead in one : grannies are only for girls . <P> It began with a few California surfers who could sew . The girls had imported bright , flowery muu muus from Hawaii to wear after surfing . But muu muus were originally thought up by missionaries to cover up the exposed breasts of the native women . The kids trimmed off the excess material , accentuated the bodice for trim fit , slit the skirt for free movement , and finished it all off with yards of ruffles and flourishes . When enough of the home-grown variety showed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fad worth cashing in on . Selling at $10 to $15 , store-bought grannies have spread to Chicago , Manhattan and Pittsburgh . <P> In Los Angeles , grannies have become de rigueur for dates and general after-school wear . " They are a good change from Capris and a top for parties , " says 20-year-old Gail Eckles . " They make you feel so dressed up , " added 14-year-old Cathy Milligan , who owns three of them . " It 's a study in contrast , " explained one designer . " The kids go from the wild , wild short dresses to the neat little granny . " Another observer has a better theory : " The kids want it because it is something mother wo n't copy . "
