Sports would seem to be an ideal subject for movies . They are fast , colorful , suspenseful and sometimes violent . Yet they generally come out looking forced and fake , because they are used as a background for some trite melodrama . Football players lose their power on the field because their wives are frigid ( Number One ) ; drivers louse up on the racing track because their women are fickle ( Winning ) ; fighters sell out under the influence of booze , dames and the mob ( Golden Boy ) . <P> Downhill Racer , a sober and straight-forward story about an aggressive young skier on the international circuit , attempts to carom past the usual clichs by taking a fictionalized documentary approach . If on occasion it takes a spill or two , Downhill still comes through as a perceptive , unsentimental portrait of a young athlete on the make . <P> David Chappellet ( Robert Redford ) , a tough kid from the wrong side of the Rockies , flies to Switzerland to replace an injured member of an American amateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the order , after other skiers have chewed up and rutted the downhill course . Still , Chappellet goes as though pursued by demons , and he wins a crack at an Olympic championship . Along the way he wrangles with his coach ( Gene Hackman ) , makes the usual number of enemies , and sleeps with a couple of girls , one disadvantaged and one super-sleek ( Camilla Sparv ) . A routine routine , but Director Michael Ritchie freshens up his first film with some electrifying camera work . The exhilarating danger of downhill racing is perfectly portrayed with footage shot by Pro Skier Joe Jay Jalbert , who held a camera in his hands instead of poles . Gene Hackman has just the right combination of brio and go-go-go as the coach , and Robert Redford 's performance as the skier rings true down to the last schuss . Downhill Racer is a modest effort but a good one . It may be the first film in history that starts at the top , goes steadily downhill , and still stays interesting along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
