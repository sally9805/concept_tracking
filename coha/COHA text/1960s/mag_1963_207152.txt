Since Synanon House set itself up in Santa Monica four and a half years ago as a mutual self-help cure station for drug addicts , it has seen its fame spread across the country . And for good reason . Addicts given intensive treatment at special federal hospitals have a relapse rate as high as 90% ; Synanon , which models itself on Alcoholics Anonymous and uses ex-addicts to give junkies the support and understanding they need to kick the habit and stay clean , has cut the relapse rate to as low as 20% . <P> Most striking outpost for the addicts ' mutual-aid method is Nevada State Prison . Authorities invited Founder Charles E. Dederich. 49 ( never a drug addict himself , but a graduate of A.A. ) , to set up Synanon 's system in the cell blocks and maximum freedom honor camp at Peavine , northwest of Reno . The result has been an unexpected bonus . Not only is Synanon taking hold with 18 addicts , but because the same personality weaknesses that drive some people to narcotics are also present in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers twice as many convicts with no addiction history . <P> The Unconnables . At the prison , Warden Jack Fogliani has set aside a whole tier of cells for Synanon . Occupying it are men who normally would be under maximum security . Yet this tier is the only one in which the cells are left unlocked at night . Each 4-ft. by 8-ft. cubicle is spick-and-span . On the walls , instead of calendar nudes , are reproductions of Van Gogh and art work done by the inmates . Neither Fogliani nor the prison guard captain visits the Synanon tier unless invited . <P> " Punishment is not the answer , nor keeping a man locked up , " says Warden Fogliani . " These Synanon people can approach the convicts in a way that we ca n't . They 've been at the bottom of the barrel , too , so other convicts listen to them . It 's the voice of experience . " Bill Crawford , one of the Synanon leaders who moved to Reno , and an ex-addict himself , goes further : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , have conned people-and therefore ca n't be conned by the prisoners . " <P> Socrates in the Cells . Synanon depends heavily on group therapy , and it insists on a tough regime . Since both addict and nonaddict cons have made lying a way of life , absolute truthfulness is demanded . Any hedging , any attempt to shift the blame for their plight to others , is ruthlessly torn apart within the group . Even foul language is banned , because it might snowball into a rumble . And the ultimate punishment is expulsion from the program . But in return , Synanon gives the addict , often for the first time , a sense of belonging to a group . Instead of a " fix , " it offers , by the example of the ex-addict leaders , hope that a cure is possible . And because the group governs and disciplines itself , it gives the addicts and other convicts a jolt of self-respect . <P> Often the starting point for hope is a timeworn epigram that is chalked on a slate , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , " or Emerson 's " Discontent is the want of self-reliance . " From there the prisoners take it on their own , analyzing themselves and one another . But the strongest prompting toward cure is the living example of the ex-junkies themselves .
