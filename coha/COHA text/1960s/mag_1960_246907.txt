" You know the President does not lie . His word is true . Someone must have faith to believe that when all this is done and the iron is dug out , the iron itself will make money to pay for all these machines . Those people are called a company . " Thus , President William V. S. Tubman of Liberia plugged a new stock issue at a meeting in 1958 of the paramount chiefs of the tribes in Liberia , speaking the simple English they could understand . Tubman told them that for $100 ( payable in three installments ) a Liberian citizen could buy $500 worth of stock in a company planning to mine iron ore along the Mano River , the border between Liberia and Sierra Leone . <P> Putting up the other $400 was a private U.S. developer , Lansdell K. Christie , 56 , who will put a total of nearly $3,000,000 into the new company . Christie , who has made millions from his share of a concession to mine iron in Liberia 's Bomi Hills , agreed to lend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their country 's richest natural resources . Says Christie : " We ca n't despoil underdeveloped countries of their wealth . We must allow them to participate . It is unthinkable for a developer to try to hog a project all for himself . " <P> Jungle Trek . One minor government official walked two days and two nights through forests , then rode for a day and a night to file applications to buy the stock . Cocoa and rubber farmers , laborers , houseboys , clerks and merchants lined up by the hundreds to oversubscribe the issue , many signing with crosses and Xs . Last week , with the proceeds from the first major public stock offering in a West African nation , construction was under way on a 55-mile railroad through the cedar and mahogany rain forest to link the Mano River ore hills with Liberia 's major port , Monrovia . <P> The Mano ore deposits ( proven resources : 53 million tons with over 55% iron content ) will be developed by Christie , a husky onetime Army engineering officer who built bases in Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic Party in 1956 ( $70,564 ) . Christie won his concession in 1946 for his Liberia Mining Co. to dig Bomi Hills ore , then sold the controlling interest to Republic Steel Corp . in 1949 . <P> Contracts in Hand . The new Mano mining concession belongs to the $10 million National Iron Ore Company , Ltd. ( 1,000,000 shares ) , owned by the Liberian government ( 50% ) , the Liberia Mining Co. ( 15% ) and Liberian Enterprises , Ltd. , a holding company ( 35% ) . Christie and his associates own 35,000 shares in Liberian Enterprises , Ltd. , and have sold the other 22,750 through the public offering to more than 1,600 Liberians . Under the terms , Christie will be repaid the $400 he lent each stockholder from 50% of their dividends . <P> Christie 's schedule calls for the Mano mines to be shipping ore in the spring of 1961 , operating at full production of 4,000,000 tons a year within four years . To do this will cost $22 million ; but Christie does not expect any trouble raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
