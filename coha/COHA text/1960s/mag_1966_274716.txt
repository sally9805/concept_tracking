THE RAILWAY POLICE AND THE LAST TROLLEY RIDE by Hortense Calisher. 248 pages . Little , Brown . $5 . <P> Hortense Calisher has a tidy and fervently loyal coterie whose members read everything she writes and pretend to understand it . They are courageous people , since understanding Hortense Calisher has to be an act of faith . <P> These two novellas illustrate how evanescent a Calisher point can be when it is pursued to its core . On the New York-to-Boston train , in The Railway Police , is a woman social worker who wears wigs to hide a hereditary baldness .

After a last ride on the trolley line , which is being shut down , these four marry . The trolley line is kept running in miniature in somebody 's basement , and subsequently it is sent to the Smithsonian Institution . <P> Calisher plots , obviously , do not readily synopsize-like boiled water , they leave no residue . But the reader can enjoy a Calisher journey even though , like her trolley line , it ends up nowhere . The Calisher ear for words is poetical , and sometimes the click of wheel on track forms recognizable rhythms : " The spirit of picnics and cemetery visits is always feminine . " <P> That may be enough to prevent the reader from getting off before the last stop . But when he does stay on to the end , there are the same questions that nagged him all along the route : " Where are we going ? When do we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
