A S THE young man came over the hill the first thin blowing of rain met him . He turned his coat collar up and stood on top of the long rabbit-riddled hedge hank , looking down into the valley . He had come too far . What had set out as a walk along pleasantly remembered Tarmac lanes had somehow , almost dreamily , turned into a cross-plowland trek , his shoes ruined , and the mud working up the trouser legs of his suit where they rubbed against each other . There was a raw flapping wetness in the air that would be downpour again at any moment . Still , this was the view he had been thinking of . Looking down from this point , he had felt , he would get the whole thing . The valley lay open in front of him , its shallow bare fields black and sodden as the bed of an old drained lake after the weeks of rain , utterly deserted . Nothing happened . Not that he had expected any very overpowering experience , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't quite sure what . So he waited , trying to nudge the right feelings alive by the remembered details of the scene  --  the surprisingly familiar curve of the hedges , the great stone gate-pillar and the iron hook let into it that he had so often used as a target , the long bank of the rabbit warren on which he stood and which had been the first thing he had ever noticed about the hill when twenty year ago , from the distance of the village , he had said : " That looks like rabbits . " But twelve years had transformed him . This land no longer recognized him . He looked back at it coldly , remotely , as at a finally visited home country known only through the stories of a grandfather ; felt nothing but the dullness of feeling nothing . Boredom . Then , suddenly , impatience , with a whole swarm of little anxieties about his shoes and this spitting rain and his new suit and that sky and the two-mile trudge through the mud back to the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go straight forward to the farm , a mile away , behind which the road looped . But the thought of meeting the farmer  --  whether to he embarrassingly remembered or shouted at as a trespasser  --  deterred him . Now the rain was pulling up out of the distance , dragging its gray broken columns , smudging the trees and farms . A wave of anger went over him , against himself for blundering into this mud-trap and against the land for making him feel so hardened , so old and stiff and stupid . He turned to get away out of it as quickly as he could and at that moment caught a movement in his eye-corner . All his senses startled alert . He stopped . Over to his right a thin black horse was running across the plowland toward the hill , its head down , its neck stretched out . It seemed to he running on its toes like a cat , a long low sidling run like a clog up to no good . Something 77 unnatural about the way it ran hypnotized him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipped slightly in a ridge that rose to another high point three hundred yards to his right . The horse ran up to this crest that was fringed with tops of trees , showed against the sky , for a moment like a nightmarish leopard , then disappeared over the other side . For several seconds he stood , stunned by the unpleasantly strange impression the sight of the horse had made on him . Then the plastering beat of the cold rain on his bare skull brought him back to himself . The distance had vanished in a wall of gray and all around him the fields were jumping and streaming . Holding his collar close about his chin , he lowered his head and ran back over toward the town side of the hill , the lee side , his feet sucking and splashing , occasionally skidding . This hill was shaped like a wave , a gently rounded back lifting up out of the valley with a sharply crested , almost concave front hanging over the river meadows toward the town . Down this front , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . The nearer wood was nothing more than a quarry , circular , full of stones and bracken , with a few thorns and nondescript saplings , foxholes , and rabbit holes . The other was rectangular , mainly a planting of scrub oak trees . Beyond the river smoldered the town like a great heap of blue cinders . He ran along the top of the first wood and , finding no shelter but the thin leafless thorns of the hedge , dipped below the crest , so that he was at least out of the wind , and jogged along through thick grass toward the wood of oaks . The rain still driving blindingly , he plunged into the tangle of bramble stems at the wood 's edge . The little crippled trees were small choice in the way of shelter and under a sudden fierce thickening of the rain he took one at random , crouching Clown beneath the leaning trunk . Still panting from his run , drawing up his knees , he watched the bleak lines of rain , gray as hail , slanting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and safe : the sound of the rain as it rushed and lulled scaled him from the world . The chilly sheet lead of his suit became a tight warm mold , and gradually he sank into a state of comfort that was all but trance , though the drops still beat uninterruptedly on his shoulders and knees and trickled down the oak trunk and onto his neck . All around him the boughs angled down , glistening like black iron . From their tips and ' lbows the drops hurried steadily , and the channels of the bark pulsed and gleamed . For a time he amused himself calculating the variation in the rainfall by the variations in a dribble of water from a trembling twig-end two feet in front of his nose . He studied the twig itself , bringing dwarfs and continents and animals out of its scurfy bark . Beyond the boughs the blue shoal of the town was rising and falling , and darkening and fading again , in the white backdrop of rain . He wanted this rain to go on forever . Whenever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed in again . Sitting there , he felt suspended from life and from time in a delicious freedom and peace . He did n't want to return to his sodden shoes and his possibly ruined suit and the walk back over that land of mud . A LL at once he began to feel uneasy . At the same moment he thought of the horse . and the hair on the nape of his neck prickled slightly as he remembered how it had run up to the crest and showed against the sky . He tried to dismiss the thought . Horses wandered about the countryside often enough . But the vision of the horse as it had appeared against the sky stuck in his mind . It must have come over the crest just above the wood in which he was now sitting . As if to clear his mind he twisted round and looked up the wood between the tree stems , to his left . At the wood top , with the silvered gray light coming in behind it , the black horse was standing under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricked , watching him . A horse sheltering from the rain usually goes into a sort of stupor , tilts a hind hoof and hangs its head low and lets its eyelids droop , and so it remains as long as the rain lasts . This horse was nothing like that . It was watching him intently , standing perfectly still . its soaked neck and flank shining in the hard light . As he turned back he felt the same crawling dismay as when he first saw it coming across the land . The hair on his head went icy suddenly and he shivered . There was surely something queer about this horse . But what was he to do ? It seemed ridiculous to try driving it away ; and to leave the wood , with the rain still coming down so heavily , was out of the question . The idea of being watched became more and more disturbing until at last he had to twist around again , to see if the horse had moved . It stood exactly as before . This was absurd . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to give the horse one more thought . If it wanted to share the wood with him , let it . If it wanted to stare at him , let it . He was settling firmly into these resolutions when the ground shook and he heard the crash of a heavy body coming clown the wood . Like lightning his legs bounded him upright and about face . The horse was almost on top of him , its head stretching forward , ears flattened and lips lifted hack from the long yellow teeth . He got one photograph glimpse of the red-veined eyeball as he flung himself backwards round the tree ; then he was away up the slope , whipped by oak twigs as he leapt the brambles and brushwood , twisting between the close trees till he tripped and sprawled . As he fell the thought flashed through his head that he must at all costs keep his suit out of the leaf-mold , but a more urgent instinct was already rolling him violently sideways . He spun round , sat up , and looked back , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was panting from the sudden excitement and effort . The horse had disappeared . The wood was empty except for the slant gray rain , dancing the bracken and glittering from the branches . He got up , furious . Knocking the dirt and leaves from his suit as well as he could he looked round for a weapon . The horse was evidently mad , had an abscess on its brain or something of the sort . Or rriayhe it was just spiteful  --  rain sometimes puts creatures into funny states . Whatever it was , he decided to get away from the wood just as quickly as possible , rain or no rain . Since the horse seemed to have gone on down the wood , his way to the farm over the hill was clear . As he went he broke a yard length of wrist-thick dead branch from one of the oaks , but immediately threw it aside and wiped the slough of rotten wet bark from his hands with his soaked handkerchief . Already he was thinking it incredible that the horse should have meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the wood for better shelter and had made a feint at him in passing  --  as much out of curiosity or playfulness as anything . He thought of the way horses menace each other when they arc playing and galloping round in a paddock . The wood rose to a steep bank topped by the hawthorn hedge that ran along the whole ridge of the hill . He scrambled up this bank toward Ted Hughes , born in Yorkshire , lives in New England . He is the author of ' The Hawk in the Rain -- a volume of poems  --  and is now a Guggenheim Fellow.a thin place in the hedge , and was pulling himself up by the bare stem of one of the hawthorn ' when he checked and shrank down again . The swelling gradient of fields lay in front of him , smoking in the slowly crossing rain . Out in the middle of the first field , tall as a statue , and a ghostly silver in the undercloud light , stood the horse , watching the wood . He lowered his head slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of helplessness came over him . He felt certain the horse had been looking straight at him , waiting for him . Was it clairvoyant ? Maybe a mad animal can be clairvoyant . At the same time he was ashamed to find himself acting so foolishly , clucking anti creeping about in this way just to keep out of sight of a horse as if it were an enemy with a rifle . He tried to imagine how anybody in their senses would just walk off home . This cooled him a little , and he retreated further down the wood , determined to go straight back the way he had come , along under the ridge . T H E rain was still falling , a cold steady weight , but he observed this rather than felt it . The water was running clown inside his clothes and squelching in his shoes as he eased his way carefully over the bedded leaves . At every moment he expected to see the prick-eared black head looking down at him from the hedge above . At the woodside he paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence , but he did n't want to venture out into the open field without making sure that the horse was just where he had left it . Then he could withdraw quietly and leave the horse standing out there in the rain . He crept up again among the trees to the crest and peeped through the hedge . The gray field and the whole slope were empty . He searched the distance since the horse was quite likely to have forgotten him altogether and wandered off . Then he raised himself and leaned out to see if it had come in close to the hedge . Before he was aware of anything the ground shook . He twisted round wildly to see how he had been outwitted . The black shape was above him , its whinnying snort and the spattering whack of its hooves seemed to be actually inside his head as he fell backwards down the bank , and leaped again like a madman , dodging among the oaks , imagining how the buffet would come and how he would be knocked headlong . Halfway clown the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stony rabbit diggings . He was well out into the middle of this before he realized that he was running alone . He was gasping for breath now and cursing mechanically . Without a thought for his suit he sat clown where he was , to rest his shaken legs , letting the rain plaster the hair down over his forehead and watching the dense flashing lines disappear abruptly into the earth all round him as if he were watching from safe shelter and through thick plate glass . His lungs trembled as he took deep breaths in an effort to steady his heart and regain con trol of himself . His right trouser turn-up was ripped at the seam and his suit jacket was splashed with the yellow mud of the top field . Obviously the horse had been further along the hedge above the steep field , waiting for him to come out at the woodside just as he had intended , and he must have peeped through the hedge  --  peeping the wrong way  --  within yards of it . However , this last attack had cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool out of simple uncertainty as to whether the horse was his antagonist or merely crazy . It was definitely after him . He picked up two stones about the size of goose eggs and set off towards the bottom of the wood , striding carelessly . The whole of this hill was skirted by a loop of the river . His plan was to cross the little meadow at the bottom of the wood and follow the river , a three-mile circuit , back to the road . There were deep hollows in the river bank , full of stones as he remembered , excellent places to defend himself from if the horse should come after him out there . The bottom of the wood was choked with hawthorns , some of them good-sized trees , and they knitted into an almost impassable barrier . He walked along , looking for a way through . Then he stopped . Through the bluish veil of their bare twigs he could see the familiar shape out in the field below , waiting for him . The horse was facing away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have noticed him , Quietly he turned back and climbed across the clearing toward the one side of the wood he had not yet tried . If the horse would only stay down there he could follow his first and easiest plan , up the woodside and over the hilltop to the farm . As he made for the straggling line of oaks hedging the wood on that side , the rain suddenly pressed down as if the whole sky were to be emptied in a few minutes . The oaks ahead blurred and the ground drummed . As he broke into a run , he heard a deeper sound running with him . He whirled round , a stone ready in his hand . The horse was charging straight at him across the middle of the clearing , scattering the clay and stones in an immensely supple and powerful motion . He let out a tearing roar and threw the stone in his right hand . The result was instantaneous . Whether at the roar or the stone the horse reared as if against a wall and shied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefeet his second stone , at ten yards ' range , landed with a thwack and he saw the bright mud blotch suddenly appear on the glistening black Hank . The horse surged down the wood , splashing the earth like water , tossing its long tail as it plunged out of sight among the hawthorns . H E LOOKED around for stones . The sharp encounter had set the blood beating in his head and given him a savage energy . He could have killed the horse at that moment . That this brute should play with him in such a spiteful , deliberate way was more than he could hear . Whoever owned that horse , he thought , deserved to have its neck broken for letting the dangerous thing loose . He came out at the woodside , still searching for the right stones . There were plenty here , piled and scattered where they had been plowed out of the field over the years . He selected two . As he looked up , the horse was within twenty yards of him , in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . " Out of it ! " he shouted , brandishing his arm . " Out of it Go on ! " The horse ignored him , only twitching its pricked ears . With all his force he threw a stone that soared and landed beyond with a soft thud . He rearmed and threw again . For several minutes he kept up his bombardment , without a single hit , working himself into a fury and throwing more and more wildly , till his arm began to ache with the unaccustomed exercise . All the time the horse mratchecl him fixedly . Finally he had to stop and ease his shoulder muscles , and as if the horse had been waiting for just this , it clipped its head twice and came at him . He spun round , snatched up two stones and roaring with all his strength flung the one in his right hand . He was astonished at the crack of the impact  --  sharp as if he had struck a tile  --  and the horse actually stumbled . ' With another roar he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be under superior guidance . The stone struck and rebounded straight up into the air , spinning fiercely , as the horse swirled away and went careering down toward the far bottom corner of the field , at first with great swinging leaps , then at a canter , leaving deep churned holes in the soil . It turned up the far side of the field , climbing till it was level with him . He felt a little surprise of pity to see it shaking its head , and once it paused to lower its head and paw over its ear with its forehoof as a cat does . " You stay there ! " he shouted . " Keep your distance and you 'll not get hurt . " And indeed the horse did stop at that moment , almost obediently . It stood watching him as he climbed to the crest . The rain swept into his face and he realized that he was freezing , as if his very flesh were sodden . The farm seemed miles away over the dreary fields . Keeping an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he loaded the crook of his left arm with stones and plunged out onto the waste of gray mud . The horse was lost to sight immediately below the ridge , but he kept twisting around every fewstrides to see if it was following him . Before he was halfway over the first field it appeared , silhouetted against the sky at the corner of the wood , head high and attentive , watching his laborious retreat over the three fields . The ankle-deep clay dragged at him as he stumbled on , burdened by his sogged clothes and the armful of stones , his limbs weighing like great clods of mud . He had to fight to keep his breathing even , two strides in , two strides out , the air ripping his lungs . Upwards and out of the sucking earth he forced himself till in the middle of the last field he stopped , dropped all the stones from the cramp of his left arm , keeping just one in his hand , and continued at a walk . The horse , tiny on the skyline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar of the gate that led out of the field into the lane behind the farm . He became conscious of the rain again and suddenly longed to collapse full length under it , to take the cooling , healing drops all over his body , forgetting himself in the last wretchedness of the mud . Instead he made an effort , pulled himself exhaustedly over the gate-top into the lane , and leaned again , looking up at the hill . The rain was dissolving land into sky like a wet water color as the afternoon darkened . He concentrated , raising his head , searching the skyline from end to end . The horse had vanished . The hill looked lifeless and desolate as some island lifting out of the sea , awash with every tide . N D E R the long shed where the tractors , plow , binders , and the rest were drawn up , waiting for their seasons , he sat on a sack thrown over a petrol drum , trembling , his lungs heaving . He began to look around . The ragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beams ; the mingled smell of paraffin , creosote , fertilizer , dust  --  all exactly as he had left it twelve years ago . He remembered three dead foxes hanging in a row from one of the beams , their teeth bloody . The nightmare he had just been through had already sunk from reality . It hung under the surface of his mind , an obscure confusion of fright and shame , as after a narrowly escaped street accident . There was a solid pain in his chest , like a spike of bone stabbing , that made him wonder if he had strained his heart on that last stupid burdened run . Piece by piece he began to take off his clothes , wringing the gray water out of them , but soon he stopped that and just sat staring at the ground , as if some important part had been cut out of his brain .
