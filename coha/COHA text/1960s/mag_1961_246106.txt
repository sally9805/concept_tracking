Peter the Great . Father of the Fatherland and Emperor of All Russia , spent most of his reign ( 1682-1725 ) trying to imitate the culture of the West , but he also kept a cold eye on the East . In Siberia great bands of plunderers were digging up the tombs of a civilization that had disappeared from the pages of history by the 4th century A.D. The looters were after gold , and the tombs were rich in that . Being a practical man , Czar Peter simply gave orders that the looters be looted in turn . Soon plaques and buckles were pouring into the imperial coffers . Thus began the world 's greatest collection of Scythian art , now in the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad . <P> The Scythians were nomads who left traces of themselves all the way from the borders of modern China to the banks of the Danube . Though they possessed neither writing nor coinage , they caught the fancy of the higher civilizations that they came in touch with . To the Scythians , Herodotus devoted a volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turies historians suspected that the old master had made the whole book up . When archaeologists , 150 years ago , began exploring the tombs that bandits had discovered , Herodotus was vindicated . <P> Those Who Must Die . Almost every ancient tribe had a bloody custom or two , but the Scythians seemed to combine them all . They not only scalped their fallen foes but also drank their blood . A man who slew an enemy in the sight of the king was allowed to keep his victim 's skull as a drinking bowl . When the king pronounced the death penalty on a person , he also automatically condemned to death all of the man 's male relatives . Scythian kings never died alone . The head groom , the head cupbearer , the head cook and at least one wife were killed when he died . <P> Above all things-perhaps even above the great goddess of fire herself-the Scythians adored decoration and adornment , and from this came their one important legacy . Even their arrows , though likely to be lost after one shot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse 's harness lacked gold plaques . Being nomads , the Scythians found their outlet not in statues or cities but in things that could be worn . Whatever talent might have poured into architecture or grand statuary went into the molding of sculptures of gold . <P> Kingdom of Fantasy . These works rarely showed gods , nor did they often portray men , as in the combat scene surmounting the golden comb ( see color ) . The favorite subjects of the Scythians were animals , and few civilizations created an animal kingdom with a more graceful sense of fantasy . A boar 's mane is not just so much wild and scraggly hair , but a crescent of curls to be worn like a crown . A tiger 's body is as supple as an accordion : every muscle , every rib , every stripe is there . A deer , though kneeling , seems to be darting through the air while its antlers ripple and bend like plumes . This quivering creature defies and submits at the same time , as if knowing that from the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
