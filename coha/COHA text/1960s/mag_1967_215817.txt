AS the antiwar protests grew and spread last week , they became a more important story with every day that passed . It was on Saturday , after the melee at the Pentagon , that the editors of TIME decided they should use cover treatment to fully point up and analyze the complex issues involved . So , only hours before our regular press time , the previously scheduled cover was taken off the presses and that story deferred , in the latest cover change we have ever made . <P> The main action of the story , Saturday in Washington , was covered by a staff of 18 . Among the marchers went Washington Correspondents Kenneth Danforth and Jerry Hannifin , as well as a group of specially recruited reporters and photographers . Some wore Levi 's and suede boots , to meld more easily with the crowd , and many equipped themselves with goggles when they heard that police might employ Mace spray to check unruly demonstrators . Pentagon Correspondent John Mulliken took up his position there , later to be joined by correspondents who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saltonstall and Donn Downing stood by , respectively , in the White House and at the Department of Justice . Coordinating the activities of all our forces on the scene were Washington Bureau News Editor Ed Goodpaster and Acting Bureau Chief Hugh Sidey . <P> The Washington task force 's reports moved to New York , where Editor Michael Demarest and Writer Robert Jones ( who had been an on-foot reporter in last spring 's Peace March ) studied them along with information that other correspondents had sent in from across the nation and around the world . Altogether , they produced a troubling story of a many-faceted movement often at odds with itself . <P> OUR mail indicates that last week 's cover of the poll-leading Republican dream ticket-Nelson Rockefeller for President and Ronald Reagan for Vice President-was read with exceptional interest wherever politicians gather . At no place was it studied more raptly than aboard the S.S. Independence , where the nation 's Governors were holding their 59th annual conference . <P> While Washington Bureau Chief John Steele watched the Governors for this week 's story in The Nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or irritation , depending on their own points of view . Republicans and Democrats alike pondered the implications . Potential candidates who did not appear on the cover looked hard at the collection of imaginary campaign buttons that appeared inside . But attention kept returning to the cover team . Was this an endorsement of a Rockefeller-Reagan ticket ? No , the story made clear that it was n't . Who was up and who was down ? That question sent a joke running through the Independence . Reagan , it was said , had taken to looking at the cover upside down so that he would be top man on the ticket . <P> Before the week was out , the Chicago American 's cartoonist Wayne Stayskal , far from the balmy waters that the Independence was skimming through , got somewhat the same idea and showed Reagan making the switch in a more graphic way .
