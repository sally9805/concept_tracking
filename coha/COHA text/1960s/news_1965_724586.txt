txt WASHINGTON , Feb. 22 ? In calling today on the youngest of the adult American generations to " work and sacrifice and dare " to become members of the Great Society he envisages , President Johnson was speaking in a definition of these words which their forebears who " conquered a continent " would not have recognized . For what is work , sacrifice and daring in the Welfare State which is to house Mr. Johnson 's Great Society has small resemblance to the endeavors by which the continent was conquered . Even as the President was warning the students of the University of Kentucky , on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of its founding , that they are " living in the wrong generation " if they " wish a sheltered and uneventful life , " his programs for cradle-to-grave individual security under a paternalistic Federal Government were advancing in Congress under his urging . And , meeting in Florida , the Executive Council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. was organizing its powerful political pressures on Congress and the Executive for a reduction in the basic work-week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $2 an hour In the minimum wage , and double pay for each hour of overtime work instead of the current one-and-a-half . Tax Foundation Report Today also , the Tax Foundation . Inc. , issued an estimate that by June SO next tie annual total of Federal , state and local government mending will rise to the $200-billion level , and may reach $203 Minors , imposing a tax burden of $3,336 per family in the United States as contrasted with $1,438 in fiscal 1950 . And , as the Foundation noted , " virtually every major fiscal action is either influenced substantially or based altogether on an appraisal of whit impact it will have on the economy . " The extent to which these major fiscal actions have been directed toward the full attainment of a welfare state is disclosed by the finding of the Tax Foundation that , while Federal administrative budget spending rose 35 per cent in the 1955-65 period , " spending from the central Government 's trust funds for Social Security , highways , etc. , increased 245 per cent . " If " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , the number of these trust funds Will mount to 135 . In this political and economic context Mr. Johnson 's notice to the newly adult generation that it must " work and sacrifice and dare " to build his Great Society does not qualify for his comparison with the individual labors , . dangers and privations of what he referred to as the " great experiment " by which the Republic was established , - saved and wrought into a world power . In this progress there also was developed a Great Society , despite all its flaws and injustices , the genius of which was the broad grant of opportunities to the individual to " work and sactifice and dare . " This is being more and more restricted by the welfare state paternalism of which the President has become the champion . Moreover , history refutes Mr. Johnson 's interpretation of the words he quoted from Washington 's First Inaugural as counsel that the United States should become the policeman ' of the world , trying to see to it that all other peoples adopt our concepts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quote Washington 's saying that " the destiny of the republican model of government is justly considered ... as finally staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the American people . " It is another and quite different thing to read any larger meaning in this than the citation of a " model " for other peoples to emulate or reject as they choose . If the students in the audience addressed by the President today , and their generation throughout the country , ' were to read or re-read the first six chapters of just one book , they would be made acutely aware that , though their task as trustees of " the American Experiment " is , as Mr. Johnson said , " airrerent- from that of their predecessors , it definitely does not meet his description as " more difficult than any that have gone before . " The book is Henry Adams 's history of the nation through the Administrations of Jefferson and Madison . The Untamed Land They will read that , as recently as 1800 , " even after two centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every portion except here and there a strip of cultivated soil ; the minerals lay undisturbed in their rocky beds , and more than two-thirds of the 5,308,483 people clung to the seaboard .. . where alone the wants of civilized life could be supplied . " They will read of individual work , daring and sacrifice which brought them their rich inheritance , without any of the benefices of government that now makes personal security its ever-expanding goal .
