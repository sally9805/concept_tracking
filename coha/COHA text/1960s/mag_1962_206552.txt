Colorado was one of the brightest spots on the Republican landscape-and it showed what can be done when good candidates are helped by a first-rate state organization to ride a conservative wave . <P> Behind the G.O.P. victories in Colorado were Denver Adman Jean K. Tool , 43 , who took over as state chairman two years ago , and Robert E. Lee , a backroom pro who heads the Denver party organization . Between them , they replaced 40% of the county chairmen , cut the average age of district captains from the 70s to the 40s , raised money for a radio and television blitz-and produced two of the most attractive candidates anywhere . They were Lawyer John Love , 45 , for Governor , and Representative Peter Dominick , 47 , for the Senate . <P> Love , making his first try for elective office , faced Democratic Governor Steve McNichols , who had an impressive record of school and highway construction , high employment and industrial development . But McNichols ' achievements came at the cost of an unpopular increase in state income taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tax cut . Love 's appearance and personality also helped him upset McNichols . Remarkably handsome in a man's-man way , he became a cracking good extemporaneous speaker , managed to sound persuasive even while remaining a bit vague about his political philosophy- " I 'm for the simple but powerful precept of government with the people . " <P> There is nothing vague about Peter Dominick 's philosophy : he is a fulltime , working conservative who stands for less government and less spending . Said he of his opponent 's record on spending bills : " The guy I 'm running against voted for every one of the cotton-picking , things . " That opponent was Democratic Senator John Carroll , a 100% liberal who edged in by 2,770 votes six years ago , later lost votes by putting his daughter Diane on his congressional payroll at $12,500 a year while she attended Georgetown University Law School . Carroll , a fumbling campaigner , was hardly a match for Dominick , who is almost as handsome as Love and every bit as good a speaker . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dominick cut deeply into the Democrats ' Denver and Pueblo strongholds ; both won going away .
