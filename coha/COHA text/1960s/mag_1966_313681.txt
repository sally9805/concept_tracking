One hundred thousand cans of Viet Nam-bound hair spray ? Explosive rubber-sandal chemicals ? Suspicious silver nitrate ? Pilferage and black marketing from the U.S. 's $375 million-a-year commodity aid program to South Viet Nam ( TIME , May 20 ) ? Last week the man responsible for discovering and curbing all these irregularities was back from a new and unpublicized visit to Saigon aimed at investigating currency manipulations and bringing still further control out of chaos . He is J. K. ( for John Kenneth ) Mansfield , who , as Inspector General of Foreign Assistance , patrols an unending beat , checking on U.S. military and economic help going to 97 countries . <P> <P> Boots &; Cable . Holder of the post ever since it was created four years ago , Chicago-born Mansfield , 44 , is a onetime investigative staff member of congressional committees who bears the rank of Assistant Secretary of State , and is empowered to suspend almost any aid program . Thus Mansfield and his 24 fellow traveling inspectors are greeted on their journeys abroad with apprehensive cooperation , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a relative of Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield ( he is n't ) . Mansfield and his operatives have tracked everything from 24 million bushels of U.S. wheat diverted from Austria and sold on European markets ( $800,000 in settlements has been recovered ) to 3,600 pairs of U.S.-supplied boots found moldering in a Mali warehouse because local American officials groundlessly thought them too small for Malian feet ( the footwear was issued to the country 's soldiers ) . <P> Two years ago , Mansfield 's sleuths discovered that a NATO communications cable laid beneath the Mediterranean at a cost to the U.S. of $1,000,000 had yet to transmit a single syllable ; studies are now under way on how to utilize it . Another time , Mansfield 's office noticed that 151 Jeeps destined for Thailand were being repainted green , though their original blue coat was in perfectly good condition , halted the paint job , and saved $12,000 . In all , Secretary of State Dean Rusk told the <P> Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a recently pried-loose report on Mansfield 's operation , the savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of dollars " - by conservative estimates more than $50 million . <P> " Caesar 's Wife . " The Inspector General 's office itself has never spent more than $800,000 a year , though it is authorized expenses up to $2,000,000 . One official explains that Mansfield 's men , a mix of ex-FBI agents , Foreign Service officers , accountants , lawyers and computer experts , are " deeply imbued with the Caesar 's wife idea . We could n't be auditing and checking on others and not be extremely careful ourselves . " The I.G. 's gumshoes log upwards of 1,000,000 miles a year by everything from DC-8 to dugout canoe . ( Mansfield , who sees precious little of his wife , Jane-no relation to Jayne-averages 175,000 . ) They gobble so many antimalaria pills that they are ineligible to donate to the State Department blood bank .
