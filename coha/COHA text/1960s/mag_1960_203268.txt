Many a U.S. manufacturer has hungrily eyed the underdeveloped British TV-phonograph market : only 65% of all British households have TV sets , v. 90% in the U.S. But the market is tough to bite into ; purchase taxes and distribution costs are high . Philco sold its British subsidiary after trying ; other major U.S. manufacturers shied away . Last week Magnavox Co. announced that it will go out after the British market in force . <P> Magnavox acquired 70% of the stock of Collaro Ltd. , British manufacturers of record changers used by Magnavox . The move 's real importance is that the rest of Collaro 's stock is held by Great Universal Stores Ltd. , biggest retail and mailorder chain in Britain ( 2,700 stores , 34,000 door-to-door salesmen ) . With this readymade sales organization , Magnavox will distribute its own British-made TV sets , radios and phonographs . Says President Frank Freimann : " We 're ready to expand . This gives us a real springboard to move fast into the English market . " <P> Tremendous Confusion . Broad-shouldered , hoarse-voiced Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along at a fast pace . He will shortly introduce a new electronic organ for the home ( price : $700 to $1,500 ) . In stereo , he pushed Magnavox ahead of the field by switching over its entire phonograph line to stereo in 1958 , bringing a mass-produced stereo set to market before any other U.S. firm . His bet on stereo 's future paid off handsomely . Magnavox sales jumped 36% to $107 million in 1959 , and profits rose 85% to $4,500,000 . The company now sells 20% to 25% of all stereo sets over $250 , expects stereo sales alone to hit $70 million in 1960 . Says Freimann , in a swipe at competitors : " There 's been a tremendous confusion about what stereo is supposed to mean . One set I know of has 15 knobs , and some advertisers say you can only hear stereo properly if you sit in the middle of the room . That 's ridiculous . The fact about stereo is that it is simple . " <P> Lifetime Critic . Hungarian-born Frank Freimann has been a critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , he went to work for an Indiana radio-phonograph company after leaving technical high school . He criticized the company 's sets so much-and proved that he was right-that at 19 he was made chief engineer . After a series of other jobs and two trips around the world as a ship 's radio operator , he founded his own company in Chicago to manufacture custom sound systems . In 1932 he sold 30% of his stock to supplier Magnavox , a company that made only components .
