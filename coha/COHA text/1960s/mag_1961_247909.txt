Any well-ordered family has an obligation to take care of its poor relations . The U.S. Government , says the 1946 Employment Act , has a duty to do everything in its power to provide " useful employment opportunities for those who are able , willing , and seeking to work . " Thus , when the problem of the depressed areas came before the House of Representatives last week , there was no question of the national obligation to help ; the debate centered on how to help , and how much aid to give to the pockets of distress . Both the Republicans and the Democrats offered area-redevelopment bills , and the difference between them turned on $175 million worth of undiluted politics . <P> The $394-million Administration bill was similar in most respects to the G.O.P. substitute , offering money for job retraining and low-interest loans for plant rehabilitation and as inducements to new industries to move to the depressed areas . The big difference was in the sugar-coating on the Democratic pill : $100 million in loans for depressed rural areas to be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote tourism ; and $75 million in grants for public improvements in rundown communities that can not raise bond issues . Both items were as certain as hushpuppies to attract Southern votes , and in case anyone missed the point , a large map was set up in the Speaker 's lobby , locating the nation 's depressed rural areas . Almost all of them were concentrated in the South and the border states . <P> " Butcher . " The Republican bill , sponsored by New Jersey 's Bill Widnall , ignored the Southern farmers . Instead , Widnall went after the votes of Northern Democrats from industrial towns , proposed an extra $50 million in industrial loans and upped the Democrats ' job-retraining ante by $5,500,000 . His strategy failed completely . Speaking against the Republican substitute , Alabama 's Albert Rains was bluntly candid : Without rural aid , he said , the Widnall substitute " seeks to butcher the bill completely . . . Anybody here knows that that would beat this bill . " He was right . On the roll-call votes , the Southerners deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute , 291-125 . The Northern Democrats stuck to the party . And when the Administration bill came up , it was passed easily , with the aid of a large Southern drawl , 250-167 . Next week the few differences between the House bill and a Senate version ( notably the method of financing area redevelopment ) will be resolved in conference . <P> The depressed-areas bill was a major victory for John Kennedy-especially satisfying after the one-vote defeat that the G.O.P.-Southern coalition handed him a week earlier on his minimum wage bill . It also fulfilled a pledge that he had made a year ago , during the West Virginia primary , when he saw for the first time the distress of the miners of Appalachia . Whether or not the bill will bring more than temporary easement to the enclaves of distress is a question for the economists to debate and for time to decide .
