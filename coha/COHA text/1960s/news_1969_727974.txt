txt Joe Namath agreed yesterday to sell his one-half interest in the Lexington Avenue restaurant , Bachelors III . The 26-yearold quarterback of the New York Jets will resume his football career tomorrow evening when he reports to the team 's training camp at Hofstra University . In capitulating after six weeks of turmoil , Namath explained that he was " tired " of the situation that had involved " so many people " and that he wanted to play football , but he stressed that he had done " nothing wrong . " Namath had retired June rather than obey an order from , Pete Rozelle , the commissioner of professional football , that he , divest himself of his interest in Bachelors III because of allegedly " undesirable " custom-I ers there . During a two-hour afternoon meeting in Rozelle 's office at 410 Park Avenue , the commissioner reviewed their discussions . They had met secretly at Rozelle 's midtown apartment for more than four hours on Tuesday and had made brief telephone contact on Wednesday and Thursday . " 1 reviewed the situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Okay , ' and stuck out his hand . " About an hour after the resolution of the controversy , the commissioner and the flamboyant quarterback , who was ' wearing a two-tone beige sport shirt , black bell-bottom slacks with white stripes and gray sneakers , appeared at a news conference in the commissioner 's office . Rozelle announced that Namath and he had " privately reached total accord , " that the quarterback was selling his interest in the restaurant and that the " entire matter " was closed . " We all got a little tired of this situation , " Namath said . " I initially did n't feel that it would involve so many people as it has . But because of the things that have been said and written , it got way out of hand and out of proportion . Because of the people that this has involved and because I do want to play football , Mr. Rozelle and I got together and solved the thing , we feel , by selling Bachelors HI . " Now there is still one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the law enforcement bodies and Mr. Rozelle agree with this . " I 've done nothing wrong , but because of the way some of the people have written and some of the things that have been said in the past , and because of the public reading these things , because this has caused so much trouble for football and for me , we feel we should divorce ourselves of the restaurant at this time , and play football even though everything that 's been said about myself having dice games is wrong . " And the magazines writing what . they have , and the newspapers about undesirables in Bachelors III and all that , I 've still done nothing wrong . I still want to play football and we are back in football . " Sale Not Completed Namath had been linked to Mafia types by both Life and Newsweek magazines and his East 76th Street apartment , according to Sports Illustrated magazine , had been the site of dice games involving Mafia types . The sale of Bachelors III has not been completed , but Rozelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 days . " The commissioner emphasized that it had to be a " clean sale , " that is , not to anyone in Namath 's family or to either of his two lawyers , James Walsh or Michael Bite . Rozelle acknowledged that Namath 's share of the restaurant could be transferred to Ray Abruzzese , a former member of the Jets who holds the other one-half interest . Asked if Namath would be permitted to patronize the restaurant , the commissioner answered , " On any question of that type , Joe and I have a mutual understanding regarding that and all other matters pertaining to it . " Rozelle also was not explicit when asked if Bachelors III would be off-limits to more than 1,000 football players under his jurisdiction . The commissioner 's evasiveness indicated that certain conditions existed in the settlement , but when asked if Namath was on probation , Rozelle said , " No . " Namath disclosed that other Bachelors III restaurants were being considered as an investment for him . He mentioned Boston , Miami and Los Angeles as possible sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other Bachelors III sites , Rozelle answered , " Yes , they have nothing to do with this situation . " Rozelle 's edict evolved from what he described at the time as " the appearance of evil , " which Namath considered " guilt by association . " " I think now , " Rozelle said after Namath had departed , " that Joe has a better understanding of guilt by association and what it can do to him and those close to him . " Namath 's comments were limited because he had to catch an early evening flight to Los Angeles to " finalize a business deal . " He refused to elaborate , but it was believed he had to complete some work on a Paramount film , " Norwood , " in which he has a role as an exMarine living in New York . " I 'll he in the Jets ' camp on Sunday night , " Namath said . " The only reason I wo n't be there is if the plane is late . " Namath , who guided the Jets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Super Bowl game last January , will participate in his first workout Monday . The world champions ' first exhibition game will be Aug. 1 against the College All-Stars in Chicago . " I 'll play in the All-Star game , " Namath said , " if I can beat Babe out . He 's got a week 's work in on me . " Vito ( Babe ) Parilli , a 39-yearold quarterback , was Namath 's back-up man last season as the Jets won the first American Football League championship in the nine-season history of the New York franchise . Rozelle reiterated his plans to explain his side of the situation to Namath 's teammates at their training camp sometime next week . " I did n't want to go out there , " the commissioner said , " while Joe and I were discussing this situation and do anything that might disrupt the satisfactory solution to a very difficult problem . " Namath first had been , warned in March that Bachelors III was being frequented by " undesirable " customers . He ' was warned again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Namath sell . Namath agreed to sell , but suddenly changed his mind on June 5 , then announced his retirement the next day . " Selling , " the quarterback said at the time , " was the logical thing to do , but it was n't the right thing . " On June 26 , Namath and Rozelle met at the commissioner 's apartment without a solution . For more than two weeks after that , there was no personal contact between them , although Rozelle did hold discussions with Walsh , one of Namath 's lawyers . Eventually , when Namath returned to New York last weekend from his movie work , discussions resumed . " Our discussions never reached heated proportions , " the commissioner said . " There was no personal antagonism at all . Neither of us got emotional . There was never a flare . There was never a cross word , although there obviously was a difference of views . I thoroughly enjoyed the one-on-one . " Asked if there had been a " generation gap " between the 43-year-old commissioner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer . Namath 's quick departure for , Kennedy Airport limited his , comments , but he appeared to be weary of the controversy that had dominated his life for six weeks . He expressed a desire " not to talk to anybody , " not even about football .
