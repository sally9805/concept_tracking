" This operation bears no comparison to anything else in United Nations history , " said the U.N . ' s senior officer in Katanga . Conor Cruise O'Brien was vastly understating the case . In recalcitrant Katanga last week , scattered bands of blue-hel-meted troops-Indian , Swedish , Irish-were engaged in a battle to the death with a weird and formidable foe : the troops of Katanga President Moise Tshombe , some of them Baluba warriors smeared with warpaint , led by Europeans and backed by jet fighters . <P> It was a war that the U.N . ' s O'Brien , presumably with the full approval of Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold , had started in an attempt to bring Tshombe back under the authority of the Congo central government and thus head off a possible civil war . As the fighting raged on , it carried the United Nations into the new , uncomfortable-and , to some critics , indefensible-position of active aggressor on a large scale . <P> Ultimatum . Since February , United Nations forces in the Congo had been armed with a Security Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading his null army-and actively working toward maintaining Katanga 's secession from the central Congo government , even at the cost of civil war . Last month , the Congo 's moderate Premier Cyrille Adoula asked the U.N . to enforce the resolution . O'Brien gave Tshombe until Sept. 9 to get rid of the Europeans . <P> When the deadline passed , U.N . Congo Chief Sture Linner reported : " At least 104 foreign personnel failed to give any account of themselves . " O'Brien de manded compliance . In answer , Katanga 's white-led political police arrested O'Brien 's deputy , Michel Tombelaine . Reported Linner , with undisguised frustration : " This was the culmination of a long series of wrongful acts by these officers , including the organization of attacks on the United Nations , repeated threats , and incitements to violence . " O'Brien issued an ultimatum : remove all remaining white officers , or else . When Tshombe flatly refused , U.N . troops went into action , while Hammarskjold , who had just arrived for a personal inspection , waited in Lopoldville . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a company of Indian troops backed by Irish armored cars surrounded the Elisabethville post office ' held as a communications center by a Tshombe garrison . In French and Swahili , demands were megaphoned that the garrison yield the building . The answer was the rattle of machine guns . The U.N . returned fire , and for two hours streams of red tracer bullets crossed each other in the predawn darkness . An Indian soldier was hit in the face ; he screamed . A Katanga gendarme , hit in the belly , fell from a second-story window , picked himself up , staggered away with his entrails hanging out . The driver of an armored car was decapitated , and his car lunged weirdly into a wall .
