" God-guidance " was his touchstone-a phrase so often on his lips that it seemed to many that he had invented the idea . God guided Frank Buchman to seek out the company of the rich and famous-an improbable prophet , ovoid and owlish , with a piping voice and a slangy sweetness-and-light that in the past four decades won him an earnest following . At first these followers were known as Oxford Groupers or Buchmanites , but in 1938. as the nations of the world rearmed for war . Dr. Buchman was inspired to christen his movement Moral Re-Armament . Stumping the world , he gathered testimonials-sometimes heartfelt , sometimes diplomatically polite-from kings , labor leaders . Oriental potentates , Mau-Mau leaders . <P> During recent years . Pennsylvania-born Frank Buchman lived part of the time in a luxurious Shangri-La at Caux , Switzerland , where two former hotels and a cluster of chalets , overlooking the French Alps and Lake Geneva , had become M.R.A. 's international headquarters . Last week , having lately finished a strenuous session with 850 Moral Re-Armers from all over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freudenstadt . There , one night Frank Buchman suffered a heart attack and died . He was 83 . <P> The Oxford Group . Frank Buchman 's special magnetism was not evident early in his life ; one of his teachers in his home town of Pennsburg . Pa. , remembered him as " not outstanding in any respect . " A bachelor all his life , he was ordained a Lutheran minister in 1902 , and soon found that his special interest was working with young men ; for seven years he was secretary of the Y.M.C.A. at Pennsylvania State College . After that , missionary work and evangelism among prisoners in World War I took him to the Near and Far East . and to Europe . It was not until 1921 that he hit his stride by forming the Oxford Group at England 's Oxford University . <P> Imported to America , the Oxford Group went well for a time among Ivy League undergraduates , who responded to the shiny-eyed intensity of the group 's weekend " house parties " in well-staffed mansions , with their morning " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The four tenets of Frank Buchman 's version of Oxford Group Christianity were " absolute honesty , absolute purity , absolute unselfishness and absolute love , " and so much absolutism was bound occasionally to end in tears ; at Princeton , for instance , President John Hibben summarily banned Frank Buchman from the campus . <P> God-Guided Elite . Buchman meant M.R.A. to be a " God-guided campaign to prevent war by moral and spiritual awakening . " It failed to prevent war , and it earned considerable censure for seeming to rely heavily on " changing " dictators ; Buchman had the misfortune to exclaim publicly : " I thank heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler . " After World War II , M.R.A. turned to attacking Communism .
