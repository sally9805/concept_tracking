In Detroit , where secrets are hard to keep , General Motors has for many months been working on a top-secret project : a new and sporty-looking Oldsmobile that will be the first U.S. auto to have front wheel drive since the 1937 Cord . The new car-code-named " Holiday " - is a 1966 model that G.M. plans to introduce next fall . <P> The Holiday is bound to be controversial . Ever since Leonardo da Vinci proposed one in 1500 , men have been designing vehicles with front wheels that provide the traction or driving power , rear wheels that merely go along . for the ride . Today , more than a dozen small European cars have front wheel drive , and both Renault and Peugeot announced last week that they would market new models in 1965 . But Detroit has always been wary , discouraged by the performance and cost of experimental models . The Holiday is thus a bold G.M. step into an area where rival U.S. automakers and even other G.M divisions have feared to tread . <P> Spinning a Problem . Experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes spinning out of control-a problem that the smaller , less powerful European cars have not encountered . Cars with front wheel drive have also proven less efficient on steep grades , noisier at low speeds . Their power must be transmitted to the independently-sprung and swiveling front wheels rather than to fixed rear wheels , requiring a more complex axle that could cost Oldsmobile $150 more per car than the conventional drive . Says a rival Big Three executive : " Front wheel drive is just not worth the added cost in a conventional American car . " <P> Oldsmobile has apparently solved the mechanical problems , hopes that the advantages of front wheel drive will more than pay for its added cost Because front wheel power eliminates the need for a long drive shaft and a rear-axle differential , the Holiday will have a flat , low floor without a center tunnel or differential hump , more room tor passengers and luggage . Front-wheel traction and more weight at the front will make the car more stable on windy days and on icy roads . Perhaps even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should draw many additional prospects into Oldsmobile showrooms , where they may gape at the Holiday but buy a conventional model . <P> Wrapping a Drive . To further entice customers , Oldsmobile has wrapped its front wheel drive into a handsome , five-passenger hardtop that will be the biggest yet of Detroit 's growing fleet of cars with fastback roofs . The Holiday will be 210 in. long , weigh about 4,100 Ibs. , come equipped with a 425-cu. - in. engine and cost about $4,400-a price that places it in direct competition with Ford 's Thunderbird , which still dominates the luxury sports-car market . To absorb some of the Holiday 's development costs , G.M. is making many of its parts interchangeable with the 1966 Buick Riviera , which could be adapted to front wheel drive at a later date .
