Eighteen-year-old Brigitte Bardot made her first splash there in a bikini , wiggling her way into the hearts of photographers ; Simone Signoret 's smoldering stare set the place afire back in 1949 ; Sophia Loren jumped from bulging starlet to blossoming actress when she made the scene in 1955 . Ever since it began , the Cannes Film Festival has been a springboard for victory and vulgarity , for fine art and flapdoodle . This year the festival is 20 years old , but it is still deep in the throes of adolescence : serious and intense one moment , strained and silly the next . <P> With good reason . The official competition , which ends late this week , involves only 24 full-length pictures this year ; but in the back streets marches the March du Film ( Film Market ) , where 160 movies compete for the attention of foreign distributors and critics . The competition is stifling , the pressure unbearable . The performers , the publicists , even the audiences feel it , and the antics become even more frantic than before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existential sensualist , joined forces with Director Tony Richardson and Actress Jeanne Moreau , a festival favorite , to produce Mademoiselle , a story of Sodom in the suburbs . It should have been a festival favorite too ; instead it got soundly , roundly booed , possibly because Moreau overworks her villainy . The film is rife with animal butchery and exotic sexuality . Sniffed one critic : " Maybe we did n't know that licking the nose of a gentleman in the moonlight constituted eroticism . . . but did we really have to know it ? " <P> Orson Welles , looking puffy , overblown and overweight , exhibited Chimes and Midnight , a lively film that he directed and wrote with the help of William Shakespeare , who supplied the chief character : Falstaff , played by Welles . Through the centuries , most actors have had to stuff padding under their tights to play the renowned clown . Welles , at 51 , remains unique ; he is probably the first actor in history who appears too fat for the role . <P> Another talked-about film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a simple love affair between a young widow ( Anouk Aime ) and a racing-car driver ( Jean-Louis Trintignant ) . New Wave Director Claude Lelouch , 28 , shot the picture in four weeks , at one point had himself strapped with his camera to the hood of a speeding car to get realistic footage of the races . The crusty critics even applauded during the showing , rated the film as an homme-dinger , a top contender for the festival 's first prize , the Golden Palm . <P> Hot &; Blue Blood . Two films shared the Itching Palm for overpromotion : Alfie and Caroline Chrie . Alfie , the story of a cockney-of-the-walk starring Michael Caine ( The Ipcress File ) , was advertised widely at the airport with signs that read ALFIE is ROCKING , ALFIE IS TERRIFIC , ALFIE IS THE MOST . " It really is n't vulgar , is it ? " asked a French critic as he watched the signs walking . " After all , the print is very small . " And so it was . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody could see their ads at all .
