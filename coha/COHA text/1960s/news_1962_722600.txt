txt Early this month , a short , middle-aged Texan gingerly steered a 63-foot boom loaded with 500 pounds of dynamite into the base of an awesome inferno blazing 450 feet high in the Algerian desert . The flames were spouting from a natural gas well which had been blown up and set afire a month earlier- by Secret Army Organization terrorists . After the thunder of the fire-snuffing dynamite explosion had subsided , it was replaced by the ear-piercing shriek of high pressure natural gas jetting from the earth at supersonic speed . Then the red-haired Texan tackled the toughest part of his job : He slapped a new set of control valves on the well , knowing all the while that the tiniest spark could cause the escaping gas to explode . When the fantastic pressures bottled up Inside oil and gas wells get uncorked , one of the costliest of all industrial disasters , oil companies habitually send for Paul N. " Red " Adair , head of a small , unique company that specializes in control of oil well fires and blowouts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressures they encounter . When drillers let these pressures get out of control , or when the pressures burst through control equipment on producing wells , the resulting blowout can kill workmen . destroy millions of dollars worth of equipment . consume tens of millions of dollars worth of oil and gas , and , if left unchecked , ruin entire oil and gas fields . While no exact figures are available on the havoc caused by well blowouts , some oil men figure such damage runs well over SI billion a year . A Dangerous . Demanding Job But if oil and gas well fires are a disaster for the well owners , they provide a excellent livelihood for Mr. Adair . In an era when many skilled men settle for security in their jobs , the daredevil Texan has found a high degree of satisfaction in working for him ? self in a narrow specialty that is dangerous . demanding , exciting and exacting . " I like the challenge of the job , " lie ex. plains in a relaxed moment behind his memento-littered desk in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When the phone rings . I never know where I 'm going or what situation I 'll have to face . " The phone has been ringing a lot more frequently of late . Already this year , Mr. Adair has been called on to tame 30 wild wells in such spots as Argentina . Alaska . Pakistan and , of course , Texas . By contrast , the firm he worked for in his first year in the business , 1946 , got only eight calls all year long . The rising need for Red Adair 's services is somewhat paradoxical in view of the industry 's steady progress in coping with high pressure . Oil well fires have been a problem since the industry 's first well burned shortly after Col. Edwin L. Drake completed it in 1859 . And the famous " gushers " of old-time oil fields actually were blowouts that often caused widespread destruction . Steady improvement in equipment , materials and techniques have made producing wells relatively safe . Drilling also became a reasonably safe occupation with the invention in 1922 of the blowout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore  --  and with development of the science of mud engineering . the use of specially mixed , heavy slurries called " drilling mud " to keep underground - wessures in check . But the danger of blowouts is increasing again , according to Mr. Adair , as the search for oil and gas goes to depths of four miles and more and as thousands of producing wells are approaching ages at which materials or equipment could fail to contain the pressures within them . Loses Can Be Huge The total number of blowouts a yearahouts 250 , of which perhaps 25 become catastrophes ? is a small proportion of the 650.000 wells in production in the world today . But a single well fire has consumed more than 3100 million worth of oil and gas , and rapid dissipation of the producing pressure in an oil ' or gas formation by an unchecked blowout could leave billions of dollars worth of oil or gas reserves trapped in the earth . Insurance normally covers only the loss of surface equipment . Moreover , in some cases foreign governments hold oil companies responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Red Adair to cope with these disasters principally because of his experience and extensive technical knowledge of oil and gas well equipment . A rugged 185-pounder , the 47-year-old fire fighter was a bomb disposal expert , football star and race driver , among other things . before turning to his present occupation . Red Adair and his two assistants  --  Edward 0 . " Coots " Matthews and Asgar " Boots " Hansen . Jr. ? keep their passports handy and suitcases packed at all times . For domestic fires . their special equipment is loaded on trucks and ready to roll on 30 minutes ' notice . To tackle overseas blazes , they fly hundreds of thousands of miles a year . frequently flying in their own equipment as well . The three work . ogether when possible , but sometimes they must work alone as was the case a couple of months ago when they took on wild wells iimultaneously on three continents . In one hectic 27-hour period not long ago . Mr. Matthews crossed the Atlantic three times . Mr. Matthews . Mr. Hansen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Adair Oil Well Fires &; Blowout Control Co . Mr. Adair wo n't give any hint of his company 's financial circumstances , but based on the number of jobs it has been handling in recent years and on its minimum fees of $10. - 000 for an overseas assignment and $2.500 for a domestic call , it probably grosses $250.000 Or more a year . That Mr. Adair has done well by himself financially is attested by a listing of some of his present possessions : A Cadillac , a Thunderbird , a Ford and three Lincoln Continentals. all fire engine red ; 41-foot and 27-foot cruisers for fishing in the Gulf of Mexico . and four homes for himself , his wife , his two married children and one grandchild . A Giant Bunsen Burner A well on fire resembles a giant Bunsen burner with the high pressures in the earth shooting the flames through the elaborate complex of valves atop the well hundreds of feet into the air . The fires vary considerably in content : Burning oil , burning gas , a burning mixture of oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil I which produces a curious white smoke ) . Some oil and natural gas liquids are not consumed by the flames . These rise in the enormous column of smoke over the blaze and then fall back to earth in hot droplets . This hot oil is more than 200 degrees Fahrenheit , and poses one additional hazard for the fire fighters . Red Adair and his assistants work only in red long-handled underwear , red coveralls , boots and hard hats . They formerly wore asbestos suits , but they discarded them as too clumsy and too tiring . However , they Insist on an unlimited supply of water so that a number of hoses , set up behind corrugated iron screens , can keep them and the surrounding area drenched every minute they are battling a blaze . To get this water supply , - on occasion they have had to drill water wells , build water pipelines and bulldoze giant storage tanks . Fighting a well fire is a highly unpredictable undertaking . Mr. Adair recently put out a well blaze at El Campo , Texas , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , long weeks of hard work are needed . It took his crew six months to tame a blazing gas well this year at Gassi Touil in Algeria . The well is owned by Phillips Petroleum Co. and two French Grins , the same partners that own the well blown up by the OAS . Sometimes the battle to extinguish a well fire takes on the aspects of a military operation . For the well at Gassi Tout ! , for example , equipment had to be assembled from several European countries , water pipelines and roads constructed and three drilling rigs brought in to drill directional wells to reduce the enormous pressure in the burning well . One Giant Torch In putting out a blaze , the Adair crew usually begins by turning the many flames jetting from the so-called Christmas tree , the complex of valves atop the well , into one giant torch . To do this , Mr. Adair uses a device of his own invention , a hinged ring of explosives which he calls a flying saucer . When attached around the base of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly severing the pipe and leaving a ? single towering torch . Next . Mr. Adair snuffs out the torch with a huge dynamite explosion which cuts the fire off from needed oxygen long enough to stop combustion . The effect is one of giant fingers pinching out a candle flame . Mr. Adair learned this technique from Myron M. Kinley , who developed oil well " shooting " to a high art and for whom Mr. Adair formerly worked . Actually , shooting out fires was discovered by accident in a California oil field in 1913 when fire fighters using dynamite to remove a Christmas tree from a burning well succeeded in extinguishing the fire altogether . - To minimize the chances of a well re- igniting once a fire is out , the Adair crew takes elaborate precautions . All matches and cigaret lighters are confiscated from workers in the area until the well is capped . Except for the equipment he must use himself . Mr. Adair insists that other vehicles be kept well clear of the area . Debris and underbrush are cleared away from the blazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrub or debris setting off a new ex ? plosion . Tools are laid down carefully to avoid sparks . One danger the fire fighters ca n't do much about : Static electricity , which can result from so slight a thing as wind moving over desert sands . The Trials of Jab The adversities that Mr. Adair and his assistants have to endure in fighting oil fires sound like the Biblical trials of Joh . A few months ago . the crew tackled a Sun Oil Co. well fire in British Columbia in temperatures that reached 50 degrees below zero - so cold that their protective streams of salt water froze in the air right up to the edge of the blaze . Shortly after , the men were taming a wild well in Iran in temperatures that soared to 179 degrees on the desert floor . To snuff out a flaming Indonesian government well at Rantau . Sumatra , they had to contend with crocodiles . pythons , sniping by guerrilla troops , and a daily diet of fish heads and rice . In fighting a Sacony Mobil Oil Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their eyes swollen shut for two days by hydrogen sulphide fumes . On another . occasion , Mr. Adair was similarly blinded for four days . When there is no wind . the men are doused with hot oil , and frequently their . skins peel from working in pools of toxic crude oil while capping a wed . Red Adair 's closest call came in highly civilized surroundings : At Hollywood Park race track In Englewood , Calif. , in 1054 , During a fire at a Basin Oil Co. well at the track his hips were crushed by a crane . Doctors gave him little chance to live . They said he never would walk again . But after four months in the hospital , he was back on his feet and ready to take on more wild wells . This sort of determination was what first brought Mr. Adair to the attention of Myron Kinley , his tutor and predecessor in the business . Mr. Adair was working in an oil field in 1939 when a well blew out ; while Mr. Kinley looked on . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well . Later . Mr. Kinley saw Mr. Adair blown 50 feet into the air by a well blowout and come down un ? hurt . This convinced Mr. Kinley he should hirC Mr. Adair ; when Mr. Kinley went into semiretirement in 1959 , Mr. Adair started his own company .
