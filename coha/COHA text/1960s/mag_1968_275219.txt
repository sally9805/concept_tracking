It is a woman 's right to be fickle about whom she will embrace . Last week , Vassar College , which for several years has been in search of a masculine mate , opened her arms to the men of Williams . <P> Several other suitors were considered by Vassar . The selective all-girls school ( enrollment 1,600 ) rebuffed a discreet pass from Princeton , * then flirted with a proposal to move to New Haven . Ultimately , the school decided not to give up its wooded 950-acre campus in Poughkeepsie , N.Y . <P> Next Vassar 's trustees decided on creating a separate but coordinate mens college on the campus . When that kind of union seemed too slow and expensive Vassar changed its mind , decided to open an exchange program this winter with Williams , the little Ivy League all-male college ( enrollment 1,230 ) in Williamstown , Mass . About 20 Vassar women will attend Williams , while a corresponding number of Williams men will move to Poughkeepsie . The exchange with Williams may be towed by similar ties with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must make to handle men . Eventually , the school expects to lose its identity as a women 's college by enrolling a high proportion of men as regular students on its home campus . <P> <P> * Which , after a trustee-ordered study is considering a proposal to admit about 1,001 women students .
