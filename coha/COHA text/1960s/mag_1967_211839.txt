Two Labor members of the Birmingham City Council recently had what they considered a bright idea : Why not establish municipal brothels to keep the city 's aggressive prostitutes in one place ? The councillors were fully braced for a storm of indignant protest , even though they never seriously expected their measure to pass . Nothing of the sort happened . Instead , the two councillors were immediately besieged with invitations to appear on TV and state their views . Many Britons wrote to congratulate them for forthrightly raising an important question . The Tories complained only that , if there were to be brothels , they should not be a government enterprise . <P> Britons may be no more or less interested in sex than most other peoples in an increasingly permissive age , but they certainly express that interest more openly and flamboyantly . The subject seems to be on everyone 's mind . Newspapers and magazines constantly frontpage details of the most lurid activities . The once-staid BBC last summer showed a boy and girl in bed together discussing their sexual history . British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers of mass-circulation papers on the Continent or the U.S. Their classified-ad pages frequently serve as arenas for the commerce of sex . British admen have learned to use sexual innuendo with such effect that some ads have had to be withdrawn for their raunchiness , including one two weeks ago by BOAC , the government airline . What was whispered about in one age or snickered at in another is now lustily shouted . <P> Real Change . Some of the bluntness is a reaction to the euphemisms with which the British gentility , whose conduct has always provided rich material for gossip and journalism , long shrouded matters sexual . But much of it is the result of a very real change in respectable middle-class morality , once considered a bastion against the sexual mores of both the upper and lower classes . Illegal abortions are estimated to be running between 100,000 and 200,000 annually ; divorce petitions have risen 50% in the last five years to some 42,000 a year ; illegitimate births have doubled in a decade and gone up to some 60,000 a year . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today there is less effort to conceal its causes . Lord Harewood , the 18th in line of succession to the throne , frequently appeared in public with a divorcee who bore him a son while he was still wed to his first wife . Queen Elizabeth , the temporal head of the Church of England , made a concession to the more relaxed morality by deciding to give him royal permission to marry the woman . Even Parliament now eagerly delves into areas that were formerly taboo . Three weeks ago , Commons passed a bill legalizing homosexual acts in private between consenting adults , and two weeks ago it followed that up with another bill liberalizing the grounds for abortion . Last week a government committee studying the question of lowering the age of majority from 21 to 18 years could not refrain from noting the sexual implications involved : the bill might , said the committee , by reducing the age of consent , " take the cartridge out of the shotgun marriage . " Said the Marquess of Salisbury recently : " Practices that a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society are now taken as a matter of course . "
