" Impossible ! " growled Andy Granatelli , the Illinois millionaire who developed the controversial turbine-powered car that came within a hair of winning this year 's Indianapolis 500 . ; " A terrible mistake ! " grumbled Parnelli Jones , the Californian who drove Granatelli 's flame-colored STP Special at Indy and was only eight miles from victory when a $6 ball bearing failed . What angered Granatelli and Jones was a regulation adopted by the U.S. Auto Club last week that sets new limits on the power of turbine engines - thereby banning the STP Special from Indy . <P> The U.S.A.C. ruling reduces the size of a turbine racer 's air intake from a maximum of 23 sq . in. to 15 sq . in . A 15-sq.in. intake would supply only enough air for a 480-h.p. turbine , while Granatelli 's Pratt &; Whitney aircraft turbine is rated at 550 h.p . The answer seems simple : replace the 550-h.p . <P> engine with a 480-h.p. engine . The catch is that no such engine exists . <P> Granatelli and Jones naturally branded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge with our car this year , " said Jones , " but it was n't that big an edge . " Not so , countered A. J. Foyt , who won this year 's 500 in a conven tional 550-h.p . Ford after Jones broke down . A.J. claimed that the STP Special had more horses than Granatelli or Jones admitted - perhaps as many as 700 . He may have a point . Turbines are notoriously affected by weather . On a hot day , a turbine engine may op erate at only 80% of its normal ef- ficiency . In cool weather , on the other hand , it may be 120% efficient , be cause cool air is richer in oxygen and nitrogen . And the temperature at Indy was an unseasonable 50.
