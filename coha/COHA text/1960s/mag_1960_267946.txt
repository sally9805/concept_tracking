" We felt that by scheduling the program the day after Thanksgiving , " said David Lowe , producer of last week 's " Harvest of Shame " on CBS Reports , " we could stress the fact that much of the food cooked for Thanksgiving throughout the country was picked by migratory workers . We hoped that the pictures of how these people live and work would shock the consciousness of the nation . " <P> When he started on the nine-month filming project that took him from Belle Glade , Fla. to Chenango County , N.Y. , Lowe found that " at first , the workers were embarrassed . Then one man spoke up : ' Are you with us or against us ? ' I said , ' I 'm with you , ' and they let us take their pictures . " The pictures he got included that of an unbowed 29-year-old Negro woman , a migrant laborer since she was eight , now the mother of 14 children but still working for $1 per ten-hour day . She was one of several million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose situation is self-perpetuating ; only one in 5,000 of their children finishes high school . Said Edward R. Murrow , roaming a field in a short-sleeved sports shirt and quoting one farmer , " We used to own our slaves ; now we just rent them . " <P> That line may have been overemotional , but the rest of the show invited emotion . The scattered , somewhat uncertain opening scenes were followed by startling juxtaposed flashes of irony . A flat-bed truck jammed with migrant families who were allowed to rest only every ten hours was compared to a cattle train , which by federal law has to stop for five of every 28 hours . A rat-infested hovel housing six was contrasted with a nearby $500,000 stable for race horses . And Murrow noted that while the Federal Government spends $6,500,000 annually to protect migratory wild life . Congress this year failed to appropriate $3,500,000 to educate migratory workers ' children . <P> What made the Lowe-Murrow hour a moving , muckraking masterpiece was the drumfire of interviews with Charles B. Shuman , president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Mitchell . While the verbose Shuman found himself becoming the program 's unwitting heavy as he painfully elaborated his foot-dragging conservatism , Mitchell emerged as an impassioned reformer . Extemporizing on " the shame of America " and the personal " blot on my conscience " he spoke bluntly of the power of the farm lobby and noted that what he called " the excluded Americans " had no voice in Congress , no organized force ( " The soil has produced no Samuel Gompers or John L. Lewis , " said Murrow ) . Mitchell 's final vow : " As a citizen , in or out of office , I propose to continue to raise my voice until the country recognizes that it has an obligation to do something for them .
