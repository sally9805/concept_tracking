txt In their sparsely furnished flat over Ziggy 's Golden Dome Bar , the Leroy Hosier family finds the going rough toward the end of every month . " Then we usually have to get along on boiled potatoes and beans until pay day , " says Mrs. Hosler . Her husband is a private first class in the U.S. Army , stationed at nearby Fort Sheridan . Like many a serviceman in the lower enlisted ranks , the lanky , 19-year-old vehicle mechanic supplements his meager army pay by holding an outside job . Even at that , his family lives dangerously close to the edge of poverty . The Hoslers and others like them inhabit , within the armed forces , an Appalachia of sorts ? bypassed by the rising national prosperity and untouched by the war on poverty . Though military pay increases Were put through in both 1963 and 1964 , the bulk of the boosts went to officers and higher ranking enlisted men : GI 's with less than two years service have n't received a raise since 1952 . Their growing dissatisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low rate of reenlistment . Proposal to Raise Pay Some help , however , is on the way ? though Congress and the President ca n't seem to agree on who should get the money and how much . The current Administration proposal to raise military pay calls for increases totaling S147 million a year , but enlisted men with less than two years service would get a basic pay increase of only 2.7% . Thus a recruit would get a raise of only $2.10 , bringing his monthly salary to $80.10 . Backed by some military leaders , Rep. L. Mendel Rivers ( D. , S.C. ) chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , has labeled the Johnson bill a " paltry " measure and has proposed his own . This would raise pay by $996 million a year  --  and give enlisted men with less than two years service increases ranging between 13% and 33% . The Rivers bill has already been approved by the committee by a 33-1 vote . In the Senate . Gaylord Nelson ( D. , Wis. ) has introduced a $690 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servicemen with less than two years service . including both officers and enlisted men . More than 30 other military pay bills have been introduced in Congress this year , and it is still uncertain which one will become law . For many an enlisted man , help ca n't come too soon . A recent Air Force survey reveals that 5,000 of its personnel have actually received relief benefits , while another 55,000 of the Air Force 's 719,000 enlisted men and women are technically eligible for certain kinds of welfare payments . An informal check of several Midwestern military bases suggests the predicament of lower-ranking enlisted men in other branches is just as serious . Subsidies , Surplus Food At Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis , Ind. , four soldiers receive state rent subsidies to enable them to afford adequate housing . In the Madison , Wis. , area , the families of some 15 servicemen are being provided with food by the U.S. Government under the surplus commodities program .. About 70% of the 600 enlisted men working at Fifth Army Headquarters in Chicago have outside jobs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Fort Sheridan . Pfc . Lyman C. Mulford , who is stationed there , observes : " If you 're in the lower ranks and married , you just have to have an outside job , or you 'll never be able to hack it . " Pfc . Mulford and his wife and new-born child now get about $230 a month in base pay and allowances , which he supplements with a $40-a-month job as a bartender in the Non-Commissioned Officers Club at Fort Sheridan . The Mulford savings account now stands at $30 and this will " probably have to be spent on baby stuff , " says the 22-year-old soldier . The Hosiers get a little more than $260 a month in pay and allowances , which adds up to slightly more than $3,000 a year ? the figure Federal poverty fighters cite as the minimum annual income needed to provide the necessities of life . Out of this , they must pay $125 for rent . $60 to $70 for food . $17.50 for payments on Pamela Hosler 's sewing machine , and $12 far gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major items . The Hosiers have two children and are expecting another in August . so Leroy now works nights and weekends delivering pizzas to help support his growing family . But the extra work makes normal family life impossible . " All he does at home is eat and sleep . " says Mrs. Hosier . Such extensive moonlighting often leaves military personnel too tired to perform their jobs for Uncle Sam with top efficiency . " They get off work here and go to other jobs till midnight ; the next day they 're only about 85% effective here , " comments a sergeant in charge of an office at Fifth Army headquarters . It 's difficult to directly equate military and civilian salaries because of the extra allowances and privileges given servicemen , such as free or nearly free medical and dental care and lower prices at post exchanges , commissaries , barber shops , golf courses , and movie theaters . But rising civilian incomes make such privileges less meaningful by comparison , and allowances for housing and other expenses do n't begin to offset costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , the Army transferred Pfc . Hosier from Fort Wayne in Detroit , to Fort Sheridan . As an enlisted man with less than four years service , he was allowed no compensation for moving his household . The Army paid only for his own transportation ? $16 worth . Housing allowances are criticized , too . Though the military provides some family quarters at or near its installations , there is n't enough space to house everyone and many personnel must live in private quarters off the post . Pfc . Henry Richardson and his family live in the cheapest apartment they could locate in Highland Park , Ill. , but it still costs $100 a month . This is roughly double the quarters allowance given him by the Army . Of course , barracks-room grousing about low pay is as old as the military itself . But the complaints have been louder and more frequent in recent years , and there is concern . in the Pentagon about poor recruiting and retention rates . In the first 10 months of fiscal 1985 there were only 242,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force , 28,000 fewer than in the same period the preceding year . In the first half of fiscal 1965 , re-enlistments by draftees were running at about a 10% rate ; this is up sharply from the extremely low 3.8% rate in all of fiscal 1954 , but is far below the 20.1% reenlistment rate in 1962 . To many a cynical career soldier , the recent flurry of concern for the fortunes of the lower ranks is long overdue  --  and is n't attributable solely to worries about declining enlistments . " Nobody got interested in this thing till Vietnam , " growls one sergeant . Rudyard Kipling had the same idea when he noted caustically how civilian attitudes toward the British soldier changed when war came . He wrote : " For it 's Tommy this an ' Tommy that an ' ' Chuck him out , the brute ! ' But it 's ' Savior of ' is country , ' when the Guns begin to shoot . . . "                @ @ @ @ @
