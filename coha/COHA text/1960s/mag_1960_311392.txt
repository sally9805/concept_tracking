Pablo Picasso once took a look at a 1907 photograph by Alfred Stieglitz and exclaimed , " That man is working in the same direction I am ! " Picasso spoke for the small group that had long realized that a great photographer is also a great artist . But one pesky question remains : Since even a bad or indifferent photographer-unlike a bad painter-can by accident produce a great picture , how much is art and how much is fortuitous subject matter ? Last week , in Manhattan , the question was noisily reopened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art 's exhibition of 176 photographs , a few of which are reproduced above and on the following color pages . <P> The exhibit bore the ambitious title of " Photography in the Fine Arts , " and was the brainchild of Ivan Dmitri , a onetime etcher who switched to commercial photography when etching lost to the camera in the 1930s . Dmitri decided that most museums would not bother with the serious photographer , and galleries were not interested in showing or selling his wares . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen out the best from the millions of pictures taken each year . <P> Kudos &; Kicks . Last summer Dmitri held his first show under what he considered promising conditions . With help from the Saturday Review , he campaigned to get amateur and professional photographers , libraries , camera associations , magazines , even advertising agencies to send him hundreds of their best pictures . He then got together a jury consisting not only of photographers , but also museum curators and art critics . Director James J. Rorimer of the Met Museum agreed to hang the final selections as works of art . When the show opened , it was an immediate hit with gallerygoers-but the more successful it became , the more bitterness it aroused among some professional cameramen . <P> The attack was led by famed 81-year-old Photographer Edward Steichen , who is also director of the photography department at Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art , which has been taking photographs seriously for nearly 30 years . The professionals claimed that they alone were qualified to judge their own work ; the way to stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them submit their best . The magazine Modern Photography published a biting attack on the Metropolitan 's exhibit under the title " The Day Photography Was Kicked in the Head . " <P> Cameras on Guns . This year 's Met show found tempers even higher . When Dmitri asked Steichen to serve on the 1960 jury , the old man contemptuously dismissed Dmitri as " the Sir Galahad of Photography , " denounced his campaign as " the most damaging thing that has ever happened to the art of photography " ; it was as if the Metropolitan " went to the sign painters ' union for its paintings . " Besides , said Steichen , getting to the nub of the controversy : How could anyone tell from one or two entries whether a photographer had been guided by art or accident ? " Some of the finest photographs of the last war were taken by automatic cameras mounted on the machine guns of our planes . "
