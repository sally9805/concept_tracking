" One who contemplates civil disobedience , " he said , " should not be surprised and must not be bitter if a criminal conviction ensues . It is part of the Gandhian tradition that the sincerity of the individual 's conscience presupposes that the law will punish this assertion of personal principle .

Speaking at the Syracuse University College of Law , Earl Morris , 59 , president of the American Bar Association , echoed Griswold as he said : " Many today seem to be demanding for themselves the unlimited right to disobey law .

In those actions of the early 1960s , said Griswold , " perhaps what mattered was not merely the moral fervor of the demonstrators , or the justice of their cause , but also the way in which they conducted themselves . " It was clear that neither he nor Morris thought that today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in evidence then .
