txt Here 's good news for all you long-suffering bus riders . A federal study on how to design a better " nonrail transit vehicle " ? in other words , a bus ? will soon be made public by the Department of Housing and Urban Development . Whether or not researchers of the National Academy of Sciences have found a way to make the nation 's 50,000 exhaust-fumespewers more sweet-smelling is still an unknown . But the academy 's report is expected to make practical suggestions of that sort ? including some for " creature comforts . " And Secretary of Transportation Alan S. Boyd has hinted at one idea the academy might endorse : a vehicle which can carry passengers during peak hours and cargo at other times . The Secretary points out that many airlines already use double-duty jets . He sees no reason why the same technique would n't work in a " nonrail transit vehicle . " President Johnson seems to be edging closer to support of Vice-President Hubert H. Humphrey without giving direct endorsement . Humphrey leaders here say they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give Robert F. Kennedy and Eugene J. McCarthy an underdog appeal . They are quite happy with the situation at present . Democratic regulars  --  the establishment  --  are aware of Mr. Johnson 's sympathies , they feel , without more being said . In New York , May 20 , Mr. Johnson attacked " despairing critics " who are , he said , " bad-mouthing our country all day long , all night long . " Who could he mean ? Well , Senator Kennedy has been a sharp critic . Mr. Humphrey , by contrast , has been taking a happy , optimistic view . Foreign aid officials are pleased at prospects for feeding the world 's hungry from the sea  --  literally . The Agency for International Development has just signed its first contract with a private firm to produce 2.5 million pounds of high-protein fish concentrate . The substance is equivalent in protein to milk , meat , eggs , and fresh fish . One-third of an ounce per day added to a child 's diet allows normal growth , tests in Chile and Peru show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cornmeal , and other basic foods . How and why ... Months after the departure of former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara , the obstacle system he envisioned south of the demilitarized zone in South Vietnam remains a taboo subject . Indications are that the so-called " McNamara line " has , however , had some measure of success . Very little of the line involves land cleared and mined in a conventional fashion . Less than 15 miles of territory , all near the coast , has been so treated . Farther inland , the line is more a maze of electronic devices and supersecret detection equipment . It is apparent that the line has not served particularly to hinder enemy movements . But the various devices have served on numerous occasions to alert United States forces to enemy movements . These enemy moves have frequently occasioned devastating bombing missions by American planes and interceptions by allied ground forces . The State Department has a red ring around June 4 . That 's the day it will ask Congress to kill the ASP . ASP stands for American Selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from selling as much of certain types of chemicals as it would like . It sets tariffs on chemical imports according to American va . ations ( which are high ) instead of foreign valuations ( which are low ) . At the " Kennedy round " negotiations in Geneva last year , American officials promised to end ASP . It was the only way they could get reciprocal tariff-lowering concessions from West Europeans . Now the House Ways and Means Committee takes up the issue in June . The American chemical industry wants it to refuse to give its consent . But State Department economic experts fee it is vital to do away with ASP to keep faith with Europeans who have agreed to historic tariff reduction in many fields . These experts fear that protectionist pressures , which are high in the United States now , could spread , force Congress to keep tariffs high , and lead other nations to block American goods . With . the United States balance of payments in trouble already , that would be bad news indeed .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
