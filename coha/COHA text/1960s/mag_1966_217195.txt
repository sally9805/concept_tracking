Ever since Bunker Hill , the man behind the man behind the gun has carried a Bible , comforted the wounded and prayed for the dead . Matching the U.S. military buildup in Viet Nam , the armed forces now have 274 chaplains on duty there and are steadily recruiting more . <P> Viet Nam is a new kind of war , and new also is the chaplain 's method of ministering to it . Since U.S. troops are so widely scattered , chaplains have be come airborne circuit riders . " It 's now a matter of riding helicopters and going where the troops are , " says Major General Charles E. Brown , a Methodist minister who is the Army 's top chaplain . " We used to hold three or four or maybe ten services a week . Now our chaplains are saying services in the combat area to at least ten and sometimes as many as 50 separate detachments of soldiers . " <P> Constant Fear . By no means does every soldier get to church on Sunday - nor do all of them want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute that old saw about there being no atheists in foxholes , " says Chaplain ( Major ) Frank Vavrin . Only about 17% of U.S. troops in Viet Nam regularly attend services on an average Sunday-35,000 men at 1,000 services . Chaplains estimate that more than 60% of the soldiers never go at all . One reason for the low attendance , suggests Air Force Captain Robert Cortez , is that the Viet Nam war is considerably less deadly than World War II , in which he saw combat duty in the Navy . Then , he says , " there was constant fear in so many cases-sitting all alone in a foxhole getting shelled , or on a rolling ship scanning the sky for kamikazes . The fear was there and it made you think of God . Here , relatively few guys are confronted with death every day . " <P> While most of the troops in Viet Nam may be indifferent to churchgoing , they nonetheless have a high respect for the churchmen who share the dangers of War with a quiet heroism that wins affection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh Lecky , 34 , a " helipadre " who last summer rode a chopper to Ba Gia , a remote outpost that was under Viet Cong attack . With a chaplain 's kit on his left hip and a medical corpsman 's bag on his right , Lecky ministered to a dying helicopter pilot , then turned to helping others-even though he was wounded by a mortar shell .
