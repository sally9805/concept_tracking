South Korea 's new military rulers are zealously puritanical men . Last week the generals issued a 74-point manifesto calling for " voluntary reform " of a whole host of questionable habits , ranging from failure to pay taxes to being late for appointments . <P> Korean women were advised not to wear jewelry , to " shun housemaids " and do their own housework , and to help " enlighten the public on the need for contraceptives . " Korean men got the word to " refrain from exchanging vain tokens , " to " avoid haggling over prices , " and " to shake off the idea of making ' quick money . ' " Both men and women were urged to greet each other each morning with the words " Let 's reconstruct ! " ( foreign residents , including U.S. troops , " will also be encouraged to exchange this greeting " ) . To keep Koreans on their toes , there will be daily " reconstruction calisthenics " and , just in case any feel downhearted , the " emotional aspects of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiCommunism , independence , brotherhood and reconstruction , which will be written and sung by all .
