THE WILL AND THE WAY @#  | rules is a wide-open game which features rugged tackling ( below the neck and above the knees ) , long and controlled drop-kicking and a spectacular specialty called " high marking " in which a player will leap way off the ground to catch a ball booted into his territory and the man covering him will try to get up even higher . If either succeeds in pulling the ball in on the fly and holding onto it , his team receives a free kick on the opponents ' goal from that spot . ONE OF the first facts anyone learns about Australia is that it is a large place with few people . The more you get to know about that remote continent the more you appreciate that there is no other fact ? except possibly its very isolation ? quite as significant as this odd disparity of 10 millions occupying a land about the size of the United States . There is plenty of room , about 3.5 people to the square mile ; in Europe there are 327 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be reflected in its sports , which it pursues with an almost vehement enthusiasm , it should come as no surprise to discover that Australian-rules football , the one new game the country has invented , is played on an oval field roughly 200 yards long by 150 yards wide , about twice the size of an American football gridiron . A cross between Gaelic football and Rugby , with some overtones of basketball ? the 18 players on a side are pitted in man-to-man duels ? Australian- Though you would expect it to be , Australian-rules football is not at present the national game . It is played mainly in the three states which front on the Southern Ocean : Western Australia , South Australia and Victoria , with Melbourne its hotbed . This undoubtedly goes a long way toward explaining why Sydney ( the capital of New South Wales , the most populous and influential state ) has stubbornly stuck with Rugby , for the two metropolises are intransigent rivals , and for Sydney to take up something Melbourne is famous f would amount not to adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian-rules sea brings on a rampant fever of inter comparable to our annual autu convulsion .

That 's where he got his nose banged up . It 's a very Australian game . MEMORY OF MATILDA Technically , my visit to the small continent this past autumn was my second . In 1943 , when my outfit was en route to China , the troopship anchored off Freemantle , the port for Perth , for three days , and we got ashore on two of them . I remember very little about that short stopover except that the Australian girls were as wholesome and unaloof as we had heard , and that a troupe of local en-  | tertainers put on a show at the dock climaxed by the inevitable rendering of Waltzing Matilda by the entire ensemble . This folk ballad , long a kind of unofficial national anthem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep , and today there are quite a number of Australians who are of the opinion that it should be played far less often , if at all . They contend the subject matter presents their country in an incorrect and unfavorable light . A far more self-critical people than is generally recognized , Australians admit that this sort of touchiness stems from a kind of national inferiority complex , which also prompts their predilection for knocking themselves good-humoredly and the relish some of them take in being conspicuously and audibly Australian when in strange locales thousands of miles from home . They also know that they are sometimes direct to the point of abrasiveness . Better than anyone else they un-@# @# derstand their ambivalent attitude toward Britain ? their resentment of anything smacking of stuffy colonialistic ritual and distinction , and , conversely , the honest sense of security they draw from their ties with the mother country . ( They are , for example , in no hurry to adopt an official national anthem of their own to replace God Save the Queen . ) They are modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the least , and are genuinely delighted when visitors comment , say , on their deep-going friendliness and their astonishing lack of all affectation , or when visitors simply remark that Australians today seem to lead a very good life . There are no two ways about this : they do . Nearly every family has a nice little home , standing on its own plot of land , usually with a small garden . Few people are rich by American standards , but then they do not have our extremes of poverty either . There are no slums as we know them . " The Australians did not play both ends against the middle , but they are in a position today where they enjoy the fruits of both socialism and capitalism , " Fred Hubbard , a wellinformed American journalist who has spent the last decade in Australia , has said . " On the one hand , one out of every four Australians works for the government , and legislation has provided the workingman with liberal sick leaves , long-service leaves , goodly pensions and a generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . On the other hand , one out of every four Australians now drives an auto and 60,000 are shareholders in the Broken Hill Proprietory Company , the vast steel combine . " MELBA , FLYNN AND KELLERMAN Culturally , to be sure , Australia has produced and offered little . One of the reasons why sport has always loomed so large is the limited means of other diversion : there are few theatrical productions or concerts , hardly any light or jazz music , a paucity of newspapers and lively periodicals . Nonsporting entertainment consists principally of going to English and American movies and watching television . ( A high proportion of the feature shows on television , incidentally , are kinescopes or tapes of American series , and if you have missed a few stirring chapters of such classics as the Bob Cummings Show or Sergeant Preston of the Yukon , this is the place to catch them . ) The young person of talent often must go abroad to realize it . Compared to the large number of Australian athletes who have earned worldwide reputations ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name as many as 20 ? few have gained a comparable renown in other fields . The same dinner table would probably come up with Nellie Melba , the opera star ; Henry Handel Richardson , the authoress ; Errol Flynn ( from Tasmania ) ; Percy Grainger , the composer ; Judith Anderson and Cyril Ritchard of the stage ; Annette Kellerman , who popularized the one-piece bathing suit ; Alan Moorehead , the writer ; maybe Ray Lawler , the author of that splendid play , Summer of the Seventeenth Doll ? but after this they would find the going hard . It is easy to understand why sport hE S traditionally been the area into continued SPORTS ILLUSTRATED May 23 , 1960 79 80 which Australia threw its interest and its heart . To begin with , the climate is ideal ? softly temperate , Californian , you might say , congenial to sports the year round . Moreover , if over the years Australians had few other riches , they enjoyed marvelous natural facilities for sports ? the sea was handy , the grass was hardy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cities , schools and clubs were quick to take advantage of the plenteous elbow room and set up first-class sports grounds . Australians had the time for sports , too , for they had never really bought the nose-to-the-grindstone philosophy and they worked at least as hard at sport as at their trades . In a country as young as Australia , where so much emphasis has traditionally been placed on physical activity , where sports-loving parents get up in the middle of a winter night and sit before fires to hear the shortwave broadcast of the Davis Cup matches from Forest Hills and the cricket test matches from Lords ( relayed from country to country by stations in the cricket belt of Pakistan , India , and Singapore ) , a boy is born and bred to sports . It is a sort of national ambition to become good at one of them . The youngsters get a big push in this direction at public school , for sports are a compulsory part of the curriculum . From the time he is about 8 , a boy attends sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , three hours each day of cricket in the summer and Rugby or Australianrules in the winter . The kids who do n't fit into these games are supervised in swimming and tennis . The whole enrollment , in short , participates in one sport or another . Interschool competition begins when the boys are 12 and 13 , and juniors who show promise early get an opportunity to find out how they stack up against the best from other sections . For instance , annual Australia-wide track and field championships for 12- , 14- , and 16-year-old age groups were inaugurated in 1951 and similar swimming championships the same year . " The size of our population , I think , has a lot to do with the keenness of our young athletes , " Peter Thomson , the golfer , has said . " Nothing helps you to climb a bit like a little success , and in Australia you can distinguish yourself without too much difficulty . You do n't have to make your way past so many others . To get to the top in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why , it must look insuperable to a young boy , way beyond him . " Aside from the abetment he receives at school the young Australian athlete gets enormous encouragement from his family . There are some " stage mothers " and " stage fathers " who push their kids , neurotically seeking to fulfill through them their own ambitions , but their number is small . Australians by and large are a people with a healthy outlook , and they are healthy parents . A HAND FOR THE HOADS In this connection I wonder if there ever were two parents more honestly helpful to an aspiring athlete than Alan and Bonnie Hoad were to their son , Lewis . Mr. Hoad has a feeling for sport , all right . In school he was a swimming and diving champion and , though a man of restricted means ? for 15 years he worked as an electrician for the Sydney Transport Department ? he found the time to be a first-rate ice hockey player , a good rifle shot , a three-mile racer with the Coogee Surf Club and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association . The wonder is that a sportssaturated man like Mr. Hoad and his wife named their first son not after an athlete but after Lewis Stone , an actor they admired . The best way , I am sure , to bring out the unbelievably close and salutary sports communion the Hoad family shared is to quote a sentence here and a sentence there from the early chapters of the autobiography Lew wrote shortly after winning his second Wimbledon championship and turning professional : " Because the war was on and there were few adults to play tennis with , my mother took up the game just to give me the opportunity to practice . ... Always scheming to help my tennis , he Dad took me to all the transport department courts to give me experience on as many different surfaces as possible . . . . He Dad built up a kayak to sail in the local storm-water canal and made the exercises we did at night fun instead of hard work . . . . Mum joined a few 80 SPORTS ILLUSTRATED May 2S , 1960 sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . . . . We b our own table-tennis table in club workshop , and my father ac as our coach . . . . My mother t me often to White City to watching names of tennis in action . . There was a time when I won final of a New South Wales h court title , and when I went ho and entered the kitchen I ask How 'd you go , Mum ? ' She smil and said , I won . How 'd you go ? ' AUSSIE GIRLS , NO LESS ENERGETIC Australians consider themselves ungifted at organization . When they speak of the 1956 Olympic Games at Melbourne , for example , their fondness for self-ribbing often leads them to make wry comments on the order of , " It was a miracle , you know , we ever got anything ready at all for the Games , but when they were actually held the same year they were scheduled for ? now , that was a shocker . " There may be some areas in which 41 ,  | The native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one N them . Take swimming . The New South Wales Australian Swimming Association , founded in 1889 , is now Romposed of 126 clubs with a total registered membership of 19 , 602 . New South Wales , to be certain , is the swimming center , but Victoria is not exactly unbuoyant , with its 13,000 registered club members , or Queensland with its 10,206 . Tennis , a workingman 's game in Australia , has inthe neighborhood of 300,000 registered tournament players and another 550,000 unregistered players ? in other words , about one out of every 12 Australians is enmeshed in it . The figures for golf are not nearly as overwhelming . Until recently it was hard for a youngster to gravitate to the game unless he was born into a well-to-do golf-playing family . Nevertheless , there are today some 1,000 golf clubs , counting the public courses , which cater to some 100,000 golfers . Golf in Australia , incidentally , is much less expensive than in any place except Scotland . You find the same pattern repeated in every sport : low cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 4,020 members , in New South Wales alone . There are 1,427 lawn bowling clubs , with 171 , - 687 members . And so on and on . Mateland is clubland . While visitors to Australia may be aghast at the extent of the compe- titions already on the schedule , the various sports organizations seem intensely devoted to enlarging their operations , almost as if they felt that a moment 's delinquence would put them a step behind a rival state or another game . An incisive example is the Lawn Tennis Association of Victoria , composed of 325 affiliated clubs and associations . In 1958 , feeling that they were not doing enough to promote junior tennis , the LTAV inaugurated the Schoolgirls ' and Schoolboys ' Championships for under-17 and under-19 players , plus some assorted junior-junior championships . The entrants numbered 1,745 , so apparently this tourney filled a need , for otherwise the state 's juniors have a chance to engage only in school matches and club matches , the Victoria championship ( on grass ) , the Victoria hardcourt championships , interstate team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LTAV 's 14 regions , some interassociation matches and either the Country Tennis Carnival at Kooyong ( for those who live in the country ) or the metropolitan winter pennant competition and Metropolitan Week at Kooyong . This , I believe , would cover most of the authorized competitions , except for the junior divisions of the other state championships and the national championships . Mr. R. N. Vroland , the incumbent president of the LTAV , likes to think his organization has a progressive point of view , and he feels a yawning gap in its promotional program was filled when during six months of 1959 it provided planned instruction by accredited coaches for 1,400 young players between the ages of 9 and 15 . Well , it 's a start . AN AMALGAM ? PLUS A fine climate , plenty of room , plenty of time , an inbred love of sports and the wish to excel at them , the lack of competing fields of interest , the worship of the physical idea which is part of a young country , the right pitch of support from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the relatively inexpensive cost of sport , the early orientation in school , the opportunity to develop in highly organized competitions ? and added to these , good food for growing bodies and the natural desire of the people of a small nation to do famously in fields which command international attention and respect ? these in combination are the amalgam which has made Australia the most vigorous sports country of all times . It does n't entirely explain , though , the emergence of its superathletes . If you add two other factors on which Australia places strong emphasis , it does . They are : extremely able coaching and plain hard work . These are more closely related than you might think at first . There are continued SPORTS ILLUSTRATED May 23 , 1960 81  | times when every athlete , even the most extraordinarily gifted , begins to question the whole damned exhausting business . More often than not , the person who helps him through the sloughs of despondency is his coach . The Australians , being an uncomplicated people , realize that the success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality fuses with his coach 's than on the latter 's skill as an instructor . The governing fathers in every sport may have their private ideas about which coaches are technically the best but , with the big picture in mind , they encourage their stars to go to whatever coach he or she enjoys working with . COACHES AND CONTROVERSY There are many exceedingly wellqualified coaches in every sport , but the best-known ? the ones whose pupils have made them renowned ? are Harry Hopman in tennis , Percy Cerutty and Franz Stampfl in track , Norman Von Nida in golf and Frank Guthrie , Harry Gallagher , Sam Herford , Forbes Carlile and Don Talbot in swimming . The most controversial is Cerutty , Herb Elliott 's coach , a garrulous , white-haired antitraditionalist whose novel ideas include training runs over the sand dunes near his home in Portsea and diets in which dried fruit , nuts and rolled oats figure prominently . Cerutty 's yen for selfadvertisement periodically gets out of hand , and there is no doubt that his interest in his charges can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over not only their athletic careers but their whole lives . With a wisdom far beyond his 22 years , Elliott has learned how to ride with Cerutty 's extravagances and sticks with them because he thinks Pere knows more about running than any person alive . He also likes him . In a land where everyone is an authority on tennis , Harry Hopman , naturally , has his detractors who question anything and everything he does , but most Australians have boundless faith in Harry . They should . Hopman was the coach of the team that in 1939 gained the Davis Cup for Australia after a 20-year hiatus . He was called back again in 1950 to restore Australia 's sagging fortunes and has succeeded so well that his teams have lost the cup but twice in the last decade . A superb technician , he is also a bug on physical condition . When he first saw Frank Sedgman in a coaching class at Kooyong in 1940 he sent the slender boy to a gymnasium to build himself up . When Hoad used to go for conditioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran with him . The era of the swimming coach , a big man in Australia today , began in 1946 , shortly after the idea of getting back into the competitive swim dawned concurrently on several of the sport 's leaders , most notably the late Professor Frank Cotton of the University of Sydney , who was investigating the physiology of muscular exercises , and Marsden Campbell , a former backstroke champion who advocated adopting the American methods of off-season body-building as espoused principally by Bob Kiphuth of Yale . By 1950 Australians were approaching swimming as a sport that had to be worked on hard the year round . In the off season the swimmer did his body-building exercises ? " Bob Kiphuth - may have really made a bigger contribution to Australian swimming than he has to American , " Syd Grange , the secretary of the New South Wales Amateur Swimming Association , has said ? and during the season he worked himself up to top form via eight weeks of prewater conditioning , six weeks of light preliminary workouts , eight weeks of intensified workouts and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his form . Now this is the kind of regimen from which a Spartan might turn with an airy wave of his hand and the excuse that he had changed his mind and was going in for darts instead . As for the Australian swimmers , there is not one who would n't long ago have become the victim of mental fatigue were it not for the companionship and understanding of his coach , an alter ego indeed . An extreme case but not an untypical one is that of Dawn Fraser , the world record holder in the 100-meter freestyle . When her coach , Harry Gallagher , took up a new position in Adelaide , Dawn , a Sydney girl , changed jobs and moved to Adelaide . She lives with the Gallaghers in their home , which is right beside the pool . While a certain individuality exists in the approaches of the several coaches and in the form of the van swimmers , there is , notwithstandi a definite Australian style . It have been best described in an formal comment which Bob Kiphu made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're swi ming just like we used to . " The e planation is quite interesting . Aft the 1924 Olympics , as was mention earlier , Australia stood still and t U.S. and Japan moved far ahead ' searching out new methods of body building and increasingly more refined techniques . By 1936 the Japanese . for example , were experimenting with delayed breathing and the intricate timing of the overtaking arm action an example of fortitude to countrymen . in the glide . " The Americans and Japanese overexperimented ? that was the rock they tripped on , " an Australian coach pointed out to me . " We avoided all of that simply by not being in the picture . When we returned to serious swimming just before the 1952 Olympics we were lucky enough to make two decisions that have turned out to be right . In bodybuilding we stressed a small number of exercises to develop gross power ? not flexibility : body-presses and work with the medicine ball and with the weights . Our other correct guess was in style . We stayed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant using fewer strokes than was the vogue and making them count more . In the 1956 Games , where many Japanese and American swimmers were taking 50 strokes to the lap , the Australians frequently averaged 41 . Murray Rose was swim- ming constantly under 40 . After they saw this , the Japanese coaches went back home and changed young Yamar.aka , who had their technique down to perfection , completely . When he trade his records this past year , Yamanaka was swimming 35 strokes a lap rich a wonderful Australian style . THE EXAMPLE OF LANDY The man who popularized hard work for swimmers , for runners , for everyone was Landy . Fate could have b .. - en kinder to John Landy . The dory of being the first man to break the four-minute barrier in the mile fell not to him but to Roger Bannister . Two weeks after Bannister ran his historic 3:59.4 at Oxford , Landy cracked this mark with 3:57.9 at Turku in Finland . In the Mile of the Century at Vancouver in 1954 the honors again went to Bannister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hobbled by inflamed tendons , he finished third on nerve alone after barely qualifying for the final . It is heart-warming to report that in his own country John Landy is not remembered as a man who was never quite first . He is admired perhaps more than any other athlete and , what is more , for the right reasons : for his unblinking sportsmanship at the bitterest moments , the modesty and honesty that characterized his conduct and the fact that he was one of the finest runners in history , a man who broke four minutes in the mile no less than six times . The Australian fans clearly understand ? and they might have missed this point since there is a side of the national character that is impatient with subtleties ? that if Landy was perhaps too mechanical a runner and lacked Bannister 's racing instincts , this was the unfortunate consequence of the absence of any countrymen who could give him any race at all during his formative years and his subsequent reliance on the stop watch as his opponent . They understand also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from placing his country above his own interests . After tremendous pressure had been put on him , he consented to publicize the Melbourne Games by going to the U.S. in the spring of 1956 ; here he ran two sub-four-minute miles within a week , and they proved  | to be his last great performances . As we have suggested , a large part of Landy 's contribution to Australian sport lay not in his performances but in the methods attending his development . In a country that had never before produced a middle-distance runner of any note , this intense young college boy set out to make himself into a " running animal . " He forced himself to the point of exhaustion in his daily workouts ; at one period , emphasizing interval-running , he ran as many as a dozen incredibly fast all-out quarters each afternoon . He learned en route that pushing one 's self past reasonably strenuous limits did not bring on staleness and that if an athlete stuck to a schedule over a long period the body would respond . His did . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entirely different pulse and heart beat and lung capacity than the average man . The point is this : if young Australian girls of 12 are nowadays swimming 12 miles a day , as the daughter of a Sydneyite friend of mine is doing , it all goes back to Landy , for although the heavy-training advocates in the other sports were arriving at these same conclusions independently , it was the great miler who dramatized for his countrymen the nature and extent of its value . REWARD OF RECOGNITION It only remains to be added , briefly , that the substantial recognition an exceptional athlete receives in Australia has something to do with there being so many . Jack Kramer 's candid remark about why he likes to visit there comes to mind : " You 're important in Australia in a way you like to be . " When Kramer walks down the street in an Australian city he is spotted by many passers-by and approached for a friendly chat by more than a few . In New York , when he emerges from his hotel , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sal Mineo should . come sweeping out of the revolving door right after him . As far as amateur athletes go ? the Australian definitions of amateurism vary with each sport ? only the tennis players are accorded liberal financial treatment . In professional sports only the top tennis pros and cricketers do well by our standards of payment and , interestingly enough , unless a golf pro is a Thomson or a Crampton , he actually makes less than a plumber . But above and beyond this , it pays in many indirect ways to be an athlete in Australia . If you make a name for yourself in sport , you enjoy a pleasant place in society , an agreeable life , and you will prosper commercially if you are normally industrious . Take the case of Frank Sedgman , one of the country 's most popular tennis stars . In 1952 , when Frank was teetering on the brink of turning professional , Australians contributed $13 , - 260 to a wedding-gift fund that would encourage him to remain an amateur for another season and so be eligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principally to purchase a gas station , which proved to be a good thing until the accelerated auto age resulted in a plethora of gas stations . He then sold this property . For a while Frank manufactured flavored straws ( called Sedgies ) , but now the bulk of his investment is in a gymnasium with squash courts in Melbourne . He is doing very nicely . Whither Australia and Australian sports ? I do n't think any punditry or pronouncements are called for . In one direction , as life becomes more autofied and Americanized , there are sure to be more and more Australians seeking their pleasure away from the arduous oval and court . And yet one knows that for a long time to come the national passion for sport will be at least what it is today . An everincreasing number of youngsters will continue to set their hearts on emulating their heroes , reacting as they do now to every excellent showing in a major event . Nor will the opportunities to do so diminish ? for this year 's Olympics , to give an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 144 athletes to Rome . Sport is in Australia 's blood , even deeper than it is in our own , deeper probably than it is in any other nation 's . It is as simple as that . ? In my mind , these several months after my return , there are a hundred and one small " set pieces , " sights and sounds which remain vivid and clear . May I give you just three . The first , in truth , is hardly that . Robert Gordon Menzies , the incumbent Prime Minister , spoke with memorable wit at the Canada Cup presentation ceremonies , but I pre- fer to present to you Menzies writer ; you will not come acre more evocative delineation of an lete than Mr. Menzies ' cameo of N man Brookes , the tennis player was Australia 's first great inte tional champion , which appeared an article for this magazine four s mers ago ( SI , Aug. 29 , 1955. " soon as he served , " so wrote Men " Brookes moved in .

His long trousers perfectly pressed , on his head a peaked tweed or cloth cap , on his face the inscrutable expression of a pale-faced Red Indian , no sign of sweat or bother , no temperamental outbursts , no word to say except an occasional well played .

I have sometimes suspected that a modern coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the astonishing elements that made him in his day ( and his day lasted for many years ) the greatest player in the world . " The second : John Landy , today a technical officer of the National Parks Authority , sits in the living room of his family 's airy home in Melbourne , across the way from Central Park , where he ran as a boy and still runs . As intent of eye as ever and extremely trim , there is about him his familiar thoughtfulness as he contributes a sentence or two here , a sentence or two there , to a conversation on track : " You were given legs to walk with and run with . You were given a good body and it 's got to be kept fit ... . Australian kids today are bigger and fuller . I do n't know if they 're as hardy . . . . The reason why we 've got @#  | those kids running at the Mountain School at Timber Top is they have an incentive .

Coaching to my mind is the ability to make a second-class athlete reach his full potential . . . . I 'm very fit , thanks , possibly because I 'm not running competitively any longer , just occasional jogs . " The third : Herb Elliott is riding into Melbourne University from his home in Clayton on his blue Japanese motorcycle . He had an auto but could n't afford to run it . As one watches him make his way through the hazardous highway traffic on his motorcycle , his legs hugging the metal frame , the feeling hits hard that there is something wrong about the world 's mile champion running such a risk . Elliott , however , appears oblivious to this , as honestly composed as he was at home earlier that morning when he spoke about the race in May 1958 at Santry outside Dublin , where he set the present mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Elliott said . " The Empire Games were over , so when I came to Ireland the tension was off . I liked the country atmosphere at the track . Trees grew all around it . That helped me to feel easy .

The track was a little damp , which was fine , of course . Well , the race got off . I start a race flat out and I try to go flat out all the way , so I never really know if I am running well until I hear the times at the half-mile . You hear them say 1:58 , or whatever it is .
