In New Hampshire 's frozen Lake Winnipesaukee region , a tall , stiff-spined farmer in high laced boots stood before the Meredith Village Savings Bank one morning last week and shook his head slowly . " I 've had so much information from so many candidates about what I should do , " said 70-year-old Jesse L. Ambrose , " that my bucolic mind is utterly confused . " <P> Only three weeks away , New Hampshire 's first-in-the-nation Republican presidential primary is indeed enough to befuddle almost any mind . For a while , it figured to be a two-man contest between Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller . From that it has turned into a scramble involving half a dozen big-name Republicans . <P> The ballot itself indicates the difficulties facing G.O.P. voters . It is a fearsome document , divided into five columns , containing some 125 names and running H ft. long . The fifth column is for the presidential and vice-presidential " popularity contest . " In it are listed the avowed candidates : Goldwater , Rockefeller , Maine 's Senator Margaret Chase Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably just to see their names in print : Norman Lepage , a Nashua accountant who also ran in the 1962 senatorial primary ; and Wayne Green of Peterborough , publisher of a ham radio magazine , who filed for Vice President . Unlisted , but with backers busily courting write-in votes , are Richard Nixon and U.S. Ambassador to South Viet Nam Henry Cabot Lodge . <P> For a state with only 14 delegates to the G.O.P. 's July convention ( out of 1,308 ) and four electoral votes ( out of 538 ) , the candidates are spending lavishly of their time , energy and money . By primary time , Rockefeller will have campaigned four full weeks in the state and Goldwater three . Nixon and Lodge plan no appearances , but their supporters are doling out good cash for expensive mailings and high-powered organizations in attempts to draw at least 10,000 write-in votes apiece , which they hope will establish them as possible compromise candidates in July . <P> Crowded House . New Hampshire has long since come to expect such serious efforts in its primaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though it is 45th among the states in population ( 606,921 ) , its 400-member house of representatives is the fourth-largest in the English-speaking world ( after Britain 's Upper and Lower Chambers and the U.S. House ) , giving a remarkable number of people a crack at active roles in politics . In a sense , the house perpetuates the New England town meeting , and in that sort of atmosphere even the most attractive candidates are hard put to get a bandwagon rolling . <P> Despite its 3-to-2 Republican edge and its reputation for old-fashioned conservatism , New Hampshire is not composed wholly of taciturn Yankee shopkeepers who spend winters around potbellied stoves , summers shooing away tourists , and election day pulling G.O.P. levers . Fed by waves of immigrants from Ireland , Central Europe and Canada , its population is 39.2% Catholic . One-sixth of its citizens are French Canadian , and there are communities where French is the first language , not English .
