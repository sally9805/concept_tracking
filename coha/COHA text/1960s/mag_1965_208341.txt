Too often , television seems esthetically a benighted land ; the networks may curse the darkness they have created , but they leave it to the independent and educational channels to light candles of culture . Two glowing examples from the current season : <P> &gt;The Esso Repertory Theater , a weekly , one-hour sampling of the U.S. 's flowering rep companies and the only major straight-drama series on TV . The 13 rep groups , winnowed from 22 auditioned by Producer David Susskind , stretch from Washington , D.C. , to the state of Washington , and their repertory has a still wider reach-from Euripides to Beckett . Last week the guest company was Chicago 's Hull House Theater , their offering was Harold Pinter 's demanding The Dumb Waiter . And their rendition ? So stunningly effective as to be worth the series ' syndication price alone. * <P> &gt;The Creative Person , a National Educational Television series aimed at elucidating the thesis : " The creative person has a special gift : his private vision of the world . " The cycle of half-hour programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NET channels , will eventually be carried by all 90 of them . The opener , " A James Thurber's-Eye View of Men , Women and Less Alarming Creatures , " was a resourceful , rousing revue adapted from the author 's work . This week 's show focuses fascinatingly on Household Poet-Critic John Ciardi ; among its vignettes : a sound track of the artist reading his own domestic verse ( " Men marry what they need , I marry you " ) , while the camera watches his wife pouring herself coffee in their Metuchen , N.J. , kitchen . Among future subjects : Painter Leonard Baskin , Indian Composer Ravi Shankar , Author P. G. Wodehouse , Film Maker Jean Renoir , and Metropolitan Opera Impresario Rudolf Bing . <P> <P> * The plays are viewable only on nine Atlantic Coast stations , although sponsors farther west may yet buy syndication rights , as they did with Esso 's earlier efforts , such as the Festival of Performing Arts series .                  @ @ @
