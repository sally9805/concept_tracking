txt Washington You 'd think spending $100 billion a year would be trouble enough for one man , but Budget Director Kermit Gordon is filling his normal 65-hour week with a lot more problems . Let 's list them : 1 . Dec. 2 to 20 is the climax of the preparation of next year 's budget  --  and he 's right in the middle of it . 2 . For reasons beyond normal understanding , Congress , for the first time in history , has passed , as this is written , less than half of the 12 big appropriation bills which it is required by law to pass by July 1 , save in " national emergencies . " ( How can you budget for next year if you do n't know what you 'll spend this year ? ) 3 . And smack in the center of that there 's a new President : Lyndon B. Johnson has thrown himself into the tragic situation with a firm energy that awes many , but after Oh well , Mr. Gordon is a vigorous youth of 47 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can fulfill the deadlines . All of which means that at the moment there 's that normal situation of organized chaos in Washington that attends the last phase of preparing the annual budget  --  a document that you can curl yourself up with on a winter 's evening with the same prospect of staying awake that you would have with the New York telephone book . Mr. Gordon has the happy knowledge that whatever he does will be wrong ? " too little spending , " snarl liberals ; " too much spending , " growl conservatives . A wistful look comes into his eye sometimes , as he thinks of Williamstown , Mass . There 's snow on the ground there now , skiing . . He might be back there , a former Rhodes Scholar , as professor of political science . He nearly made it , too . He had actually sent his charming wife and three children back home , after two years in the Council of Economic Advisers , when President Kennedy suddenly tagged him and said , in effect , " You 're it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there he was , Dec. 28 , 1962 , Budget Director . " But the job is whipping boy for the whole of Washington , " he may have thought . If he did he was right ; Senator Harry Flood Byrd ( D ) of Virginia , who has made a career of denouncing high federal spending , demanded his resignation almost before he got his chair warm . // U.S. Budget Director Slices Revenue Pie // This may have left certain marks on Mr. Gordon  --  a man with open face , and characteristic half smile and a gift of what one reporter described as " unorthodox , incisive , fast , pungent repartee . " In fact , all this leads naturally to what the Budget Director calls his " Baboonville file . " In his spare time , while toting up the billions , Mr. Gordon has now and then come across what he describes as " horror " stories representing what are billed as examples of wasteful , profligate government extravagance . Since it is his own job to sniff out such extravagance and normally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal agencies , Mr. Gordon takes a personal and sensitive interest in such reports . They crop tip everywhere , and since he assumes you ca n't spend $100 billion without some waste and duplication , he wants to know about them . Most of the reports , he says quite emphatically , are n't true . That leads to the " Baboonville file . " Here are some of the allegations , and his discoveries : Is the published charge true that . government officials in Kenya used foreign-aid money to purchase extra wives ? No , it is n't true . Did the government " buy suits for Greek undertakers ? " No. - Did the government contract to buy 1,000 TV sets , for $400 , - 000 , for use in underdeveloped countries where there is no electric power ? Yes , it is true . They were battery operated sets to be used in local villages for community education programs . An official who probably saw the late President Kennedy oftener than any other top adviser in Washington and who now is working closely with President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photographer stopped one of Mr. Gordon 's predecessors and commanded , " Say something , " the latter cheerily replied " Ten billions . " ) To the laymen few subjects might seem drearier than the process of preparing the nation 's annual budget . In point of fact , few people probably have the foggiest notion of how it is done . Actually , the huge document is a master chart in Washington of who gets what . The budget director and his agency are the eyes and ears of the President , with a finger in every pie . Like a farmer 's calendar , here 's the seasonal distribution of the work on the upcoming budget : Spring : Mr. Gordon asked federal agencies to submit 5-year programs of policies and plans . This was a preview . At a Cabinet meeting in May tentative targets were adopted . Summer : In August Mr. Gordon asked President Kennedy for over-all policy guidance for 1965 ( budgets go by " fiscal years , " this one from July 1 , 1964 , to June 30 , 1965 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. the " 1965 budget " ) . Mr. Kennedy set rigid and restrictive guidelines . Fall : Here Mr. Gordon got agency budget estimates and began fitting the mosaic to gether . Some agencies met guidelines ; others exceeded it . There were long , rueful conferences ; aided perhaps by Mr. Gordon 's humor . Winter : Now in November-December everything steps up ; each agency is told the budget figure that Mr. Gordon proposes to assign to it in his report to the President . The agencies have the right to appeal . President Johnson makes final decisions , Dec. 2-20 , i.e. , right now , he has a few more days ' leeway at the end , to take care of program changes . In January , Mr. Gordon 's experience shows , the annual cry rises about the huge size of the budget . No doubt of it , the budget is big . But the size , relative to gross national product , is declining . Cut the budget ? Not easy , when half of it goes to defense . Nor is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . Take mail deliveries : They will be 6 percent higher next year , the Post Office Department will need more carriers , and the budget will get an Upward nudge . Military spending , . space spending , and interest on the debt are all rising , and will probably go on rising for two or three years . The Budget Bureau has other aspects . Mr. Gordon will testify before Congress 8 or 10 times in 1964 ; he and his assistants must know the answers . The bureau coordinates legislation  --  if President Johnson wants a new agency or law , the cost of it must be fitted into the over-all budget . Again , budget experts are always examining , checking , investigating expenditures and considering management problems , all trying to ensure a dollar 's worth for a dollar spent . How big is the Budget Bureau ? A freshman congress- man , who personally surveyed the machine , later wrote the director that he had asked fellow congressman to guess the size of the staff . The smallest figure he got was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is 467 . This is odd , because in 1947 , with a budget of $39 billion , the bureau had 600 employees . ( In President Monroe 's day , Attorney General William Wirt got $3,000 for taking care of the government 's business from his private law office . He thought he deserved a raise , a clerk , and a nook somewhere in a government building ; he got it  --  and bureaucracy began . ) Finally , for all the jeers and sneers , Gladstone 's comment 100 years ago still holds true : " Budgets are not merely affairs of arithmetic , " he said , " but in a thousand ways go to the root of prosperity of individuals , the relation of classes , and the strength of kingdoms .
