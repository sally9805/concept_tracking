No sooner had the brand-new Congressman from the brand-new state arrived on Capitol Hill than he got some sage advice from a House veteran . Said Maryland Democrat Frederick Talbott to Arizona Democrat Carl Hayden : " Son , there are two kinds of Congressmen-show horses and work horses . If you want to get your name in the papers , be a show horse . But if you want to gain the respect of your colleagues , do n't do it . Be a work horse . " <P> Linking Two Frontiers . That was in February 1912 . This month , as Arizona celebrates its 50th anniversary as a state , Work Horse Hayden celebrates his 50th year in the U.S. Congress-an alltime record . A Senator for the last 35 years , he rarely speaks on the floor , avoids newsmen as if they were lepers , hardly ever appears in headlines . He is chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee and , as the Senate 's president pro tempore , third in succession to the presidency . Bald , stooped Carl Hayden , 84 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Frontier and the real one . <P> Hayden 's father was a Connecticut Yankee who came down with " lung fever , " headed West , took the Santa Fe Trail from Independence and finally settled in Arizona . There , on the Salt River , eight miles from a farm village that is now Phoenix , he built a flour mill , started a ferry , opened a general store , a blacksmith shop and a freighting business . Young Carl swam in the Salt River , rode a pet bull while driving cows , recalls seeing Apache fire signals burning at night on nearby Four Peaks . He went to Stanford in 1896 and , as a strapping 6-ft. 220-pounder , played center on the football team . In his senior year his father died , and Hayden left college without graduating to take over the family business . <P> Smiling Through Millions . In 1907 Hayden was elected sheriff of Maricopa County . Phoenix was then a raw town of 10,000 , its unpaved streets lined with saloons , gambling halls and brothels . Among Sheriff Hayden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Maricopa Reservation to wear pants , not breechclouts , while in town . Once , according to a story Hayden likes to tell , a group of churchwomen complained to him that an old Indian chief outside town had three wives ; they demanded that the sheriff do something about it . Hayden went to see the chief , explained : " Under the white man 's law you can only have one wife . Now you pick out the one wife you want to keep and then tell the other two that you do n't want them . " The chief sat in silence for a few minutes , then grunted : " You tell ' em . " Hayden knew when he was whipped ; he got on his horse and rode back to Phoenix .
