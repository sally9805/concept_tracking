 | Discovering a French Original His music ? known in this country mostly for one riotous showpiece ? is above all representative of " French taste " and can now be listened to on records for many happy hours . A short time ago , Vox Records issued a three-disc set containing the complete piano music of Emmanuel Chabrier ( VBX 400 , mono ; SVBX 5400 , stereo ) , and I have since then spent many happy hours with the album , listening to the music with pleasure and thinking about the remarkable composer who was responsible for it . In America we do not hear much of Chabrier . Indeed , about the only piece that turns up with any regularity is his Espana , that riotous showpiece favored by conductors of pop concerts . And , indeed , Chabrier composed very little . But almost every piece he did write has something special . More than that , though . As an influence on French music , Chabrier had much more importance than is generally recognized . Most history books , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six , the new school after World War I headed by Milhaud , Honegger , and Poulenc . But , as one listens to these Chabrier piano pieces , it becomes clear that Chabrier was , much more than Satie , writing a Les Six kind of music as early as the 1880s . There is much more Chabrier in Poulenc than there is Satie . Emmanuel Chabrier was born in 1841 , died in 1894 , and had a creative career of only twelve years . He studied law and joined the French civil service in 1862 , becoming a functionary in the Ministry of the Interior . He had loved music from the beginning , and his parents , solid middle-class bourgeois types , encouraged that love and his unusual ability at the piano until he began to get ideas about makHarper 's Magazine , September 1966 ing music his life 's work . Then there were tears and opposition . Chabrier dutifully responded to his parents ' wishes , working for the government and picking up whatever musical instruction he could on the side . Not until 1879 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted . The lever was Wagner . Henri Duparc , that composer of about a dozen great songs and nothing else , talked Chabrier into making a trip to Munich to hear Tristan and Isolde . Chabrier was overwhelmed , and when he returned he sent in his resignation . It was accepted in 1880 . But he had been moving in musical circles long before that . Early in the 1870s he was close friends with all of the leading French composers , especially the avant-garde ones . Chabrier was a natural avant-gardist . His closest friends were Verlaine and Manet ( by the time Chabrier died he had a brilliant collection of Impressionistic art , including many Manet canvases ) . In 1875 he joined the Societe Nationale de Musique , where his colleagues were Saint-Saens , Duparc , Chausson , Faure , Lalo , d'Indy , and everybody who counted in the new French school . He also started composing in the middle 1870s , and one of his earliest works was an operetta named L'Etoile . There used to be a recording of this , made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed where Chabrier was heading , and it is a remarkable score . In its humor , sophis- tication , creative harmonies , and : melodic style , it is unparalleled ' . . French music . " Sophistication " probably the key word . The music representative of everything pop : : - larly conceived as " French taste . " The score is highly spiced , highly clan - matic , has some peculiar dissonances. and moves with the original kind of charm that was Chabrier 's particular contribution . It is a lightweight score but a masterpiece of its kind , to be surpassed only by his own Le Roi malgre lui ( 1887 ) . His major serious opera is Gwendoline , which is supposed to be heavily Wagnerian . Balanchine has used sections of Gwendoliri ? ( along with other Chabrier music for his ballet Bourree fantasque . What Is Melodic Power ' Chabrier composed piano musk through the greater part of his life . His earlier pieces are unimportant . and not until the ten Pieces pittoresques did he arrive at his mature style . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bourree fantasq/if ( 1891 ) , and the Cinq morceaux ( published posthumously but probably composed in the middle 1880s ) are his major pianistic contributions . Best of all probably are the Trois valses romantiques for two pianos : glittering , pianistically ingenious , the kind of apotheosis that Ravel 's La Valse was to be . Its charm is hard to describe in words . Chabrier 's piano style is very rich without being empty . There is plenty of decoration but all the decoration , as in Chopin and Faure , is functional , meaning that the music never stops to deliver an empty cadenza . The melodies are simply unforgettable . One test of melodic power is its ability to remain fresh , and Chabrier triumphantly comes through the test . The melodies of the three Romantic Waltzes stick in the head and never become cloying . Another unforgettable bit is the very ending , where Chabrier wrote down a sequence of blues chords ? in 1883 ' One can mentally hear a New Orleans trumpet : waah , waah , waah , waah . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a long melodic effusion , Idylle , suggesting nothing so much as Poulenc 's Adagietto from Les Biches . There is a gay , coruscating example of waltz writing , the Scherzo-Valse . There is a  | musical equivalent of a Manet outdoors scene in Sous-boil . Each of the ten pieces has something different to say , and each of them is permeated with the unmistakable Chabrier style . The man was a true original , and it is only necessary to hear ten bars of any of his music to know that only he could have composed it . One of his tricks is rhythmic . The Tourbillon is written in time , but the inner pulse of the beat is completely irregular , and Chabrier might as well have done away with bar lines . The Cinq morceaux are very much in the style of the Pieces pittoresques ? equally sophisticated , equally inventive . Chabrier himself called the set " music of today and tomorrow , certainly not of yesterday . " His most popular piano piece , one which still occasionally turns up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubinstein ) is the long Bourree fantasque , a whirligig , a capricious bundle of interrelated ideas , with more harmonic innovations than can be found in the complete operas of Ambroise Thomas and Charles Gounod rolled together . An oddity is the fourhand Souvenirs de Munich , in which Chabrier , half lovingly , half jestingly , composed a set of five quadrilles on themes from Tristan and Isolde . In this Vox album the pianist is Rena Kyriakou , assisted by Walter Klien in the works for two pianos piano duet . She is a Greek who as has not appeared in the United S ' Obviously a good technician , she in a clear-cut manner , with plenty of rhythmic drive . What she laLi ; s color and sophistication . Chabrier ten used , purposely , light mate music-hall tunes , quadrilles , and dance forms , just as Poulenc and haud were to do many years later Kyriakou has a tendency to play t with a seriousness that suggests is playing the Hammerklavier So To do full justice to this music , a imaginative stylist is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has been admirable recorded sound , espec lifelike ( and in the stereo version two pianos have complete separation a most exciting effect ) . In any this is the only available perform of Chabrier 's piano music . There to be a pair of Westminster discs voted to Chabrier ? the Pieces pittoresques and a few other things those have long been withdrawn . since they were not appreciably - than the new album , there is no to try to unearth them . The pr three discs will serve to introduce American listeners one of the unique figures in music , a minor ma whose music remains fresh , vital . utterly original . @#
