Going to bed in Japan these days often requires a good night 's sleep in advance . No more can the weary traveler anticipate curling up on the traditional straw mat , bundled between layers of silken spreads-or even on a regular bed , which is still rare in Japan . Instead , he is likely to find himself a helpless passenger aboard a vehicle that sways from side to side , swoops abruptly to the ceiling , or flips up and down in three-quarter time . For a beddo only sounds like a bed . In fact , it is an electronic adventure . <P> The Japanese yen for " play beds " started slowly enough . First there were the " come-come " models-twins that shot together at the flick of a button . Soon came the " miracle series , " or circular double beds , each installed on a turntable on the floor and surrounded by such inbred in-bed necessities as a TV set , refrigerator , hi-fi and completely stocked bar . Only a handful of fun-loving householders could afford a price range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels in the countryside snapped up the beddos . Hotel guests were only too delighted to spend $2.70 ( for one hour ) or $10 ( for the night ) for the chance to join a uniquely Japanese movement . <P> Now there is the Pegasus , a double bed that climbs three feet up and down ; the Seesaw , which makes the bedroom a playground ; and the Seesaw Pony , which not only teeters but simultaneously flips a center section up and down . There is an Apollo series , double beds with built-in hi-fi and lighting system designed to create a " mesmerizing bedroom mood , " and the Fantasia series , which throws in a movie projector and screen as well . <P> Greater Bliss . " What 's the fun of hopping into beds for the same eternal routines ? " asks Buntaro Nagasaka , manager of the Hotel New Japan in Kobe . " We provide our patrons with something new and exciting in beds to help trigger a greater bliss for them . " The most sensational trigger : a double bed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling . Another , simpler model features a mirror that drops suddenly to a position only four feet over the bed . Explains Manager Nagasaka : " Shocked and terrified , your partner is bound to grab hold of you . " <P> Adds Mr. Nagasaka : " We dress the Western way , we eat Western foods , we work in Western milieus , and we even dance gogo . The trend toward Westernization has at long last begun making us sleep the Western way . "
