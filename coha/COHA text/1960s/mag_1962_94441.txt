While there was very little of lasting interest about an editorial in the Birmingham Age-Herald endorsing the presidential candidacy of James M. Cox one fall day in 1920 , the newspaper 's words had a galvanic effect upon an Alabama shopkeeper named Julius Allen Israel . " I remember that as I heard the words my hair stood up on end , " Israel takes pleasure in relating today , " and goose bumps popped up all over my body . " To appreciate the man 's agitation , it is necessary to know that Israel was being read to at the time by his son Melvin , a little fellow not yet a month enrolled in the first grade . The revelation that the child could read the Birmingham papers , let alone the ponderous editorial pages , was an eye-opening experience from which the father has not yet completely recovered . " I had known all along that Melvin was brighter than most , " says Israel with paternal candor , " but he 'd never let on just how smart he really was . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Modest he still is  --  he has not forgotten how to blush and , when asked for his autograph , never fails to say , " Thank you "  --  but quiet he is not , for the boy Melvin Israel has since grown up to become the man Mel Allen . As such he is the most successful , best known , highest paid , most voluble figure in sportscasting , and one of the bigger names in broadcasting generally . In New York City , his base of operations , Mel Allen has a following that only a politician , which Allen in some ways is , could love . There are people to whom his voice is a comfort , his handshake a benediction , his autograph an heirloom . " Write ' Good luck , George ' and sign your name , " a man named George demanded of Allen not long ago , and a bartender insisted that Mel sign a $5 bill . " This is illegal , " said Allen , scribbling away . // " For this , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // To such a weird and wonderful estate , which over the last dozen years has annually paid him more than $100,000 , most of it already spent , Mel Allen has risen on the strength of an indefatigable , hinged-in-the-middle tongue , an unsurpassed knowledge of and almost mystical involvement in sports . Riding the pinstriped coattails of his employers for the last two decades , the New York Yankees , has helped . Moreover , he has merrily made his way to the top of a field of limited opportunities without deceit , without guile , without cynicism and without , it would seem , half trying , fame having stalked him more than the other way around . His formula has been simply an open-faced and honest ambition to fulfill himself and to believe in himself . // Since self-satisfaction has always eluded Mel Allen , he sits today uncomfortable in his eminence , wondering what it amounts to and knowing at the same time that , whatever its worth , he has , in the words of a friend , " only one direction left  --  down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along by loneliness that befalls him as a 49-year-old bachelor hopelessly embroiled in his job  --  Allen is a tireless worker , driving himself to accept as many obligations , commitments and duties as daylight and dark will allow and , like a tightrope walker , resisting the impulse to look beneath him . " He has so many things going for him , " says fellow sports-caster Joe Garagiola , " that if he ever got the flu he 'd be a one-man Depression . " And one of Allen 's favorite stories , one of the thousands he knows and cherishes , takes on the flavor of a morality play when he tells it . The story concerns a onetime major league pitcher named Bobo Holloman who had the bad luck to pitch a no-hitter for the St. Louis Browns on his very first start in the majors . By the end of the season they were saying , " Bobo ? Bobo who ? " // Bobo 's flaw , says Allen , was a sore arm and serenity , and while a sore throat may now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes before his fall . Attaching a peculiarly negative significance to the mark he has made , he lost his once abiding respect for Who 's Who in America , he says without coyness , when it requested his biography 10 years ago . Allen frankly protests that " if the New York Yankees had been an eighth-place team all the time I 'd been with them I 'd be an eighth-place announcer . " Since the Yankees have done very well altogether during the 21 years , so has their official spokesman . Yet Allen , like a spinster with a rich daddy and a poor boy friend , wonders bleakly how much he is liked for himself and how much for his association with affluence . Says Julius Israel : " What Mel needs is the swelled head he deserves . " // Whether or not Allen 's popularity is as mercurial and subject to whim as he supposes , it is sufficient nowadays to keep him occupied on radio , television and motion picture film 600 hours each year , pitching athletic sweat , beer , smokes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lip balm . More than half of that time , of course , is devoted to Allen 's folksy , garrulous descriptions of 162 Yankee ball games , while most of the remainder is parceled out to the World Series broadcasts , college football and Rose Bowl games , a three-hour , $3-a-minute segment of NBC Radio 's Monitor on Saturday mornings and baseball All-Star games ( his 23rd comes up next Tuesday ) . // Twice each week he lends his voice to the soundtrack of Fox Movietone sports newsreels . To earn his $12,000-a-year salary for that job , Allen is obliged to write as well as talk the scripts . He does both after a quick look at the film , with speed and efficiency , having a practiced ear for the catchy , punny phrasing that is the pattern of most newsreel features . ( " The hull thing makes a fellow keel over from sheer delight , " he wrote shamelessly for a girlie documentation of New York 's winter boat show . ) Somehow Allen has enough energy left over to write an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine and to work away , somewhat desultorily , at his second book , which , like his first , will be a collection of uplifting sports stories . With so many demands on his reportorial sense , it is no wonder that his capacities are sometimes taxed to the limit , as they were several years ago when he tried his hand at song lyrics . " Let 's play ball , play ball , you all , " his song began  --  and went downhill from there . // Happy in his work , Mel Allen is likewise happy in his relative leisure , liking nothing better than to fill it by making speeches  --  which he makes often for free and always at the drop of the invitations that come in daily . His format , by and large , is the presentation of sports stories  --  straight-from-the shoulder , sometimes gamy stories for adults , inspirational stories for youngsters . He even makes speeches when no one has asked him to , in bars , on street corners , wherever there is an attentive  --  or captive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to the modern world who has had his day in a major league ball park , in this case Mel Allen Day in Yankee Stadium in 1950 , when he received clothes , a Cadillac and $10,000  --  which he in turn gave to Columbia and the University of Alabama for scholarships . He is certainly one of the few broadcasters who can draw better crowds leaving a stadium than many ballplayers , and is one of the few whom young boys and old women alike have smothered to the sidewalk in excessive shows of partiality . And while it is not a unique experience among radio and TV personalities , it is encouraging to Allen 's frangible vanity that some of his mail still contains endearments of the " Dear little of celebrity , You do n't know me , but ... " kind . // To offset such effusions , Allen has a solid corps of detractors , too , one of whose doughtiest said gleefully not long ago : " Mel Allen talks more than a magpie  --  which is n't saying much . " More specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point or overwork a pet phrase ( " How about that ? " ) , that his voice , deep , rich and mellow as it is , has an irritating edge on it , and that his stilled but not fully hidden enthusiasm when the Yankees are winning violates his rights to the air waves . Sober , industrious and otherwise well-adjusted men have been known to fall into gargling , sputtering rages as , sitting helplessly before their TV sets , they feel themselves assaulted by Allen 's tedious , drawn-out explanations ( " For the benefit of those not so familiar with the game , the infield fly rule states that , with first and second base or first , second and third occupied and less than two out , a ball which in the judgment of the umpire , " etc .. etc. ) , by his excessively elated descriptions of everyday Yankee catches , by his strangling compulsion to qualify , modify and amplify nearly every general truth he utters . " International Falls is the coldest spot in the U.S. , " he said on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And because New York teems with people who love baseball but refuse to pledge allegiance to the Yankee pennant , Allen 's " objective but pro-Yankee " broadcasts can turn a ruly roomful of people into a hating , shouting , blaspheming mob . " In New York , Mel 's like the drinking friend who takes home the town drunk , " says Lindsey Nelson , a fellow sportscaster and a friend of Allen . " Since the anti-Yankees are n't able to change the team , they hit the nearest thing  --  Mel Allen  --  with a rolling pin . " Says Raconteur Tex O'Rourke : " Mel is Alabama 's answer to Tennyson 's babbling brook . " // After winning a radio-TV " best sports-caster " award in 1952 , Allen 's first reaction was to say , " It 's nice , but what if I do n't win it next year ? " The fact is , he 's won it , wonderingly , every year since . He can no more understand this unqualified praise than he can understand the ire and vitriol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and restraint in replying to both . If accused of favoring the Yankees , for instance , he answers that his technique is one he has carefully considered for many years , and he would do as much for anyone he worked for . If he is accused of being unfavorable to the opposite team , he bridles and denies it . " You listen , " he will say , proudly professional . " I call a Colavito home run the same as I call a Mantle home run . The guy who does n't think so did n't want Mantle to hit that home run in the first place . " Only when accused of talking too much does Allen admit that perhaps he has a problem . " Somewhere , " he says , " there must be a middle ground : enough explanation for those who do n't understand the game and not too much for those who do . If I do n't qualify everything I say , here come the letters . I have lain awake nights wondering where that happy medium is . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , as it turns out , is still this side of prolixity . Phrases like , " That brought the crowd to its collective feet , " and , " There 's no room for margin of error , " will suggest why . Like most people who talk a lot , Allen exposes himself to easy ridicule . The New York Times once characterized him as a connoisseur of the obvious on the clich ? matinee . A quotation the late John Lardner once attributed to Allen  --  and it sounds more like Allen than Lardner  --  found him in one of his typical **43;223;TOOLONG situations ( a result , says Allen , who happens to be a law graduate , of his legal training ) . Lardner 's quote , picked from a game several years back , went like this : " By sending Mize to the bat rack , Stengel may have kept Boudreau from replacing Brown , because  --  You see , Collins is a left-handed hitter  --  Well , we 've got a right-handed pitcher in there now , but if Boudreau had called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left-handed hitter , too . But what this might mean  --  Well , of course , it may mean nothing at all . " // Sometimes Allen joins the Allen critics . " When somebody tells me I 've done a good job making a bad ball game sound good , " he says , " I know I 've failed some way . They mean it as a compliment , but it 's really a criticism . I never try to inflate a game . Instead I try to ride it like a boat on waves , and to make it sound like no more than it is . My job is reporting , not making up a press agent 's release . " Like any reporter , he sometimes fails on his face . Afterward he will brood about these gaffes for years . His worst mistake to date occurred in the seventh game of the 1960 World Series , when he prematurely blurted , " It 's going foul , " on a three-run homer by Yogi Berra . Stung by the recollection still , he takes some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it the biggest boner " since Clem McCarthy 's historic miscall of the 1947 Kentucky Derby . " // " That , " says Allen with relish , " was their biggest boner since Clem McCarthy 's historic miscall of the 1947 Preakness. " // Because he is usually sitting behind a microphone , Allen is pictured by most people as a short and dumpy man . He is not . Unbent , he stands taller than six feet , weighs about 200 and wraps his large , bearish frame in loose-fitting casual jackets and slacks . Like his father and his brother , he is balding , but unlike them he disguises the truth with a hairpiece . He has heavy features , translucent blue-gray eyes and is handsome in an aging way . He looked like a cupid when he was born on St. Valentine 's Day in 1913. // Mel Allen 's grandfather , William Israel , was a Russian Jew who came to the U.S. when he was 35 , settled in West Blockton , Ala. , where he ran a dry goods store and raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julius Allen , Mel 's father , remembers West Blockton as a tough mining town , and the meanest man around was an outlaw lyrically named Bart Thrasher . Julius Israel also remembers his father as a stern patriarch unfavorably disposed toward boyhood idleness and particularly inimical to baseball , since it interfered with Julius ' chores . " How do you reckon he would like it if he knew his grandsons were making their living just looking at baseball games ? " says Julius delightedly . " Ho ! " Julius ' other son , Larry , is a statistician and spotter on Mel 's staff . // Mel Allen 's mother , Anna Leibovitz , the daughter of a cantor , was born in Russia and came to this country when she was 9 . She married Israel in 1912 and , by the time Melvin was born , Julius was well established in the dry goods business in Johns , Ala. , a small mining town 30 miles southwest of Birmingham . Continuing to prosper , Julius moved his business and his family first to Sylacauga , Ala. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he opened a ladies ' ready-to-wear shop . It was in Bessemer that young Melvin began flabbergasting his elders by reading the papers , particularly the sports pages , and by reciting , at the slightest provocation , current batting averages , RBIs and ERAs of popular major league players . // Hit hard by the postwar depression , Bessemer 's economy collapsed , and so did Julius Israel 's business . In 1922 he moved it to Cordova , Ala. , where things went sour again . The Ku Klux Klan , a phoenix in a dirty bed sheet , was re-emerging at about that time , and high on the Klan 's list of un-American activities was being Jewish . Cordova 's citizens began to boycott the Israel store , and before long , the $20.000 Israel had salvaged from his Bessemer operation was gone and , in declining health , he turned to selling shirts on the road . Bitter as Allen 's mother is about Cordova 's Klan , she can not forget a second disappointment that took place there . Her ambitions that Melvin should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off his left forefinger while paring a peach . // By the time Julius Israel moved the family to Greensboro , N.C. the siren call of a career in major league baseball had become a real and vital thing to Melvin , age 11 , and he got a job as bat boy with the Greensboro Patriots . Already beginning to spread his time thin , he also delivered dry cleaning on roller skates and spent Saturday afternoons at the corner cigar store posting baseball scores on a blackboard . " Always it was baseball this or that , " Anna Israel recalls . " There was never the time to study his school-books or his music lesson Mel was now supposed to become a concert cornettist . One day  --  it was a beautiful sun-shining day just like I prophesied  --  I see the school principal coming up the walk . My God , he 's been expelled , I thought . My God , let me fall down dead on this spot and I will welcome it , I thought . " The principal had come not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that the boy had been selected by the Civitans to serve in Raleigh as North Carolina 's lieutenant governor for one day . It was an occasion that comes back vividly to Mel Allen . He was introduced that day in round-eyed wonder to the Tar Heel electric chair . // Two years later Julius Israel moved his family again  --  this time to Birmingham  --  and there Melvin finished high school , dated the prettiest girl on the block and enrolled in the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa . He was only 15 years old and , because of his precocity , they called him Skyrocket . To save the expense of putting him up in a dormitory , the Israel family moved to Tuscaloosa , too . " About all I was able to afford was a roof over his head , " says Julius Israel . // Characteristically , Mel Israel spent little time under that roof . Tall , skinny and physically immature , he was cut quickly from the varsity baseball team . He turned instead to intramural baseball , to writing sports for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary , to his books . To help his father meet expenses , he worked Saturday in Brown 's Dollar Store selling shoes . After a good day he would take five of Brown 's dollars home . // By the time he was a senior , Mel had entered law school , was teaching a class in speech and was sports editor of both the student paper and the annual . He was also earning his varsity A as student manager of the baseball team , working as sports stringer for out-of-town Alabama papers , writing scripts for the football coaches ' radio show , playing sandlot baseball and announcing downs and yards to go on the P.A. system at Alabama football games . One fall afternoon in 1935 the late Frank Thomas , the football coach , got a call from a Birmingham radio station . It had suddenly lost its sportscaster for Alabama and Auburn football games . Did Thomas have any suggestions ? Sure he did . Mel Israel . // " I was n't really interested , " says Allen now , " but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To see that he did , Allen prepared for his audition by boning up on an earlier Rose Bowl game that he had n't seen , and came to the station to deliver a stirring account of how Alabama tied the score against Stanford in the last minutes . Charmed as much by Allen 's account as by the recollection of that happy day in Pasadena , the station manager hired him . // Allen was already in his third year of law school , and he took his broadcasting job so lightly that in one early game he lost track of a down . To square himself with the scoreboard he squeezed in a line buck for no gain while Alabama was still in its huddle . Nevertheless , he got the job again the next season , but was unavailable the one after that . He was busy instead on the CBS network . The following fall he called the first baseball games he 'd ever seen from a broadcasting booth : the 1938 World Series . // As he had done in Birmingham , Allen got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a skylarking Christmas vacation , he strolled into the CBS studio one evening to see a program being broadcast . He mentioned his association with the CBS affiliate in Birmingham to a night supervisor , and for no better reason than curiosity let himself be induced to audition . The next question he heard was , " When can you start ? " // " Gosh damn , " says Allen , using one of his wild expressions ( others are " dad gummit " and " jiminy cricket " ) . " I like to fell over when they said that . I did n't want to start anytime , I told them . I was a graduate lawyer , ready to start my practice most any day . And besides , I had a job teaching speech at the university and getting $1,800 . So they said , $45 a week , think it over . " // Mel thought it over when he got home . " I told him it was plain foolishness for a boy to go all the way through law school just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I told him if he went he 'd never come back . " Neither was the elder Israel friendly to the network 's suggestion that Mel change his name for , as they put it , a more euphonious sound and one not so  --  uh  --  inclusive of all the tribes . Mel answered his father that , well , he meant only to go on for a year . The experience would broaden him , he said , give him a bigger outlook on things . Oh , let the boy go , Mel 's mother put in . What did it matter what he did for one year , and what did it matter what he called himself for that time ? Call yourself Morgan Hall , a solicitous friend suggested , thinking of a euphoniously named building on the university campus . Or call yourself Mel Thomas , suggested Frank Thomas . So Melvin Israel , who has always liked travel and mellifluousness , packed his bags , borrowed his father 's middle name and went north . He honestly meant to be home 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mel Allen began broadening his outlook by getting up in time to open the network at 6 a.m. , introducing to the stirring nation organ stylings on the Mighty Wurlitzer . Three weeks later he was assigned to a sponsored nighttime show ( his salary spurted up to $95 a week ) , and a couple of months after that he broke into sports . // A prerequisite for sports announcers is an ability to carry things along without benefit of script , and Allen demonstrated an unapproachable talent for that on his first assignment . In a day when networks pirated events from one another , CBS sent Allen aloft in a DC-3 to describe a Vanderbilt Cup race on Long Island ( NBC had hoped for exclusive ground-based coverage ) . Circling over the course , Allen was obliged to talk for 52 minutes , describing nothing at all because the race was being delayed by a rain shower . The race never did get away , but from then on Mel Allen 's career in sports announcing was off and running . // His first full season of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the No. 2 announcer after Arch McDonald , broadcasting both for the Yankees and the New York Giants . The next season McDonald went to the Washington Senators , and Allen moved up . Allen was in the infantry from 1943 until early in 1946 ; in a rare burst of intelligence the Army made use of his broadcasting experience by assigning him to a public relations program . When he came back to New York he signed a contract with the Yankees ( for $17,500 then , for he 's not saying how much now ) and has been with the club ever since . Along the way , he has also broadcast basketball games , tennis matches , dog shows and horse races . Once he recorded the offstage voice for the game sequence in the Broadway production of Damn Yankees , and in a movie called The Babe Ruth Story Allen 's voice described Ruth 's then remarkable 60th home run . " The fact that I was only 14 years old when Ruth hit that homer did n't seem to faze the director , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough idea of what kind of movie it was . " // Inasmuch as Mel Allen has been doing basically the same job for more than two decades , it would be reasonable to suppose that much of his enthusiasm has faded . But for Allen , with no wife or children , no hobbies and , with the exception of popular fiction and magazines , no interests beyond sport , it is n't so . Each game he sees is a new and challenging experience . He does n't just look at it , he lives it . " My job on Monitor " he says , " is pleasant and it pays well , but it is not the sort of thing that keeps me in this business . I could never be just an announcer . I think I 'd go back to law if I had to do that . But my work as a sportscaster , dad gummit , is a creative thing . The players on the field are the actors , and I , in a sense , am the narrator putting the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so carried away by his narration that he paws the air and gesticulates , pounds his neighbors and shifts to the edge of his seat . It is a technique that leaves him completely bushed after a game . // " In a business never known for hard work , Mel has built a reputation for hard work that makes us all uneasy , " says Lindsey Nelson . " In the early days of radio it was enough for the announcer to say , ' The sky is blue , folks , and the band sounds mighty pretty , so let 's listen . ' Now the listeners are too sophisticated for that , and Mel spends far more time getting ready for a broadcast than he does giving it . He gives the listener everything he could ask for . " // Once Mel Allen got over the idea of returning to a law practice in Alabama and accustomed his family to the same thing , he moved them all to New York in 1940 . His sister has married and gone her own way , his brother works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a $75,000 house in Westchester County . It is a close-knit family , and everybody is fairly happy , except perhaps Mrs. Israel . She openly resents the fact that her son " never married anybody but those New York Yankees . " She has seen Mel woo and abandon possible brides , and she does n't laugh at the crack made by a friend : " Here comes Mel Allen with the future Miss Jones . " And she begrudges the demands made on him by his public . // " Once I thought it would be nice to go to dinner with the whole family , " she said the other day . " So we go to a little out-of-the-way restaurant out near Esther 's house on Long Island . No sooner do we walk in the door , than here come the kids , the mommas , the poppas , the grandmommas and the grandpoppas , all holding these little autograph books . Later this man gets angry because Mel says he 'll have to check his appointment book before promising to make a speech to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit in Mel 's lap . It was too much . Me , I wanted to be at home in my kitchen , eating a sandwich with Larry . " // But , she is asked , would she wish her son Mel to be anything less than the success he is ? Anna Israel answers with rue : " I wish he was a shoemaker . A married shoemaker . "
