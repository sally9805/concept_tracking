In 1915 , H. L. Mencken commissioned Frank Harris to write an article called How I Discovered G. B. S. for The Smart Set . When the magazine came off the press , Mencken found that the same article was in another magazine already on the stands ; Harris ' only explanation was that the article was good enough for two appearances . This anecdote affords a quick view of Harris ' experience , ability , and ethics . The only important Harrisian quality not included is the sexual . All of his qualities are now fully displayed by the publication in this country , at last , of his unexpurgated autobiography . To many , Harris is only a peripheral name , so a brief outline of his life may be in order . ( These facts are not drawn entirely from his autobiography , which is approximately as reliable as Wagner 's . ) Harris , as his biographer Brome says , " was born in two different countries on three different dates and his name was not Frank Harris . " His baptismal name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was born in Galway in 1856 not , as he states , a year earlier . His parents were Welsh ; his father was a naval lieutenant commanding a revenue cutter in Western Irish waters . Harris was educated in Ireland and at a public school in England . At the age of 15 he won a E.10 school prize , and because he thought he had been cheated out of a better prize , a Cambridge scholarship , he used his money to run away : to America . In New York he found jobs as a bootblack and as a caisson worker on the foundations of Brooklyn Bridge . He had been , and remained , a ravenous reader with a tentacular memory . One day , while blacking the shoes of a well-dressed regular customer , he remarked that the man looked intent . The man asked him why he used that word . " ' The Latin phrase came into my head , ' I replied without thinking , ' Intentique ore tenebant , V e rgil says ' . " Whether it came with or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The intrigued customer took the youth to Chicago and employed him as night clerk in a hotel . Many of the guests were cattlemen , and Harris subsequently left with a group of them as a cowboy , to drive cattle up from the Mexican border to the Kansas railheads . After two years of cow-punching , he heard that a brother of his had emigrated to Lawrence , Kansas , and went to see him . There , under the guidance of a mentor named Byron Smith , whom he revered , Harris enrolled in the university , eventually worked in a lawyer 's office , and was admitted to the bar . After some months of Lawrence law practice he grew restless , and , galvanized to action by an Emerson essay , he left westward ( he says ) or eastward ( his biographers think ) and either circled the globe through Asia to Europe or made his way more directly to the continent and London . There ( all agree ) by audacity and ability he secured reviewing and editorial work on leading magazines ; relatively soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evening News . He was then 27 . Harris claimed that this amazing appointment came about solely through his qualifications and personality . An easily decipherable roman a clef , published 14 years later , says that the hero seduced the publisher 's wife and that she interceded for him . He became " the only editor who drove fine horses tandem down Fleet Street , " dined and wined well , boxed , and worked ? in two senses ? outrageously . A few years later , after stimulating its sales and style , he Ieft the paper because of policy disagreement and then bought the ( London ) Saturday Review with the aid of a thousand pounds borTHE NEW REPUBLIC rowed from the author of Charley 's Aunt . His years as head of this magazine during the ' 90 's were the peak of his professional life . Quite clearly he had editorial genius . He got the young H. G. Wells to review novels , Cunninghame Graham to write travel sketches , Max Beerbohm to contribute satire , Thomas Hardy and Rudyard Kipling to contribute stories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made some mark as a music critic and who had written a play that Harris had seen : Bernard Shaw . Years later the New Statesman said that , under Harris , " the Saturday Review was beyond all challenge the most vital and stimulating journal in the English-speaking world . " By his mid-forties he was restless again . He had begun to write fiction and non-fiction ; he decided to devote himself to writing and to support his high living by investment . His business deals verged on peculation , even in the sale of the Saturday Review , and at least once his money maneuvers included blackmail . His finances faltered , and in the course of his several movesfrom London to Nice to New York , he found himself forced to edit a series of lesser magazines , calling on the loyalty of former contributors ( at least one of whom , Shaw , stood by him ) . He served a month in Brixton Prison for contempt of court arising out of an editorial contretemps . Early in World War I , because of pro-German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectured , was eventually reduced to writing advertising copy for railroads . After the war he returned to Europe and spent much of his time in Nice . He married twice . His first marriage , to a wealthy English widow , was brief . His second wife , an Irish girl 20 years his junior whom he married in 1898 , became his , widow . He died in Nice in 1931 . His best-known previously published writings are : a novel , The Bomb ; his story collection , Monies the Matador ; his five volumes of Contemporary Portraits ; his critical work , The Man Shakespeare ; his biographies of Wilde and Shaw . His most famous work , until now largely unread , is his five-volume autobiography , My Life and Loves , lately published in one 983-page volume . It was begun in New York in 1920 and was finished in France almost 10 years later . The serial appearance of the volumes , in France and Germany , had produced various scandals and police actions that had delayed the aging and weakening man . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaw had written him in 1915 : " Your most interesting book will be your autobiography . " Moore had said , grandly but truly , " You have , in yourself , a subject that will carry your name down the ages , if you write it with the necessary sincerity : that of Jean-Jacques ; and it will not surprise me if you do write it . " On every other score Harris is certainly a minor writer , largely a negligible one . The Bomb , a novel about the Haymarket murders in Chicago , is a wooden attempt at the then new naturalism , leagues below Frank Norris , not up to the level of Upton Sinclair 's The Jungle . His stories are in the finde-si &ofe; tradition that treated the short story as a minuscule melodrama , the dilution of de Maupassant aggravated by , among others , 0 . Henry . His work on Shakespeare , carefully analyzed by Shaw in the preface to The Dark Lady of the Sonnets , was , in its humanistic bent , an interesting departure in its day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers . His Contemporary Portraits are sporadically enlightening . His biography of Wilde must be used supplementally to a factually reliable and complete work but has many colorful memories and impressions . His Shaw biography , written in collaboration with Frank Scully , the American journalist , is factually dependable , as far as it goes , because of a possibly unique distinction : the subject himself corrected the proofs after the author 's death . Shaw 's postscript says : " Frank knew very little of the facts of my life , and , having no patience for the very dull work of investigation ... put in a good deal of guesswork . . . I have got rid of the contradictions . . . by simply supplying or correcting the facts . .. . All the criticisms , jibes , explosions of passing ill humour , and condemnations have been piously preserved . " In sum , his other books assure Harris of little continuing readership . His autobiography , however , is a work of importance for three reasons . Firstly , the story ? despite some inaccuracies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unknown to its author , has an arch of pathos in his ebullient youth , rise , decline . Secondly , his meetings and friendships are fascinating : Whitman , Marx , Gladstone , Carlyle , Conrad , Taine , Bismarck , Wagner , Ruskin , Rhodes ? this is a helter-skelter handful of some of the figures in the book . One can learn here about Prince Edward 's German accent and taste in jokes , about an odd physical power of de Maupassant 's , what Lady Randolph Churchill said about the terminal insanity of Winston 's father . One can also learn that Harris thought that Henry James had a " Jewish-looking nose " ? a remark that , ironically , was often made of Harris himself . In the fashion of the time , many people believed that Harris ' outr ? behavior must be due to the fact that secretly he was a Jew ? which gossip may explain the modish buzz of anti-Semitism that recurs in all his work . ( While on the subject of Harris ' acquaintances , a comment is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallagher , the editor . For example , he carelessly includes two identifications of Mounet-Sully , omits from Bram Stoker 's note the principal fact that he wrote Dracula , gives two lines to Leopardi and six to a forgotten novelist named Blanche Roosevelt , then kindly identifies Dogberry and Mrs. Grundy for us . ) Third of the reasons for this book 's importance is the factor that delayed its publication and gave it its sub rosa reputation : the account of the author 's sex life , more fully detailed and frankly worded than any such factual account that I know , including those of Rousseau and Casanova . What was the point of the sexual candor ? Was it merely a 70-year-old man smacking his lips over his memories ? Suspicion of this can not be completely ruled out ; but it is also clear , I think , that Harris thoroughly believed that a time had come in history to try to put a whole man on paper . Rousseau had said that his attempt was without precedent and would be without imitator . Harris eventually found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bomb and his long story , Sonia ) strains to deal realistically with love and love-making while both his men and women wear literary corsets . When he came to write his memoirs , goaded by a frustrated impulse to truth that at last overwhelmed him and , to some extent , freed from restraint by the world 's disregard , he fused the facts of life as he knew them with the world of literature that tried to distort them . His sexual recollections begin with his peering up girls ' dresses in his first school and continue through his explorations in a life-boat on his first sea voyage to various affairs of sorts that one might expect . But his life , and therefore his book , went further . He also describes , for instance , the procurement of girls at an Italian villa for the joint delight of his guests and himself ; procurement of a 15-year-old on a ship , of a succession of 12-year-olds in Bombay . Harris does not merely recount sexual adventures of a kind known to many and at least tacitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some men ( Dostoevsky , Nabokov ) have treated in fiction and countless others have secretly fantasied . He makes absolutely no moral judgments about any of it , nor does he pretend to such poetics as those of Genet 's Divine . He writes of sensual experience as such , as part of human existence . He does not hold himself up as exemplar but as example . Shall the reader now transpose this completely amoral sexual biography into a moral context ? In varying degrees , none of us can resist doing this . Few mature readers will be offended by the affairs with women , married or not . The sexual detail in them , as well as the language , is surprising to readers of zoth-Century fiction only because it is here used in autobiography . But it would be idle , fake modernism to pretend that the adventures with minors produce no slightest disquiet . It is not my intention to " excuse " them ; if our society is to cohere and function , acts of that kind are sensibly taboo . But the pre-eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our approval . He is telling us what he did ? everything he did , from escapades that raise chuckles in mixed company to those that cause shock even in the smoking room . Because his sexual life encompassed a range that is fearful autism for most and because of his blazing , almost scornful honesty about it , the very amorality of this chronicle gives it a place in moral history . The temple sculptures of Konarak , the murals and statuary of Pompeii are only two indexes of the regard in which sex was once held . These works are not Jiggs and Maggie cartoons , they are art by the best artists of the time , executed as public celebrations of esteemed activities in that society 's life . These activities , in themselves , have of course not changed . ( A gruff English colonel , in a room with me in Pompeii , inspected the wall paintings silently , then grunted : " Hmph . Nothing new under the sun . " ) What has changed is the social estimate of those activities . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Restoration , from 1.8th Century to loth , sex in our civilization had always been , at best , snigger . With the turn of our century and what can be called the Isadora Duncan age , sex became Beauty ; with the emergence of Freud , it was named the chief motive in life , and our chief concern in our personal lives then became how to adjust that motive to the increasing constrictions of society . To Harris , sex was never either dirty or self-consciously Beautiful ; nor was it a problem to be faced with deliberate , four-square sobriety nor a force that had to be reconciled to the demands of the times . It simply was . He lived , he ate and drank , he worked , he fornicated . ( We still do n't have a good printable word for it . ) He thought as little of either defending or praising sex as he would have done with breathing . Thus , on the sexual level , his book achieves something that even the great Joyce did not do . Joyce , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish , always in a context of social repression and disguise . Harris , as autobiographer , has no sexual morals , has ( one may say ) no subconscious , is not the least concerned with social context . It is not necessary to advocate voyeurism and the procurement of minors to recognize this achievement : that a man was able to record his life sans decorative cupids or evasive terminology . Is " Know Thyself " the poet 's injunction ? Harris has obeyed it in spades and in calling of spades . His sexual life may not be a paragon for the generations but it is certainly , as recorded here , sinless . As with all his non-fiction , ve next have to ask how much of it is true . Mr. Gallagher says in his introduction : " There is the question of whether Harris invented sex episodes in the hope of increasing sales or heightening effect or whether his memory played him false in recalling details . It does not seem likely that a man who could accurately quote at length , say , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years after reading them would find it difficult to remember the faces and anatomies of women . " It seems somewhat na ? ve to believe that Harris never consulted a text when he went into his occasional ( and usually tiresome ) bouts of quotation . But even if he did not , I find it easier to believe that he remembered Swinburne and Macaulay than that he remembered , not only most encounters with most women but every detail of most encounters . For example , a Kansas lady , during the act itself , apologized for her awkwardness . Harris says he replied : " Your awkwardness , however , excites me . " To have remembered that line ( commas and all ) fifty-two years after such a moment and only one among hundreds of such lines in dozens of encounters ? beats Anactoria all hollow . Gallagher goes on to say : " Those persons still alive who knew him best deny there was any necessity for invention by him . " That is conclusive enough ; besides it is supported by the ambience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The episodes themselves can be believed ; it is the memory of minute detail that is in doubt and that is sometimes unwittingly funny . Harris had in general a deficient sense of humor . What other author would put a chapter on an Indian sexual device between a chapter on reminiscences of George Meredith and another on personal im-mortality ? His financial shadiness , his lies , his deceits , all flourished after he made the crucial mistake of his professional life , which was to give up serious editing for writing . He was a meteoric success as an editor ; he was a writer without much success or distinction . His business failures ( he died in relative poverty ) drove him more and more to stratagems for money . He says that he was once considered for the editorship of The ( London ) Times but that his ideas frightened the directors . Both the consideration and the fright are credible . Nevertheless , in that post or a similar one , he would have been enabled to be honest , and might have magnificently redeemed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing as such . When Harris tries to " write , " he gets stuffy . Most of this book is vivid because it seems to be eloquently told . One reason that the sexual monosyllables seem perfectly in place is that they are used by a man who seems quite accustomed to them in speech . ( He once almost drove Browning up the wall by asking whether he got all the passion of lames Lee 's Wife from one woman , Elizabeth Barrett . ) Harris , a short man , was personally imposing by reason of his voice ? thunderous and bass . Freudians can easily make out a case for his being an oral erotic . Certainly he thrived orally , and therefore this book ? the one in which he seems to speak instead of writing and in which he insisted on speaking freely is his best book . It even runs down with a gaffer 's talkiness : the last volume is cranky and patchy and ends with an irrelevant attack on Woodrow Wilson . Without My Life and Loves , Frank Harris was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm place in the main text . Surely a chief aim of literature is the deepening knowledge of man through significant communion of experience . The paradox of Harris ' book is that , although he was a widely recognized rogue , his memoirs are grounded in a strong impulse to self-revelation , with what Moore called " the necessary sincerity . " It is fittingly amusing that this famous liar should end up striking a blow for truth . For with all its shortcomings , in this book Harris has tried to tell the whole story as far as he is capable of seeing it . It is a high ambition and one not often genuinely undertaken .
