It took only two minutes in the $107,800 Woodward Stakes at New York 's Aqueduct race track to convince the few remaining doubters that Mrs. Edith Bancroft 's Damascus is 1967 's top three-year-old . That became abundantly clear when Damascus flashed under the wire a good 10lengths ahead of Dr. Fager , who beat him in the Gotham Stakes this April . And that was the least of the triumphs . In their first meeting at the Woodward , Damascus put a quick end to all speculation about whether he was a better-or at least sounder-horse than Ogden Phipps 's four-year-old Buckpasser , winner of 25 of 31 starts and racing 's third-greatest ( at $1,462,014 ) money winner . By the quarter pole , Damascus had opened a five-length lead on Buckpasser ; at the finish , the margin was an incredible ten lengths and growing with every stride . <P> In a sense , it was the coup de grace for mighty Buckpasser . Soon after the race , Trainer Eddie Neloy announced that the strapping horse would run no more , would retire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since early last year , Buckpasser has been afflicted by painful cracks in his right forehoof ; this year , the condition became chronic , and without making excuses , said Neloy , " it definitely compromised his abilities in the Woodward . " <P> Testing the Temper . No such ailments seem likely to cut short Damascus ' career . Sired by Sword Dancer , himself a two-time winner of the Woodward , Damascus is as sound as his steely name and just beginning to test his temper . In his first campaign last season , he won three out of four starts and $25,865 in purses . So far in 1967 , he has won 11 out of 14 , including both the Preakness and Belmont Stakes . Winnings this year : $723,651 , which puts him within easy reach of the one-year record of $752,550 set by Nashua way back in 1955 . <P> If Damascus has any flaws , they are the kind that a shrewd trainer and top jockey can handle . Unlike Kelso , who was practically a pet around the stable , Damascus has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Favored at 17-10 odds in the Kentucky Derby , he was already sweating before the start , folded in the stretch , and wound up third . To keep him calm in the stable , Trainer Frank Whiteley has now put a radio in his stall ; Whiteley also dips the colt 's protective leg bandages in a peppery solution to stop him from chewing on them . And to ease pre-race jitters , Damascus is usually the last to enter the track , parades to the post in the soothing company of an old lead pony called Duffy . <P> Once out of the gate , says Jockey Willie Shoemaker , Damascus has all the heart anybody could want , is at his best running off the pace , then comes on strong in the stretch . The one problem is to prevent him from loafing a bit once he gets out in front . " You have to keep after Damascus , and when you do , no horse can beat him . " says Shoemaker .
