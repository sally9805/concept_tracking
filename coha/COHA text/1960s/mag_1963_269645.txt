With all his laconic ways , Astronaut Leroy Gordon Cooper Jr . was a wildly acclaimed homecoming hero . In Honolulu , Cocoa Beach , Washington , New York and Houston , the Oklahoma-born Air Force major accepted roars of applause from hundreds of thousands . He reported to the U.S. on a televised news conference . He addressed a joint session of Congress . He and his wife Trudy sipped cocktails at the White House with Jack and Jackie . In the midst of it all , Cooper attended a Broadway musical-Stop the World , I Want to Get Off . <P> The outpouring for Cooper was both genuine and deserved . And Cooper , his fellow astronauts , and other U.S. space enthusiasts were quite candid about capitalizing on the moment to seek more space-flight funds from a Congress that is plainly worried about the cost , and the basic value , of the various man-in-space programs . <P> " Why Go ? " As Cooper waved to 250,000 cheering spectators from a blue convertible along Washington 's Pennsylvania Avenue , it was no idle impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic Senator Clinton Anderson beside him . As chairman of the Senate Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee , Anderson will have a lot to say about whether the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will get the $5.7 billion it has requested for 1964 . <P> Similarly , President Kennedy made a pointed pitch for the space program in awarding Cooper NASA 's Distinguished Service Medal in the White House Rose Garden . Kennedy noted that Cooper took just about as long to orbit the earth 22 times as Charles Lindbergh did to fly solo to Paris in 1927 . Said Kennedy : " Both flights were equally hazardous . Both were equally daring . I know that a good many people say ' Why go to the moon ? , ' just as many people said to Lindbergh , ' Why go to Paris ? ' The U.S. has committed itself to this great adventure in the ' 60s . <P> 1 think before the end of the ' 60s we will see a man to the moon-an American . " As for those who might argue that no great harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. to the moon , Vice President Lyndon Johnson asked : " What American wants to go to bed by the light of a Communist moon ? " <P> After a two-minute ovation from the Congress , Cooper used much of his eight-minute speech to praise Project Mercury and the men who man it . " I do n't think I 've ever been with a team that was more dedicated , was striving harder , and was more completely sold on their product and the total space effort , and particularly the manned space-flight effort in which I am involved , " he said . In his soft twang , Cooper read a prayer he had recorded over the Indian Ocean on his 17th orbit . It read in part : " Father , we thank you especially for letting me fly this flight . <P> Thank you for the privilege of being able to be in this position , to be in this wondrous place , seeing all these many startling , wonderful things that you have created . Help us in our future space endeavors that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still is able to do things in a big way . " The Congress was at first silent-then exploded in applause .
