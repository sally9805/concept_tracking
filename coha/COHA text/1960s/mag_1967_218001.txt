THE ADMINISTRATION <P> ( See Cover ) <P> When he quit the Department of Health , Education and Welfare in 1962 , Secretary Abraham Ribicoff described it as the " department of dirty water , dirty air and dirty looks . I feel sorry for the so-and-so who is going to take my place . " One of his predecessors , Marion Folsom , an Eisenhower appointee , complained : " They expect you to know everything , and it 's just not possible . " One Congressman has called the department " a nightmare , " another " a monstrosity . " Others call it the Department of Headaches-or , more specifically , the Department of Wealth , Aggravation and Hellfire . <P> John William Gardner , 54 , the so-and-so once removed from Ribicoff ( former Cleveland Mayor Anthony Celebrezze came in between ) , takes wry pleasure in recalling the bloodcurdling things he heard about his sprawling domain when he first took over in August 1965 . Then he adds : " I think that people just do n't say that any more . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gardner has even more problems to cope with than any of the others , but he hardly seems disgruntled by the dimensions of the job . With characteristic wit , he once described his concerns as " a series of great opportunities brilliantly disguised as insoluble problems . " But as head of a department with a $12.3 billion budget ( plus $25 billion more for social security ) , 150 programs and 100,000 employees , Gardner derives pride from the fact that he is quite literally the construction boss of Lyndon Johnson 's visionary effort to build a Great Society . He is a Republican , but he wholly subscribes to Democrat Johnson 's dreams for a better nation . " This department touches every American , from the preschool child to the elderly , " said Gardner when he accepted its command . " It has been handed an absolutely staggering set of assignments that can result in enormous good to the American people . It must be well-managed . That is an exciting challenge . " <P> Cash Flood . The challenge has been made doubly exciting-and devilishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the Johnson Administration has committed itself in the past three years . The 89th Congress put no fewer than 136 major domestic bills on the books , and nearly everybody from federal administrators to municipal bookkeepers has been overwhelmed as a result . " Our aspirations , " says Gardner , " have outrun our organizational abilities . " <P> Medicare was one instance . Though HEW officials prepared for its introduction with what the President called " just about the largest single management effort since the Normandy invasion , " there were inevitable bottlenecks . <P> As the program got under way , hospitals had 50% of their Medicare forms bounced back because of errors , causing two-month delays in payment and forcing some of them to seek short-term loans from banks . <P> The 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act was another example . Title I of the act , a $1 billion program to upgrade the schooling of poor children , held vast promise . But the cash it released hit many areas like a flash flood , running off before it could be absorbed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $52 million out of the $61 million authorized . " It 's like having $50 million to spend in
