txt Customers of many of the nation 's banks are being confronted with a pleasing paradox . If they are lending money to the bank , by depositing in a savings account for instance , they are probably receiving higher interest than a few months ago Savings interest has been boosted since the first of the year by 83% , of the nation 's large banks and 49 , ' , of mediumsized banks according to a Federal Reserve Board survey Many now pay the 4% maximum now permitted under FRB rules . If the customers are borrowers , the chances are just as good that interest rates on loan* are lower and terms easier This applies to both home mortgage and business loans . For instance , the average interest rate on business loans made by seven New York City banks slipped to 4.55% in the first half of March Three months earlier . according to the New York Federal Reserve Bank , the average was 4 7 and a year before it was ** Business loans are being granted for longer periods and requirements , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loan on deposit , are being eased . Bank Earning .. Slip Normally . when bankers have to pay more to depositors to obtain funds , they might be expected to pass along the higher cost to bortowers The fact that now the reverse is often happening is cutting earnings of some banks and causing concern among bankers . Combined earnings of 11 major New York City banks dropped slightly in the first quarter of this year from a year before , despite the higher level of activity in the over-all economy . In San Francisco , Wells Fargo Bank 's firstquarter earnings fell 16% from a year earlier . Detroit Bank &; Trust CO. suffered a 27% decline for the same period . The difficulties some banks are having resuit from two primary factors . Loan demand has been disappointing to bankers so far this year , helping to weaken lending rates . The rise in interest on deposits results from the harder scramble banks are having to obtain such funds . Commercial banks draw their funds from savings and checking accounts of individuals , and the checking accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditionally been a primary source of bank deposits . But corporate treasurers have been seeking ways to keep checking deposits at a minimum , since these earn no interest . More corporate funds are being put into interestbearing securities . Big banks in major money renters such as New York , Chicago and San Francisco have been further affected by the decentralization of large corporations , which has led them to disperse checking accounts to smaller banks . To offset these trends , banks have plunged into stronger competition with savings and loan associations for the personal savings of individuals , pushing banks ' interest rates on this kind of deposit nearer to the higher saving-and-loan levels . Also , a number of leading banks in New York and other cities early last year began issuing interest-paying time deposit certificates to corporations to try to woo back some of their company funds . The rates on these deposits vary , but the banks usually try to keep them as high as they need to compete with other investments , such as Treasury bills or commercial paper . Savings Deposits Rise These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year , savings-type deposits of banks that report to the Federal Reserve System have climbed $3.8 billion , or 9% . Although the figures are not directly comparable , an indication that savings and loan associations have fared less well is the fact that their share accounts in the first two months this year dropped 10% from a year earlier . As to banks ' interest-paying time deposit certificates , it is estimated that some $2 billion are now outstanding . But the cost of these deposits can be easily demonstrated in terms of individual banks . Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York , a big commercial bank , paid out $7.2 million in interest on time deposits in the first quarter , nearly double such payments a year ago . But the interest which the bank took in on loans rose only $1.6 million . Returns on other investments more than made up the difference , however . First National City Bank of New York suffered a similar experience with savings deposits . The interest it paid on such deposits jumped $5.1 million , or 58% , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received on loans rose only about $2 million , or 4.6% . Although loan demand has not measured up to expectations , some bankers and banking analysts are hopeful of an upturn . Business loans made by banks that weekly report to the Federal Reserve System had , by April 11 , diopped about 1 , ; ? since the first of the year . ( New York City banks suffered a $38 million decline in business loans in the week ended Wednesday . See story on page 24.1 It is normal for such loans to decline during this season as businesses repay money borrowed the previous fall for such purposes as laying in Christmas inventories or purchasing farm crops . Last year the decline for the comparable period was less than 1 , , . M. A.

Bond Yields Reduced One of the major factors that has lowered bank loan demand has been the high demand from investors for corporate debt securities and S Government bonds This has forced the prit e of such secur ties upward , causing a decline in their yield to investors .

The lower bond yields are causing some analysts to question the majority opinion that the prime rate will not decline . " The question now is how muc h further the bull market In bonds can go without forcing the ( Federal R.eserve ) authorities to lower the discount rate . " says New York economist Eliot Janeway " A cut in the rediscount rate would force the prime rate down , " so that banks could compete more effectively for loans .
