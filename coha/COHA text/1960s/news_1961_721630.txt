The Governor made the proposal in his annual message to the Senate and Assembly , to empower the Port of New York Authority to take over the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad , He called such legislation a " must " and a " constructive step in the development of our interstate transportation facilities . " The Governor also renewed his plea for passage of his proposed income tax on New YorkNew Jersey commuters . He said the measure would solve the commuter rail problem " without a single cent of additional cost to our citizens . " He was " perplexed , " he said , by the refusal last year of the state Senate to adopt the bill . In another proposal , Mr. Meyner sought additional power for the Waterfront Commission . Governor Rockefeller already had endorsed the recently requested authority to curb crime on the bi-state docks . The bulk of Mr. Meyner 's message was a repetition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor limited his remarks on education to a request for minor changes in the state scholarship law and for a study of state school aid laws . He said that the state Department of Education would soon publish a report on the need for public two-year colleges and technical institutes . In other proposals , Governor Meyner asked for a sharp upgrading of unemployment , disability and workmen 's compensation benefits ; outlined a program to improve . law . enforcement , and urged the revision and tightening of a number of state statutes . Asks Court Revision Mr Meyner also proposed that the state 's 505 part-time municipal courts be replaced by a small group of full-time courts . Such a substitution has long been advocated by Chief Justice Joseph Weintraub of the State Supreme Court . At today 's session , Thomas J. Hillery of Morris County was elected president of the Senate . Walter H. Jones of Bergen was named Senate majority leader and Joseph W. Cowgill of Camden County , minority leader . The Senate is controlled by Republicans , 11 to 10 . LeRoy J. Daloia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John W. Davis , Democrat of Salem , was named Assembly majority leader and Raymond H. Bowkley , minority leader . Democrats dominate the Assembly by 34 to 26 . Before adjourning sine die at 1:45 Y. M. the 1960 Assembly approved and sent to Mr. Mey-Ler a measure to protect local /I assessors from suits because of failure to assess property at 100 per cent of true value . In 1957 the State Supreme Court ruled that assessors were bound by a century-old law requiring assessment at full value . But relatively few localities complied because of the expense and other problems relating to a general reassessment . Several taxpayer suits against assessors ensued . However , the Legislature enacted a reform measure that will permit each county , beginning next year , to fix its own ratio of true value for assessments . Today 's measure was designed to protect the assessors from litigation until the new law goes into effect . Mr. Meyner told the legislators the state had made " significant " progress in the last ten years in acquiring and developing open lands for recreational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such state holdings have risen from 145,000 to 275,000 acres . His plans for increasing this to 600,000 acres , he said , were required by the " emerging needs of the Sixties . " He said the state was negotiating for purchase of a 6,800-acre site in Sussex and Passaic Counties , which the National Park Service had called the " most significant site " in the Delaware River basin . The property is known as the Lake Wawayanda Tract . Part of it has already been acquired through an exchange of property with the New Jersey Power and Light Company . The rest , most of it owned by the New Jersey Zinc Company , will , be purchased for about $1,000,000 . The Governor requested a conservation easement law and power for the state to perfect title to tax delinquent lands already acquired as a means of reserving still-open areas for future recreational development . The Governor said he would make recommendations for financing the program in his annual budget message . He will deliver this to the Legislature Jan. 30 . The Port Authority first proposed acquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the bi-state agency has completed an exhaustive survey of all the properties . Mr. Meyner first made his income tax proposal on May 1 , 1960 . It is designed to siphon from Albany to Trenton $35 , - 000,000 to $38,000,000 a year . This money is paid in income tax in New York by 150,000 New Jersey residents employed there. , The Assembly approved the plan last year , but the meal* , e was never acted-on in tlio-senate.
