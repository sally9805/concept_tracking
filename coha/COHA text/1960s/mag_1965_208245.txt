In the past year , Cuba has been torn by a power struggle between its old-guard , Moscow-lining Communists and the younger Fidelistas , whose hearts are closer to Peking . The Moscow old guard is clearly getting the worst of it . Between May and December last year , Castro sacked four Cabinet ministers who were aligned with the Soviet-oriented wing of the party . Last week he bumped the most important old-timer yet : Carlos Rafael Rodriguez , 51 , director of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform ( INRA ) and top go-between for Havana and Moscow . <P> <P> Into the Hills . Urbane and well-educated , Rodriguez joined the party in 1930 , while a law student at Havana University , soon proved himself one of its most practical politicians . In 1944 , when the Communists were supporting Dictator Fulgencio Batista , Rodriguez even became a minister without portfolio in Batista 's Cabinet for seven months . That palship lasted until the mid-1950s , and when Castro started his revolution in the Sierra Maestra , Rodriguez hurried into the hills to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> For four years after the victory , Rodriguez edited the party daily Hoy , always seemed to turn up close to Castro on the podium at important functions , outranked only by Little Brother Raul , Che Guevara and Bias Roca . In 1962 Rodriguez took over from Fidel as agrarian-reform director and boss of the island 's sugar industry-in effect Cuba 's economic czar . As Cuba 's econ omy continued to fall apart and Castro 's relations with Moscow cooled , Rodriguez lost some of his power-over the fishing industry , water resources , and finally the whole sugar industry . <P> Moscow &; Out . In December Castro sent Rodriguez to Moscow to negotiate a new trade pact with the Russians , who are obviously weary of pumping $1 million-a-day worth of aid into Cuba with little effect . The mission was less than successful . Announced last week , the 1965 pact provides for $640 million in two-way trade , a mere 4% increase over 1964 compared with last year 's 22% increase . And to help square its overall debt , estimated at $650 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviets , nearly double the 1964 amount . <P> <P> Almost simultaneously , Castro announced that he himself was taking over INRA , and that Rodriguez was " relieved of his duties . " Rodriguez would remain in the Cabinet " in charge of directing the study of numerous problems of national economy . " The Soviets could not miss the point . For his chief INRA assistant , Fidel passed over Rodriguez ' first vice minister and named instead a Fidelista , whose previous experience was as CO of Cuba 's air force .
