For the first time in ten months , the Congo 's fledgling Parliament reassembled last week in Lovanium University 's handsome modern auditorium . Isolated from outside influences by an electrified barbed-wire fence , patrols of police dogs and Indian machine gunners of the U.N . force , the legislators made a forlorn stab at statesmanship . That it failed was largely the fault of two bedridden absentees : Red lining Antoine Gizenga , boss of Eastern province and heir apparent of Lumumba , and round-faced Moise Tshombe , President of the separatist state of Katanga . <P> By a narrow vote of 62-58 , Gizenga 's slate of seven candidates swept every office in the Chamber of Representatives ; in the Senate , Gizenga supporters won five of the seven elective posts . The Congo 's normally inert President Joseph Kasavubu was sufficiently stung by this rebuff to crossly remind the legislators that , as chief of state , it was his responsibility to name a Premier-designate-a strong hint that his first choice would not be Gizenga . <P> Just for Insurance . Gizenga 's team might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his delegation of seven Senators and eight Deputies to attend the session in Leopoldville . But Tshombe , between bouts of bush fever , was more interested in sowing discord at home and abroad . Imprisoned for two months by Kasavubu 's central government , he had won release by promising Strongman Joseph Mobutu that he would merge his 11,600 army , officered by 634 Europeans , with that of the central government . Once back in Katanga , Tshombe assured his Cabinet that the agreement was only a " gesture of support for Mobutu and a form of insurance for us . " When Gen. Mobutu 's staff officers arrived in Elisabethville to take over , they were coldly ignored . <P> Tshombe then blithely took on more sizable opponents by charging that there was a U.S. " plot " to use U.N . troops to crush Katanga and bring about the unification of the Congo . Stunned reporters were told that Katanga would " ask for and accept Russian help " - despite the fact that the Soviet Union has long denounced Tshombe as a " Belgian stooge " kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European diplomats testily dismissed this attempted blackmail of the West and the U.N . as a piece of " dangerous skulduggery , " <P> Not for Sale . In his ramshackle capital of Stanleyville in faraway Eastern province , Antoine Gizenga discreetly remained in bed with a case of diplomatic " bronchitis . " To help him assess his victory in the parliamentary elections , he had on hand a recently arrived delegation of Russian and Czech advisers . Remembering the botch they made of their effort to take over the Congo with Patrice Lumumba , the Communists this time may urge Gizenga to let President Kasavubu name one of his own men as Premier-on the theory that whoever he picks is bound to fail . <P>
