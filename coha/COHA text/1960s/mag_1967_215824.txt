Every morning the boys from Bill Gordon 's barbershop in Meridian , Miss. , staked out a big Confederate flag . Across the street , U.S. District Judge W. Harold Cox and a jury of white Mississippians were hearing charges against 18 of their neighbors named as plotters in the grisly 1964 murders of Civil Rights Workers Michael Schwerner , 24 , Andrew Goodman , 20 , and James Chaney , 21 . The indictment did not specify murder-merely a conspiracy to deny the dead men their constitutional rights under a federal statute dating back to Reconstruction days . But the flag was a reminder that the Deep South never cottoned to such laws . Then one morning last week a barber slipped through the waiting townsfolk and somberly rolled up the flag : according to reports from the courtroom , the seven women and five men of the jury were bringing in guilty verdicts . <P> Three housewives , a school-cafeteria cook , an electrician , a pipe fitter , a secretary , a gas-company clerk , a grocer , two factory workers and a former state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury drawn from Mississippi veniremen convicted white defendants in any civil rights case . <P> After 14 hours of deliberation , it took less than three minutes for Courtroom Clerk Mrs. Sue Richmond to declare seven men guilty of a conspiracy that began when Meridian 's White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan voted to " eliminate " Schwerner for running a Negro community center and culminated when the lynch mob bulldozed three bullet-stitched corpses into an earthen dam . One of the men convicted was Neshoba County Chief Deputy Sheriff Cecil Price , 29 , who set up the killings by arresting the young activist for speeding ; another was Samuel H. Bowers Jr. , 42 , the White Knights ' Imperial Wizard . They face maximum sentences of ten years in prison and a $5,000 fine . <P> Eight accused conspirators were acquitted-one of them at the Government 's request . Among those who went free was Neshoba 's Sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey , although Assistant U.S. Attorney General John Doar charged that Klansman Rainey 's inaction at the time of the murders clearly implicated him . The jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to come back for a " supercharge " by Cox , could not agree on the guilt of three others . In their cases , the judge declared a mistrial , and although two of the trio freed on bond-Fundamentalist Minister Edgar Ray Killen and E. G. Barnett , Democratic nominee to succeed Rainey as sheriff-were fingered as deep in the plot by witnesses , according to Government lawyers , they are unlikely to be retried . <P> Scrupulously Fair . Mississippi alone can bring murder charges against any or all of the 18 , but it has not so far . " We 'll have to study the evidence from the trial , " commented District Attorney William Johnson Jr . State attorneys claimed that the Government 's carefully gathered evidence-mostly amassed by the F.B.I.-was " a complete surprise " to them , although federal officials say they offered it long ago to Governor Paul Johnson .
