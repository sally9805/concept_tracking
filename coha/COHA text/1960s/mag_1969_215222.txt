When Hair , America 's first tribal love-rock musical , opened two years ago , t was thought by many to be merely a passing fancy . Not so . Now it is a case of Hair , there and everywhere . So prolific has the show become , in fact , that t is difficult to find a spot in the world where Hair is n't sprouting . <P> There are permanent companies in New York , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Chicago , London , Berlin , Paris , Sydney , and-get this-Belgrade . And all with four-letter words and the nude scene solidly intact . The show is currently playing in Las Vegas ( where the cast was threatned with arrest for , of all things , indecent exposure ; but when the guffaws echoed from both coasts , the proposed arrest was canceled ) . Toronto , Boston , Helsinki and Sao Paulo will get their Hair next year , and rights have been sold in Israel , Italy and Belgium . <P> All this hairsplitting is not without its dangers , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authorities moved in to close the show for " undermining the morals of youth " and put the cast in the local crcel for five hours . By coincidence or something , the date of the Mexico opening was the only one that was not determined by the company astrologer . All other openings have been determined by the stars and planets , and all were financial successes . Even history could not stand in the way of Astrologer Marya Crumere 's choice of this week 's opening date in Japan-Dec. 7 . <P> The original cast album of Hair has sold nearly 3,000,000 copies , and the score has been recorded for various national posterities in Swedish , Spanish , French , German and Japanese . Back home , everyone from Andy Williams to the 5th Dimension has a Hair tune on his album . And the producers have opened bidding for the movie rights , now up to $2.5 million . Which just goes to show that , for American tribal love-rock musicals at least , this is most assuredly the Age of Aquarius . And bread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
