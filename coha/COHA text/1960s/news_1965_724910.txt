txt Washington Phase 2 of the Great Society program is getting under way now at the White House . The 1966 state of the Union address , in which President Johnson must present his new program to Congress and nation , is six months away . But a search for ideas is already in full swing to carry frrward Great Society goals . As defined by President Johnson in the 1965 state of the Union address , the basic task is : ? To keep the economy growing ; ? To open for all Americans the opportunity available to most Americans ; ? To improve the quality of life for all During Phase 1 the President concentrated on building the economy and sharing the opportunity . His legislative requests to Congress , while surprisingly sweeping in scope , were almost entirely follow-throughs of concepts and programs previously suggested . It was a cleanup of the agenda from the John F. Kennedy administration . Legislation outlined With Congress heading into its final months , the Johnson administration 's key legislation has already been enacted or assured of passage  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medicare , excise-tax reductions , creation of a department of housing and urban development , and aid to Appalachia . Mr. Johnson also tried ? to build public support , especially with business , for the over-all concept of what he chooses to call the Great Society . Ii Phase 2 , the President seeks to create a unified program out of patchwork beginnings . He hopes to add new approaches to familiar problems . And he wants the benefits to go to the whole people and not just to the poor . Problems listed White House sources say the President believes most Ameribans are convinced now that there is a federal responsibility for attacking the problems that have . become too large and ' too complex , to be handled by states and cities , or by the private sector alone . These problems include chronic unemployment and the need to match potential workers with the new types of jobs being created through the hew technology ; fully integrating the Negro into the American society ; // *Great Society Phase 2 // tackling the growing urban questions of congested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the preservation or restoration of beauty in the countryside and creating it in the urban areas . " The most important gain made in the past year , " says a presidential adviser , " is in public acceptance that these problems must be solved . The discussion now is over how to do it  --  not whether it should be done . " Although not readily apparent because of the 2-to-1 Democratic Party majorities in both Houses of Congress , which have greased the rails for passage of legislation this year , Mr. Johnson 's Great Society approach does have opposition on Capitol Hill . In addition , many Americans do not accept the necessity for the pace and scope of the increasing federal involvement with the affairs of individuals , cities , and states . Task toughens With the backlog of social legislation that had been building up in the past decade now pretty well cleaned up , President Johnson 's task becomes more difficult . A president 's job Is to spur ideas and make judgments on which proposals should be implemented , and when and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks on some of the long-range domestic problems is thus a priority these days at the White House . Early in July , the President called the leaders of last year 's Great Society task forces to a White House meeting for a new appraisal of the problems . A dozen or more task forces of experts in such fields as education , transportation , health , finance , agriculture , urban affairs , and economic policy submitted ideas and programs last fall . A few of their proposals , such as rent subsidies and regional medical centers , surfaced in the 1965 legislative program . Frank budget talk Also at the July meeting were Vice-President Hubert H. Humphrey , a few White House aides , representatives of the Budget Bureau , the Council of Economic Advisers , and the Office of Science and Technology . No decisions were made on specific legislative proposals for 1966 . The President made known his desire not just to extend and expand programs that help the poor and underprivileged , but to find ways of doing more for the remaining 75 percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life " for all . The President has talked " bare-bones budget " in frank language to recent meetings of government task forces on cost reduction . " Between fiscal 1964 and 1966 we will increase spending on the major Great Society program by $41/2 billion  --  a rise of over 60 percent . But our total budget will go up by only $2 billion . Over half of the new spending is being financed from improved efficiency and reductions in less-essential programs . want you to help ' " If we are not to have our budget grow much faster than our population growth , then we 've got to find some things that we are now doing that we can stop . " Let 's get this thing down to where we can effect every possible economy . Then .. . we 'll have some money to do the things that must be done if 1 ; 1 are to lead the world in education , health .. ? . and the rest of it . " " I want you to help me now . We are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to do it if you will , " he said . " If you wo n't , I 'm going to get your Cabinet officer down to the ranch .. . and say ' Here are the items I think we can cut out . ' " Meanwhile , the vast majority of Americans is on one hand sharing in the material abundance of the times ; on the other , experiencing daily living affected by smog , water pollution , traffic congestion , crime on the streets , health problems , littered streets and highways , and scars on natural beauty around them . City problems How to approach the problem of urban areas is perhaps the most difficult one facing the administration . In his first major speech on the Great Society  --  at the Univ , ersity of Michigan in May , 1064 ? Mr. Johnson talked.of the need to rebuild the entire urban United States in the next 40 years . In another 50 years , four-fifths of the population will live in urban areas , he forecast . " Our society will never be great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The administration 's opening wedge in solving cite ' problems is the creation of a Cabinet office of housing and urban development , which appears assured of passage in this session of Congress . In his Michigan speech , Mr. Johnson talked of holding a White House conference on cities . But the administration now feels that not enough ground work has been laid for such a conference . White House aides frankly admit that not only they do n't know all the answers , but they are not even certain of the nature of some of the problems . Conference on Negroes The problem of the American Negro , Mr. Johnson said at his most recent news conference , " is one of the two or three most important problems that we must face up to with our legislation again next year . " In an effort to help define new approaches to the problem , a White House conference will be held this fall . Its subject : " To Fulfill These Rights . " Out of the conference should come proposals that will be incorporated into future legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another principal plank in the Great Society program ? are expected to emerge from a White House conference on education to be held later this month . Ideas from last May 's White House conference on natural beauty are being surveyed now . Almost all the major problems facing the nation are interrelated ? the city and the Negro , education and poverty , transportation and the city , natural beauty and pollution  --  White House sources say . Mr. Johnson is trying to tie together his 1966 legislative requests into a coherent package which will focus attention on these related problems , instead of approaching them piecemeal . The President also recognizes the need for a coordination of economic and social policies . Social reforms can be financed only by a prosperous and growing economy . At the same time , Mr. Johnson hopes to finance new programs by curtailing programs no longer needed , or by eliminating waste and making economies in government operations . Tax policies and international economic policies , are being considered now in preparation for the 1066 legislative program .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
