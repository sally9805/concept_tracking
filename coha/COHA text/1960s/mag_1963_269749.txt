Good manners are not nearly so good as they used to be . In a freewheeling society with no hard-and-fast code of etiquette , this is perhaps inevitable . But there are individuals-ask any lady who has had to stand up on a bus-who insist that what is needed is not a new set of rules , but a new ruler . The old-fashioned wrist-tapping kind . Especially for these young people . <P> Students Smart . At the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill , many a campus carpus has felt the sting dealt out by 69-year-old Otelia Connor . An inveterate Letters-to-the-Editor writer and widow of an American Tobacco Co. executive , Otelia came over from Durham for her son 's graduation in 1957 , was so upset by all the shoving and slurping that she decided to settle right down there in Chapel Hill and do something about it . Taking up residence near the university , she began to eat her meals in the student dining hall , soon became an unofficial campus institution . " The students want to learn , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . They do n't open doors for women . They slouch . They prop their feet up on tables . They say ' huh ? ' and ' uh-huh . ' In the dining hall , they just pull a chair away from your table without asking , and they wo n't carry your tray . " <P> Otelia favors a return to the gracious Old South tradition in which she was raised . But the Connor catch-up course is often elementary . If she does n't have her umbrella handy for a quick thwack , Otelia is apt to snap a finger against an undergraduate 's skull , then tell all to the nearest Letters column . " I sat with two law students , " goes a typical mid-term report . " One was lying almost prone across the table . The other had his knees doubled up under his chin-I slapped him on the legs and told him to put his feet down . " <P> Field Study . " She is an anthropological treasure , " says Dean of Students Charles Henderson , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when elderly ladies thought it their duty to preserve them . " Most students agree . They dig Otelia . The school 's Current Affairs Committee invited her to lecture at Graham Memorial Hall-though some soreheads around Chapel Hill have been known to describe her as " a circus , " " a hell-raiser , " and " an apparition-a little toothpick of a woman with a cigarette dangling out of her mouth . " <P> That kind of talk does n't bother Otelia , who calls her chain smoking only " a silly nervous habit . I just puff it in and puff it out . " As self-appointed Gadfly of Chapel Hill , she thrives on controversy . This summer , with many of her naughty U.N.C. " children " off on holiday-presumab ! y littering up the beaches or just thoughtlessly kicking sand around-she took a trip to nearby Duke University . " I went there to observe the students in the Union Cafeteria , " she reported ruefully , " and their manners are even worse than ours . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
