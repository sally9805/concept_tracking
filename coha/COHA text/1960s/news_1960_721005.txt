txt Douglas Dillon , Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs , left for Paris today to attend a thirteen-nation economic conference . He is prepared to urge at the conference that machinery be set up for tackling three important economic problems of 1 the non-Communist world . These problems are trade relations in Europe , expansion of ' aid to under-developed countries and the future of the Organiza1 tion for European Economic ' ' Cooperation . The conference will take place Tuesday and Wednes- , i day , to be followed by a meet ! ing of the 0 . E. E. C. Thursday . He Identifies Problems Before departing , Mr. Dillon issued a statement identifying the trade and aid problems and saying : " These are complex , difficult problems , We do not expect to solve them . in the course of the next week nor do we plan to make decisions affecting other countries without full consultation with them . " The United States believes that different machinery is probably needed to handle each of the three problems . Thus Mr. Dillon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-encompassing economic body for the free world . The first problem has , been caused by the division of Europe into two tariff-cutting groups , the European Economic Community , or Common Market , and the European- Free Trade Association , or Outer Seven . Need For Talks Felt The United States feels the . immediate need is to start the two groups talking with each other to minimize the political and psychological effects of the split . The United States has no solution to propose . It remains lukewarm to a solution backed by many members of each group  --  a Europe-wide free trade area . Mr. Dillon is understood to be concerned over the tension that has arisen from the division and to feel that talks should take place before its economic impact begins . The economic effects on outsiders of tariff-cutting in the two blocs will begin to be felt next July 1 . The tension arises from fears of members in each group that they will lose markets in the other group . In a larger sense , there is fear that the trading division will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . DiscusMons on aid to underdeveloped countries , according to the United States view , should be limited to the nations that are already in the aid business . The aim of the new machinery would be not so much to coordinate aid as to permit the industrial countries to examine one another 's techniques , problems and potentialities for expanded aid . The problem of the Organiza- , tion for European Economic Cooperation , which has eighteen European members , with the United States and Canada as observers , is that it has been , in effect , moribund since the trading division in Europe developed . The United States is not pre- , pared to commit itself to joining ' as a full member a new and enlarged organization , but it is sympathetic to the idea . Mr. Dillon 's proposal will be to establish a study group to make recommendations on the 0 . E. E. C. 's future . President Eisenhower 's State of the Union message list week suggested that the organization could help with initial studies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the European trade problem . The report was compiled by a three-member subcommittee headed by Representative Frank M. Coffin , Democrat of Maine . The group 's key recommendation was that the United States push immediately for a reorganization and expansion of the D. E. E. C. The new organization , said the report , " must not be all industrial , all white or all northern . " The committee said the new body should include the eighteen members of the present or , ? , cranication , the United States , CanIda , Japan , India , Brazil and 7epresentatives from the Far East , South Asia , the Middle East and Africa . The subcommittee , which toured Europe late last year , concluded that there was no urgency about forming a " bridge " between the Common Market and the Outer Seven . Mr. Dillon 's party included Mrs. Dillon , T. Graydon Upton , Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs , and Mrs. Upton ; John M. Laddy , special assistant to Mr. Dillon , and John W. Tuthill , director of European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
