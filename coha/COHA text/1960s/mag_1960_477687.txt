C. Wright Mills , Professor of Sociology at Columbia University , and author of such books as The Power Elite and The Sociological Imagination , visited Cuba last August and made an intensive study of its revolution . Using a wire-recorder , he spent three eighteen-hour days with Fidel Castro , interviewed many of the principal government officials , and spoke to hundreds of Cubans while traveling the length of the island . The article which follows draws on these conversations and attempts to present a composite viewpoint of the Cuban revolutionary . ( It will be included in Mr. Mills ' book entitled Listen , Yankee to be published shortly by McGraw-Hill and Ballantine . ) The message Mr. Mills puts in the mouth of the Cubans is , in effect , a piece of propaganda ? uncritical , emotional , oblivious of the faults of the Castro regime . But , while criticism of that regime is widely published in America , the revolutionary elan which brought it into power and supports it is little understood ; and it is something we must confront if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THIS article reflects the mood and the contents of my discussions with revolutionaries in Cuba during August . But it is about more than Cuba . For Cuba 's voice today is a voice of the hungry-nation bloc , and the Cuban revolutionary is now speaking ? most effectively ? in the name of many people in that bloc . In Asia , in Africa . as well as in Latin America , the people behind this voice are becoming articulate ; they are becoming strong in a kind of fury they 've never known before . As nations , they are young . To them , the world is new . No matter what you may think of it , no matter what I think of it ? Cuba 's voice is a voice that must be heard in the United States of America . Yet it has not been heard . It must now be heard because the United States is too powerful. , its responsibilities to the world and to itself are too great , for its people not to be able to listen to every voice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mills If we do not listen to them , if we do not hear them well , we face all the perils of ignorance ? and with these , the perils of disastrous mistakes . Some of the mistakes of ignorance have already been made , in our name , by the United States government ? and with disastrous consequences everywhere in the world , for the image and for the future of the United States , But perhaps it is not too late fur us to listen ? and to act . My major aim is to present the voice of the Cuban revolutionary ; I have taken up this aim because of its absurd absence from the news of Cuba available in the United States today . You will not find here The Whole Truth About Cuba , nor " an objective appraisal of the Cuban revolution . " I do not believe it is possible for anyone to carry out such an appraisal today . The true story of the Cuban revolution , in all its meaning , will have to wait until some Cuban , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " LISTEN , YANKEE " voice of his revolution . In the meantime , my task has been to try to ask a few of the fruitful questions , and then to seek out and to listen well to as full a variety of answers as I could find . I believe that much of whatever you have read recently about Cuba in the U. S. press is far removed from the realities and the meaning of what is going on in Cuba today . Unlike many Cubans , I do not believe that this fact is entirely due to a deliberate campaign of vilification ? co-ordinated advertising pressure , official handouts , and off-the-record talks . Yet it is tine that if U. S. business interests adversely affected by the revolution do not co-ordinate your news on Cuba , they may none the less be a controlling factor in what you know , and do n't know , about Cuba . More generally , business as a system of interests , which includes the media of communication , certainly does play a role in such matters . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does restrict and shape the copy journalists produce . They print what they think is the salable commodity . Our ignorance is also due to the fact that the revolutionary government of Cuba does not yet have a serviceable information agency for foreign journalists . Those Cubans in a position to help are very busy with the revolution . But more than that : they are increasingly unwilling to help , for they feel that their trust has been betrayed . " To report " a real revolution involves much more than the ordinary journalist 's routine . It requires that the journalist abandon many of the clich ? s and habits which now make up his very craft , and that he know something in detail about the great variety of left-wing thought and action in the world today . Most North American journalists know very little of that variety . To most of them it appears as all just so much " Communism . " Even those with the best will to understand , by their very training and the habits of their work , are not able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so the meanings , of revolutionary events . Rut one thing is clear : TVe are not getting sound information about the hungry-nation bloc . HAVING said that , I must immediately add that whatever may be truthful or useful in this article is due less to any skill on my part than to my good fortune in having been given complete access to information and experience by Cubans close to events and who , once trust is established . are eager to express everything they feel . That trust was given to me , not because of any viewpoint I held toward them or toward their revolution , but simply because of their acquaintance with previous books of mine . In writing about Cuba , I have tried not to allow my own worries for Cuba ? and for the United States ? to intrude upon my presentation of the Cuban voice , nor have I attempted either to conceal or to underline such ambiguities as I happen to find in this argument . My aim , I repeat , is to see to it that the Cuban Revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you because we believe that you have lost touch with us . As human beings , it is true , we Cubans have never had any close relations with you . But as peoples , each with its own government , now we are so far apart that there are Two Cubas ? ours , and the one you picture to yourselves . And Two North Americas . too . Perhaps this would n't matter so much , were it not that we know our Cuba has become a new beginning in the Western Hemisphere , and maybe even in the world . It could be a new beginning for you , too . To most of us ? and we want you to know this above all else ? our new beginning is the very best thing that has ever happened to us . To some of us ? and we suppose to most of you ? much of it is uncertain , obscure , bewildering . But are n't new beginnings always like that ? We Cubans are traveling a road no peoples of the Americas have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , exactly where it leads . But we do fear that what you do and what you fail to do might well affect the question . And that does worry us ; for you see , it 's our destiny . To us , the question of Cuba is first of all the question of how we are going to live ? or even for how long . And you are involved in this , We do n't think you do understand who we are , how we got this way , what we are now trying to do , and what the obstacles along our road may be . Consider for a moment how it 's been that we 've known each other . Some of you came down to Havana ? tens of thousands , in fact , during the ' fifties . Some of you came down just to lie in the sun or on the beaches we Cubans were not allowed to use . But some of you came clown to gamble and to whore . We stood on our street corners and watched you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bleak , Yankee winter . We Cubans , like everyone else , we know all about sin , being Catholics of a sort . But in the old Havana , organized sin meant big money for the few , and every filthy practice of the brothel for girls , twelve and fourteen years old , fresh from the bohios , the huts where they lived with their families . Maybe you do n't know two facts about the gambling and the whoring . A lot of that money ended up in the pockets of a corrupt Cuban government , which your government and some of your businessmen supported and helped . Also much of it ended up in the pockets of your gangsters from Chicago and New York and Los Angeles . Nobody knows how many of our sisters were whores in Cuba during the last years of the Batista tyranny . As for the gambling , it was not convenient for anyone to keep records , but slot machines in the tens of thousands were everywhere in the Island . It was a thorough and complete racket , controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tyranny . And whatever Cuba has been in all these respects , you helped make it that : by your support of ' ' our " government , by your gangsters who were in on it , and by the patronage and the whims of your rich tourists . Well , that 's over , Yankee , please know that : we 've made laws and we 're sticking to them , with guns in our hands . Our sisters are not going to be whores for Yankees any more . So anyway ? you knew us as tourists know people ? and that 's not knowing very much . F 0 R the rest , how have you known us ? By what your newspapers and magazines have said about us . And about this , we Cubans are very sure of one fact : Most of your newspapers and magazines , they have lied to you , and they are lying to you now . A lot of people in the world who are n't limited to Time magazine and the Hearst papers , and listening to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know something of the truth about Cuba today . They 're getting to know that your press on Cuba is about as real as your quiz programs have been . They are both full of outrageous lies which may fool Yankees but do n't fool anyone else . Anyway , off and on , you 've been hearing about Latin America since yolfwere in high school , and we know how boring it 's been to you . But you ca n't afford to ignore us any longer . For now our history is part of your present . And now some of the American future is ours , too , as well as yours . You say , or you think , " We have n't done anything to you Cubans . " Well , that is just not true : look at the history of our two countries , how they 've been involved with each other , First , in 1848 , you tried to buy Cuba outright , for $100 million . You tried again a few years later . But Spain would n't sell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South wanted Cuba for slavery . And when they could n't buy it , some U. S. envoys issued the " Ostend Manifesto . " Cuba , it said , was geographically part of the United States : if the United States could not buy it , " by every law , human and divine , the United States has the right to take it by force . " It did n't conic off : Cuba remained under the Spanish yoke ; and against that yoke we kept on revolting . In the late 1860s we began an uprising that lasted for the next ten years ; we demanded that the slaves be freed and that Cubans govern their own island . But still the slaves were not freed ? until twenty years later ? and Cuba was not independent . Then finally in 1895 , inspired by Jose Marti , Cubans made an insurrection and tens of thou . sands of soldiers sent from Spain could n't cope with our guerrillas . The next year , the Spanish sent a big general ? he " turned Cuba into a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But also many Spanish soldiers died . True , for a long time , Cubans failed ; true , our countryside was laid waste ; true , out of our misery Yankee businessmen made money . They bought land cheap after our devastation , In the last twenty years of the nineteenth century , Yankee bankers went all out for sugar plantations . By 1896 they had about $30 million of our property . Also , they bought up Cuban mines ? iron , nickel , manganese . Bethlehem Steel and the Rockefeller interests ? they began to buy us up . By the time this century began , the Yankees owned 550 million worth of Cuban sugar land , and tobacco , and mines . Meanwhile , what were we Cubans doing ? Working , as usual , when we could get the work . But also fighting Spain for our independence , and dying for that . The rest of Latin America , most of it , had already thrown off the old Spanish yoke , decades before , but Cubans were still rising against them at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yankee Marines . Our revolutions in Cuba ? first against Spain , then against the Yankees ? they 've come closer together than in most of Latin America . We are the last of the nineteenth-century revolutions and , maybe , the first of the twentieth-century ones , unless you count Mexico . But back to our history for a 54 " LISTEN , YANKEE " moment . At first we thought you were going to help us to be really free ? built did n't turn out that way . In 1901 , the U. S. forced upon us something called the Platt Amendment , which simply took away our sovereignty . It gave Yankees " the right " to come into Cuba with guns in their hands if they wanted to , to intervene to see to it that the government here was protecting Yankee property . And that 's just what they did . The first time was before the Platt Amendment , in 1899 . One of your generals and his troops occupied our island ? after we had just about whipped the Spanish who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1902 , leaving behind the right to have a naval base ? for $2,000 or $3,000 a year ! ? at our Guantanamo Bay ; as we write to you , in August 1960 ? the base is still here . But you did it again and again : Yankee troops came in 1906 . Again in 1912 . Again in 1917 . And in 1920 you controlled our government directly , without even using your own troops . Violence and cash , cash and violence . Can you understand why we might believe they are all Yankees think about ? The dollar and the flag , they were all mixed up together . In the late ' nineties only 10 per cent of our sugar production came through mills owned by Yankees . Just before the first world war , about one-third . By the middle ' twenties , the figure was two-thirds . Corrupted Cuban politicians and your absentee capitalists , they got together . Our politicians were grafters and lackeys ; your capitalists were upright , honorable men in New York , who paid off the grafters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We were the vassals of both . It was n't what we did or what we did n't do that was making our history and our way of life . It was what was decided in the Directors ' Rooms on lower Manhattan . And we did n't even know those men . We never saw them . J U S T before our revolution , those men in the Directors ' Rooms on lower Manhattan controlled more than 90 per cent of our electricity and telephones ; about half of what was called our " public service " railroads ; some 40 per cent of our sugar land ; and practically all our oil . They dominated two-thirds of our imports . And the Cuban government ? ? well , your government and corporations had much to do with that and at times ran it outright . Sometimes the truth is simple : those who ruled us were mainly incompetent despots , venal grafters ? and often , especially toward the end , bloody butchers . Revolutions usually exaggerate the evils of the old order . We Cubans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the army in 1933 , and with it he seized the government of Cuba . Your government " recognized " him as the true government of Cuba almost immediately . The Yankees did n't intervene then , you can be sure , and he ruled over us , with the power of the army , for ten years . Then again , in 1952 , after the war for the Four Freedoms was all over and done with , Batista came back into power . Very soon then his blood-bath began . Before we threw Batista out , late in 1958 , this butcher and his gangsters , trained by your military missions . using weapons your government gave to him . had murdered some 20,000 Cubans . To Batista , anyone who was against him , anyone who complained out loud about anything , was A Dirty Communist . And always his answer was the same : torture them , mutilate them , kill them all . In Havana alone , God only knows how many men and boys were castrated ; and when women were raped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the same excuse : " The Dirty Communists , they are trying to take over our fine little democracy . " While all this was going on , in the 1950s ? just yesterday , it seems to us ? for four and a half years , the Eisenhower-Nixon government sold bombs and war planes and bullets and guns to this gangster and dictator . They always said it was for Hemispheric Defense . But those weapons were used to kill Cubans . And that 's one reason why it is that whenever we Cubans hear talk about " Hemispheric Defense , " we shudder . Your Ambassadors ? hear their names , Yankee . and send them to disgrace ! ? Mr. Arthur Gardner and Mr. Earl E. T. Smith ? did they tell you what was going on ? Did they tell you about the inhuman outrages , or did they just watch the sugar quotations ? Did your radios , your newspapers . all your TVs. did they tell you all about how bombs made in the U. S. A. were used to kill thousands of Cubans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did they tell you that shortly after those bombings , the United States Air Force decorated the Cuban general of Batista who directed those air attacks ? And if they did tell you , Yankee , what did you do ? If we Cubans have " gone to extremes , " know this : so have you Yankees . We 've been involved with each other in extremist ways . The abuses printed in Cuba against the Yankees have been all overbalanced by the abuses printed in the United States against us Cubans . On both sides , some of these statements are extreme , maybe even absurd . But much that we 've said against you is simply the plain , miserable truth , and we know it is because we have lived it ; and you do n't know it because you have not lived it . Our country , our Cuba , it was simply a political colony of the United States at least until F. D. R. , and even after that . Our Cuba , our country , it was simply an economic colony of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Cuba was a place of misery and filth , illiteracy and exploitation and sloth ? a caricature of a place for human habitation . ( Between 1902 and 1958 only one new school was built in Havana . ) And it is out of all that , the Cuban revolution is struggling . Keep that big fact in mind , Yankee , write it into your conscience , when you read about what 's happening in Cuba today . W E CUBANS have had a highly visible standard of living ? and of starving and dying , too ? but you did n't see that . We did . And that 's what our revolution is all about . Our revolution is not about your fight with Russia , or about Communism , or Hemispheric Defense , or any of all that : all those words came later , partly forced down our throat by your government and your monopolies . Point number one , Yankee , is that our revolution is about our old Cuban standard of starving and our new Cuban standard of living . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are building , at breakneck speed , an entirely new society , and we did n't inherit much to build it with from the old order in Cuba . From that we inherited disorder and grief . Were in a fluid moment and everything 's at stake ; like the men in the Sierra Maestra , now a whole nation of Cubans , we 're camping out . Our soil and climate are among the best in the world ; you can grow almost anything . But we could n't even grow enough to feed ourselves . The reason is simple : we could n't use our land for the kind of diversified agriculture we needed . We had to import 70 per cent of all we ate at high prices we could n't afford . Why ? Less than one-tenth of all the farms in Cuba held over two-thirds of the land . Rut again , why ? Sugar . Until 1934 , the United States companies that bought Cuban sugar paid the same price as the companies of all other countries . But in that year your quota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beet sugar . A tariff was not enough : your producers could n't compete on the world market . So the U. S. withdrewfrom the world market , setting up special prices higher than this market . Many people think that the U. S. was making a present to Cuba by this quota price . But that 's not true . You have to look not only at the traffic in sugar , but at ail the economic transactions between Cuba and the U. S. A. When you do that , you see at once that in re-turn for the sugar quota , as it were , U. S. exporters to Cuba got such an advantage that no one else could compete with them . Producers of sugar in Cuba were given a higher import price , but because of an advantageous tariff , U. S. exporters to Cuba were able to take back any benefit the quota system might have produced . In the last ten years of the tyranny , despite its tiny economy , Cuba lost some one billion dollars to the United States . To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cuba 's sugar production was in the hands of the U. S. monopolies . Now of course , all sugar is produced in Cuban mills , and so the economic benefit of all Cuban sales is Cuba 's . Were coming out from under , Yankee . Our revolution is already economic construction . For the first time in the history of Cuba , the rural population is going to have ? this is just an example ? plenty of chicken to eat at prices they can afford . Who is raising these chickens : People who just yesterday were squatting in miserable bohios between the highway and the cane fields . We 've built houses for these people with floors and toilets in them , and they 've helped build the long sheds of pole and straw matting for the baby chickens . Who 's for the revolution ? Those people who are now raising chickens . Who 's for the revolution ? The people who are eating the chickens these people are raising . You see how it 's working ? We are going to do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lard we import from you and raising our own peanuts for the good oil in them . We Cubans , we 're a do-it-yourself outfit . We 're not capitalists and we 're not building a capitalist society in Cuba today . Neither are we building a Stalinist society . We ourselves do n't know quite what to call what we are building , and we do n't care . It is , of course , Socialism of a sort . We 're not a bit afraid of that word ? and why ever should you be ? There is one more thing that you must understand about us young intellectuals who 've led this Cuban revolution : Since we did not belong to the old left intelligentsia who had gone through Communism and 36 " LISTEN , YANKEE " been disillusioned with Stalinism and with the purges and the trials and the thirty-five years of all that , we 've had one enormous advantage as revolutionaries : We 've not gone through all that terribly destructive process ; we have not been wounded by it . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have all that cynicism and futility about what we 're doing and about what we feel must be done . That 's the big secret of the Cuban revolutionary . We arc new men , and we are not afraid to do what must be done in Cuba . We 're always acting with reference to one master aim : to make Cuba economically sovereign and economically prosperous . We do n't want to be anyone 's satellite . So we 're increasing and diversifying our production and our consumption ? especially in our agriculture ; we 're doing the same with our export markets and our sources of supply from abroad ; and were beginning to industrialize our island at the same time as we are immediately improving our standard of living . Think about our economic way Like this : At one extreme ? say , Stalin 's old way ? the agricultural problem was n't solved and there was very little consumer-goods industry ; everything went into big heavy industry ? for the future . And there were no friends 10 help the Soviet Union economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's way in Argentina ? agriculture was left in a stale condition ; there was no heavy industry and no real planning for it . Practically everything went into the consumer-goods industry . Also , Perlin had no friends to help him economically . In Cuba , we 've just about solved the agricultural problem by our land reform : we 've increased production and greatly diversified what we are growing . For instance , we 're going to get cellulose from our wasted sugar cane , and we 're going to make paper . We 're putting great energies into consumer-goods industries . Already the benefits are showing up in our everyday lives . At the same time , we 're doing some work on heavier industry , and we 're planning it carefully with an eye to our own resources and markets . And in this respect , we do have friends who are helping us . So we do n't have to be in such a hurry that we 'll sacrifice a generation to get industry ; we do n't have to do that , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your own mind about Cuba , here are some things you 've got to know : First of all , we Cubans are part of Latin America ? not North America . We speak Spanish , we are mainly rural , and we are poor , Our history is , part of Latin American history . And Latin America is over 180 million people , growing faster than you are growing , and scattered over a territory more than twice as large as the U. S. A. Second , unlike most of Latin America , we Cubans have done something about exploiters from your country in Cuba and about our own Cuban exploiters of Cubans too . We mean business , your kind of business first of all : economic business for us . Your corporations and your government , they do n't like what we 've done and what we 're doing . But ? here 's our third point ? we are not alone . T OD A V the Revolution is going on in Cuba . Tomorrow it is going to go on elsewhere . A revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? although it takes that , too . Revolutions in our time come out of misery , out of conditions like those of the old Cuba . Where such conditions continue and there 's a mountain nearby , there 'll be revolutions . That is why this continent is going to become the scene of convulsions you 've never dreamed of . You ca n't buy off revolutions with $500 million of aid . You can only buy off some Latin American governments ? and for that , it 's far too much money ; they can be bought much cheaper ! What will happen when the people of all those South American countries realize their enormous wealth and yet find themselves poor ; then looking across to tiny Cuba , they see that Cubans are not poor ? What will happen then ? We are all part of " Western Civilization " ? so we 've always been told . But are we really ? All of us ? Today we Latin zlirzericans die at the average age of thirty-five . You Yankees live until you 're past sixty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolivia and Peru and Venezuela , and yesterday in Cuba ? are they part of the same " Western Civilization " as you ? If so , is n't it a curious kind of a civilization in which such things go on ? As long as they do go on , perhaps we Latin Americans had better realize that the people of whom we are a part are not part of whatever civilization you North Americans belong to . Hunger is hunger . To ( lie before you reach thirty-five in Central America while working for the Fruit Company is not so different from dying in South Africa while working in a diamond mine . Disease is disease . And not to be able to read is the same in any language : it is to be a people without history ; it is to be only half a man . Almost half of us Latin Americans are such primitive creatures ? we are illiterate . What does " The Free World " of the Yankees mean to us ? If you still think that we are members of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization ? whatever it means to you ? then perhaps you 'd better find out what is going on within what you take to he its confines . Many of us know only the confines . Y 0 U R power and wealth , Yankee ? that 's why it seems so crazy to us when your government says to us , as it has been saying , that our Cuban government is following " . . . a pattern of relentless economic aggression ... against the United States . . . . " Now is n't that slightly ridiculous ? We arc about six million people , you are 180 million . You 're approximately two hundred times richer than we . You spend more in a year for lipstick and things like that than all of us down here earn for a full year 's work . Anyhow , it 's time you knew that all over the world there 's been building up the hatred of what your government and your corporations have been doing . Most of that hate has had no chance to come to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more will . About two years ago ? remember ? ? your Vice President tried to make a good-will tour of South America . In many countries , Mr. Nixon and his company were often jeered at and the questions put to him got sharper and sharper . In Caracas , capital of oil-rich , poor-people Venezuela , the rocks thrown at him got as big as melons ; his limousine was attacked . Later that day , the army of Venezuela broke up demonstrations " with bayonets and tear gas . " Then Yankee Marines and Paratroopers were dispatched to Caribbean bases . There have been many more such incidents , some reported , others not . But in the spring and summer of 19G0 , the results of what you 're doing and what you 're leaving undone really began to show up ? dramatically , violently . In South Korea , on Taiwan , on Okinawa , in Japan . That 's not the complete list But why are we blaming you for all this ? Because of your power , first of all , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , if you do not act , you are acting . Do n't you see that ? Now you are the main target of this trouble and this hate . All those tells of millions of people , they did n't just happen to pick on Yankees . They had some reasons , maybe wrong reasons ? some of them ? but do you even know what their reasons were ? Have you ever tried to find them out ? Tomorrow the returns from what you fail to do , everywhere in the hungry-nation bloc , will be even more evident . But will they be obvious enough to distract you from the energetic pursuit of your private affairs ? That 's a real question for us Latin Americans . It 's also a question about world history ? today and tomorrow ? a world history of which we are all a part , whether we want to be or not . So things are riot under the easy old control , and your country ? and so you , too , if it is your country any more ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy-going Yankees have never dreamed of . B U T listen , Yankee : Does it have to be that way ? Is n't it up to you ? Is n't at least some of it up to you ? As you think about that , please remember this : Because we have been poor , you must not believe we have lost our pride . You must not believe we have no dignity , no honor , no fight . If you do n't ace this , it is going to be a very bad time of troubles for us all . Do n't you see that events all over the world demand that you think , feel , act ? We Cubans do n't take satisfaction in the fact that we are the center of the Cold War in the Caribbean . We do n't like the Cold War anywhere ? who does ? We do n't want to be the Western Hungary ? who does ? But we are glad , we have to be glad , that finally many things that must be done are now being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to make you under-stand ? Can we say : Become aware of our agonies and our aspirations ? If you do , it will help you to know what is happening in the world . Take Cuba as the case ? the Case in which to establish the way you are going to act when there are revolutions in hungry countries everywhere in the world . In terms of Cuba , think again about who you are , Yankee . And find out what Cuba . our Cuba , means . We are one of the vanguards of the hungry peoples . I.ike al vanguards , what we 've done , what we 're doing , what we 're going to do ? it puts us on a perilous road . We may fail . will all end .
