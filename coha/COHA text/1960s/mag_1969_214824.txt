In an era of acquisitive conglomerates and breathless corporate mergers , San Francisco 's Levi Strauss &; Co. is something of an anomaly . It is a privately owned , family-controlled company that has become successful almost entirely by internal expansion . Just how successful became known only last week . Issuing the first public financial report in its 119-year history , the behemoth of blue jeans announced that it earned $12.1 million in 1968 on sales of $196.8 million . That record makes it one of the nation 's half-dozen biggest apparel manufacturers . <P> The disclosure was prompted by a Securities and Exchange Commission requirement that large privately held firms issue such information if they have more than 500 shareholders . Levi Strauss now comes under that ruling because it has been making a growing number of its employees eligible for the company 's employee stock-purchase program . About two-thirds of its stock is held by 43 family members and trusts , with the balance in the hands of 480 employees . The shareholders have benefited from expansion that has doubled sales every five years since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades ago is today worth $60,000 . <P> Something Basic . The business was founded by Levi Strauss , a Bavarian peddler who followed the gold rush to California in 1850 . He saw a demand for trousers strong enough to withstand the rigors of mining . Using bolts of tent canvas , he devised what quickly came to be known around San Francisco as " those pants of Levi 's . " Over the years , denim replaced canvas , and Levi 's acquired their distinctive indigo-blue color and low-slung design . Strauss , a bachelor , died in 1902 , leaving the company to four nephews . <P> Before World War II , Levi Strauss was a $10 million-a-year firm with operations largely west of the Mississippi . After the war , it moved eastward . Then , recalls Walter Haas Jr. , 53 , a great-grand-nephew of the founder and the firm 's president since 1958 , " we did something very basic . We began concentrating on the teen-age market . " As its youthful customers grew older , the company kept their trade by bringing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men 's casual wear . Last year it introduced " Levi 's for gals , " a line complete with miniskirts , culottes and shirts . <P> Levi Strauss owes part of its growth to a willingness to gamble that Haas insists has been possible only because the company is privately held . Possibly the boldest move occurred in 1964 , when the company became one of the first to manufacture permanent-press clothes , which it now sells in 60 countries . The company intends to keep its ownership concentrated . Whenever an employee leaves , he is required to sell his stock back to the company .
