Ladies and Gentlemen A story by Muriel Spark Past the Cathedral , past the " Fighting Cocks " which will not be open till six , past the ice-cream stand , past the mill-race , past the lake which was once a monastic fish-pond , they come . June Flinders is her name , Bill Dobson his . St. Albans on the ancient site of Verulam is the place . Arm in arm they advance toward us . In reality , it happened a year ago . I am glad it is in the past . Miss Flinders was still a student at a university in the north of England . Mr. Dobson was a teacher of domestic science at a technical college in the midlands . They had met at a holiday course . Yes , there was a Mrs. Dobson but she was as far from their thoughts as the end of this tale is from yours . They dallied awhile by the mill-race , leaning over the bridge . A cow came down and stepped daintily into the water farther up where the river was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own shadow , she stood and accepted the cool water about her feet . Where the stream broke up noisily at the mill-race a few barefoot boys were playing . Neither Rine nor Bill were fond of children , but they felt pleasantly inclined towards these boys . Because they were two together , illicitly , and in secret , asentiment of indulgence entered their hearts and caused them to buy five threepenny cones at the kiosk , and distribute them among the children . The boys took the ice-creams and deserted the mill-stream right away . Either they did not want to be watched or they felt that the cones were a hint for them to move off . " Do n't go , boys , " said Bill . But that finished it . They recognised the teacher in him , and went . " It must be funny , " said June , " suddenly inheriting a fortune . " He was glad she had opened the subject . There was something he wanted to tell her . " I could n't believe it , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , " said June . " / showed Maisie the letter . Maisie could n't believe it , " he said , " at first . " A look of sad reflection overcame June 's face . Maisie was Bill 's wife and June felt sad and reflective whenever she was mentioned . Moreover , this expression was one to which June was adapted la% nature . She wore her light hair parted in the middle and drawn back in a bun , and she had rather a long white nose , and you will understand how the dolorous look fitted in with the whole . She pursued the subject , however . " It will make it easier when we break the news , " said June . " Yes , " he replied eagerly , " that 's the important thing about the money . Maisie wo n't be dependent upon me , now or later . " " As a matter of fact , June , " he said , " I have left her the lot in my will . I 'm sure you will agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But of course we shall have enough to live on , June . Only , I thought it only right , June , to leave her the lot in my will . It will make it easier when we break the news . " " The lot ? " said June . " Yes , " said Bill . " It will make it easier for us , you see . " " It 's a great deal of money , " said June . " The tax would come off it , the death duties , " he said pacifically . ' But we 've got our life ahead of us , and who knows who will die first ? " " Do n't let 's talk about it , " he added . " Let 's live and make the most of it , " he added . Bill was forty-two . To June , who was eighteen , he did not seem to have his life ahead of him . But then , she was in love with Bill , surely that was all that mattered . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Botany , with this exception , that Bill had run away with her and the Professor of Botany had not and never would . It worried June that Bit had not made a clean break with his wife . Indeed , Maisie knew nothing about her husband 's romance , and fancied he was gone to give a series of lectures . " I wish you had made a clean break with Maisie , " said June . " I always hate deception in cases like this , " ' Why , " said Bill , have you done it before ? " " Oh no , " said June swiftly , " I just meant that I always hate deception . " June had not done it before . This worried her . They had left their luggage in the hotel bedroom . Bill had signed " Mr. and Mrs. Dobson " in the book . Suppose he ceased to want to live with her always ? Suppose he only wanted her for one thing ? If he only wanted her for that , it would explain why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards . What a muddle ! " I always hate deception , " June repeated . " I thought we should see how we get on together before doing anything final , " Bill was careless enough to say . " So you are not going to leave her in any case ! " said June . " You said it was all over between you in any . case , " said June . " It is , " said Bill . " It is . " " Bill , " she said , " will you do something for me ? " " Of course , " he said . " Just for tonight , " she said , " I 'd rather we did n't  --  I 'd prefer not to  --  I mean let 's not ? " June sought round in her mind for the correct phrase . She was anxious to convey her meaning without seeming either coarse or prim . With relief she lit on the words she had read in the papers . " I would rather intimacy did not take place tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were some very surprising elements in June . " Do n't you want to stop at the hotel ? " he said . " Oh yes , " said June impatiently , " but I 'd rather we waited . Do n't you see . It 's a very important and big thing for me . " " Tomorrow night , though , " she added , with a searching look at Bill . " That 's all right , " said Bill , who was still a bit bewildered . " If you do n't want to come across with it ? " " I mean , " he said , checking himself , " if you would rather wait , my dear , then naturally I will respect your wishes . " " I hope , " he said , warming to the idea , " I hope that I am man enough for that . And I love you very dearly , June . " June felt relieved . She would have liked to go on about the final break with Maisie , but she thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Roman wall , " she suggested . She had thought it wiser to wait before mentioning Maisie again . However , she was only eighteen and very excited . " I 'm only eighteen and very excited , what with it all , " she told herself . In a few seconds she was back on the subject of Maisie . " Have you made a settlement on Maisie ' ? " she enquired . " Because I hope you will make her a small income . Have you done that ? " " Yes , " said Bill . " Sufficient for her needs ? " said June . " They ca n't be much , she has n't any children . " " Yes , " said Bill . The most recent of Muriel Spark 's seven novels is " The Girls of Slender Means . " Born in Edinburgh , Miss Spark lives in London but spends the winter months in New York . She also writes poetry , criticism , and plays and has been editor of " The Poetry Review . " 62 LADIES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She was thinking of the best way to frame this question when Bill spoke again . " I must remember to send a liver to my old cousin Leonard . He lives near this place , in fact . At Bricket Wood . " " Who is he ? " said June . " Oh , I hope we sha n't meet him . " " Do n't worry . " Bill laughed . " He would n't recognise me . He 's been simple all his life . He lives all alone , poor old chap . " " I daresay he gets the old-age pension now , " Bill mused on . " Still , I must get Maisie to send him a fiver , now I can afford it . " " Why Maisie ? " said June . " Ca n't you do it yourself ? " " I do n't know his address , " said Bill . " Maisie knows it . She has kept up with him . Out of charity , you know . " " Maisie has got her better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stress his point . " I 'll say that for her , darling . " " Oh , everyone 's got their good side , " said June , looking at him anxiously . " But she sounds a terror otherwise . " " Yes , " said Bill . " I 'm afraid she is a terror . But I 'm going to buy my freedom now , at last . " " Come on , " he said , " let 's go and look at the Roman wall . " He took a few paces forward and stopped . " Stop , " he said . About fifty yards ahead , on the left side of the path facing the lake , was a bench . It was placed on a small raised bank under a hawthorn . A man and a woman were seated on the bench . Owing to the bending sprays of hawthorn , it was impossible to see their faces properly . " That looks like Maisie , " he said . " I 'm not sure , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . " " Oh , no ! " she said . " Oh , Bill ! " she said , " I 'm going back to the town . " " Do n't be silly , " he said . " I 'm not at all certain it is Maisie . It just looks a bit like her . I ca n't quite see the face . But I 'm certain she never comes here . " " Maybe she has come to see your old cousin , " said June . " Oh , let me get back , quick . " " That 's possible , " said Bill . " It might be old Leonard . with her there . But I 'm sure she would have told me she was coming . " " I 'm going , " said June . " No . Wait here . Do n't panic , " said Bill . " I 'll find out . " " It might all get into the papers , " said June . " My name and all , " " It wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alas , however , it got into the papers . But I anticipate . In their present predicament , Bill kept his head . " Wait here , " he repeated . " I 'll skirt round that wooden but and get a look at their faces . I 'll soon see if the woman is Maisie or not . " Idaresay that even if you know the place you will not remember the wooden hut . It is a modest building situated on the lake side of the path , about halfway between the mill-race and the bench where the couple were seated . It is a building less crude than it looks . Perhaps it was built to look rustic , with its rough overlaid planks . It is lined with brick . All round this simple structure is a narrow space fenced off with wavy wire . You may enter this enclosure at either end . accordingly as you are a Gentleman or a Lady . These two ends are separated by a shaky fence . It is doubtful if Bill noticed this . In any case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wooden door marked Gentlemen , began to skirt round the building with his eyes fixed on the bench . He could not make out their faces . Keeping close to the wooden walls he passed under the Gentlemen 's windows . Still he could not see the couple on the bench . The hawthorn tree was still in the way . If , at first , he had observed what the building was , he had by now forgotten it . He was intent on seeing the occupants of that bench . It took him three movements to climb over the wire separating the two ends of the enclosure . A second , and he was under the windows of the Ladies . Nearer , nearer , he creeps . Yes  --  it is Maisie ! But , is it ? No . She has no hat on . Maisie always wears a hat . It is not Maisie . But look  --  she is holding her hat ! Yes , and is n't that old Leonard there beside her , with his mouth wide open ? To make quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagging wire . He gripped the ledge of one of the Ladies ' windows ; he placed his hand on the ledge of another Ladies ' window . Thus poised , he turned and got a clear view of the bench . It was Maisie ! It occurred to him how like June she looked ; older of course . Yes , and that was Leonard sitting all slack and silly beside her ! Thus poised , he surveyed them , calculating his retreat with June , They had better leave the town . No one would see them . Thus poised , he a story by Muriel Spark 63 signalled to June ; and thus it was that they caught him . Advance warning of the ensuing disturbance came with a fanfare of outraged shrieks from inside the building . There was a splash followed by a child 's loud yell . " Hold him ? " said a thin wiry woman , rushing out of the Ladies , " the dirty Peeping Tom , the swine ! " She got hold of Bill 's feet , and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose , floored him . June turned and started to run for it . " Wait here , you ! " shouted the wiry woman . " Stop her , someone . She 's a witness . " A middle-aged couple caught at June , who did not resist . " I know nothing about it , " she said . " I saw nothing , " she said . " Did n't you ? " said the thin woman . " Well , I did . " " So did I , " said one of the girls . " He was peeping into the Ladies . Broad daylight , too . " " Low ! " said the middle-aged man . " I call it low . You hold him down while I get a policeman . " Three more women had emerged from the Ladies , a-tremble with the fuss . One woman held a little girl under her arm , and with her other arm she wielded her handbag , landing it on Bill 's upturned face . " Let me get up , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , you sneaky peeper , " said the mother of the wailing child . " You 'll explain all right . You wait till my hubby hears of this . " " Ask my friend there , " gasped Bill , pointing to June . " Your friend ! " said a pretty young girl in riding clothes who had been inside the Ladies . " If she 's your friend , she 's for it too . Part of the game , she is , bet . " " With a face like hers , " added the girl inconsequently . " I did n't see anything , " said June helplessly . Bill managed to lean up on his elbows . The thin woman was sitting firmly on his legs . His feet were being secured by the child 's mother . As Bill saw the policeman approach , so also did he see Maisie arise from the bench . Curious about the little crowd which had gathered , Maisie ambled in her familiar casual way , over to where he was lying . Behind her shuffled Leonard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nonchalant stride ceased , as if brakes had been jammed on inside her . " Bill ! " she said . " This , " she informed the crowd haughtily , " is 64 my husband . Is he ill ? Make way for me if you please . " " Oh , is he ? " said the wiry woman . " Well , he 's been up to his tricks , the back-door squinter . " June made one more attempt to retreat . " You stop right there , " said the girl in riding clothes . The policeman arrived . " Stand up , " he said to Bill . It was a very distressing case . The mother of the small girl was the chief witness for the Prosecution . " I was out for a walk with my little girl , " she said in the witness-box , " and she wanted to go . I was holding her out when suddenly I saw the face of the accused at the window . " " I am afraid , " she added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go of Betty and poor little thing , she went right in . " " Was the child hurt ? " enquired the magistrate . " Well , there 's nothing to actually see , " said the mother . " But it ca n't be good for a child , a thing like that . " If it had been left to the other witnesses , the Prosecution might perhaps have lost the case . The girl in riding clothes let them down by saying she had only gone in to tidy up when she saw Bill at the window . The thin woman had only been putting her stockings straight when she saw Bill at the window . No one would say what they were really doing when they saw Bill at the window . Not that it made much difference . Peeping is peeping , no matter what you see . Still , they were glad of the mother of Betty to make a clear case of it . The magistrate spoke severely to Maisie , being under the impression that she was June . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle and pulled back into a bun , Maisie looked remarkably like her rival , as do so many women whose men can not really escape from them , but seek the same person in other arms . When the magistrate was put right as to the mistaken identity , he spoke severely to June . " You come to this town with another woman 's husband and condone his offence , " he said . " You even attempted to impersonate , " he added , " this good , this honest woman . " Bill was fined ? 10 with an option of three weeks . June emigrated to Australia to forget . Maisie went to the hairdresser without telling a soul , and had her hair style changed in favour of something softer . Bill went to his lawyer without telling a soul and had his will changed in favour of his simple cousin Leonard .
