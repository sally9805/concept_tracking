The trouble with many live-virus vaccines is that the viruses of which they are made multiply in the body in such away as to cause illness . As a result , some measles vaccines produce what seems like a mild case of measles ; some polio vaccines may make the vaccinee infectious to others . Virologists have long sought a way to deliver the live ( though possibly weakened ) virus of a vaccine into a part of the body where it will cause neither symptoms nor infection , but will still do its job of triggering antibody formation . <P> Last week Government doctors announced that they had turned the trick with a coated capsule that bypasses the respiratory system and releases a dried and purified version of the live virus in the intestine , where it multiplies and starts antibody production . The virus , called adenovirus Type 4 , causes a severe , grippe-like illness , and sometimes viral pneumonia , especially among raw recruits in military camps . <P> The capsule was perfected at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 126 men who took the capsules , not one came down with " cat fever " ( short for catarrhal fever ) , as the Navy calls the disease ; of 132 who got dummy capsules , 32 became ill enough to go to the hospital , and several developed pneumonia . <P> Despite overoptimistic claims , the new vaccine has no immediate bearing on the common cold , which is caused by a multitude of viruses that are only distantly , if at all , related to adenovirus 4 . What is hopeful , for possible vaccines against many other virus diseases , is the ingenious technique of roundabout vaccination.
