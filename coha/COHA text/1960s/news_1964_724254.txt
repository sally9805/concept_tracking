txt London The sad story of Sovereign 's misfortune off Newport , R.I. , could do Britain a world of good -- if the pain is remembered long enough and the remedy sought . As virtually every newspaper and journal of opinion in Britain has now observed , Sovereign did not lose for any one reason . The main , overriding reason is that in all the areas of technical skill involved in building a racing yacht Sovereign is a decade behind the times . The shortcomings are in such things as textiles , metallurgy , and aerodynamics as well as in a comfortable attitude that victory does n't matter so long as the effort is gallant . The saddest part of all is that Sovereign is no better than her predecessor Sceptre of six years before . According to The Times , " The British effort does seem to exemplify a national tendency not only to fall behind other countries but also  --  which is worse  --  to remain unaware of doing so . " Thanks to Sovereign the unawareness has for the moment been punctured . A ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of present prosperity and Labor is promising more and better , and yet behind the scenes the leaders of both parties recognize that not even a miracle can keep Britain 's economy booming on up- wards as it is going now much beyond election day . The key election question really is whether the government dares let the economic boom go unchecked through polling day . After that , whichever party wins will have to put on the brakes because imports continue to run ahead of exports . A certain amount of exaggeration is acceptable in Western society anywhere during a political campaign . Few expect the leaders of the two British parties to be entirely candid before election day . Their omissions and commissions around the fringes of candor are no worse than those committed elsewhere and probably more or less balance each other off . But the election propaganda of both parties has drawn a rosy veil over the face of actuality . Let 's Both Agree To Some Other Tack Till After Election Day ' For example , both Tories and Labor promise a higher rate of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of construction has already run up against such a simple thing as a shortage of bricks . Both promise more rapid expansion of educational facilities  --  which both admit is long overdue  --  but new schools and universities are being generated now as fast as new teachers can be generated . And a school without teachers is futility . A A A Also even at the " slow " Tory rate of expanding housing , hospitals , schools , and all other amenities of " prosperity " the country is buying more than it is selling . The moment of truth lies somewhere ahead when either there will have to be less buying abroad or more selling abroad . That moment will not come as dramatically or as visibly as Sovereign 's , failure off Newport . But when it comes it will call for candor in the government of the day and the unfortunate necessity of telling the British people that they are living beyond their means . It is , of course , unreasonable to expect either Harold Wilson or Sir Alec Douglas-Home to emphasize during the euphoria of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The above is why among both Tory and Labor leaders there are those who contemplate the possibility of victory with mixed feelings .
