txt Some 20 Negro farmers huddled together at one end of a hot , dusty potato shed . They sat on wooden crates discussing " leadership qualities " and " human relationships . " At the far end of the low , barnlike building , another group made final repairs on a conveyor belt . The belt would soon be used in assorting , washing , and waxing the first shipment of sweet potatoes ever marketed by a cooperative comprised solely of poverty-stricken sharecroppers and farmers . " We just had to do something , " one elderly Negro said , explaining why the low-income , uneducated farmers had banded together to form a co-op . " The shipper only paid me 60 cents a crate for my potatoes last year , and it cost me more than that to get them out of the field . I had 2,835 crates . All together , I got about $900 last year , and I already owed that . We 've been living in the red , in the hole , for the past six years .

They do n't need us small farmers any more . " . A handful of these economically deprived " Cajun county " potato growers first began pondering almost a year ago the possibility of forming a " poor people 's cooperative . " By combining their resources and doing their own marketing they hoped to increase their profits and raise their standard of living above the poverty level . Their plan was to bypass the " middle men , " or shippers , whom they accused of making huge profits at the expense of the small farmers . Their plans reached sympathetic ears in Washington . A delegation of representatives from the Farmers Home Administration , the Farmers Cooperative Service , and the Office of Economic Opportunity traveled here earlier this year to confer with the farmers and survey their needs .

Today the Grand Marie Vegetable Producers Cooperative , Inc. , is a reality , and its membership is soaring . Within six weeks its membership jumped from 165 to 360 . The cooperative 's farmers are spread throughout five surrounding parishes ( counties ) . The FHA has promised the cooperative $152,000 for constructing a potato shed and for operating expenses . In the meantime , the // *Poverty farm co-op sets high goals in Louisiana // farmers are leasing a temporary shed and operating " on a shoestring . " Both the farmers here and officials in Washington seem optimistic about the new undertaking . Richard Berberich , a member of the Farmers Cooperative Service , says the sweet-potato co-op will be " a real breakthrough " if it succeeds . However , he stresses there are many possible pitfalls facing such a group . Mr. Berberich told the farmers after a two-week study of their conditions earlier this year that education must play a vital role in the co-op .

Long-range plans call for setting up a cannery , for increasing the co-op 's educational benefits , and for eventually branching out into marketing other vegetables . Although the co-op is ostensibly a racially integrated one , civil-rights leaders here in Louisiana say the predominantly Negro group " exemplifies " their concept of " black power . " John Zippert , a Congress of Racial Equal- ity ( CORE ) member who has worked closely with the co-op since its beginning , notes : " All of the bosses in the co-op are Negro , and all of the people we 've hired are Negroes . It 's already changed the Negroes ' viewpoints as to just what they 're capable of doing . We 've also been able to get a Negro potato inspector appointed , although it took us 10 months to do it . We have about 20 whites in the co-op . " Mr. Zippert envisions the co-op one day selling produce under its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities in the Midwest and North where we can create our own market among Negroes in the ghettos .
