More than 30 people in California 's Imperial County were bitten last week by dogs , many of which were certainly rabid . <P> At least 100 county residents were taking or had recently finished the tedious " Pasteur treatment " *-a series of 14 to 21 painful daily injections . Since Labor Day , 1,388 animals ( mostly dogs , but including 187 cats ) had been shot ( more than 200 last week ) on the suspicion that any animal at large might be rabid . That the suspicion was justified was shown in a check of 48 stray dogs picked up at Calexico in four days : 29 proved rabid . <P> Rabies is a disease that demands superlatives . Once it develops , it is invariably fatal . But it is completely preventable . The World Health Organization reported last week that Norway has had no case in animal or man since 1809 , Australia since 1867 , Britain since 1922 . In 1959 , the U.S. had five deaths through November . Prevention requires two rigorous steps : destruction of every rabid animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Vaccination of pets is a valuable added precaution . ) <P> Shoot at Sight . Imperial County 's problem is that , although its antirabies precautions have long matched the U.S. average , it faces an abnormal hazard-an estimated 25,000 stray dogs across the border in Mexicali ( pop . 175,000 ) , capital of Baja California Norte , Mexico 's newest state . An eight-mile fence , 8-ft. high , between Calexico and Mexicali , does not keep the beasts out , mainly because they trot through the border control post alongside cars . <P> The current border-jumping epidemic began Labor Day , when one rabid dog bit a man and a child . It built up gradually . Imperial County was quarantined and declared a rabies area in early November . <P> Any animal not on a leash became fair game . First day , 40 dogs and 20 cats were shot . " They 've gone crazy , " complained one man . " My wife hollered , ' Do n't shoot ! ' but they shot my Labrador retriever four times with a shotgun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tag on . " Unsentimental health officers literally stuck to their guns . <P> Heads in the Reefer . Dozens of dogs have been proved rabid , and in the county health department 's refrigerator at El Centro there is a big backlog of heads from destroyed animals . Microbiologist Ella Capers Weston has not had time to check them all , has sent an overflow to state laboratories in Berkeley . At least 15 people have been bitten by dogs now known to have been rabid ; scores of others have had to take the vaccine injections before the biters ' rabidity could be established . Microbiologist Weston has taken them too . <P> In Calexico , a door-to-door check was in progress to make sure that every dog or cat was vaccinated against rabies . In Mexicali. health officers opened vaccination clinics for dogs , got 5.000 vaccine doses from the Pan American Health Organization . It looked like too little , too late ; more than 600 residents had been bitten , of whom 425 had taken shots . Casualty reports were feared daily . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enough . Said Calexico 's City Health Officer Al Brooks : ' ' If we get by without a few people dying from rabies , it will be a miracle . " <P>
