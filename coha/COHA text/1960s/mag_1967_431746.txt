 | Basic Rooms You Can Add to Any House . Within 10 years the average family out grows the two- or three-bedroom house of optimistically purchased to last until the chit dren are grown and gone away . The choice then , is between buying a larger house at considerably greater cost per square foot enlarging the house you have . Here are two modular rooms ? one square . one oblong . Either can be attached to the back , side , or front of most styles of houses . The modular units are four-foot-square areas that permit construction without waste . That 's because standard-size materials fit the modules evenly . For instance , plywood and composition board come in 4 ' - by -S ' sheets ; concrete blocks lay up to 8 " - by- 8 " - by-16 " dimensions and fit in the module without cutting . The drawings and blueprints here show how you can add one of these two rooms to your house , doing the work yourself if you wish . But , as noted on the blueprint , you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an architect . With it on can ask for contractors ' bids and file for building permit . The footings must be poured on undisturbed earth and below the frost line ? the depth to which the ground freezes in winter . Since this varies considerably north to south , check building authorities regarding the proper depth . It 's a good idea to put ) 1 " reinforcing , rods in the footings . If you 're using pouredconcrete foundation walls , place greased two-by-fours in the middle of the top of iENCE  | foorings . The groove left when a two-by-four is removed keys the poured wall in place . Easiest and cheapest , particularly for a do-it-yourself job , is to use cement blocks for the foundation walls . Lay them in mortar on top of the footings , making them high ugh to put the new floor even with the house floor . If your land drops off steeply from the house , the cheapest way to put a foundation under a new room may be to mount it on pillars with an open area beneath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pillars may be either poured concrete or cement blocks . .  | A polyethylene vapor barrier laid on the earth and partly up the sides of the foundation walls prevents condensation on the joists and helps keep insects out . A two-by-six sill is held by bolts embedded in the foundation walls 8 ' on center , or in cement-filled openings in the block . Heavy galvanized mesh or expanded metal at joints under the blocks into which the anchor bolts will be embedded will hold the cement . The %-by-20 " bolts , threaded ends up , should project above the foundation wall about 3 " . Put a termite shield of sheet aluminum between the top of the foundation wall and the sill . Extend it an inch or more on each side of the wall and bend the ends down 45 degrees . The two-by-eight joists are toenailed to the sill and held on edge with cross bridging . Over the joists nail ' , " CD or CS plywood subflooring . Around the edge of the floor nail a two-by-four sole plate , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet-metal anchors for the studs . Note also , on the framing elevations , oneby-three diagonal bracing which must be let into the studs . Horizontally above the studs , nail two two-by-four plates as a base for the ceiling joists . Space the joists 16 " on center and use cross bridging every 8 ' . For outside sheathing , use one-by-eights applied diagonally , or Ii " CD plywood sheathing . Cover the sheathing with building paper and put on the siding . For best appearance , use the same kind of siding as is on your house . Frame in and enclose the room before erecting the inside partitions . Some ideas on how both rooms can be divided are illustrated , but you may  | have ideas of your own . If so , lay out your arrangement to scale on graph paper . Also draw to scale the furniture in each room . Use two-by-six rafters for the gable and shed roofs ; put collar beams across every pair of rafters on a gable roof or ties on a shed roof . Notch the rafters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling joists to the rafters . Sheathe the roof with ' 2 " CS wood . Over this put roll felt , then col position or wood shingles . Instead of p wood sheathing you can , of course , use 1 ' by-S " roofers or ii " weather-tight composition sheathing without underlayment . For roofs of less than 4-12 pitch . shingles should not be used because wind and rain can get under them . A low-pitched shed roof or a flat no , ' should be made of built-up roll roofing If you 're doing the work yourself you 'll save time and effort by buving both windows and doors as complete units . Some doors now come in a frame you can quickly install in an opening you have left in the house framing Some modern window units include storm and screen elements already built in . If you buy both the windows and doors in advance , you 'll know what size to make the openings . You should install them before the siding is on . Be sure to use double studs around window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Install double lintels on edge for greater strength . Use batt insulation for both ceiling and walls . Always put the vapor seal toward the warm side of the room and staple the flanges to stud and rafters . A shed- or gable-roof addition needs ventilating louvers in the end walls , too . For the interior walls , use gypsum board or prefinished paneling . You can put these on yourself . If your furnace has the capacity , heating can be brought in from the main house . If not , consider space heaters or electric heat . Ask electric-company engineers to estimate monthly costs . @#
