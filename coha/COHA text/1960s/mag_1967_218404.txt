In the coastal city of Ulsan last week , old and new Korea came into symbolic confrontation . The spring mists filtering across the landscape were mixed for the first time with ammonia clouds , and Korean farmers wearing traditional costumes stood side by side with businessmen and government officials in trim , Western-style business suits . All had gathered for the dedication of the Korea Fertilizer Co. ' s new urea plant , which , with an annual capacity of 330,000 tons of fertilizer , will be one of the world 's largest . Presiding over the ceremonies , suitably enough , was Byung Chull Lee , 57 , the plant 's owner , who is the richest and by far the most controversial businessman in South Korea . <P> Grace &; Karate Chops . Lee 's approach to business is a combination of Oriental grace and karate chops ; the combination has made enemies for him ever since he left college in Japan 33 years ago and went into business as a rice miller . By the end of World War II , Lee had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syngman Rhee ; he was one of a chosen few to whom Rhee doled out , at the low official exchange rate , precious U.S. dollars that had been acquired by sales of valuable tungsten . For his profitable dealings in " tungsten dollars , " Lee was branded an " illicit profiteer " when Rhee was overthrown in 1961 by Chung Hee Park . He fled to Japan , returned to Korea and resumed operations after Park decided he needed Lee 's ability and overseas business contacts to help modernize South Korea . Lee was forced to pay $4,400,000 in back income taxes and tax-evasion penalties , and his shares in three banks were confiscated by the Park administration . Now back in grace , Lee got $6,000,000 in government-backed loans to finance the fertilizer plant . The remainder of the money included a $43.9 million loan from Japan 's Mitsui &; Co. and a $1,000,000 investment by International Ore and Fertilizer Corp . of New York , which will market excess output abroad . <P> The Korea Fertilizer Co. , during its 18 months of construction , involved Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction , chemicals that had entered the country duty-free for use in fertilizer making were sold to a saccharin-processing firm at a $40,000 profit . As a result , Lee 's son , Chang Hee Lee , was sentenced to five years in prison for smuggling ; he is appealing . <P> In the course of that controversy , an opposition delegate to the National Assembly , shouting " Eat this saccharin ! " threw the Assembly into confusion by hurling a can of human excrement at a group of surprised members of Park 's Cabinet . He was protesting what he charged was government connivance in the smuggling . The Cabinet ministers resigned in anger , but Park quickly reappointed them . Lee finally smoothed over the situation by offering the government a 51% interest in the new fertilizer plant .
