txt Jawaharlal Nehru offered today to submit the border conflict with Communist China to the International Court of Justice if the Chinese forces withdrew to positions they held Sept. 8 . But he said " no " to two questions put yesterday by Peking : Will the Indians withdraw 121/2 miles from what the Chinese call the actual line of ' control of Nov. 7 , 1959 ? Will the Indians send officials to discuss the demilitarization of the border zone with the Chinese ? In response to a third Chinese question , the Prime Minister said India had accepted the unilateral cease-fire put into effect by Peking last month . He said India had done nothing to " impede " the cease-fire . Nehru Bars Compromise Mr. Nehru made these statements in a speech to Parliament opening a debate on the border situation . He called the meeting of six nonaligned Asian and African nations at Colombo , Ceylon , today on the Chinese-Indian crisis " friendly " and " well-meant , " but said , " I trust , however , that they will appreciate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister warned that long effort ? " five years or more " ? was ahead and that " sacrifice would be needed . " " There is not much love lost between the Soviet Union and China , " he said . " China has chosen a form of communism that is considered dangerous and harmful to other Communist countries . " Mr. Nehru prefaced his reply to the Chinese questions by saying that Peking had rejected the Indian proposal for withdrawal to the Sept. 8 positions . " There is at present no meeting ground between us , " he declared . The difference between what the Chinese call the line of actual control of Nov. 7 , 1959 , and the position really held on Sept. 8 , 1962 , leaves China in control of 2,500 square miles of Indian territory , he said . Points Previously Rejected The questions from Peking constituted a demand for a new reply from New Delhi to a repetition of the three-point proposal the Chinese first made on Oct. 24 , four days after their push into India began . Mr. Nehru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of the " actual line of control " in Ladakh in northwestern India corresponds in fact to the line established by the Chinese attack of October and November . Mr. Nehru said , " The aggression must be undone before peaceful discussion can begin . " " I have come to the conclu- sion that the word of the Chinese government can not be relied upon , " he said . He characteried as " double talk " the description by the Chinese of their invasion of India as " self-defense by frontier guards " and called their ' action " an insult to conscience , " and " duplicity . " " We are aggressors on our territory , " he commented ironically . India 's policy of nonalignment will continue , he declared , but his government will continue to get help from friendly nations , for which " we are grateful . " These nations , he ! said , understand and appreciate ' India 's nonalignment in the cold . war . " The one country which does not approve of nonalignment for us or anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthen ourselves in every way , " he said. ! " I am confident we shall win . We shall refuse to bow down to these imperialist tactics of China . The issue is not only our survival but the cause of peace in the world . " He said , " chancelleries throughout the world " w e re watching the split between Moscow and Peking with deep interest . " We are in an extraordinary and difficult situatio n , " he warned . " Going to Nva r with China , the biggest and mo s t powerful country in the world , is not an easy matter . But I am convinced China can not have her way and we will have our way . Something infinitely morel than territory is involved . " House Backs Nehru Policy I The lower house adopted by acclaim a resolution supporting government policies in the conf li c t with China . Parliament will adjourn tomorrow until February unless an emergency session is called . The government will then be free to handle the difficult Italks with Pakistan on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debates . Issues that might mean war or peace with China may also be handled discreetly , . though any major decision ! would presumably necessitate a special session . During the debate the prime : minister assured the House that he would seek parliamentary approval before submitting t h e border dispute to the W o r l d Court . In view of the Chinese refusal to withdraw to the Sept. 8 position , however , the issue may not arise . In a broadcast tonight M r . Nehru warned that China might attack again . He called the Chinese cease - fire " trickery . " Speaking to the army , he told the soldiers not to be disheartened by the initial reverses . " I am confident you will finally throw the Chinese out , " he declared . He said India would . raise new armies and develop t h e strength of her air force with the help of United States and Britain . " We wo n't be cowed , and we wo n't lose our liberty , " he said .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
