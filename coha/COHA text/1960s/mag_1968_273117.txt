Everybody remembers the name of the fellow who played Moses in the 1956 film remake of The Ten Commandments . Right . Charlton Heston . But who was that fellow with his bare back to the camera who played the drum while Charlton strode down the mountain with the tablets ? He was a little nobody , a movie extra who just happened to have the kind of graceful dorsal muscles and shoulder blades the director was looking for . Herb Alpert has since become considerably more than a name that everybody remembers , or a man who hires his own drummers . He is a major sound system . <P> As leading man with his own Tijuana Brass , Alpert has just wound up a U.S. tour that established the group as one of the top handful of pop road shows around . It is equaled only by the likes of Sinatra , Streisand and the Beatles when it comes to filling big halls . Just three years ago , the seven-man troupe was playing in small clubs like Manhattan 's Basin Street East . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Antonio 's HemisFair Arena and other massive coliseums would do ; at Madison Square Garden , for example , they drew a crowd of 20,000 . In Detroit 's Cobo Hall , squealing teeny-boppers and grown women ran up and down the aisles , setting off a blitz of lights with their Instamatic cameras . In Laramie , Wyo. , a woman clearly in her 80s came down the aisle and shouted , " Sock it to me , Herbie ! " <P> Twin Trumpets . What seems to please the crowds most is that Herb does n't sock it at all . He silks it . The Tijuana Brass is basically just a good old-fashioned melody band that makes no pretensions toward the new . No soulsearching Thelonious Monk stuff , no revolutionary developments-just pleasant music that is as universal in its way as Bob Hope is in his . Alpert 's rhythms have a pulse all their own . " I can take any tune , take anyone 's tracks , and record the Brass over it and make it sound like the Tijuana Brass , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short staccato bursts by twin trumpets . The crackling , joyous blend of mariachi , Dixieland and cool rock-often called Ameriachi , but Mexiland or cucaracha-rock will do just as well-appeals to the oldsters as much as Lawrence Welk does . But it is infinitely less square than Welk , and the kids dance to its classic 4/4 beat with no complaints . <P> Until 1965 , the Tijuana Brass only made records-with Alpert dubbing both trumpets and sometimes dubbing piano too . That was for Alpert 's A &; M Records ( the M stands for Jerry Moss , Alpert 's nonplaying partner ) , which had been launched in Alpert 's garage three years before . Now A &; M is set up on Charlie Chaplin 's old movie lot in Hollywood , and Alpert is busy plowing profits from such million-seller albums as Whipped Cream , What Now My Love and Goin ' Places into modernizing the old silent-film workshop .
