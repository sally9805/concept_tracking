On the television screen a flamingo takes flight across a verdant rain forest . A doe peers at the sky . A jet swoops upward , catching the wind , in a visual poem to flight . Educational TV ? A documentary on aeronautics ? No , just a two-minute spot plugging Eastern Airlines ' flight to Miami . In any year it would have been a tasteful , artful job of the soft sell , but in this , television 's slackest season , the Eastern Airlines commercial looked like a masterwork . <P> <P> It is only one of many such works that are currently outclassing the programs they interrupt . Alka-Seltzer , for example , has retired its ubiquitous , jolly salesman Speedy , substituted a diverting view of waistlines-a hula dancer 's , a frugger 's , a weight lifter 's , a pants press-er's-and simply says , " no matter what shape your stomach 's in , when it gets out of shape , take Alka-Seltzer . " The public is getting the message-Alka-Seltzer sales have risen 16% this year-and so are sponsors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rheingold beer , once notorious for a stupefying parade of look-alike Miss Rheingolds , has switched to a vigorous ethnic pitch . Its commercials now show Negroes , Jews , Greeks , Irish and other minority groups enjoying themselves at parties , quaffing beer when they get too tired to dance . Rheingold then shrugs at its new-found success with its now famous tag line : " We must be doing something right . " <P> In the nuts-and-bolts field of truck selling , Ford has chosen gentle Silent Film Veteran Buster Keaton as its pitchman . In one new commercial , Keaton fills up a truck with furniture only to find that he has left out a live lion . <P> When Keaton loads him on another truck , the lion drives off . Buster is last seen in hot pursuit , his legs whirring away at silent-movie speed . <P> Flamencos &; Astronauts . Even deter gents , capital offenders of eyes and eardrums , have begun to inject a light touch . Lever Brothers ' Breeze includes a towel as a premium in its package , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flamencoing in the bathroom , snapping the towel about his shoulders and abruptly turning into Jose Greco when the spirit moves him . Presumably his wife is Breezing the dishes , but she never appears . <P> Are the tasteful new commercials a trend ? Yes , but with a big hedge . Esthetically , the fresh approach is appealing to nearly all clients ; financially , it remains out of reach for most . The Alka-Seltzer commercial cost nearly $25,000 , and a new Ford spot featuring an astronaut walking in space outside her car cost even more . Still the fact that commercials are now being watched with something like pleasure does raise , at least faintly , the startling possibility that TV might be upgraded by , of all things , the long-abused commercial .
