It was a textbook coup . At 3 a.m. , shortly before the most faithful Moslems would answer the call to early morning prayers , columns of trucks loaded with troops rolled through Tripoli , spearheaded by British-made Centurion tanks . Swiftly , soldiers surrounded army headquarters , the security police building , the Royal Palace and the national radio station . Teleprinters in the national news agency fell silent . The borders were sealed tight , and at the airports , controllers got orders to suspend all air traffic indefinitely . <P> Libya had long been ripe for a coup . Flanked by socialist regimes in Algeria and Egypt , the kingdom was rolling in oil wealth , but much of it was being pocketed by corrupt officials . The country was ruled by a frail and feeble old man , King Idris , 79 , who had offered to abdicate five years ago but was persuaded to stay on by the Cabinet . Crown Prince Hassan Rida , 40 , obviously lacked the capacity for leadership . Even so , neither foreigners nor Libyans had expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is both the father of his country ( with Britain as midwife ) and the religious leader of the potent Senussi , a Moslem sect . <P> When Libyans woke on Monday morning last week , the radio had returned to the air and was blaring Sousa marches . Startled listeners were told that the King , who was at a Turkish spa being treated for poor circulation in his legs , had been overthrown and Parliament dissolved . The Kingdom of Libya , said Radio Triooli , was now the " Libyan Arab Republic " controlled by a Revolutionary Council of army officers . An around-the-clock curfew was imposed . <P> Legalized Regime . Throughout the week , extreme secrecy was maintained , and almost no foreigners were allowed to cross the borders . Much of the coup seemed to be run by radio ; an announcer would say which officials had been dismissed and which kept in office and all , amazingly , seemed to obey . Only one name was given prominence in connection with the coup-Colonel Saaduddin Abu Shweirib , who was made the army 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 30s , studied at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth . Sacked from the army in 1967 because he was suspected of republican sympathies , he has since worked as a notary public-prompting some wits to point out that he could legalize his own regime . If it is his regime . Reports in some Arab capitals said that Shweirib was merely a front man .
