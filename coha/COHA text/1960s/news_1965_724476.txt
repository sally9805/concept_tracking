txt Allan Dale Kuhn is understood to have let it be known that unless the gems remaining of those stolen from the American Museum of Natural History are returned he will tell the police the names of every person who touched , saw , held or knew about the stolen stones . The threat by the alleged leader of the burglary ring was presumably made at the same time that fences in Miami were informed by District Attorney Frank S. Hogan 's office that if the missing DeLong Star Ruby and other gems are not returned by tomorrow " all deals are off . " The deal was understood to have provided that if all the gems were returned , Kuhn , Jack Roland Murphy  --  known as Murph the Surf ? and Roger Frederic Clark . the suspects in the Oct. 29 burglary , would plead guilty to the crime tomorrow and receive one-year sentences . This agreement hinged on Kuhn 's pledge to Assistant District Attorney Maurice Nadjari that he would get back 15 of the 24 stolen gems . Nine , including the Star of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday in a Miami bus station locker . Nine others have been reportedly cut up and disposed of by fences , and six are still being sought . Five of these six are understood to be intact . The status of one has not been determined . Even if the ruby and other stones still intact are not recovered , the one-year sentence may still be recommended . However , Mr. Nadjari is understood to feel that the recovery of only nine gems is not substantial compliance with the original agreement . According to reports , he feels the prosecutor 's office has been short-changed and the Florida figures in the case have been told that without the return of the six stones , Kuhn , Murphy and Clark are right back where they started before the trip to Miami last week , In a telephone interview last night , Herman Gordon , the Miami Beach man who aided authorities in recovering the nine gems that have been returned to the museum , said he was " in no position to know anything " about those still missing . Driver of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests in Florida , drove the car that was instrumental in the recovery of the museum gems Friday . He said later that an informant had asked him to pick up Detective Richard Maline of the New York City police at a Miami motel and drive him to another motel . His instructions . Mr. Gordon said , were to leave the car parked prominently outside the second motel . This he did and when he and Mr. Maline returned they found a note and a bus station locker Pkey on the floor of the automobile . Mr. Gordon is the man who is said to have eaten the note . The gems were found in the locker . Mr. Gordon has said that the authorities made clear to him that they do not believe he was involved in any way in the theft of the gems or their subsequent disappearance . He was merely picked by the informant to help get them back , he said . Mr. Gordon said last night that the District Attorney 's office was making a fair offer in asking the suspected fences to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theft . " I think the authorities are entitled to their jewels . " he said . " They belong in a museum . " " Besides , " he remarked . " what would a man want that ruby for anyway ? It 's probably the , most notorious stone in the world today and it 's not of that gem quality that would make it valuable except for its size . " " Of course , " Mr. Gordon added , " I have n't seen the stone ' myself . " Mr. Gordon denied a report that he was to fly to New York from Miami Beach to confer with Kuhn . " At the moment I have no plans to come up to New York , " Mr. Gordon said . However , it was learned that the New York authorities were weighing a meeting between Kuhn and Mr. Gordon . But , the , authorities said , Mr. Gordon would be coming only if and when they asked him to . Jeweler Sees Gems It became known yesterday that Mr. Nadjari opened the two wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miami motel , an unnamed jeweler , also reportedly a fence , was present . It was said that the jeweler paled when the nine stones were removed and the DeLong Ruby was not among them . " Some time between the time you got here and now . " the jeweler told Mr. Nadjari and the three detectives who were with him . " someone got sticky fingers . The ruby and the other stones should be here . " Kuhn did not know about the recovery of the gems until he arrived in New York . His Miami sources reportedly dried up when the trip to Florida became public knowledge and the police and Mr. Nadjari made the recovery through their own informants and cooperative fences . Kuhn 's usefulness at this point was only that these informants and fences knew that Kuhn wanted the gems returned . A question that has remained unanswered is whether the three suspects , Murphy , Clark and Kuhn , were working for themselves or were part of a larger burglary ring masterminded by someone else . In reference to this , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the investigation was far from over . Two fences were said to have disposed of the nine gems . Kuhn , Clark and Murphy reportedly used the money to post their bail bond premium , pay their lawyers , and make frequent trips between New York and Florida . Three friends of Kuhn also reported to have known about the gems played some part in recovering the nine on Friday . Mr. Nadjari hopes to have the 100-carat De Long ruby , which is valued at $100,000 , returned by tomorrow , along with the 15.37-carat Eagle Diamond , valued at $25,000 , and other stones described as smaller and of less value . ? The 24 gems have been valued at $410,000 by the museum for bookkeeping purposes and $300,000 in the indictment against the defendants . Historically they are priceless . The missing gems believed to be intact are valued at about $160,000 by the museum . To the fence or fences who hold them , this could mean a profit of $80,000 if the gems are sold at their full value . The District Attorney 's office is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might realize and the possibility that they , along with the three alleged thieves , would come under prosecution ; Normally , the professional gem thief gets from 10 to 30 per cent of the value of his loot when he sells it to a fence , depending on how easy the gemsi will be to resell on the open market . In the museum case . the smaller figure would probably apply . If there is a broker or intermediary between thief and fence he would get 5 or 10 per cent of the proceeds . The fence none malty realizes 40 to 50 per cent of the value of the loot . The balance is accounted for by the difference between wholesale and retail prices and the loss Ithat occurs when large gems must be cut down . It is highly unlikely that the missing DeLong Ruby and Eagle Diamond could be sold : legitimately without alteration , 1lHowever , it is known that Middle Eastern potentates and other private collectors maintain representatives who are willing to acquire rare , if tainted , treasures .
