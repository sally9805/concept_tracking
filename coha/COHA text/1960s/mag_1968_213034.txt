Sierra Leone , which had two army coups in quick succession a little more than a year ago , underwent another one of a somewhat different order last week . Officers had led the previous coups , but this time it was soldiers from the 1,600-man army who mutinied against their superiors and decided to take their turn at governing the country . Dissatisfied over low pay and poor living conditions , troops led by sergeants rose first in the town of Darn and then the capital of Freetown . At least twelve people were killed as a contingent of 300 men seized and threw into prison the entire ruling military junta , headed by Brigadier Andrew Juxon-Smith , 36 . Then the sergeants went on the radio and announced the formation of something called the " Anti-Corruption Revolutionary Movement . " <P> Unlike last year 's coups , this one was welcomed by the people . They were not so much fed up with any corruption as with Juxon-Smith 's fondness for lecturing them on " sweat and toil . " <P> His junta had raised taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired the most venal politicians and turned the economy over to professional administrators . His policies brought considerable unemployment . <P> More important , Juxon-Smith showed no signs of returning the government to civilian rule , as he had originally promised to do . <P> Perhaps realizing that they needed a little experienced help , the new junta , including not only sergeants but privates and police patrolmen as well , summoned home Colonel John Bangura , a counselor in Sierra Leone 's Washington embassy , to head an interim ruling council . As second in command , the junta brought home Lieut . Colonel Patrick Genda , the ambassador to Liberia . As they arrived in Freetown , both men were greeted by happy crowds clutching signs that read " Welcome to Freedom " and " Welcome , Our Saviors . " <P> Both promised a quick return to civilian rule . The most likely leader of any such return is Siaka Stevens , 62 , who was named Prime Minister after the country 's elections in 1967 but held the job for only ten minutes before the army officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nearby Guinea , may well have had a part in encouraging the " sergeants ' coup .
