Each year , at least 200,000 U.S. men with blood classified as Rh-positive marry women whose blood is Rh-negative . The mismatch poses no threat to the first child , but with the second there is an almost certain chance of miscarriage , stillbirth or brain damage . The only remedy with promise has been a transfusion , replacing the child 's entire blood supply in the womb . <P> Medical researchers have now found a surer and simpler way to protect the second child by inoculating the mother during a crucial three-day period following the birth of her first child . Heretofore , the problem has been that during childbirth , the bloodstream of the Rh-negative mother is invaded by hundreds of thousands of the red blood cells of the child , each carrying the factor that makes it Rh-positive . During the next few weeks , her system reacts to the foreign cells by developing active antibodies that can then attack the blood of all subsequent children . <P> As devised by Dr. Vincent J. Freda and Dr. John G. Gorman of Columbia University , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new technique is to vaccinate the mother immediately after the birth of her first Rh-positive child with a blood fraction containing other people 's anti-Rh antibodies . These stifle development of a lifelong " active " immunity and in stead provide her system with a short lived " passive " immunity , and her system is far less likely to develop virulent antibodies . So far , reports Ortho , of 825 women treated with the fraction , only one became sensitized to the extent that a future baby would be endangered . Many have given birth to Rh-positive babies who showed no effects of the incompatibility.
