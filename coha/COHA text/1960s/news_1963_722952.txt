txt In Newport Beach , Calif where lots on or near the ocean usually sell for $20,000 and up , a subdivider advertises three-bedroom houses a few hundred feet from the water for as little as $22,900 . Not until they visit the development , known as Newport Shores , do prospective buyers learn how this apparent bargain is accomplished : The landowner retains title to the lot on which the houses are built : the home buyer receives a long-tern/ lease and pays an annual rental based on the lot 's value The leasing of residential property Is no novelty In the U.S. As long ago as 1750 a Baltimore landlord offered lots , with no down payment , on 99-year leases at an annual " ground rent . " Other landlords adopted the practice and even today many homes in Maryland are on leased ground . =Leasing also has been the custom in Hawaii . where Kaiser Industries ' new Hawaii-Kai development in Honolulu offers lots on a leased basis only .

" Newport Beach is a resort-residential community near Los Angeles . Just south of San Francisco , at Menlo Park and Woodside , Stanford University In the past seven years has developed 90 acres for residential use on leased lots . Buying a Better House Leasing enables large landowners who are reluctant to sell their holdings to have their cake and eat it too . But real estate men specializing in leasing say its main advantage is that it allows home buyers to purchase much more expensive houses than they otherwise could afford . Consider the terms arranged for a retired executive who recently moved into a $40.000 home in Irvine Terrace West , another new subdivision in Newport Beach . The lot itself , located on a bluff overlooking the Pacific . is valued at $35,000. making the house and land worth $75,000 . If the former executive had been obliged to buy the house and lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By agreeing to lease the land for 55 years . he obtained the hcalse with a down payment of only $12,200 . Moreover , the savings he makes in his mortgage payments by buying only the house instead of both house and lot more than cover the annual rental of the lot . Nevertheless , real estate men concede many prospects are reluctant to build on leased land . Under Maryland 's " ground rent " law . leaseholders have the right to buy the land they are leasing if they choose to . And they are assured of having their leases renewed if they wish . But in California , Hawaii and other states , there are no such guarantees . Thus sales resistance at leased-lot developments can be stiff . Unfavorable Reactions " The natural feeling , the American tradition , Is to own your own piece of ground . " says Russell N. Cox , vice president of Cabot , Cabot 4 Forbes Co. , real estate development concern handling sales for Laguna Niguel , a new subdivision near Laguna Beach . Calif . Nine of 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning that lots there are available only on lease , the developer reports . Most California developers avoid mentioning the leasing feature in their advertising in hopes that once a prospect is at the site he can be convinced of the advantages of leasing . In addition to stressing the lower initial outlay , salesmen also point out that most buyers will resell their dwellings long before the leases expire . As Mr. Cox puts it . " Most people in California move every three or four years . When they buy a home they think in terms of how It will resell in a few years . In contrast , a New Englander buys for a lifetime or at least for the next 20 years . This difference permits you to market leased land in California when you would fall flat on your face in Boston . " West Coast developers insist that reselling is no problem for owners of homes on leased land .

Both savings and loan associations and banks make mortgage loans at going interest rates on houses on leased lots . Of Newport Balboa 's total loan portfolio of $65 million , 20% to 25% is in loans on such properties , officials report . Another point salesmen in leasehold developments make is that unless a buyer is willing to lease his lot he probably will have to settle for a less attractive site . This is simply because the developers set aside their most desirable property for leasing , even though they may be willing to sell some sites . Reluctant to Lease Laguna Niguel officials recall the case of a General Motors executive who was seeking a lot on which to build a retirement home . He looked first at the choicest section of the subdivision , a promontory with  --  a sweeping view of the ocean 200 feet below . But all the lots in this section were available only on lease .

But because this area lacked the dramatic view , the executive changed his mind and took the lease . In most cases the owner of leased land does n't handle the subdividing and building of houses on the property . Instead , he grants a " master lease " to a subdivider , who puts in such improvements as streets and sewers . The subdivider recovers this cost in one of two ways . If he builds and sells a finished house along with the lease , as is usually the case . the cost of the improvement is included in the price of the house . If he resells the lease on the lot only , he recovers the cost of improvements and makes his profit by charging a flat fee to the buyer of the lease . There are various ways to determine annual rent on leased land ' but generally it 's equal to 6% of the lot 's appraised value at the time the lease is created by the landowner .
