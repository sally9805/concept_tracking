THE BETROTHAL A Story by LORNA BEERS Drawing by Frederick A. Marvin in October it was dusk out the last letter , heard the usual remark about the weather and , " How is your mother , Amy ? " To which she gave the reply which had become so invariable as to be automatic , " Fine , thank you . My mother is a remarkable woman . " She pulled down the stamp window , counted her stamps , checked the few money orders she had written and the records of insured parcels , and took her coat from the hook . No one could remember the time she had not worn this coat for everyday purposes . It must have been bought thirty years ago before she got her growth , for it was skimpy even on her slender person . It did not come closely about her throat and the high hand of her modest blouse showed above its neckline like a clerical collar . Not that Miss Amy Cromwell was gaunt . Rather , she was wraith-like . She had a quick soundless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow . Her eyes were blue and set wide apart . Her unlined face had a dreamy expression , as if she was not part of life , but listened to it as to a tale . When she locked the door of the post office the sun had set . The day had been one of high winds and gusty showers . For a moment as she put the key in her pocket a break in the mists beyond the rim of the world made the gray clouds dove-breasted as they drove along . She looked at them a moment , then crossed the street . The general store , the drug store , the feed and grain store were dark , their proprietors home eating their suppers , the preparation of which sent the pleasant sting of wood smoke into the air , and the odor of onions and potatoes frying in butter . She did not look up as she passed these buildings , or when she passed the one beyond them  --  a more elaborate structure with a false front which gave the illusion of a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows , the curtains of which were drawn . Above this door was a gilt sign shaped like a platter . Twined about with tarnished gilt wreathings , which suggested the ornaments woven with the hair of the dead , was the name , Carr &; Son . The older Carr had died ten years before , and the firm consisted only of the son . Mordecai Carr was the undertaker . Miss Amy Cromwell turned the corner into Dogtooth Lane , a mere path . A drift of yellow beech leaves was sifted along the ruts , and as she walked , her feet rustling the leaves , she stooped to lift the hem of her skirt ever so slightly , and in so doing her eye caught a bar of golden light , 93 bright and definite , unlike the feeble reddish shine of the lamps in the windows beyond Dogtooth Lane . Her eye followed this ribbon of light to where it came from below the incompletely lowered blinds at the rear of Carr &; Son . She let the hem of her skirt fall and stood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She saw something white as a peeled tree lying on a table . As she stood , her knuckles against her teeth , a shadow fell on the Winds . A hand gripped the edge , and the curtains were pulled to the sill . The shadow retreated , advanced , made wings of blackness sweep across the windows , like the silhouettes of enormous bats . She ran , stumbling , slipping on the wet leaves , half falling . She reached Appletree Street , where on the corner was the little house , gable end to the path , in which she lived with the remarkable woman , her mother . She stood awhile , her hand on the picket fence , until she caught her breath , for her mother had remarkable energy , and when she spied something ever so little amiss she never stopped until she got to the bottom of it . Amy Cromwell did not want to explain why she had been so frightened , or even let her mind dwell on what she fancied she had seen . She drew a deep breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove lids , called out , " Fetch me a few sticks of wood , Amy , while your coat 's on . " Later , at the table , pouring the creamed codfish over the potatoes , she said . " Seems to me the Whittier 's potatoes a'nt so good this year . " Amy , who had learned always to agree with her mother , murmured , as if she were a faint echo , " No , I do n't think they 're so good this year . " " Anybody get any mail today ? " " None to speak of . " She hesitated , and then said , " Except a letter came for Phoebe Dixon . From Boston . From her cousin , I guess . " " Well , fancy that , and her passed on yesterday . It 's enough to make you question the ways of Providence , her passing on in childbirth . Her so pretty and young . Men are wicked wanton things and will have their way . See to it you never have anything to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight shudder . " Oh , I 'd never have anything to do with any of them . " She thought , leaning over her baked Lorna Beers has had five novels published , including " A Humble Lear " and " The Mad Stone , " which won the Avery Hopwood award . A native of Minnesota , she now lives in Vermont.apple , " Mr. Mordecai Carr has some strange privileges . " When supper was over she fitted her embroidery hoops onto a patch of her crazy quilt and began to embroider a cluster of violets . Mrs. Cromwell , without spectacles , the remarkable woman , studied next Sunday 's lesson in the Quarterly . Miss Amy put in stitch after stitch . " What does John Dixon think of Mr. Mordecai Carr 's strange privileges ? " she wondered . T H E next day she walked the long way , avoiding Dogtooth Lane . Her circuit brought her to the front of Carr &; Son . just as Mordecai Carr came out the door and stood on the step , his hand on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not raise her eyes higher than the legs of his cinnamon-colored trousers , and when he said , " Good morning , Miss Amy , how is your mother ? " she answered nothing at all , but stood white as linen staring at his ankles until he leaned over to see if something was wrong . The day was bright , the air filled with the glitter of golden leaves and sunshine . The brightness penetrated even the shadowy partitioned post office and tiled it with golden squares . Mr. Mordecai Carr was a good customer of the postal service . He sent packages and received them . He sent registered letters . He bought quantities of stamps , all in the course of his mysterious business . Early in the afternoon he came with his letters and made his purchase of stamps . lip the dark frame of the stamp window he looked at her like an ancient painting . Above his cinnamon-colored coat his face was pale , with touches of pink about the nose and ginger-colored eyes . It was the look of the professional deacon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she thought . " Head to foot . That 's how it will be . Head to foot . " He put his hand out for his sheet of stamps . It was not like other men 's hands  --  coarse from axe and plow , fingers spread , scarred , broken-nailed , brown , and calloused . It was a long pale hand , the nails pink and showing their half-moons , the fingers tight together as if his twin palms had just been folded in prayer . With a soft and stealing motion he drew the stamps across the counter . Fascinated , she watched the compressed fingers disappear . He left and she sank upon a chair , trembling slightly . She was sitting so , staring at something terrible , when old Dr. Sills came in . " What 's this , Amy ? That pain in the left elbow again ? Are you taking the boluses I gave you ? You better come see me . " He did not like to see wasted Jives , and he made a clucking sound , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , if I had to live with the remarkable woman . " At six o'clock Miss Amy Cromwell locked the office and went home by the long way . The luminous trees prolonged the day , and the air was dusty gold . The potatoes were in the oven baking , and the remarkable woman was sitting by the laid table reading the Valley Times . " I see Mrs. Dunham married again . To a man no way equal to her first . I call it indecent , a widow 's marrying again . It 's against the gospel . There should be only one man in a woman 's life . That 's the gospel . And if he 's took , that 's an act of God and she should abide by it . " Miss Amy hung her coat on its hook . " And here 's Della Briggs about to marry a man different from what she was engaged to only last summer . That 's wanton . That 's what it is . " " That 's true , " Amy said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , seeing her mother 's bright eye upon her and finished , " One and the same , betrothal and wedding . " She had almost said , " Only one who is privileged to see you , head to foot . " The next afternoon when she walked slowly past Carr Se Son she did not meet him , but an hour later , looking up from stamping her letters she saw the cinnamon-colored coat passing the past-office window . She shuddered with a strange terror mixed with a mysterious delight . There he went , the only man who would ever see her head to foot . He would stroke his strange hands , like rose-colored satin mittens , over her , head to foot . Della Briggs came in to post her order for wedding finery . " What was it you ordered , Della ? " " Fancy you wanting to know ! I never imagined you cared about such things . " " Why should n't I care about pretty things , same as you ? " " Well , you do embroider beautiful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping right off , have you embroider my outfit . 1 would . " She spread her catalogue on the counter . " There 's the chemise . Real val lace . There 's the petticoats . F.mbroidered ruffles . Machine clone , I guess , Not like what you 'd do . There 's the dress . China silk , it says . And this is the veil . Orange blossoms . Artificial . I guess they 're lovely . " " It must cost a lot . " " Well , it does . I could n't have managed it , but Harry helped me . He says , " her rosy lipsspread in a triumphant smile and her eyes closed slowly like the eves of an ecstatic cat , " he says he wants me to be a beautiful bride . " Miss Amy Cromwell parted the stamp on the wet sponge , placed it on Della Briggs ' letter , stamped the envelope , and put it with the outgoing mail . S H E walked to the window and looked across the street , where Mordecai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strange business lie was an idle man , and on fair days like this he stood on the walk talking to whoever went by , leaning forward slightly , his cinnamon-colored hat tilted just a little to the left , his thumbs hung on the edge of his pockets so that his long leaf-shaped hands lay down either side of his coat . She looked at him intently , absorbing and accepting what she had thought revolting in him . For if he was to see her head to foot , then theirs was a mystic union , one that was bound to be culminated . She could not throw him over for another as Della Briggs had done , for he was the one , the only one , who would ever see her head to foot . As though he felt her intent gaze he looked toward the post office , gravely removed his hat , and bowed slightly to her . She stepped back in confusion . " He is a gentleman , " she thought , and she had a sensation along her throat as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hands moving up her throat and tilting her chin . In a basket beyond the stamp drawer she kept a square of her crazy quilt . On idle afternoons she sat and put in a petal , a chain of featherstitch , a few French knots to make the heart of a rose . When she rose from her work the visitors to the post office said , " let 's see what you 've done now , Amy . Nobody embroiders like you . " She took up her silk and threaded her needle . " What Della Briggs got was ordinary , " she thought . " If I was her I 'd do it myself , stitch by stitch . I 'd do the underthings in handkerchief linen , and the dress in white mull . Mull takes the stitches so nice . " When Della Briggs ' packages arrived , Miss Amy Cromwell lifted the grill of the stamp window to hand them through . " Oh , Della , I 'd like to see them . " " Fancy you wanting to see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the parcels . Miss Amy Cromwell made admiring comments , but she thought , " They 're sleazy , that 's what they are . I can do better than that . " She sat by the window and put in the petal of an apple blossom , stitch after careful stitch . The day was raw and misty , and across the road Mr. Mordecai Can sat in his bay windows that reached to the floor . He was in a wooden arm chair , his cinnamon knees crossed , looking over the street as from a theater box . He sat there patiently , not moving hour after hour , nodding to those who went by , looking after them with his ginger-colored eyes . Miss Amy Cromwell reflected that it was a great advantage to he postmistress . She could send for a few yards of mull or handkerchief linen and no one the wiser . She could draw a few dollars from her postal savings , and no one know it . If she took the money from the bank the whole town would know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with it . Had n't the cashier just confided to her that Pisgah Marsh had cashed his pay check in a tavern and Earl Roscommon had finally paid his grocery bill ? Getting the linen would he easy enough , but how could she keep its possession hidden from her mother ? The thought of that remarkable woman filled her with dismay . The sweet docility that made her feel that any plans that ran counter to her mother 's were conceived in folly now caused her to blush with shame . Just as she gave a resigned sigh she lifted her eyes from the green stem of a violet and saw the cinnamon-colored coattails disappear through the opposite door . She was overcome with the certitude of that meeting . " As sure as the sun goes down , as sure as the snow will come , he 'll see me , head to foot , bare as a peeled tree ! " Hastily , nervous as a fawn , she mailed her order . Thereafter when between customers she sat in the window putting in stitch after stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she worked , discreetly shielded by a square of crazy quilt . When she was asked , " What have you got done now , Amy ? " she took a square she had finished two years before and displayed it . " Oh , now that 's the nicest yet , Amy . " S H E began with scallops and eyelets , but soon her needle seemed to fly , forming tendrils , flowers , doves , and hearts . Now and then she looked up to see the cinnamon coat passing along the street , or to see him standing , his thumbs in his pockets , his leaf-shaped hands against his sides , bending forward slightly . Seeing her white face turned toward him he lifted his cinnamon-colored hat and bowed slightly . It seemed to her that when he sat in his bow window his ginger eyes were on her , unblinking . One day , turning the corner , she saw him coming toward her , leaning against the wind , his hand holding the brim of his hat , his cinnamon coat floating behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion like a brown hawk settling onto a furrow . She faltered and stood still , a small creature crouching in the naked field , paralyzed with fear , and yet shot through with a pulsing delight . He came on while she stood there , and they met face to face . Slowly she lifted her head and looked into his eyes . Her pallor gave way to a deep flush . He looked at her gravely , lifted his hat with his customary gesture , and passed by , his cloak fluttering in the October wind . That evening she sat in the circle of lamplight , round as a halo , puttMg featherstitch in her quilt . Hcr mother , reading the lesson in the Quarterly , said , The thought this week is Ye know not the day nor the hour . That 's a solemn thought , one men should lay to their hearts . " Miss Amy Cromwell let the embroidery hoops fall to her knee . " Yes ! " she said breathlessly . " Yes ! " " Amy , " eyeing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor gave you . I counted them this morning . Eleven in the bottle , same as last week . " The remarkable woman , who did not think Amy capable of any practical activity , banked the fire , wound the eight-day clock , put the cat in the woodshed , and locked the doors . Miss Amy Cromwell 's room was over the kitchen . It was a small room containing a white bed , a white dresser , a little chair , and a trunk with a round top . In the middle of the floor was a register , over which she stood and took off her modest blouse and her long black serge skirt . She pulled her full flannelette gown over her head , completing her disrobing under that ample tent , hidden even from herself . She knelt in her nightclothes on the strip of woven carpet and said her prayers . She shut the register to conserve heat . She lowered the lamp wick and blew the flame out gently . Once she had left her light burning arid begun a story in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , for there was a rapping on the wall and , " Amy , I see a light under your door . Stop wasting oil . " This night she set the darkened lamp on her bureau , but she did not slip under the bed covers . She sat on the edge of the bed , her arms hugged to her chest , shivering slightly . A light snow had fallen , hardly more than a frost . The moon was rising , and it sparkled with a blue and white glitter on the shed roof . She tiptoed to the window . She looked out on a black and white world . The fences , the roofs , all the moonlit buildings had the quality of marble , whose facades were broken by yawning gaps of black shadow . She went to her trunk , kneeling in the cold pool of moonlight . Moving softly as a kitten she pulled her linen from beneath the lowest folds of her crazy quilt . Wrapping a blanket around her she sat in the window in the moonlight and steadily embroidered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose in the sky , rode overhead , and glittered like fire on her quick needle . " Della Briggs ' things were not like these . " She pondered on how it was when Della Briggs was wedded and first alone with her lover . He lifted the veil with its circlet of orange blossoms as though he uncrowned a queen . Then he pulled down the china silk dress as a lady strips off her white glove ; then the chemise with the vat lace , and the ruffled petticoats , like hollyhocks , until her clothes lay around her like tumbled flowers . " But with me it will be the other way round . I 'll be in a shift when he comes . A flannel shift like this . Maybe I 'll be lying on the sheet with nothing on at all . He 'll see me like a peeled tree . He 'll pour a precious flask of frankincense and myrrh over me , and caress me with his hands until I shine like a lily stalk . He will pull up the white stockings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the petticoats full as white roses , and the dress , and last of all the veil with the wreath of velvet flowers . Nothing man can do , or woman either , nothing under the sun can make it otherwise . " The next morning she was pale , but she said , " It 's nothing . I got a chill . " " A chill ? Did you put the goosefeather quilt on your bed ? Well , put it on . " - No , it was nothing . She moved lightly , exalted . S H O R T L Y thereafter was Hallowe'en . Written on the post-office windows was , " Aaron loves May . Becky loves Ben . " She went out with basin and cloth to wash the legends away . " Oh , they know nothing about it , " she thought . " It is terrible as death . As terrible and sure . They play at it as boys play at war . " Dr. Sills , breathing clouds into the frosty air , walked by . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . You 're looking blue these days . That pain in the arm again ? Taking the boluses I gave you ? " He looked at her over his glasses as he loaded his pipe . Mr. Mordecai Carr , wearing his cinnamon overcoat , his cinnamon hat pulled down againstthe glare , crossed the street and took the cloth from her hands . He erased the trivial records gravely , as if he foresaw a Herculaneum or Pompeii and did not care to have future generations reading apostrophes to local gladiators . He looked as if he knew how large trivial records of the dead can seem in history . All the while Miss Amy Cromwell looked at him with eyes blue as periwinkles . " Now mind you , " said Dr. Sills , starting on his way , " come and see me . Take the boluses I gave you . Take one if you feel the pain in the left arm . " When the window was sparkling clean she said , " Thank you . " Mordecai Carr lifted his hat and bowed slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white silk thread and sat by the window . She saw him across the street , one cinnamon knee over the other , his slender hand supporting his chin on the middle finger . The ginger eyes looked at her , and slightly giddy , she closed her own a moment and it seemed to her she walked toward him with a swimming motion , right through the glass , over the calico street on which the snow was melting . When the moon gave her light she sat wrapped in the goosefeather quilt , her needle stitching , stitching , stitching . At last on a cold January night her white garments were finished . The waning moon was high in the sky . The ironwood tree by the shed wrote back and forth on the glittering snow with black fingers . Until now she had kept her snow-white garments folded and hidden under the crazy quilt . Now she laid that unfinished meaningless tapestry on the bottom of the trunk over the boluses she hid there day by day so that the remarkable woman would not see them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her trunk , which seemed to be filled with white foam . She lowered the lid and took the mirror from the wall . It was a small mirror , and its images wavered . When she looked at herself hastily in the past it had been as if she looked at herself through a veil of flowing water , as if the self she looked at stood behind a waterfall . Now she set the mirror on the chest , on a chair , on the floor , solemnly looking at herself , whom she had never seen before . " Like a beautiful white birch , " she thought . " A slender white birch , where two or three lean together . " She got into bed , and although the pain in her left arm was keen as a surgeon 's knife , she did not get the boluses from the trunk . Beside her on the little chest lay a note . " I want to wear the white things in the trunk . It is my wish . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
