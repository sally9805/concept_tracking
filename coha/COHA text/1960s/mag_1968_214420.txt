This is the law of the Yukon , and <P> ever she makes it plain : " Send not your foolish and feeble ; send me your strong and your sane-Strong for the red rage of battle ; <P> sane , for I harry them sore . " <P> - Robert W. Service , 1907 <P> Modern technology is writing amendments to Service 's Law of the Yukon , and strong , sane , shrewd men are putting them into practice . With winter settling harshly over Alaska , an assault is being mounted by air and land on an area north of the U.S. share of the old Yukon . In the air , so many planes are aloft that the Federal Aviation Administration next month will impose the first air-space controls over the barren territory . On the ground , road-building equipment rolled out of Fairbanks to begin the two-month job of scraping a 429-mile-long " winter road " over the frozen tundra , lakes and rivers along which trucks can manage 15 to 20 m.p.h . A boomtown atmosphere pervades some usually sleepy communities , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of the tundra and get rich quick-and then move to Hawaii . <P> The cause of all the activity is not the gold of Service 's day but another resource that may eventually make Alaska far richer . Under the ice , by expert estimates , are pools of at least 5 billion to 10 billion bbl. of oil . If so , this would be the biggest U.S. oil find since the East Texas strike in 1930 , and perhaps even greater than that . Some enthusiasts make blue-sky estimates of 40 billion bbl . That would more than double American reserves ( currently 31 billion bbl. ) and rank the U.S. alongside Kuwait ( 70 billion bbl. ) as the world 's greatest source of oil . <P> Gently to the Sea . The Yukon law still holds in one sense : the oil , like the gold , is remote and difficult to recover . It lies under the 89,000-sq. - mi . North Slope , an area that drops gently from the Brooks Range to the Arctic Sea . Temperatures there fall to 65 below zero and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been populated largely by lemming , hare , fox and caribou . Oilmen have had to bring in by air or snow tractor all the gear needed for drilling . Alaska Airlines and Interior Airways , using C-130 Hercules transports , which haul an average 22 tons a load , carry cargoes including food , hardwood logs for pilings and the pile drivers to sink them . <P> <P> Half a dozen airstrips have been cleared for the " Herky birds , " but in a pinch , says one pilot , they can land on " anything flat and a mile long . " <P> Transportation costs and weather conditions-which snap metal wrenches or freeze the drilling equipment-make oil prospecting expensive . To haul in a rig and drill one hole may cost $15 million , compared with about $55,000 in Texas . Thus the slope is a place where only big companies can survive , and even they prefer to work in consortiums.
