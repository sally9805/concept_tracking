NARRATOR A priest emerges and he shakes a birch branch over the animal 's back and he forces its soul out , and the soul flies away to God . And the priest repeats the same gesture over The Head Holder , for he wants the soul to follow the soul of the horse . And the actors make breath sounds of extraordinary texture .
