Meeting in Washington for the 55th annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , some 2,000 delegates could find real cause for satisfaction in the advance of the Negro revolution . <P> The Supreme Court , in a busy , term-ending week , had just invalidated the trespass convictions of 42 civil rights sit-in demonstrators in three Southern states . And the long-awaited civil rights bill would surely be signed into law by President Johnson on or about July 4 . <P> Since the N.A.A.C.P. , oldest , largest and among the most levelheaded of civil rights organizations , has long concentrated on court and legislative action instead of street demonstrations , the delegates now felt the correctness of their course had been demonstrated . <P> That was the spirit in which the convention began . Executive Secretary Roy Wilkins decried the " reckless adventurism " of more militant civil rights groups . Warned Carl Rowan , a Negro and director of the U.S. Information Agency : " Do n't use an elephant gun to hunt toads . " Counseled Guest Speaker Hubert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil rights bill : " There is a place and a time for banners . But there is also a time to stack the banners for a while and get down to the patient , infinitely detailed work of making civil rights realities . " <P> But then , into this atmosphere of calm , cool and collected reasoning , came word of the three missing civil rights workers in Mississippi . And in that instant the whole tone of the N.A.A.C.P. convention changed . Charles Evers , brother of Mississippi 's assassinated N.A.A.C.P. Leader Medgar Evers , passionately demanded that the delegates stage a protest march on the Department of Justice . " Let 's go , " cried the delegates , and only with difficulty did their national leaders dissuade them from marching instantly . <P> And then , acting in an outraged , all-night session , the N.A.A.C.P. Board of Directors adopted a resolution demanding that President Johnson " invoke the power of the Federal Government " by " taking over the administration of the state of Mississippi .
