txt A team of Northwestern university astronomers will build a television-assisted telescope described as the " most sophisticated observation system yet designed " for tracking satellites , meteorites , and missiles , it was disclosed yesterday . The announcement was made by Jay Burns , associate professor of astronomy at the university , who said the project is being financed by a $75,291 grant from the air force . He said the new telescope will use standard television camera tubes with specially designed circuits that will greatly increase the definition of the image . He said the university pioneered in the use of televisionassisted telescopes and now operates one for the National Aeronautics and Space administration at the university 's astronomical field station in Las Cruces , N. M. The existing system ; he said , which is being used to systematically scan the surface of the moon to spot possible obstacles to the landing of a manned space craft , breaks down the image into 500 lines on the viewing tube . The new system , he added , will break the image down into 5,000 lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system will be used to gain more accurate information on tile trajectories of objects moving in space , and added that it eventually will be used in connection with batteries of small telescopes mounted on highflying aircraft .
