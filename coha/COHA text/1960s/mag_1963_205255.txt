The Kremlin likes to paint life on a Soviet collective farm as spiritually rich and financially rewarding . The kolkhoz manager is always a cross between Paul Bunyan and Luther Burbank , and his sterling example inspires glorious acts of self-sacrifice from the lowliest peasant . Though foreigners laugh off the myth as nonsense , millions of Russians are asked to swallow it . Hence the shocked incredulity of Russians who picked up the Leningrad literary monthly , Neva . There , in a short story by Fedor Abramov , was a startling indictment of the apathy , discontent and frustrating failure of collective farm life that still exists after more than four decades of Soviet rule . <P> " Seventeen years after the war we are still fighting on the farm for every pound of bread , " exclaims Anany Egorovich Mysovsky , chairman of the fictional New Life kolkhoz in Abramov 's tale , entitled Round and About . In these excerpts , Abramov follows Mysovsky on a day-long inspection tour of a typical collective . It is the middle of the harvest season , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other is stuck in a ditch ; villagers are lolling about in the community bath houses instead of working the fields ; for five months they have not received a single kopek of advance wages because there has been no money to distribute . <P> Alone in the Fields . Mysovsky looks around at the fields , sees that in the section where peas should be harvested , only seven milkmaids are working . He muses : <P> " Seven young girls , just out of school , and they are the ones who really are holding the whole kolkhoz together . Each kopek is milked by their hands , and getting more milkmaids is one of his biggest headaches . The old women ca n't build a modern kolkhoz ; that 's why he had to argue for weeks to break down the resistance of schoolgirls . And then , if the girl was ready to sign up , her mother would hit the roof . ' What ? My daughter muck around in the manure ! Is that why my husband and I sweated our guts out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alone in the fields with his sorrow . Where are all the people ? Behind their own houses working their private plots . He had better get tough . It was the middle of August and there was no time to lose . He 'd start to comb the upper part of the village , enter each house , and demand to know from each kolkhoznik why he is not working down at the silo . The farm workers ' rejoinders , he knew , would be the same as always : ' Let the hay rot . let the peas go to ruin . ' " <P> Same Old Talk . The chairman spots three women , who should have been working , returning from the forest , loaded down with mushrooms they have picked for themselves . <P> " ' Stop , ' cried Anany Egorovich . The women disappeared around the corner . He ran up and blocked their way . ' You working ? ' The women were silent . ' So this is what you call work ? ' he repeated . ' Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retorted . ' If there were more kopeks in the kolkhoz , we would not have to go to the forest for mushrooms . ' ' But where are we going to get these kopeks ? ' asked Mysovsky . ' You think they fall from the sky . '
