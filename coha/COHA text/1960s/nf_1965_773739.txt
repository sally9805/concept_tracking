txt // ligion such a near monopoly . Many infants are not chris-tened ( even outside the sects which do not employ infant baptism ) but merely have their births registered ; many marriages take place in registry offices ; but death is a religious preserve . Because religion impinges on more British people in early bereavement than on any other occasion in their lives , because all versions of Christianity contain dog-matic statements about the reality of a life after death and its nature , and because , traditionally , religion is held to offer consolations for the grief of bereavement , I de-cided that the sample of mourners should be asked the same questions as had been answered by the much larger and more heterogenous samples reported on in Exploring English Character . ' These questions are : Would you describe yourself as being of any re-ligion or denomination ? If yes , which ? How often do you normally attend a church service ? Do you ever say any private prayers ? How often ? Do you believe in the Devil ? Do you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like ? Six per cent ? 15 men and 8 women ? denied having any religious denomination ; these were predominantly people under 44 , and concentrated in the South-East and Mid-lands ; there were none in the North-West , and only 3 in the North-East and Scotland . With the exception of a solitary Jew and 7 Spiritualists , Christian Scientists and // other members of modem sects , all the remainder claimed membership of some Christian sect . Far and away the largest group , with 61 per cent , call themselves Church of England ; these are followed by 11 per cent Roman Catholic , 8 per cent each of Church of Scotland and Methodists , and very small groups of Baptists , Congregationalists and Christians ' . ( Because the figures are so small , members of the five last-mentioned sects are grouped together as Nonconformists ' in some analyses . ) Members of the Church of England are heavily concentrated in the South-East and the Midlands and are a minority in Scotland ; they are concentrated in towns of between 50,000 ? 100,000 inhabitants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle and professional classes and least numerous among skilled clerical workers ( who have a high proportion of Methodists ) . Only three members of the Church of Scotland live outside Scotland ; within that country they are evenly represented among all ages and social classes . The Roman Catholics represent over a quarter of the respondents from the North-West and are relatively numerous in the NorthEast and in Scotland ; they belong overwhelmingly to the working classes , and in these classes to the least skilled . They are predominantly urban . It is perhaps relevant that out of the 15 children whose death was mourned , 8 were of Roman Catholic parentage . Adherents to the smaller Nonconformist groups tend to come from the villages and towns of less than 50,000 inhabitants in the South of the island . All but one of the adherents to the modern cults are women . In general , the women among the bereaved are much more regular in their public and private devotions than are the men . Two-thirds of the women , but only a quarter // of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the men , but barely an eighth of the women , never say any prayers at all . The contrast is less marked in church-going ; 14 per cent of the men and 21 per cent of the women go to their place of worship weekly or more frequently ; 39 per cent of the men and 31 per cent of the women go to their place of worship on special occasions only , weddings , funerals and the like . Seventeen per cent of both sexes say that they never enter a place of worship at all . The younger the respondents the less likely they are to say regular private prayers ; less than a quarter of those under 35 do so , as contrasted with three-fifths of those over 55 . This pattern is much less marked in attendance at public places of worship ; the minority ( less than a third of the total ) who go to church or chapel once a month or more frequently are evenly distributed among all the age groups . The social make-up of the congregations is predominantly upper middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a fifth ) of the skilled workers are even moderately devout . Three-fifths of this class , if they enter sacred buildings at all , do so only on special occasions ; the corresponding figure for the upper middle classes is one-third . A quarter of the members of the upper middle classes never say private prayers , which suggests that some of their church-going may be of formal social significance . The skilled working class contains the lowest proportion of those who say regular private prayers and the highest proportion of those who never pray . The Roman Catholics are by far the most regular in both their public and private devotions ; three-fifths of them go to church once a week or more often , in contrast with 25 per cent of the Church of Scotland and // the Nonconformists , and 9 per cent of those who call themselves Church of England . Just under half of the Nonconformists and well over half of the members of the Church of England never go to church or chapel at all , or only on special occasions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter . A third of the members of the Church of England and the Nonconformists never say private prayers at all , or only in peril or grief ; the corresponding figure for the Roman Catholics is 8 per cent , Since the Roman Catholics are concentrated in the North-West and in Scotland these areas have much the highest figures for regular church attendance , and London and the South-East much the lowest ; but the converse is not quite exact . The South-West and Scotland have the lowest proportions of people who never go to church at all , or only on special occasions . Scotland has the highest proportion of people who never say any private prayers , followed by London and the South-East ; the North-West has the lowest . People living in metropolises have the highest proportion of people who never go to church , or only on special occasions ; but , somewhat paradoxically , they have the lowest proportion of those who never say prayers or only on special occasions , and the highest proportion of regular pray-ers . It must be recalled that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The widowed ? those who have lost their husband or wife ? are much the most regular in private and public devotions ; whereas those who have lost their parents ? particularly if they are married themselves ? worship and pray regularly somewhat less than the average . The small group of the unmarried , divorced and separated appear somewhat more devout than the married . // ii The Afterlife The reason why the Christian clergy are so continuously involved in the disposal of the dead is that orthodox Christianity is dogmatic that the soul continues to exist after death , and is judged ; the good go to heaven , the imperfect ( in Roman Catholic dogma ) purge themselves of their sins in purgatory , and the evil are damned to hell . The hope and belief that one 's loved ones are in bliss are meant to be consolations to the bereaved ; the fear of damnation is meant to keep sinners in the ways of righteousness . By these dogmatic standards , only 11 respondents out of the 359 hold orthodox beliefs , making some reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , without envisaging Judgment . A quarter of the population states firmly that they do not believe in a future life , and the same number is uncertain ; of the remainder some 15 per cent say that they believe in a future life but have little idea what it will be like ; and the rest voice a series of unorthodox beliefs , with no overt religious content . The pattern of disbelief in a future life is much the same as that for abstention from church-going and private prayer . It is voiced more than twice as often by men as by women ( who , however , have slightly more uncertainty ) ; and more frequently by the young than the older , by members of the skilled working class than by members of the other classes ( the upper middle classes having the smallest number of unbelievers ) , and by people living in the South-East and , somewhat surprisingly , in the North-West . Those who have lost a husband or wife have the smallest number of unbelievers , those who have lost // a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , married , skilled working man is very likely to have no religious beliefs , a widowed upper-middle-class older woman is likely to be a practising but not orthodox Christian . Typical of the orthodox statements are those of an 84-year-old Roman Catholic widow from the North-East , who died shortly after the survey was made : I believe in purgatory , that we have to suffer for a time before we go to heaven . Do n't think hell can be what it is supposed to be . ' Similarly , a 75-year-old widow from the Midlands , Church of England : You do n't go straight to heaven . There is a transmission period . There is no family life and no sex in heaven , ca n't imagine what it will be like . ' But the most frequent orthodox answer , usually given by Roman Catholics , is the quotation from St. Paul : Eye bath not seen nor ear heard , neither hath it entered into the heart of man what things God bath prepared for those who love Him . ' Typical of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in scriptural terms is a 73-year-old widow from Scotland , who describes herself as ' Chris-tian ' : The Lord says nothing will be more glorious than to be with Him . There will be happiness and life everlasting ? the Lord did n't die for nothing . ' Or a 74-year-old widow from the Midlands , Church of England : // When we die we go to God in His glory ; He paid for all our sins . ' Or a pious 65-year-old widow from Scotland , a member of the Church of Scotland : You go to sleep and when you waken up then it is judgment day , meet all your dear ones then . ' A 34-year-old building foreman from the South-East ( 13 ) , Church of England but not a churchgoer : A spiritual state where I feel you will be able to see your family growing up . I do n't feel any of us know much about it in fact , but I am sure that we are promised more than this life ? a life after death through Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth are doing and see where they need help and guidance . ' This last quotation fades into the most popular concept of the afterlife held by this sample of bereaved people ? watching over or rejoining one 's loved ones . It is exceptional in that it does mention Christ . The 49-year-old wife of a director of a small firm in the SouthEast , a Methodist ( 14 ) , who had recently lost her father , said : I do n't know , but I have lost so many close relatives and I know they are able to watch over us here and give us help and guidance and I do n't believe we are meant to know what it will be like until our time comes , so I am satisfied that everything does not end here ? in my own mind I am sure of that . ' A 7o-year-old widow from Scotland , a pious member of the Church of England ( 19 ) : // Fine ? awfully bonny ? you will see all the people that belonged to you . Just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bed . ' A 75-year-old widow from the North-West , Church of England : I think we become spirits and that if I see any of my family about to make a mistake I will suffer because I will be unable to prevent it . ' A 48-year-old clerical assistant from the North-East ( 2o ) , Church of England : We shall see our dear ones again ? no troubles or trials ? not floating around on clouds in luxury ? a working community ? for needs , e.g. food and clothing . ' The 41-year-old wife of a Midlands sales manager ( 6 ) , a ' Methodist : A place where there are no worries and where we meet all relatives and friends . A place where we do n't worry about money . ' This consoling belief in rejoining or watching over one 's loved ones is held by 17 per cent of the women , but only 3 per cent of the men , widows voicing it particularly frequently . Among the 8o people whom I re-interviewed , 19 were positive that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not ; the remainder were either unwilling to express any opinion at all , or stated in various ways that there was no possibility of knowing the answer to such a question . The minority of firm believers seemed to derive considerable comfort from their convictions . Thus , the wife of a sales-manager in the Midlands ( 6 ) , quoted above , who had recently lost her father said : // I definitely believe in a future life , yes , there 's no point in living otherwise . I should imagine I 'll see my father again . ' The 45-year-old widow of a shop-owner from the NorthWest ( 21 ) : I 'm one of those who believe that those up there can look down and see us clown here . It 's a comfort . ' The wife of a director of a small firm in the South-East ( 14 ) , who had lost her adoptive mother : What I feel , if I 've got any worries I used to take them to her , you see , and I feel that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts me on the right track . . . I still feel that if I had any worries and I prayed for help and guidance from her I would get it . ... There is a life hereafter . Lots of people think this , but one thing I feel ? I shall meet her again . I suppose really it 's ? at the back of it it is a real comfort , although I feel that she 's gone now , at this moment , at the back of my mind there 's still the feeling that one day we shall meet again . ' An 85-year-old widow from the South-West ( 22 ) , reminiscing about her youngest boy : ' He was killed in the Air Force in the war , my youngest boy , and he often comes back and speaks to me ... and I was laying ? missing him you know ? with a light over my bed ? if I do say it , I 'm his mother , he had a lovely face ? and all the time I was thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It 's all right Mum " ; and I thought , Thank God he 's all right ; but he 'd gone . Still , I think I 'll see him again some day . In fact it 's kept me going . ' // The elderly wife of a director in the Midlands says that she often feels when she is working round the house that her mother is still with her , and watching over her . The second most popular view of the afterlife , after rejoining or watching over one 's loved ones , is of a vaguely blissful condition ; some respondents stress the positive features ? beauty , rest , peace ? and others the absence of worries or evil . These views are held by 15 per cent of the women and 7 per cent of the men , and are particularly popular in the upper middle and professional classes . Thus , a 4o-year-old schoolmaster from the Midlands , a pious Methodist : I do n't really know . I hope like this life , but without miseries and worries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19-year-old shop-assistant from Scotland , a non-observant member of the Church of Scotland ( 23 ) : Much more pleasant than living ? more contentment . ' The 47-year-old wife of a semi-skilled worker from the South-East , Church of England : Altogether different from this life ? no worries , no pain and we shall be with our relatives again . Do n't know what it will be like , but I know there is an afterlife . I have faith in that ? I know we are all here for a purpose and this life is not just the end of everything . I am not concerned really as to how exactly it will be ? I am satisfied that there is another existence after death . ' The 49-year-old widow of an unskilled worker from the South-East , a pious member of the Church of England : // I hope it will be a little better than this ? we are hoping for better things ? more friendly and neighbourly . People do n't seem too friendly these days ? they are more stand-offish . ' A 48-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England : You will go to a nicer world ? no worries , no enemies . Everyone the same and at peace . I have visions of my husband who once said to me ( in a vision ) ; " I wish you were here , but it is perhaps too quiet for you here . " It must be peaceful and quiet . ' A 63-year-old widow from the North-East , a Methodist : A river with flowers either side , wide and then it narrows until you cross easily . ' All the views so far quoted and illustrated are held far more by women than by men . The only concepts about the afterlife which are advanced equally by men and women are the unorthodox notions that the next life will be just like this one or , explicitly , reincarnation . These views are advanced by 9 per cent of both sexes . They of course do not correspond to the dogma of any Western Church ; the relative prevalence of such ideas is still unexplained . Typical of such notions are the following quotations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ io ) , nominally Church of England : Coming back in some shape or form . You go into the land and nature sends you back in some form , do n't know quite what . ' The 43-year-old wife of an accountant from the SouthRELIGION // East ( q ) , an observant member of the Church of En-gland : Sometimes I think we are reincarnated . Our afterlife is what we have left behind us in our childhood , and maybe our spirit lives in heaven . ' A 44-year-old tool-fitter from Scotland ( 12 ) , a lax member of the Church of Scotland : Come back to earth as some other thing . ' A 34-year-old shoe repairer from the Midlands , nominally Church of England : You come back on this earth in a different sex . ' A 55-year-old wife of a professional man from the Midlands ( 18 ) , non-observant Church of England : Come back to earth as member of a family ? that is , new member of the same family , reincarnation in fact .

' The 45-year-old wife of a disabled soldier in the SouthWest ( 26 ) , a practiser of Yoga : Reincarnation , until you actually reach salvation , but I do n't know what that will be like . ' The last two quotations could be considered fairly orthodox statements of Buddhist beliefs . The few members of the modern sects , such as Spiritualists and Christian Scientists , are articulate and , I dare say , orthodox in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such sects is elected in adult life . Thus a 73-year-old widow from the North-East ( 27 ) , living alone , a Christian Scientist : It is like a misty scene ? a ship goes off into the horizon , but it never quite disappears until you go to join them . ' A 63-year-old widower from the South-West ( 28 ) with his own business , a Spiritualist : We believe that our body is only on loan to us in this world . The world we go to is like this one , only better , and it is always daylight ? the sun always shines . ' A 63-year-old widow from the Midlands , living alone , a Spiritualist : Next plane to this is the astral plane where we rest until it is decided which plane we go to , all depending on how our life has been spent on this earth . We can come back to earth if we so wish in spirit form . ' // I have chosen these typical quotations to demonstrate how very small a role dogmatic Christian beliefs play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people mourning the death of a near relative . The absence of supernatural fears is the more surprising since a quarter of the population say that they believe in the Devil . This is the only form of supernatural belief ( of those asked about ; I thought a direct question whether the respondent believed in God would not get an honest answer ) in which the difference between men and women is not marked ; though men have a distinctly higher proportion of disbelief , women of uncertainty . Belief in the Devil is very slight among those under 34 , among inhabitants of the metropolises , and in the South-West ; it is highest in the North-West , with its high proportion of Roman Catholics . It would seem that the Devil who is believed in is active in this world only ; not a single respondent voiced a belief in eternal damnation . iii The Clergy For the great majority of the respondents , the clergyman who conducted the funeral was a technician hired to do his job in much the same fashion as the undertakers or monumental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the former than with the latter . Of the 8o people I interviewed , only 14 made any spontaneous mention of their clergyman or minister ; and half of these were in Scotland . In Scotland , it is customary for members of both the Scottish and English Churches to have a service , conducted by the clergyman or minister , in the house of mourning for the relatives , prior to a second and more public service in the church ; and when the minister or clergyman had come to offer consolation and // help this was remembered with appreciation . An incon-solable widow of a baker , aged 53 ( 29 ) , said : The minister was awfu ' good . He and the doctor was both here . And after it was all over the minister came to see if I was all right and if I wanted a job . Of course , I go regular to the Church and the Women 's Guild . ' Four other Scottish mourners spoke appreciatively of the minister 's goodness and helpfulness in calling to offer consolation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the minister had not called . A rather dour 71-year-old widower ( 30 ) , a former worker in a jute factory , remarked : The minister 's never been to see me since the fu-neral . He need n't bother to come now , because if he does come I wouldna ' say owermuch . ' A 6o-year-old shop-owner ( 24 ) , who had lost his mother to whom he was very deeply attached , complained that he had never seen the minister since the funeral , that he thought the minister might have been able to give him the help he needed , but had not and that 's what puts me against them . ' Just because the customary link between clergyman or minister and parishioner is closer in Scotland , and the formal ritual of mourning more completely maintained , any dereliction from what the mourner considers the minister 's duty evokes resentment and hostility which is very seldom voiced in England . When such complaints are made in England , they tend to come from the settled residential towns and villages where the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the widow of a retired civil servant in the South-West ( 31 ) : // I was a bit annoyed with the clergyman . We 'd had a new one , he 'd been here for over two years before my husband died , and he 'd never been up to see him . The clergyman who was here before , who was a great friend of my husband 's gave the service ; he came over from a town nearly a hundred miles away . ' The widow of a retired serviceman , also from the SouthWest ( 32 ) , whose husband had been ailing 7 years : We never had no help , not from anybody , and it made me very bitter . Do you know , my husband was a good living man , he was confirmed , he was a really good living man ; everybody liked him . But do you know , the vicar came and saw him once , he never saw him after . . . . Do you know , when the harvest festivals were on ? my husband ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard one day that at a certain harvest festival , the people that was there were having the stuff . The vicar was no help , not one bit . There is a nice woman next door , she 'll help . I got bad hands , you see . But after my husband died , nobody came to see meno one , and that hurt me more than anything . When I could have done with company , I had nobody , nobody . That really got me . ' From the South-West , too , come echoes of the doctrinal disputes which rent the Church of England in the last century . A courageous and pious 85-year-old widow , living alone ( 22 ) said : The one thing I do miss is going to church ? not being able to get out , I miss that terribly . The present vicar does not call . I keep in touch with my old parish , St. ; you know I always keep in touch with them , they come and see me . In any case they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I always think there 's something evil in doing that . ' There is of course some appreciation , as well as some criticism . A very recently widowed woman from the Midlands ( 33 ) , whose husband was cremated said : It was a marvellous service and a marvellous vicar . My husband 's business friends were there , and the vicar stood near me and spoke to me ; he was marvellous really , he read some marvellous passages to me . I 'm peculiar , I believe in the New Testament . ' The widow of a colliery maintenance engineer from the North-East ( 34 ) found the vicar 's visit a real consolation ; and a very humble , deaf old lady from the North-West ( 35 ) , who 'd lost her husband after more than 50 years of marriage excused the Church of England clergyman for not visiting her : He came to me at graveside , minister , he said he would come and see me , but he has n't been yet . He will be coming ; it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outsider that the English clergy are missing a major opportunity for charity in failing to visit the recently bereaved in their parishes , even if they are not churchgoers . For it must be emphasized that the majority of the people I interviewed made no spontaneous mention of the clergy at all , though nearly all were questioned about the type of religious service that had accompanied the burial or cremation , about visits and help in the days after bereavement , and the consolations ( if any ) they had found in their grief . CHAPTER THREE THE FUNERAL AND AFTER i Disposal of the Body As has already been stated , burials and cremations are almost always accompanied by religious services ; only two of the respondents reported non-denominational interments . There are slight discrepancies between the denominations to which the respondents claim adherence and the type of service at the funeral of their near relative ; the proportion of Church of England ( and , to a lesser extent , Church of Scotland ) ceremonies is greater than the number claiming adherence to those creeds , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group who stated that they had no religious denomination gave their relatives the rites of the Church . On at least one occasion , the choice of rite to accompany the disposal of a body was the cause of family disagreement : a 72-year-old spinster from the North-East was in a nervous state after her brother 's death because her sister-in-law had given him a Church of England funeral when he was by rights a Roman Catholic . Nearly a quarter of the Roman Catholics reported a Church of England funeral for their near relative ; there is no evidence to show whether this was due to mixed marriages or to lack of sectarian feeling ; half of those who claimed adherence to no sect provided similar rites , as did a fifth of the Nonconformists . Church of England funerals are especially frequent in the upper middle classes ; // their proportion increases slightly with the age of the re-spondents . The general sample were not asked whether their rela-tive had been buried or cremated ; but of those whom I re-interviewed and questioned on this subject , 40 had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen cremation ( there is no choice allowed for practis-ing Roman Catholics ' . or Orthodox Jews ) is rather sur-prisingly high ? according to the Cremation Society there were 41 per cent cremations in 1963 . Among these se-lected informants , cremation was overwhelmingly pre-ferred in the South-West and in the North-East ; in Scot-land burial was preferred . A few respondents felt deeply about the method of disposal of the body . A widowed old-age pensioner from Scotland ( 19 ) spoke for several people in claiming that cremation was contrary to the Biblical injunction dust to dust ' , and , furthermore , that bits of the box ' are bound to get mixed up with the ashes . A 43-year-old widow from the North-West ( 21 ) , whose husband had collapsed and died on the football field said : At the actual service , about half-way through it , I did n't want to cry because somehow a cremation ? to me it does n't seem as final , to me , as when you see somebody go down in the ground ... to me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit unfin-ished as if nothing was as definite as when you see them go down in the ground . ' Similarly , a slightly older widow from the South-East ( 36 ) : I 'd like to be cremated . I had my mother cremated , // I think it 's healthier . I think for my husband , who was buried , it was too final . A lot of people disagreed with me . I would n't like to be buried , that 's too final . ' A number of respondents advanced aesthetic or hy-gienic reasons for preferring cremation ; if the body had been deformed , or wasted by disease , or mutilated , it was apparently felt that it was more fitting that it should be burned . We thought it wiser , ' said an elderly woman from the South-East ( 3 ) of her adopted daughter , her niece , who had been afflicted with acromegaly . Especially with the kind of disease it was , ' said a widow from the Mid-lands ( 2 ) , whose husband had died of cancer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was that of economy . A widow in Scotland ( II ) whose husband had died of a heart attack in the South of En-gland explained that she had chosen cremation on ac-count of you see his family wanted him brought back here ; I thought I would keep the expense down , doing that ' . In many cases , it would appear , cremation is chosen be-cause it is felt to get rid of the dead more completely and finally than does burial . As far as I can tell , the question of the expense of a funeral or cremation does not seem to have borne hardly on any of the respondents , not even on those living on old-age pensions or National Assistance ; the display and expense of a lovely funeral ' seem to be completely things of the past .2 The one item of expense which was men40 DEATH , GRIEF , AND MOURNING tioned by several of the poorer respondents was the erection of a headstone over the grave when their relative had been buried ; a number were saving up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , avoided when the body is cremated . Crematoria have halls or gardens of remembrance in which plaques can be erected ; but such a plaque was only set up by one informant , out of the 40 who had had their relative cremated . Fourteen of them had had their relative 's name inscribed in the Book of Remembrance , which is a feature of many crematoria . This is described as an expensive volume of vellum , with one page for every day of the year . On each day the book is opened at the appropriate date ; and on this anniversary the mourners can go and read their relative 's name and take flowers . The cost of an entry into such a book is stated to be between two and eight guineas.3 // ' When they attend a funeral or cremation , four-fifths of the men , but less than half the women , indicate that they are mourners by their dress . The difference in practice between the sexes can no doubt be in large part accounted for by the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also often a crepe armband ? are relatively cheap and relatively inconspicuous ; whereas the traditional all-black mourning outfit for women is neither . This does not , however , seem to be a full explanation ; a few women ( 5 per cent ) made minor modifications to their costume to show they were mourners ( compared with two-thirds of the men ) ; one man and two women in five wore predominantly black clothes ; a fifth of the men and over half the women ( 52 per cent ) gave no public indication that they were mourners . This abandonment of the wearing of mourning by women does seem to represent a major change in British customs over the last 50 years ; it is also a reversal of the practices of Christian Europe , where it was , and is , traditional for women to indicate their bereaved condition more markedly and for a far longer time than their male relatives . For the minority of women who do wear mourning this persistence in its display still holds good . A third of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their signs of mourning within the month ; 18 per cent of the men and 22 per cent of the women wore mourning for more than three months after the funeral . These persistent wearers of mourning , who follow the older traditions , can be identified with some precision . They are predominantly over 45 , from the unskilled working classes , somewhat concentrated in the larger towns and in the North-West ; and it is husbands or wives they mourn , much more frequently than any other rela42 DEATH , GRIEF , AND MOURNING tive . These distinctions in mourning clothing are much less marked on the day of the funeral . The South-West and Midlands show , by a small degree , the highest proportion of people who make no changes in their costume for the funeral . For the old-fashioned and the old the omission of such signs of mourning can be very distressing . The 67-yearold widow of a colliery maintenance engineer in the North-East ( 34 ) considered that the most painful of all her memories was : It 's just the son came when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral , he had a grey tie and not a black tie , and I thought how awful it was . That did affect me ? it did , yes . ' The abandonment of the wearing of mourning ( apart from a black tie on the day of the funeral ) is considerably more advanced in the upper middle and professional classes than in the rest of the community , in the SouthWest and the Midlands , and in the bigger towns . Scotland has the lowest proportion of people wearing no mourning clothes . The young , under 34 , are slightly more likely to wear signs of mourning on the day of the funeral than are their elders ; but , with insignificant exceptions , they give up such clothes within the month . The customs of mourning dress , which were general when I was a boy , are now predominantly maintained by the old , the poor and the unskilled . ii Family Gatherings Immediately after the funeral the mourners gather in the house for a family meeting , sometimes accompanied by prayers , in three-quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Scotland and the North ; it is less fre-quent in the South of England . It is also somewhat more general in the larger towns ; but in general the distribution of this custom is much the same for people of all ages , of all social classes and of all creeds . Apart from the religious rites accompanying the disposal of the body , this is the most widely spread ritual of mourning in Britain today . In the days after the funeral , there is a likelihood that special visits will be paid by relatives and by neighbours , those by neighbours being slightly more common . Only in about a quarter of the cases will there be no cere-monious visits of any sort . As with the gatherings after the funeral , these ceremonious visits of condolence are most general in Scotland and in the North-East ; they are least frequent in the South-East and North-West ; in these latter areas the visits are more likely to be from neigh-bours than from relatives . Neighbours are particularly at-tentive to the widowed in the bigger towns . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilled working class and in the upper middle and pro-fessional classes who have lost a parent or a sibling ; but such visits are a more general custom than I had assumed ; their incidence is greater when the mourners are young . iii Gravestones For Roman Catholics4 and Orthodox Jews burial of the dead is enjoined ; and for the latter so is a visit to the cemetery on the anniversary ( counted by the Jewish cal-endar ) of the death . But for those whose creeds allow a choice between burial and cremation , the opting for bur-ial implies the acceptance of a style of mourning of a // different nature from that implicit in cremation . It also implies a willingness to engage in continuous extra expense to keep green the memory of the dead . A gravestone is so substantial an outlay that , in at least three cases ( 5 , 35 , 37 ) poor mourners had to save up for over a year to make up the money ; the taking of flowers and keeping the grave neat and decent are further continuous expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but four had erected , or were saving to erect , gravestones ; of these four one was an old-age pensioner on national assistance , one had quarrelled with ( or been quarrelled with by ) his wife 's family , one had no love for his dead parents ( 38 ) , and one was a Christian Scientist who denied the reality ' of death . Of the remainder all but four visited the graves and tended them ; three of these were prevented from doing so by reasons of distance or illhealth ; the fourth was a practitioner of Yoga who had followed out her sister 's wishes in having a stone erected for her ( 26 ) , but gave no intellectual support to the practice . All the remainder made regular visits to the graves of their dead relative . Ten of these make relatively infrequent visits , ranging from once or twice a year to once a month ; the rest go so frequently that a visit to the cemetery becomes an important part of their weekly routine . This routine visiting is particularly common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country which does not have some examples . The poor widow of a Scottish baker ( 29 ) goes to the cemetery : When the good weather 's in every fortnight . I do n't take the flower , but he gets a wreath every Christmas . It 's all we can do . ' // A Scottish local government employee ( 39 ) visits his mother 's grave every Sunday ; so too does a seventeenyear-old youth from the Midlands ( 40 ) , accompanying his mother to his father 's grave ; so also does the widow of a taxi-driver ( 36 ) from the South-East . A disconsolate widower , a cement worker , from the South-East ( 41 ) goes every week , sometimes twice a week ; I 've got flowers planted ' . The wife of a jobbing gardener who had lost her mother , also from the South-East ( 5 ) and whose family was saving up for a gravestone in the distant cemetery said : One of my sisters goes twice a week ; and I usually go once a fortnight ? it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant sales manager in the Midlands who lost her father two years ago ( 6 ) says of her 69-yearold mother : She wo n't live with any of us because it 's not fair to intrude on the younger folk . She 's got her memories and she 's quite happy . . . . At Christmas she comes to one of us . She wo n't stop with us because she likes her own bed ; and she says she 's near to my dad ? he 's buried down the road . The stone cost her about ? 50 . She visits the grave twice a week and buys flowers once a week , and she ca n't afford it . I go on Saturday if it is n't wet . . . after the funeral I was n't exactly sleeping , but lying awake ; and if it was snowing I used to say " Think of our poor Dad in that churchyard . " ' The proprietor of a small shop in Scotland ( 24 ) , who lost his mother fifteen months ago , takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retired stoker in the Midlands ( 4 ) visits his wife 's grave ? she died in 196o ? every week on Sundays , Tuesdays and Thursdays . // An independent writer from the South-East ( 8 ) told of the precautions taken by his parents to avoid such a continuing cult : My grandfather insisted that it should only be a wooden cross , so that it would only last a lifetime and then rot . My mother was much the same , and did ask us that if we put up a memorial , it was to be a small one in Bath stone , because it weathered quickly , and after 30 years you ca n't see an inscription . ' By and large , the choice of cremation obviates such a cult . Quite a few informants go to the crematorium on the anniversary of the death , when the Book of Remembrance ' is open with the name of the deceased inscribed ; and three people ( 2 , 14 , 31 ) who had arranged cremations by the express wishes of the deceased treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wife of a director of a small firm in the South-East ( 14 ) explained that her uncle and aunt who had been her adopting parents : Were cremated ; it was their wish to be cremated . They 'd got no children of their own ; and they said that they 'd far rather know that they were in a garden of remembrance than a grave that was neglected ; because the grandparents and so on who 've got graves in Highgate cemetery . . . where all the young have moved away , there 's just so much money sent every year to the upkeep of the graves , you see ; and they felt they did n't want that . ' This woman still mourns deeply for the loss of her adopting mother , bursting into tears ? in her phrase ' boilGRIEF // ing over ' ? at any mention or recollection of her ; she still prays to get advice from her and would , I think , have liked a grave to tend . CHAPTER FOUR GRIEF AND MOURNING i Public Signs of Mourning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices have been reported , it is customary for people bereaved of near relatives to abstain for a traditionally fixed period from some social activities and from public diversions . For a period , mourners lived in partial social seclusion , as they worked through and came to terms with their loss ; the end of this period might be signified by a return to normal dress and a complete re-entry into all social activities ; or , as in traditional England , the process might be a prolonged one , with gradual modifications of costume ( as the move from deep mourning ' to ' mourning ' to half-mourning ' dress ) , signifying the types of social life and diversions which were deemed suitable at that stage of the mourning process . These customs have practically disappeared in England , though they are observed by over a third of the Scottish mourners . In England as a whole less than a fifth of the respondents said that they gave up any leisure activities for a time after the funeral , and in the Midlands and Western half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten ; the vast majority hid their grief and , ac48 DEATH , GRIEF , AND MOURNING cording to their statements , acted as if nothing had happened ' in any situation where they could be observed . In the minority of cases when diversions are given up , the period is usually a short one ; for a week or so , mourners may give up visits to the cinema or theatre , watching TV , dancing , sports , and club activities , in that order . These abstentions are chiefly practised by the young and unmarried , in mourning for the loss of a parent , usually a mother ; two typical cases of prolonged abstention from amusement after a mother 's death are a 48-year-old clerical assistant from the North-East ( zo ) who gave up dancing and going to the cinema for six months ; and an unmarried 50-year-old engineer from Scotland who gave up tennis , badminton , first aid activities and Civil Defence for a year . Such abstentions occur chiefly after the death of a parent ; they are much less frequent after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never occur after the death of a brother or sister . Indeed any overt abstentions after a sibling 's death are most uncommon . A very few widowers give up their club activities for a little after the death of their wives . A tiny group ( less than 4 per cent ) cut down on their social life for a time ? visit friends less , or , in a single case , entertain less ; none of these people come from the largest towns . But with the general conspiracy to pretend that death has not occurred and that nobody is grieving , two-thirds of the respondents think that bereavement meant no difference to their social life ; the frequency of contacts with their friends did not change . Of the remainder , zo per cent said that they saw more of their friends than before their bereavement , 15 per cent less . Those who felt that their friends rallied round them in their grief came from Scotland in particular ( where , according to this survey , all the rituals of mourning are // more observed ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparison thought that they saw less of their friends after their bereavement . In general , friends were more attentive to mourners who were over 45 , lived in the smaller towns , and particularly to the widowed . Mourners in the unskilled working classes noticed the most difference in the behaviour of their friends ; 28 per cent thought they saw more of them , 18 per cent less ; the corresponding figures for the skilled working class are 13 and 14 per cent . The middle and professional classes say that their contact with their friends remained steady ; 17 per cent state it was more , 8 per cent less , than before their bereavement . It is above all the younger respondents and those living in the big towns who feel ( in nearly a third of the cases ) that they saw less of their friends after bereavement than before . Except coincidentally , this group is not the same as that which chose to abstain from social intercourse for a period ; it would seem that they have been avoided , rather than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mourning Although mourners can avoid giving any social expression to their grief , grief is none the less real , a deep , complex and long-lasting psychological process with physiological overtones and symptoms ; and of these the most widespread are disturbances of sleep and loss of weight . Two-thirds of the women mourners and two-fifths of the men stated that they slept less well after their bereavement than they did before ; over half the bereaved population suffered from disturbed rest . Significantly , I think , the incidence of disturbed sleep tends to be higher in those areas where mourning is least ritualized ? in the // Midlands , and in the biggest towns . In the upper middle and professional classes disturbed sleep , or the possibility of it , seems to be dealt with by the doctor 's almost routine prescription of hypnotics ( according to a number of informants ) . The effect of barbiturates on people suffering from severe grief seems to have been inadequately studied ; more than one informant described an experience similar to that of a recent widow in the South-East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hospital sent a couple of pills for me and , do you know , I took one and went to bed , and I literally shook all over . I thought they had given me the wrong pills and were killing me . I said , " Never again will I take a sleeping pill ! " I literally shook for an hour . . . . Do you know , it was a week before I could go to bed without shaking . ' The prescription of such unaccustomed hypnotics is kindly meant ; but on occasion they have considerably added to the mourner 's distress . The younger the mourner , the more likely it is that his or her sleep will be disturbed ; and it is only a minority ( 17 per cent ) of the widowed who consider that their sleep was not modified by grief . There is a tiny group ( between 3 and 4 per cent ) who think their sleep improved and that they gained weight after the death of their parent ( in the majority of cases ) or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were tending invalids whose death was not in doubt ; their release from such duties and from the accompanying apprehension might have resulted in improved health . This can not be determined from the tables , for the number is so small ; and this small group was markedly unwilling to talk about their experiences . // Fewer people are conscious of losing weight during mourning ? just on half the women and a quarter of the men did so . This change is reported more by those under 44 than those above that age , by mourners from the North-East and North-West and from the bigger towns ; a very high proportion ( over half ) of the mourners in the clerical class report this , double the proportion from the upper middle and skilled working classes . Widows and widowers report loss of weight in more than two cases out of three ; only one in eight of those who have lost a sibling make the same statement . I think it is perhaps significant that in Scotland , where the rituals of mourning are the more generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not proportionately as high as in either the Midlands or the two Northern regions . Although the involuntary physical changes of disturbed sleep and loss of weight are far more general than the voluntary temporary abstention from recreational or social activities , it is to a significant extent the same people who show both signs of mourning . Although social ritual no longer gives guidance to the behaviour of either the mourners themselves or the people who come into con-tact with them , the process of mourning still poses a pro-longed problem of psychological adjustment for the be-reaved with , in nearly half the cases , some of the same symptoms that accompany grave physical illness.l iii Dreams and Visions Thirty-one of the eighty people I interviewed recol-lected vivid dreams of the person they were mourning . Five people maintained that they never dreamt at all ; // the remainder did not recall dreams of the recently dead . Widows are much the most regular dreamers about their dead husbands ; 15 out of 23 report this experience . Next come children dreaming about their dead parent ; 9 out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 widowers dream of their dead wife ; 4 out of 15 dream of their dead brother or sister ; none of the six desolate parents who had lost a grown child report this comforting experience . For , on the whole , these dreams are comforting ; only six informants report an unpleasant feeling-tone ( four of these are dreams about dead parents ) . As an inconsolable poor widow of a Scottish baker said ( 29 ) : I do dream , but I canna ' keep it long enough . It just vanishes . You see him so nice , and try to keep it on when you wake . . . . He looks younger ? aye , nice , nice . Last time I was dreaming he had lovely hair ? I told Mrs. X he was younger lookin ' than ever . Funny , is n't it ? ' A 45-year-old widow from the North-West , whose husband had owned a small shop which was subsequently taken over under a compulsory purchase order ( z1 ) : I dream of him occasionally . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him all about the compensation ; I suppose it was in my mind . If he 'd answered me I would have taken his advice . I 'm not one of these spiritualists ; but it did seem so real at the time . It did n't upset me . There was a bit of a laugh in it as well . ' A 55-year-old widower from the South-East , employed in local government ( 42 ) , whose wife had died five years previously : // As a matter of fact , I still do sometimes dream about her . I wake up suddenly in the night and think that she 's there , you know , and it is n't till I 'm thoroughly awake that I realize that . . . . She is generally younger , as when we first married ; that 's the time when I dream of her mostly , I think . . . . I find them quite pleasant . ' The 71-year-old wife of a pensioned bricklayer from the South-East ( 37 ) talking about her loved younger sister : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know ; we have a laugh and that ; we 're always together and working in my dreams , you see . Because we worked together sometimes on the land years ago hop-picking and we used to have a wonderful laugh and game out in the fields ; and I can always see her in that field , you know , and the games we used to have . ' A Scottish school-teacher ( 7 ) who lost his mother a year ago : Occasionally I dream about her ; strangely , it 's mostly associated with scenes of my childhood . I 'm a small boy , and she 's very pale . Always very pale . I think that may be because I saw her when she was dead , and one of my thoughts was " this deathly pallor " , you know . I 've seen death in the war but this was new to me . ' It is worth noting that in these typical comforting dreams the dead person is envisaged as young ; and on the evidence from these interviews I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a rich and happy one , and that the mourner is working through his or her grief without too much disturbance . The converse is not completely true ; although all the dreams told to me with an unpleasant feeling-tone envisaged the lost // relative as last seen just before or just after death , some of the comforting ones were also of the dead in his or her last days . In these cases I think there is some evidence ( which I can not detail without hazarding my informants ' anonymity ) that there was a good deal of ambivalence in the broken relationship . A pretty example of the two types of dream is given by the wife of an assistant sales manager in the Midlands ( 6 ) , whose father had died in the cold January of 1963 , and whose mother ( as recounted on p. 7 ) had kept his body in the coffin in the front room , and made her daughter kiss him good night ; she dreamt of him every night , with his white face , in blue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't get him out of my mind ; it was horrible . . . . Later she dreamt of all the places we went to with him when we were kids , and of all my childhood days when he used to take us out . . . . He seemed big in these dreams ; actually he was n't a tall man . He was very good to us children , you know ; he took us everywhere . ' A number of the distressing dreams are founded on the traumatic experience of seeing a dying or dead person for the first time ; the wife of a van-driver from the SouthWest ( 43 ) dreamed of her sister-in-law after her death : Next couple of nights I could see her ; every time I closed my eyes I could see her . . . . I seen her when she died . Oh , she was terrible ! She must have suffered . ' The widow from Scotland whose husband had died of a heart attack on a family outing ( II ) has nightmares about finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of just as we were ; it just makes me feel as if next // day he was coming in ' , and she finds some consolation from the fact that it happened down in England ? I can leave that part ' . The German-born wife of a skilled worker from the Midlands has nightmares about her dead mother : Well , she was in a coma , and it was the look on her face ; the eyes were open and I knew she could n't see me and I was trying to make contact with her . The nightmare was trying to talk to her and not being able to . ' A 61-year-old widow from the Midlands ( 44 ) says that when she dreams of her husband : That 's a strange thing , when I do he 's always one step ahead away from me ; I never get any contact . ... He looks just as he died . ' A similar nightmare is recounted by the 19-year-old wife of a miner in the Midlands ( 1 ) about her dead fa-ther : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , it was terrible . ' An intelligent married woman from the South-East , who was quite conscious of her ambivalence towards her dead mother ( 45 ) : dreamt a lot , either that she 'd come back or been in hospital and the diagnosis was a mistake . . . . rather distressing dreams . . . . I never dreamt of her as a young woman , but then my mother was 30 when I was born , so that most of my adult life she was an older woman . ' A very depressed and distressed widow of a process worker in the South-East ( 46 ) dreamed that her husband // was in bed , one night , on top of her ; he appeared as he was in his last years . This woman was in such a disturbed state , that I could not decide whether she was describing a dream or an hallucination ; these are described by six informants . A hale 85-year-old widow from the South-West ( 22 ) describes both experiences : I do n't dream of him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he says , " Oh Agnes ! " ; then I wake up and realize . . . . I go quite back in the past , it 's stupid of me . I remember I was sitting in that chair one night and I was reading , and I thought I heard a rustle ; and I looked up and there he was in his dressinggown ! I 'm not a bit frightened of anything like that , it 's rather nice . It 's stupid to be afraid ; what is there to be afraid of ? My mother used to tell us when we were little that if the live people did as little harm as the dead , we 'd be all right , ' A poor and lonely widow , aged 74 , in the North-West ( 35 ) , said she does n't dream of him much : I fancy I can see him on t ' chair . That chair when you come in , love . I 've no one to talk to . ' A 7o-year-old Scottish widow ( 19 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes into your mind , and you see him , you know . ' Similarly , a 64-year-old widow from the South-West , whose husband had been ill at home a long time before he died ( 32 ) , said : The first three months , I used to forget . I used to be making a cup of tea and take one into the front room for him . Things like that . And how many times have I heard that invalid bell ! ' // The only person who recounted a frightening experience was a small shopkeeper in the South-East ( 47 ) who had let his upstairs rooms to lodgers : I could n't sleep in there after the wife died . I was upstairs after the wife died and I was watching television for the first time after she died ; and all of a sudden I could see my wife as plain as anything , sitting in one of those chairs . I flew downstairs and never went in that room again . . . . It was very frightening . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife . It seems not unlikely that such vivid experiences of the presence of the dead can occur in many cultures : and they can easily be elaborated into complex structures of belief . iv Condolences Nowhere is the absence of an accepted social ritual more noticeable than in the first contacts between a mourner and his neighbours , acquaintances or workmates after a bereavement . Should they speak of the loss , or no ? Will the mourner welcome expressions of sympathy , or prefer a pretence that nothing has really happened ? Will mention of the dead provoke an outburst of weeping in the mourner , which might prove contagious ? The only community in Britain , as far as I know , for whom this is not a problem is that of the Orthodox Jews . Among them , the mourner is greeted with the formula I wish you long life ' and this demands no reply ; after it has been spoken the conversation proceeds normally . But even people who have the advantage of this ritual are at a loss when dealing with people outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 15 ) said : // People are a little embarrassed to talk about these things , even if they feel quite sorry . One does n't know quite what to do . Quite a well-known figure in this town who died about a week ago ? well , his son who I know fairly well , I did n't quite know whether to go in his shop and say , " Well , I 'm sorry about your father " or not . He has probably got plenty to think about , and plenty of closer friends . . . . I 've found it a little bit awkward when people came in and spoke about my father , because I had to repeat the same thing over and over again , till I was tired of repeating it really ... Similarly , a recently widowed woman from the SouthEast ( 36 ) said of her friends and neighbours : They probably felt a little bit embarrassed ; I 'd have felt a little bit embarrassed . When I 've met people before , I 've thought : " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other way ? " and I think my neighbours have felt the same . . . . I think people tend to be embarrassed if you speak to them ; they feel they must say something , and they do n't quite know how to say it . ' Fifty-four of the mourners I interviewed held definite views about the expression of condolences . Twenty-eight of these felt that they had received comfort and support from the sympathy of their neighbours and workmates ; twenty said that they had found them painful in various degrees ; and six were resentful because nobody had offered them sympathy . These were all lonely people , all but one of them living in big cities ; the two who came from the North-East were adherents and exponents of locally unpopular creeds ? a Christian Scientist and a Roman Catholic . Neighbours ? do n't speak of them ! ' was the recurring refrain in their complaints . // It is difficult to discern any consistent pattern among those who said they found it easier ' when their friends or neighbours did not express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by men than by women ; and in every case but one ( a young man who had lost his father ( 40 ) the mourner was grieving for a dead member of the opposite sex ? men for wives , mothers or sisters and conversely . In many cases it seems as though these mourners felt their response would be inappropriate , that they would show more or less grief than was seemly . Thus a young shop-manageress from the Midlands who had lost her father ( 48 ) : People said they were sorry . I did n't want it . It had n't affected me as tragically as they thought it might . ' More general is the fear of being overwhelmed by emotion which is not acceptable to themselves . A very recent widow from the Midlands ( 33 ) who finds no relief from weeping said : Meeting people was terrible , that 's why I had to go to the doctor 's ; I could n't face them at all . As long as they stop and say , " How are you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very popular man , and lots of people stopped me whom I did n't know . It made me cry . Anyway , I stopped taking a handkerchief with me , thinking I would n't cry if I had n't got one . ' Similarly a working-class mother from the North-West , grieving for her son ( 49 ) : I do n't like people talking about it . . . . They kept coming like , but I did n't want to go out to meet anyone . ' 6o DEATH , GRIEF , AND MOURNING Her husband explained : When she went out she was meeting them , see , and they kept sympathizing . . . . Well , I have n't been as bad , like .... Well , I 'd rather them not mention him really , me own children does n't mention him a lot ; they know how it hurts , you see . ' It seems a fair generalization to say that most of those who rejected their friends ' and neighbours ' expressions of sympathy , or who were greatly disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened of their own emotions . It is possibly significant ( and not an artifact of the small sample ) that the majority of these rejecters of sympathy come from the traditionally dour ' Northern regions and Scotland . Only two of them are from the South . It is equally difficult to find common sociological traits which would categorize those who found comfort from their neighbours ' sympathy and condolences . There are slightly more women than men voicing this sentiment , twice as many working class as middle class , predominantly mourning their parents , husbands or wives ; it is only for a minority that the loss of a brother or sister in adult life is publicly announced or deeply mourned . The loss of an adult child is ( as will be developed in Chapter Six ) so shattering that there is no comfort to be found , with very rare exceptions . My impression is that those people who welcomed their neighbours ' sympathy were well integrated and happy in their communities and their work , and were mourning deeply , but without either ostentation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can accept sympathy in their grief are better adjusted socially and psychologically than those who cannot. // Such appreciation is usually expressed in fairly few words . Thus a widower from the South-East ( 47 ) running his own small business : The neighbours were a great help to me . . . . Very friendly . You see , I 've been in this locality for years and years . I know them all ; it 's first names with me . ' A woman in a fulltime factory job in Scotland , who had recently lost her father ( 5o ) to whom , as an only daughter , she was very attached : Very good everybody was . I think it 's better that her workmates talked about her loss . There 's no use shuttin ' yoursel ' up inside , is there ? ' A widow from the North-East , working as a bus-conductress ( 51 ) , talking about her colleagues on the buses , when she went back to work ten days after her husband 's death : Oh , they were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I mean they knew , they were very good . ' The caretaker of a block of working-class flats in the North-East who had recently lost his father to whom he was much attached ( 52 ) : They all came up to me and said how they were sorry . . . . They all talked to me , and asked after things .... ' A professional man in the South-West who had lost his 15-year-old boy in a tragic accident ( 53 ) : My employer gave me every consideration ? in fact he gave me a fortnight off . The whole office staff was very , very good . They were kindness itself , by // being not too obvious that they were sorry ... but they were embarrassed in trying to offer sympathy . ' On the basis of these interviews , I am inclined to consider that the grateful acceptance of spoken condolences is the most reliable single sign that the mourner is dealing adequately with his grief . My evidence does not allow me to make any similar generalization about condolences conveyed through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and professional classes or the mourning cards frequently employed by the skilled clerical and working classes in the North and in Scotland ( as described in pp. 8-9 ) . When mourners did mention these postal condolences , they tended to stress the number received : Do you know I had sixty-three letters , and I 'm answering every one . I think it 's rather a coward 's way to put a notice in the newspaper . ' ( 36 ) This statement by the widow of a self-employed taxidriver in the South-East is typical ; she certainly had found comfort in the demonstration that her husband had been so widely respected . Similarly , the widow of a colliery maintenance engineer from the North-East ( 34 ) , whose husband had died of cancer nearly two years before my visit , kept the stack of mourning cards she had received in a convenient drawer and would have enjoyed showing them all to me . In those classes and regions in which letters of condolence or mourning cards are customary , the absence of such a courtesy will be frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bereaved and those who did not send the expected tribute . Receiving and responding to postal condolences are typically solitary activities . // When anything had been written about the deceased in the local newspapers this was always referred to with gratification . CHAPTER FIVE STYLES OF MOURNING i Introduction Up to the beginning of this century every society in the world , to the best of my knowledge , had explicit rules of behaviour which every mourner was meant to follow . In the smaller societies , and in those which had a Church or religion to which all the citizens belonged by definition , there was most generally a single set of rules which applied to people of every social degree ; in the complex , heterogeneous industrial societies there were a number of accepted variants of the rules , dependent on creed , locality or financial or social status . These variants were socially determined ; customs varying from the norm were followed because the mourner was a Quaker , or a Welshman , or an aristocrat ; but , with quite insignificant exceptions , everybody knew how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dress when they suffered a bereavement and how to treat other mourners . People might feel that the accepted ritual was hypocritical , because it forced them to display more grief than they felt , or heartless , because it placed a taboo on the mention of the dead person or on any public signs of mourning . // I know of no evidence to show that this resentment of the social rules resulted in aberrant individual practice . As far as my evidence goes , there are only three , relatively small , communities in Britain today whose members have rules of mourning available for them which are followed by a sizeable section of these communities . Of these , the most complete and detailed rules are those for the Orthodox Jews ; these lay down in almost every particular the way mourners should behave . The Church of Scotland has a ritual which many of its members ( perhaps particularly in the working classes ) follow ; and Roman Catholics from Ireland have , many of them , kept up the Irish practices of the wake even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier . These Irish Catholics , too , are predominantly working class and the group tends to be endogamous . The Orthodox Jews and the Catholics enjoin burial ; the members of the Church of Scotland whom I interviewed had chosen burial in the proportion of two to one . Outside these three small communities , the style of mourning in Britain is now a matter of individual choice ( as is the method of disposing of the body ) . Recorded human societies have chosen among a gamut of possibilities , from the four days ' intensive mourning among the Mohave Indiansl of the Colorado river to the life-long withdrawal imposed on widows in classical China and Hindu India and the mummification of ancient Egypt or Peru , through all the gradations of calendrical rituals and observances . For nearly every position on this gamut an analogue can be found in contemporary British practice . This suggests , firstly , that the varied cultural practices recorded by anthropologists and historians may all have 1 Mohave Ethnopsychiatry and Suicide , George Devereux . // originated because they were congruent with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social rules ; and , secondly , that when , as for the majority in contemporary Britain , the cultural rules are discarded , the varieties of individual temperament will develop spontaneously private behaviour corresponding to nearly the whole gamut of recorded social responses to mourning . At present , it is only the bereaved who are allowed ? nay , forced ? to choose the type of behaviour which they find congenial or consider appropriate ; but it is , I think , possible to imagine a society where individual responses to other emotions would be similarly unpatterned . Because the behaviour of most mourners in contemporary Britain does not follow any explicit rules , it would be possible to organize the information given me by my informants and the observations I made in a variety of ways . In the pages that follow I have described the different styles of mourning primarily on the basis of the amount of time that the bereaved person acted like a mourner , or , according to his or her statements , felt that they were inwardly mourning although there was no public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern sects of Spiritualism and Christian Science dogmatically deny the existence of death ' ; and consequently convinced adherents of these sects would be going against their tenets if they admitted mourning for those who have passed on ' . A convinced , indeed fanatical , Spiritualist from the South-West , a 63-year-old widower who runs his own small business ( z8 ) said : // Well , I was brought up in the movement . You do n't countenance grief at all ; it relieves you of the thought of grief . You 've got the loss , but it 's only the physical loss . You do n't feel sadness because we look at it and treat it in a different way , what we call a more normal way . . . . The knowledge which I have today ? and I say knowledge , it is n't a belief ? the knowledge which I have today counts so much in life that it displaces fear and doubt and ? as you would term it ? grief , and they just become nothingness . ' The latest bereavement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , who had lived in the North-East . What , ' he asked rhetorically , was the difference between his being in the North-East and being dead ? It 's just a question of communications . ' Similarly , a 73-year-old widow from the North-East ( 27 ) : There 's no death in Science . There 's my Science and Health there . That I deeply believe ; if you 're a real Scientist you do n't believe in death . . . . It 's just like the pattern of a ship over the horizon , you know . We believe that . The ship goes over the horizon ; it 's still there , but we do n't see it . It 's just the soul departs . ' This lonely old lady had been a widow for forty years ; her husband had been converted to Christian Science three years before he passed on ' and the last thing he said to me was , Would I bring the two children up in Christian Science ? He said there was nothing else besides . ' Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that she did not mourn for her in any way . Since her neighbours were not Scientists she apparently had nothSTYLES // ing to do with them . Both these informants seemed to be somewhat out of contact with reality and with their neighbourhood . A socially much better adjusted woman was the wife of a disabled soldier in the South-West ( 26 ) who believed in Yoga . This woman had lost all her family ( except her husband ) , her last bereavement being a brother and sister who , like her parents , had died young from circulatory troubles . It is n't , ' she said , a death to frighten one ; actually I would be grateful to have the same one . . . they had no suffering . . . I do n't think about death a great deal ; I 've tried to get what to my way of thinking is a decent attitude , according to my lights , poor as they are ... . My husband and I have been greatly influenced by Yoga , which happened to us about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since . . . . Anyway , if one believes in reincarnation , I do n't think one can regard death as anything but casting off an old suit . ... I do n't like the way our society treats death , the sort of darkness of mourning . . . . I do not go much for mourning , and all those outward shows do n't mean much to me . But my family was very keen on having nice headstones and all that sort of thing , and I know my brother wanted one . . . . My sister , brother and mother all have a common grave in with a big headstone for Mother and two little ones for the others ... my brother died two years ago ; and I did go up last year to see if they had put this headstone up ; otherwise I do n't go ... // iii Absence of Mourning Besides those informants whose adherence to a creed outside the established Judeo-Christian traditions made them deny the importance of death , there was another group who claimed that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both men and women belong to this group , coming from varied social classes ; but the relative who was not mourned for was in all cases either a parent or a brother or sister , never a spouse or a child past infancy . The most general picture is of brothers or sisters who have drifted apart : I did n't see an awful lot of her , ' as a school-caretaker in the South-East ( 54 ) said about her sister ; You 've got to accept these things . . . they do n't worry me ' , in the words of a railway worker from the North-'West ( 55 ) who had recently lost a brother ; or , as a militant anti-religious retired worker in the South-East ( 56 ) said : Well , I used to run over to see the elder brother ; I just miss that ; and that 's all there is about it . . . . I accept the loss , that 's all . ' ' When brothers or sisters are not mourned it is usually because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourned it is usually because the relationship was predominantly negative . A married fitter from the North-East ( 38 ) who had lost both his father and his mother ( the father dying three years subsequently ) said : I was n't disturbed much . . . I 'll tell you , I had a bit of a rough bringing up . It was quite a rough bringing up . When you 've had one like that you do n't grieve . // Not much ? shall I say ? ? love .... They do n't come into our life . ' The intelligent and articulate wife of a local government officer from the South-East who had lost her mother a few months earlier ( 45 ) : Yes , her death was a relief , I suppose , with a guilty conscience . I suppose the fact that we did n't get on was that I was as pig-headed as she was . I can say that six months later . . . the neighbours were wonderful . I think they all knew that in some ways it was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I pretended to anybody that this was a very happy relationship . . . it was because we were so different ... . My feelings are now much more what they should have been earlier . . . . I feel that now for once perhaps I can have my independence , be a person in my own right , instead of having to do the things I know perfectly well I do n't want to do . ' The 4r-year-old wife of a school-teacher in the NorthEast ( 57 ) , both of whose parents had died within a few weeks of each other , did not mourn for them ; but in her case it would seem that it was less the absence of love than her inability to mourn any more . Her first husband had been killed on the anniversary of her wedding-day ; and this had been so traumatic an experience that even twenty years later , happily remarried and with three young children , she could not speak of it without tears welling up in her eyes and her florid complexion blanching . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wells of grief had been permanently dried . // iv Mourning Before Death When someone one loves is dying of an incurable illness , either when the mourner knows this and the invalid does not ( as discussed in Chapter One ) or when the sufferer is in great pain , a great deal of mourning may take place during this period , so that the eventual death is felt emotionally , as well as intellectually , to be a release . Thus , the widow of a retired serviceman in the South-West ( 32 ) : Well , he was ill for seven years , but it was a shock in the end . He was a very sick man for seven years ... . It was a relief because it hurt me to see him , it hurt me terrible ; I used to have to go out the back or upstairs , because I knew that as soon as he took these tablets , he was in pain . . . . I used to grieve terrible ? my neighbour will tell you ? I used to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me . I miss him terribly , but he 's really better off ; he did suffer , and he suffered right to the end ; in fact he had a terrible ending ; he was in agonies . . . . My husband used to say things that he did n't really mean , and it used to hurt me ; but the doctor said , " Mrs. , you 'll have to go through more than that ; Mr. is a very sick man , you 'll have to bear it " ; and from that day onward I did bear with it . ' A Scottish schoolmaster , talking about the death of his mother ( 7 ) : If I may speak personally about this , she had obviously been suffering and she was obviously depressed . She used to reminisce a great deal about her youth and so on and say that her happiest days were when // the family was young . I knew that morally she was sinking , I suppose that was natural . When I knew that there was no hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sake she would be better dead . The war scattered our family , and I do n't think she ever quite got over the loss of her two sons . ' A very depressed widower , a 66-year-old retired tracer from the North-East ( 58 ) whose wife had been dying of cancer over two years , found that her death was a release ; the worst had been that : I was worried all the time she was ill ; and of course I did n't know which way it was going to go , or whether she 'd get over it or not , you see . ' A 49-year-old widowed bus-conductress from the NorthEast , whose husband had suffered from arthritis for twenty years before dying suddenly from kidney disease ( 51 ) : I knew that would happen after all . I mean , when you 've lived with sickness for so many years as I did with him ? I mean at times it was pitiful to see him ? when this came and he went ? I mean , for him it was peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of it , that 's the way I looked at it . . . . To him , it was a relief , because he would have got ? with his old complaint he would have got that he would n't have been able to do anything for himself ; he was getting that way when he died , you see . ' Four other informants spoke in very similar terms . v Hiding Grief For about a dozen women the appropriate way to deal with grief is to carry on ' , to keep busy ' , to act , at least in // public , as if nothing had happened . Only one man , out of all those I interviewed , used phrases anything like these , a manager of a caravan site in the South-East ( 59 ) , about the death of his mother ; and this was a short and rather unsatisfactory interview in the open air , as his widowed father was an invalid in the house . It seemed as though , on a deeply symbolic level ( he was married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's role in tending his grief-stricken father . So , despite this one exception , I think this particular response can be described as feminine . Nine of the women were widows , three had lost their mother . This response has several components . One is the generous wish not to make others unhappy in one 's misery , particularly to protect children from the infection of grief . Frequently coupled with this is what might be described as psychological hypochondria , a belief that giving way to grief and mourning is morbid ' and ' unhealthy ' , and that psychological health will best be maintained by endless trivial distraction ? by continuing to be as active as possible . This aspect is most stressed by middle-class women without any gainful occupation ; and though advocates of such behaviour are found in all social classes , a disproportionately high number come from the widows of professional and managerial husbands . Thus the widow of a high civil servant in the South-West ( 6o ) repeatedly made the point that the only way to cope with grief is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friends and so on . She kept her mind off things ' by entertaining a good deal , preparing the food and doing all the shopping and housework . Variants on this theme are frequent ; the widow of another civil servant in the SouthWest ( 31 ) , with both her sons abroad , kept repeating : // The only thing is to keep busy . . . . Keep busy , you 've got to make a new life for yourself . . . . Well , if I can help anyone I will do , but the only secret is to keep busy . . . . Since I 've come back from a visit to a married son abroad I 've been doing bed-and-breakfast and now I 've got two boys from the technical college . The only thing is to keep busy .... I think the only salvation is to keep busy . My husband was 70 , so he 'd really lived his life ? still , I feel that his life was shortened by his experiences in the first war . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left their mark on that generation . ' The 45-year-old widow of a shopkeeper in the NorthWest ( 21 ) felt that she was carrying out the wishes of her loved husband in hiding her grief : He was n't a person who would have wanted me to be miserable . Outsiders think that you should do this and do that ; but he was n't the type who would have wanted me to sit at home , never go anywhere , go into deep mourning and all the rest of it . . . . Well , I naturally went into mourning , but I went out ; and then again I had the shop and I had to go into it , and that helped a lot . You put a bright face on , and people never actually brought it up ? but you knew it was there all the time . He was one of these first-name people . ... I suppose if I 'd been in the house , I could very easily have broken down , I suppose it 's some kind of complex we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop ? after a few days you get used to it . . . . Do n't get into a rut ; go out . My husband once said to me about a lady we know , whose husband had died five years before ? he said , " Let 's not sit near her , she 's always moaning " ; and I think I 've always thought of that . // I want people to be able to speak to me , although on your own in the house you get these feelings , do n't you ? I get the feeling sometimes that I 'll wake up , and it 'll have only been a dream and it will be gone ; it 's a queer sensation .... I think when you 've a family it 's not fair to them to be that way either . People do n't want to come in the house when there 's that kind of an atmosphere , do they ? ' Although the phrasing naturally varies , the stress on the therapeutic value of being busy , making work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brood ' , said the 73-year-old widow of a serviceman in the NorthEast . I was so busy at the time I did n't feel it , ' said the daughter of a businessman who had lost her mother ( 6i ) . You must occupy your mind with something else , ' said the Scottish widow of a professional man ( 62 ) who had died suddenly in Rhodesia . She also stated ( with I think considerable psychological insight ) ; I find too if you 've got a temper it 's much easier . I never cry , not about things about myself ; I think this self-pity is ghastly . ' The consideration for others in such behaviour is well expressed by the wife of a director of a small firm in the South-West ( 14 ) , still deeply distressed at the death of her adopting mother : I thought , there 's just nothing you can do about it ; and all the worrying in the world wo n't make any difference . You 've got not to upset yourself or make people unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , you see , you tell them that Nana ? my youngest boy 's thirteen , or he will be in three weeks ' time ? and you tell him that Nana died ? she 's gone ? and if you 're unhappy about it , you see , instead of saySTYLES // ing it 's just one of those things you 've got to accept ? we 're only here for a time sort of thing ? you make them unhappy ; and I mean if you upset a boy of that age , he 'll cry and you 're sort of sad with them all the time . ... Well you must sort of do that hide your feelings for those around you ; when you 're on your own and think about them , you do your mourning quietly , alone . The same as you might do praying . You do it alone and you do it just the same in your own room as you can in a church . ' Tears came into this woman 's eyes nearly every time she mentioned her Nana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prolonged , perhaps in part because she allowed it no outward show ; but I think she will get over it . With nearly all the others in this group I had the feeling that , by denying expression to their grief , they had reduced their lives to triviality , even though their purposeful busy-ness warded off any overt symptoms of depression . vi Time-limited Mourning I am using the phrase time-limited mourning ' to designate a phased pattern of behaviour : a period of intense grief typically characterized by weeping , loss of weight or sleep , and withdrawal from some social activities , followed by a return to physical homeostasis and a fuller social life in one or more stages . Included in this concept are the traditional rituals of mourning , whether established by religious injunction or social custom ; but I also include those mourners who describe their own behaviour in such a phased fashion , even when they were not aware of following any ritual . // In most psychological thinking and writing , and for most of the societies for which we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is frequently regulated by the solar or lunar calendar . Among the mourners I interviewed it is , if one interprets what they say with generosity , still the most general pattern ; twentyfive mourners , out of the eighty interviewed , can be considered to have followed such a sequence . Only with the Orthodox Jews and , to a modified extent , with the mourners in Scotland , was there an actual calendrical pattern ; with the remainder the changes from one type of behaviour to another were determined by their autonomous feelings . Time-limited mourning tends to be connected with the active practice of prayer and church-going . This is not inevitable ; five of these mourners were agnostics . There is also a slighter correlation with the rite of burial and the erection and tending of a headstone ; twelve of these mourners made regular visits to the cemetery . Men and women in equal numbers , and coming from all social classes , mourn in this fashion , and all relatives may be so mourned ; in this group 8 were mourning their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 their wives , 4 a brother or sister and 2 a child . As can be seen , it is the parents who are most frequently mourned in this fashion ; and it may well be that the death of a parent , of a person a generation above one 's own , can be accepted with more resignation and mourned with more spontaneity than the death of a loved person of one 's own generation or of the generation below . Much the most complete pattern of time-limited mourning still observed in England is that followed by the Orthodox Jews ; since it is so sharply contrasted with // most contemporary practice it seems worth while out-lining rather summarily the enjoined behaviour .2 Unless death occurs after sunset on Friday , in which case the burial is postponed until the Sunday , an Ortho-dox Jew should be buried within twenty-four hours of death , and , the more honoured the person , the quicker will be the burial . While the body is in the house it should not be left unattended ; ideally , the sons or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a candle at its head and feet ; if no relatives are available , professional watchers are called in . The rabbi is sent for as soon as death occurs ; and he returns to the house of mourning about an hour before the funeral is due to start . All the closest relatives of the dead person should be gathered there , wearing some old garment ? such as a jersey ? from which a piece is ritually cut by an official of the burial group ; this rent garment should be worn continuously during the seven days of sit-ting shiveh ( shiveh is the Hebrew for seven ) of intensive mourning . The rabbi says special prayers at the house , mentioning the deceased by name and hoping that he/ she has found his/her heavenly world and is happy ' . The same prayers are used during the shiveh period . After these prayers the coffin is carried out , and all the mourners should follow on foot . If the cemetery is be-yond ordinary walking distance , the mourners should walk quite a way ? say half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken into a special room , serving the same // function as a funeral chapel , at the cemetery ; the mourn-ers wait outside until it is placed in the centre of the room ; then ( in those groups where both sexes attend the funeral ) the men stand on the left and the women on the right . Prayers and psalms are recited , and a panegyric of the dead person 's virtues is declaimed by the rabbi and also frequently by a lay friend . The coffin is then carried to the grave , followed by the mourners . All the sons and brothers of the dead person shovel some earth on to the coffin . All the relatives of the dead person then line up by the grave ; and all the visitors walk down the line of mourners , shake them by the hand , and say in English , ' I wish you long life ' . This phrase is only used in this context ; it is also written in letters of condolence by people who have not been pres-ent at the funeral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kaddish , is recited for the first time by the sons and brothers of the dead person . The funeral party then returns to the house where the death has occurred ( or occasionally to the house of a near relative ) . The closest relatives of the dead person sit on special low mourning stools ( these can be bor-rowed from the synagogue ) wearing their rent garment and special slippers without any leather in them . For the whole seven-day period the mourners should sit , thus dressed , on the low stools , unwashed and unshaven and the women without make-up , from sunrise to sunset . They should move as little as possible and do no work at all . On the return from the cemetery a meal is provided of eggs , salt-herrings and circular rolls , beigel.3 The // mourners should not feed themselves ; it is a good deed to feed the mourners . After this ceremonial meal the visitors go home . During the seven days of intensive mourning , prayers for the dead are said every morning by the men , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other time during the day when ten males over the age of 13 are gathered in the room to compose a minyan . The mourners are meant to do nothing and in theory only to eat the food that the visitors bring them ; but today in England it appears that this food is sometimes symbolized by sweets or cigarettes . ( I do n't smoke and I do n't eat sweets ' , the business-man from the North-East ( 63 ) added parenthetically when describing the gifts he was brought when mourning his first wife . ) The visitors greet the mourners who either do not reply at all , or only very briefly . They then start talking to each mourner about the person they have lost . It is amazing , ' said the wife of a business-man from the South-East , remembering the mourning for her mother , It is amazing how these visits comfort you . They talk to you and start discussing the person you have lost ; picture albums are brought out and everyone reminds you of little episodes in their lives . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lightened ; it is a most healing and comforting week . Brothers and sisters who have drifted apart come together again and recall good memories . It is a comfort . ' The man from the North-East ( 63 ) spoke in much the same way : Well , you do these things , you do n't worry about them . . . . It 's actually a good thing ; the week of grief 8o DEATH , GRIEF , AND MOURNING gives you time to get over all the worry and what not . ... Even though it seems outlandish at the time ? it really is a help ? you 're away for a week and get over all your grief . You get it all concentrated in one week . ... I always thought before his first wife died it was a waste of time ; but you realize when you go through it that it is n't really ; it 's there for a purpose . ' The ritual enjoined for women ends with this sevenday period ; men should not cut their hair or shave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other mourners should go twice daily to the synagogue to say Kaddish . At the end of these eleven months the gravestone is erected and the period of mourning is over ; but four times a year prayers for the dead are said at the synagogue , which should be repeated meticulously , since the souls of the dead are said to be nearest the earth ' , and at every anniversary of the death ( counting by the Jewish calendar ) the grave should be visited and prayers recited in which the names of all surviving relatives and descendants are mentioned and memorial lights should be lit in the home . All the informants agree that they found this very concentrated and overt mourning therapeutic ; the fact that they could hide neither their grief nor their mourning made it easier for them . As far as my knowledge goes , there is no Christian practice which regulates the behaviour of the mourners to anything like the same extent . The nearest analogue would seem to be the ritual of the Church of Scotland , and of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the Church of England ' ) which have adapted their ritual to that observed by the majority in Scotland . // With this ritual it is customary for the body of the dead person to be brought to his or her home , if death has occurred in hospital or abroad , and for at least an intermittent vigil to be kept in the days preceding the funeral . On the day of the funeral the near relatives gather at the house and the minister or vicar conducts a short service for the family in the house ; the funeral procession then proceeds to the church at which a second service is held , attended not only by the family but by those neighbours , friends and associates who wish to pay their last respects . After the burial those who have attended the funeral are entertained , typically at the house , with tea and sandwiches or the like ; but if the family is relatively prosperous and if mourners have gathered from a distance , it is customary to give a slap-up high tea with drinks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not prescribe the proper behaviour for mourners in either the detail or the duration that Orthodox Jewry does , the first days of bereavement are fairly fully occupied . Many of the Scottish mourners wear black or dark clothes for some weeks , and abstain from unnecessary social activities . Neighbours proffer help . It is not easy to illustrate the way in which this customary behaviour makes mourning easier to work through . It was indicated by short phrases of appreciation of the help from the minister and the neighbours : Very good , everybody was ' ( 5o ) : I got help from the clergy ? he was very nice . . . och , it 's not so bad now , it was at first . I 'm getting used to it now . ' ( 19 ) One neighbour says I can just drop in any time ; she makes me a cup of tea ; we have a chat and then I carry on . . . . The girl her 11-year-old daughter was doing // a paper round and I got up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . It started me off going out and about again ' ( II ) . For a few days I wore mourning , which seems to have gone out of fashion a bit . . . . I felt the strain and I was in tears some of the time . I used often to cry in private , quite , quite copiously . My father did too , just before the funeral ; he just dissolved . Once you have cried you do feel better . ' This last quotation is from a schoolmaster who had lost his mother ( 7 ) . The ability to weep freely , and admit one has done so , seems to be a reliable sign that mourning is being worked through and overcome . Oh , I did cry ; I could n't stop . ... When you cry you get it off your chest , ' said the 32-year-old caretaker of a block of flats in the North-East ( 52 ) , talking about the death of his widowed father to whom he had been devoted . Before his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round or I 'd be at the club with him ' , and he still misses him sorely . For six or seven weeks he wore mourning and gave up all social activities ; he was grateful to the people who came up to him and said how they were sorry ' . With no apparent guidance from religious ritual ( he was nominally Church of England ) or local custom he had evolved a satisfactory timelimited ritual of mourning . The general consensus of people who have evolved their own time-limited mourning without the guidance of ritual is that the period of intense grief is somewhere between six and twelve weeks : The grief never quite goes , I should think that after about three months I got over the worst of it . I knew I was on my own and I 'd got to make the best of it . ' // These are the fairly typical words of a 55-year-old widower in local government in the South-East ( 42 ) whose dearly loved wife had died of tuberculosis five years earlier . He wore a black armband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His wife was cremated : I mean , I think once the body is cremated or buried , I think that 's the finish as far as the body goes . I mean , I think you can preserve their memory more at home than where they 're actually buried . I 'll tell you one thing I always do ? perhaps it 's silly , but I always buy her a little present at Christmas of some azaleas or flowers of some description ; I feel that she 's still in the house , you see . ' A similar ritual was observed by a solitary woman from the Midlands ( 44 ) who had lost her husband nine years ago , and her spastic son , to whom her life was devoted , quite recently . I 'm not a coward , but I 'm not one to keep going to the cemetery ? I believe in helping the living . On birthdays , I put a bunch of flowers by their photograph . I can see that , you see . . . . After it happened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live , I did n't take an interest in people ; but my husband left me a legacy of friendship . . . . I like people ; I 've just come from a club now ; you must get amongst people . You lose friends if you 've got a long face . For three years , I could n't bear the thought of going where we used to live , but now I can face it . Time heals. ' vii Unlimited Mourning : Never Get Over ' The comforting belief that time heals is rejected in so many words by a sizeable group of mourners ( i5 out of // 8o ) ; the phrase used is never get over it ' , and it is em-ployed both to describe one 's own feelings and those of others.4 All the informants who used this phrase were working class ( two owned one-man shops ) ; all but two were over 50 ( and these two were referring to their sur-viving parent ) ; and I felt that the statement was fre-quently made with some complacency . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerely loved and mourned , but rather that , within this predominantly un-skilled or semi-skilled working-class group , the statement that one will never get over it is a demonstration of how dutiful and loving the mourner is . The same phrase is used continuously . I 've never got over it . . . . You never forget , ' said the Scottish widow of a factory-worker who 'd died of a heart attack ( 64 ) . She 's never got over it ? definitely not . Christmas , birthdays , you know . . . ' ; a young storeman from the Midlands ( 40 ) , talking about his mother , widowed four years ago . I think it 's a thing you never get over , ' said the 53-year-old Scottish widow of a baker ( 29 ) ; she added , when I said goodbye , I 've got a braw house with four bedrooms upstairs ; but the main thing is missing . " I just sit around and mope really ; . . . some people may have more guts than me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South-East ( 47 ) who runs a small shop . It 's a blow yet ... there are things you never get over ' : an elderly woman from the North-West , talking about the death of her younger son ( 49 ) . It was our eldest sister , and naturally you do n't get used to it for a long time ... . It 's a thing we 'll never forget because it 's one of our own , ' a van-driver from the South-West ( 43 ) said about his // unmarried sister , who , from other remarks made , seems to have been rather a burden while she was alive . Oh , they 'll never get over it ' , said the wife of a retired bricklayer from the South-East ( 3- ) about her dead sister 's family : No , I do n't think they 'll ever get over it ; because each time I meet them they talk to me and that when they come up ; they always bring her name up and they say , " Aunt Mary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's husband will never get over it . Still works , but he 's awful bad hisself now . Never had a day 's illness . Do n't go out , he sits and watches television . . . . It was a very bad loss to me , I felt it very bad when she went . . . Although these people 's grief was genuine I did not feel , when talking to them , that they were in despair , as are the mourners to be described subsequently . Psychologically they had , most of them at any rate , got over their intense grief ; by saying they would never get over it , they were proclaiming their continued affection for the person who had died . viii Unlimited Mourning : Mummification I am using the term mummification ' in a metaphorical fashion . The ancient Egyptians preserved their dead from the natural processes of decay by embalming the body ; the type of mourner whom I wish to describe preserves the grief for the lost husband or wife by keeping the house and every object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though it were a shrine which would at any moment be reanimated . The most notorious exemplar of mummification in // recent English history is Queen Victoria , who not only preserved every object as Prince Albert had arranged them , but continued the daily ritual of having his clothes laid out and his shaving water brought . None of my informants went to quite that length ; but two of them ( 4 , 42 ) bought flowers at Christmas and on her birthday for their wives , dead four and five years respectively . Four widowers and two widows treated their houses in this fashion . Everything is just as he or she left it . The visual impression is striking ; the woman living in a house alone , with a man 's belongings all over the room : The house is just as it was , even this ; he always kept it there and the dog used to get it to go out for a walk at night ; his pipe is still over there , his glasses and his hearing aid , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clothes out , but I could n't ? not yet anyway . ' ( 36 ) This woman was a very recent widow ; another widow in the North-East ( 34 ) had kept everything in the same place for two years . A widower in the Midlands , a retired stoker , ( 4 ) whose wife had died four years previously , had her clothes all over his sitting-room ; her grave was just round the corner and he visited it every Tuesday , Thursday and Sunday . A 61-year-old manufacturer in the NorthWest ( 65 ) had kept his large house with everything just as it was ' for four years ; he seemed to be trying to kill himself with overwork : I was working till half-past two this morning , and three o'clock yesterday . ' A 58-year-old cement worker from the South-East ( 41 ) who was widowed fifteen months previously , worked on night-shift and spent his days keeping his house in spotless condition ; the front parlour could easily have been in an ideal home ' exhibition : // She had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at all . Everything is in the same place where she left it . . . . Of course it 's a woman 's job , but I 'm not afraid to try . It 's a full day 's work al-together to do everything ; I may wash one or two things myself , a few hankies , you can do small things yourself . . . . Things run just the same as she was here ; the neighbours and that , they come along and every-thing seems , well as a matter of fact , normal . It 's just that it 's my feeling that everything seems empty . When you walk in the room and there 's nobody there , that 's the worst part of it . . . . I know when the wife died it used to take me about a day to dust round , where a woman goes around in about half an hour and makes nothing of it . . . . We his unmarried son share the chores between us . I sweep and dust and that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anyone to come in , you see . I just carry on . ' The discovery of these domestic shrines , of the material preservation of every trace of the dead spouse , was the most unforeseen aspect of the interviews I conducted ; but when I mentioned this to some of my other infor-mants , they frequently produced other examples from their knowledge . Thus , the courageous widow of a civil servant in the South-West ( 31 ) said : A woman two or three doors down , that 's exactly what she 's done . Just as if her husband 's still there , and it 's a year ago this week . She goes about like death warmed up . We 've tried to get her out and to go about , she just wo n't go . ' // ix Unlimited Mourning : Despair Since I did not interview this lady , I can not tell whether I should have classified her type of mourning as mummification or as despair . It sounds more like despair ? a term I have chosen in preference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three terms are probably synonyms , but I consider that depression or melancholia should be reserved for psychiatric diagnoses . Despair is almost palpable to the lay interviewer : the toneless voice , the flaccid face muscles , the halting speech in short sentences . Three out of the nine mourners whom I consider to be in despair were sitting alone in the dark . Three of these mourners were widows , two were widowers , two were men in middle age who had lost their mothers , and one widower and one married woman had lost a son in young adulthood . One widow hanged herself between being interviewed in May and my attempting to see her in the North-East in November . Only two out of these nine people had engaged in any formal mourning ; these were a pious Roman Catholic ( 66 ) , an old-age pensioner mourning his boy killed in a motoring accident , who found some meaning and pattern in his life from the practice of his religion ; and an observant member of the Church of Scotland ( 24 ) , a 6o-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his mother until she died fifteen months ago ; he takes flowers to her grave twice a week . These two were the only mourners in despair who had had the person they mourned buried ( the old-age pensioner was on National Assistance and regretted he could not erect a headstone ) ; the other seven had arranged cremations , // and , save for two inscriptions in the memorial book and one seat in a distant crematorium , had not given any formal or ritual elaboration to the disposal of the body . It is difficult to illustrate despair from the interviews , for one of the signs of despair is the grudging speech , the monosyllables or incomplete sentences , the long silences . The 54-year-old widow of a process worker in the South-East ( 46 ) spoke about 200 words in twenty minutes ; the first thing she said when she opened the door was , I miss him . I 'll never get over it ' ; the last thing , twenty minutes later , I do n't think time ever heals . ' She can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daughter , a young woman , is out of the house , she has to go out somewhere , to see her sister or to the shops . Apart from this protection , there 's nothing I really want from anybody . I miss his company terrible . ' She was full of nervous twitches . A 66-year-old widower , a tracer , from the North-East ( 58 ) , who looked undernourished , said he did n't bother to do any cooking ? ' anything will do for me . ' His neighbours and relatives try to help him : They asked if there was anything they could do , you see , so I told them that ... I managed all right .. . there 's people tell me there 's people a lot worse off than me , but that does n't make my case better . I know it 's unfortunate , but I suppose we have to face this sort of thing . ' A manufacturer in the North-West ( 65 ) , whose wife had died four years earlier , was trying to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the early days of his bereavement . It brings it all back , you see . ... It 's all right working , but when they go , you 're down // at the bottom again . ' I interviewed this man two days after President Kennedy 's assassination , and he remarked as I was saying goodbye : I 'm thinking about the Kennedy family and the kiddies . I do n't know . You do n't think of these things till you 've had a packet yourself . ' This was the longest consecutive sentence he uttered , and the only time his thought was diverted for a moment from his own misery . None of these people in despair were very recently bereaved ; at least twelve months had passed since the death of the person they mourned so insistently ; their unhappiness was of a quite different nature to the intense grief which so many of the time-limited mourners reported in the first three months of bereavement . They were nearly all solitary , as it seemed by choice for ( with the exception of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived alone had children or other kinfolk who were willing to share a house with them . As the wife of a sales-manager in the Midlands ( 6 ) said about her widowed mother : She wo n't live with any of us , because it 's not fair to intrude on the younger folk . . . . She never bothers to get herself any meals unless you go . When we go she lays the table and gives us a damn good meal ; but she never has a dinner if she 's by herself . . . . The neighbours have asked her to join the Darby and Joan club ; but she wo n't join any , she wo n't mix . She says , " I 'm all right with my memories ... : ' The number of people in despair ? 9 out of 8o ? was a surprise to me . I am inclined to see a connection between // this inability to get over grief and the absence of any ritual either individual or social , lay or religious , to guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER SIX TYPES OF BEREAVEMENT i Introduction Every death entails some changes in the social position and the status of the surviving kinsmen ; some of these changes are slight , such as , in the majority of cases , those resulting from the death of a brother or sister ; some are so profound that most languages have special words for the orphan , the child who has lost one or both parents , or the widow , the wife who has lost her husband , to indicate their special status . Since there seem to be some regularities , in Britain , concerning this change of status , the information given me by my informants is analysed in this chapter according to the relationship of the dead person to the survivor . ii Death of Father For fifteen of the people I interviewed ? eight men and seven women ? the loss of their father was the most recent bereavement they had suffered . In four of the cases the mother and father had died within a few weeks of one another ; in two cases the father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years previously ; in the remaining nine cases the mother survived her husband . On the basis of these interviews , I should consider that the survival of the mother is crucial in determining the status of the child after the father 's death . When both parents died within a few weeks of one another , the change of status seems to be slight ; the pattern of holidays , especially Christmas , is liable to change , with fewer or no gatherings of brothers and sisters and their children ; but the survivors do not seem to consider their position altered , nor was their grief intense . The death of the parents seemed to be natural ' , in the proper order of things ; none of my informants inherited any considerable property or a title . The two men who lost their widowed father were much more distressed ; in both cases father and adult son had been good friends , spending much of their masculine leisure together . Oh , I do miss him ! Of a night-time he 'd come round or I 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said the caretaker of a block of flats in the North-East ( 52 ) . He had a headstone erected for his father , and visits it regularly with his children . He seems to have acted as the centre of his family ever since he married , his father and his married brother coming to him for Christmas ; he mourned for six or seven weeks ; but his status had not changed significantly . The miner from the Midlands ( 67 ) felt that the death of his widowed father had removed the bond which held the family together . We always used to go down Christmas Day to see him , and there 'd be one or two of the brothers and sisters there .... Nothing like that now . ' All the family were miners : Dad worked at the pit ? " This is my son " business . // ... When they told me about him on the Sunday I could have dropped through the flipping floor . . . . He just collapsed , he collapsed and died in the bathroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he would have wished to have gone , when his time come like . . . he did n't suffer . ' . When the mother survives her husband , her children always seem to feel an extra burden of responsibility , irrespective of age or sex ; the widowing of one 's mother imposes a sudden and heavy burden of responsibility on the unmarried ; the responsibility of the married shifts from their own generation and that of their children to the generation above , the generation from whom they had been used to receive protection and advice and whom they now have to succour . In most cases there is also a financial responsibility , for , as will be developed at greater length subsequently , it is very uncommon in Britain for a widow not to be considerably impoverished by her husband 's death . The only informant who expressed no feeling of responsibility for his father 's relic was the antique dealer from the South-West ( 15 ) ; in this case the widow was his stepmother , his real mother 's younger sister , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father , from whom he had inherited the business : I found that there was somebody I wanted to speak to about certain things , you know , particularly about the business , and it seemed a complete absence of anybody , you know . . . The wife of an assistant sales manager in the Midlands , ( 6 ) who was very attached to her dead father , spoke for nearly all her fellow-bereaved when she said : I was upset about my father , but more about my poor mother . ' This // woman has made a cult of her husband 's grave , and will not sleep in the house of any of her children , so as to be near my dad , he 's buried down the road . ' The children have established a sort of informal rota for visiting her be-cause : She never bothers to get herself any meals unless you go . When we go , she lays the table and gives us a damn good meal ; but she never has a dinner if she 's by herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midlands explained how she and her married brothers and sisters took it in turns to loan one of her mother 's seven grandchildren to live with her : This keeps her interested . She has one of the boys with her now because she is inclined to mope in private . ' In a rather similar way , a 47-year-old Scottish flax and canvas weaver ( 5o ) who was very attached to her father ? she was the only daughter ? ex-plained : Well , I work you see , and she helps to keep the house . She makes the dinner and the beds and that . That keeps her mind occupied , you see . I help her in the money . . . she 's not a poor widow but she 's not wealthy . . . . At times you did n't know just what you were going to do , but I had my work and my family and mother to help . . . she 's kept busy just now , she has her own home , you see . ' The compromise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a role in her married children 's lives but maintains her own home , seems to be the best available under the current British value system , which holds that it is distasteful , almost immoral , for three generations to occupy the same house , for a widowed parent // to live with her married children ( this will be further discussed subsequently ) ; in many other societies a resident grandmother is considered to be of the greatest help . The only example of this which I saw ( 1 ) was not a happy one . The middle-aged . widow of a man who had died of cancer had come to live permanently with her I9-yearold daughter who was married to a miner , because : I was three months a widow before I came down here ; it was lonely , horrible . I gave up my home .. . I 'm getting used to the idea now . . . . Your life 's gone , as if there 's nothing left in life at all . . . . I dread Christmas coming . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own life ? she had a baby daughter ? seemed absorbed in tending to so much misery . We used to go out for a drink , my husband and I , but we stopped that . ' The responsibility seems to bear even more heavily on the children if they were unmarried , particularly if they are only children . The 23-year-old manageress of a shop in the Midlands ( 48 ) had been engaged when her father died three years earlier , and I 'd been putting it off and putting it off ' because she felt unfortunately ' responsible for her mother . You 've got to take things on yourself . ' Now the story is coming to a happier conclusion . Her mother has taken a job and my mother 's friends were quite helpful ; they took her out of herself more or less . I could have done , but they were her own age group . ' Now the date of the wedding is fixed and her mother is trying to get a smaller house ; she 'd rather be independent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm getting married , because before she thought , if anything happened to her , what would I do ? ' Even more poignant is the case of a 17-year-old youth // in the Midlands ( 40 ) whose father had died of a heart attack just before the boy was 15 . He is an only son . He took half-days off from school to look after his mother and left school when he was 15 to take a well-paid but dead-end job as a storeman . I was going to sit for the G.C.E. ; but I felt it was too much . I left and got a good job ; I wanted a car ... . I 'd lost all interest . It 's only now that I realize that I 'd have had a bit of a future . . . . It 's a thing that happens . ' He had been a notable schoolboy athlete and had represented his county abroad , but he had abandoned all that to look after his mother : I 'm the only one . I look after her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a man and wife . We share each other 's problems , and all the rest . . . . I 'm going to get married in the near future . . . . She his mother does n't really associate with people though . If we go out , you see , with the girl-friend , we have a lot of freedom and that , but she 's welcome and we have a good time , but , well , it 's just one of those things . ' It was of course planned for the girl-friend to move in with the young man and his mother when they did get married . He would not contemplate his mother moving away : We 're happier as we are . ' In a rather similar way a 17-year-old apprentice fitter in Scotland ( 64 ) was the sole emotional and financial support of his widowed mother , though , as an apprentice , he has n't got much pay ; they just manage . The widow of a professional man who had died in Rhodesia ( 62 ) when her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a terrific strength .. Without him I would have gone under . I may have put too much on him , but he 's that sort of type .... ' iii Death of Mother Owing to women 's greater longevity and the fact that , particularly one or more generations ago , a husband tended to be older than his wife , the death of a mother comparatively rarely leaves a widower father as a responsibility to the surviving children . Apart from the four cases , referred to above , in which the death of both parents was nearly simultaneous , five of the people I interviewed had a father surviving his wife 's death , whereas in eight cases the mother had been a widow . In four out of the five cases , it was a son who took responsibility for his widowed father , to a greater or lesser degree . The manager of a caravan site in the South-East ( 59 ) had his father living with him and his wife ; he had given up the family home . Similarly , an unmarried 51-yearold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invalid father living with him and his unmarried brother . They were , he said , a very united family ; either the widowed father , one of the brothers , or his married sister visited his mother 's grave every day . A girl from Australia ( 6i ) whose mother had died from cancer at the age of 53 , reported that her father was managing very well . He has a lot of friends and he 's very adaptable . He cooks for himself and my younger brother lives there with him . ' Every effort was made by this family to act as if nothing had happened . The cement worker from the South-East ( 41 ) who was keeping his house as a shrine to his wife ( see pp. 86-87 ) was helped in this task by his unmarried son : We share the chores between us . . . you see we 're // doing a bit of decorating . ' This son seemed to have no life of his own , no friends of either sex as far as his father knew ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 ) felt that with his mother 's death the centre of the home ' had gone . There 's now no focal point where we can meet . ' His father had spent the last Christmas ( the first since his wife had died ) with him ; but otherwise he did n't feel him a responsibility . Actually , he 's taken up with a man in similar circumstances , whose wife died too , and they 're now firm friends . Previously these two gentlemen had not seen eye to eye , but now they 're firm friends . ' This pattern of friendship between two men or women widowed at about the same time is , as will be seen , a not uncommon solution for the loneliness of widowhood . The only instance that I heard of a child having to assume the responsibilities of a dead mother in a fashion analogous to those recounted above for a dead father was that of the niece of a retired bricklayer in the South-East ( 37 ) . This is a very traditional mother-centred workingclass family ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6i . My informant was the oldest sister , eleven years older than she who had died ; and for her own children , as well as for her nephews and nieces , she was still the principal person to consult and to visit . But her sister had left not only a husband , but also two unmarried sons , aged 29 and 23 ; and the eldest daughter kept house for them : She 's got to , you see ; because there 's two sons going to work and the father ? well you see she 's got to stop at home to see to them , else they would n't have no hot food nor nothing . ' // This girl had also taken her mother 's place as what might be termed the communication centre of the family ; she gathered all the news by telephone , letters and meetings and passed it on ; and she entertained all the large extended family at Christmas and similar festivities . Her aunt commended her as a nice girl , a nice living girl , nice respectable girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all take after their mother ? very clean , plenty of good food , nice girls , have a nice table . ' The aunt realized that this girl was sacrificing herself to look after her father and brothers and thought that she would never get married . She had a young man , but he went abroad , salesman he was . She used to say to me , " I do n't think I want him , Aunt Mary " ; and I said , " Well you have your choice ; you do n't want him , you do n't have him " ; that 's what I used to tell her . ' In this typically mother-centred working-class family the father 's kin count for very little . They do n't have much to do with one another , ' my informant said . There ai n't many of them here now . . . there 's only about one sister , I think . ' In such families the death of a mother is not only a cause for grief , but modifies the status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death in the family would appear to do . The wife of a jobbing gardener in the South-East ( 5 ) felt that the centre of the family had disappeared with her mother 's death : Well , it 's surprising ; we girls just cling together and the boys ? we do n't see much of them . It 's surprising ? we used to see them when we had to go and see Mother ; but now
