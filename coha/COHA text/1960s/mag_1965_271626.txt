THE Caribbean is closer to U.S. shores than the South China Sea , but despite the nearby uproar in the Dominican Republic , the crucial test of American policy and will is still taking place in Viet Nam . <P> By and large , U.S. public opinion seems strongly behind Lyndon Johnson 's unyielding strategy of bombing the North and stepped-up ground action in the South . At the same time , an insistent-if by no means unanimous-chorus of criticism is heard , particularly on college campuses , from faculty as well as students . " Teach-ins , " petitions and picketing get headlines . Most of the critics argue that the U.S. should stop the bombing and get out quickly , giving an odd combination of pragmatic and supposedly ethical reasons . <P> The pragmatic reasons add up to the notion that the U.S. either can not win or need not win in order to safeguard its interests . The moral objections are often weakened by the fact that , while the critics condemn the use of force against North Viet Nam , they either condone or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Malaysia , Red China 's conquest of Tibet or , most important , the Viet Cong 's own terror against South Vietnamese peasants . <P> Questions of Reality <P> Herewith a discussion of the six principal arguments . <P> ? The struggle in Viet Nam is a " civil war " and the U.S. has no right to interfere . Certainly , there are elements of a civil war present . Many Viet Cong are not hard-line Communists but nationalistic and social revolutionaries whose aims include land reform and reunification . But as elsewhere , the local revolution has been captured by Communism . The Viet Cong have some autonomy , but they are trained , directed and supplied by North Viet Nam . In the Communist rebellions in Greece and Malaya , for example , almost identical arguments were heard ; these were called civil wars in which the U.S. was supposedly backing reactionary regimes that lacked popular support and could not win . And yet in both cases , when outside Red help was shut off , the rebellions collapsed . Because the West has lately learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back their export of revolution , it is sometimes forgotten that Communism still remains an international aggressive movement , that " infiltration " and " subversion " remain realities , not words to frighten children . No struggle in which Communism is involved is ever truly a civil war . <P> ? The South Vietnamese people do n't care whether they live under Communism or not , as long as they get peace . Obviously they desperately want peace , and they need more positive hopes than just anti-Communism to keep them going . But after a decade , South Viet Nam 's army is still fighting , and sustaining casualties proportionately higher than U.S. casualties in two world wars . This is an amazing fact , recently heightened by the decline in government desertions , and in the increase in new recruitment .
