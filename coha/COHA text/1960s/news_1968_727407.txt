txt Around the world 164 times in 11 days . Traveling 4,500,000 miles through the black silence of space at 17,500 miles per hour . Seeing 16 sunsets and 16 sunrises every day  --  or one or the other every 45 minutes . That is the trip awaiting the three Apollo 7 astronauts ? Walter M. Schirra , Donn Eisele , Walter Cunningham ? as the countdown goes on for the 11 a.m. liftoff Friday , Oct. 11 on Pad 34 at Cape Kennedy , Fla . And they are ready , fit , and anxious to start this last lap of the manned moon program that could climax sometime in the fall of 1969 with two of a three-man crew actually stepping down onto the moon 's surface . Confidence high What is equally important is that these three are confident they have a safe spacecraft , a reliable rocket , and a dedicated trained ground crew supporting them . Actually the crew has an absolute veto , right up until blastoff as to whether it is " go " or " no go . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise that right without question . But he does n't expect he will have to . Astronaut Schirra put his views about the flight on the record recently in his usual frank and earthy way to a group of space experts : " Space flight is risky at best . There are // Ready for a ' go 9 Left to right , Astronauts Donn F. Eisele , Walter M. Schirra Jr. , and Walter Cunningham are fit and ready for 164 trips around the world in 11 days aboard their Apollo 7 spacecraft . Each member of the crew has a veto over the flight right up to blastoff , scheduled for Oct. 11 , should there be any question as to the vehicle 's reliability . *Impressive flight plan for Apollo 7 // many areas we have concern about . We have been hurt in one obviously , the environment the pure oxygen on pad , now a 60-40 mix of oxygen and hydrogen instead of the highly flammable pure oxygen . We fixed that . We have a new hatch that works properly . " We 've taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I would say when we go over the sill for launch day we will consider that all those risks that are appropriate for this type of mission are either understood by us or they are low enough that we have a very very high probability . " But it would not be sensible , if we had problems developing where the risk went up , to stay up there for 10.8 days . We would have to come down early . . . . For a total posture you ca n't ever say everything is 100 percent . " As for our booster , the Saturn 1B , the reason we are on it , rather than the Saturn 5 or 1C , is that it is a very stable , almost Brooklyn Bridge structure . It is almost over-designed in the sense of safety and strength . We have eight engines on the bottom of it . One of those engines could fail and we would have no problem achieving orbit . In fact two can fail as time goes on and we can still get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Housekeeping ' a challenge On this same discussion of the coming Apollo 7 flight Astronaut Eisele commented on some of the housekeeping problems involved in three men spending 11 days together in a combination bedroom , workshop , dining room , kitchen , lavatory , sun porch , radio station , gym , office , and laboratory no bigger than a medium-priced auto . " We have worked out a work-rest cycle so that each day is divided into three 8-hour periods . One will coincide with the passes we make over the United States when all three of us are awake . A second 8-hour period will be when Walt and Wally will be sleeping . I will be minding the store . The third period will be when I am sleeping and Walt and Wally are awake . This work-rest arrangement is somewhat of an experiment . " On Gemini the two pilots were so close to each other and the cabin noise level so low they found if they did n't sleep simultaneously they disturbed each other . We think on this vehicle , because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not objectionable , it will drown out minor noise . " Also , our sleep stations are now located beneath the crew couches , so that when you are down there sleeping , or trying to sleep , you will at least be removed from the most active area of the spacecraft . If we find out we ca n't sleep while one fellow is awake we will have to go back to the old Gemini style , I guess . " Regarding food , " continued astronaut Eisele , " it will be the same sort of food we had on board Gemini . The rehydratables , plus the bite size . One thing is different , though . We 'll have heated water reconstituting the food , and this is much more palatable than the cold water we had in the past . On the Gemini the water was about 60 to 65 degrees F. ? like a cold glass of water . On Apollo we can heat the water to a temperature of between 140 and 150 degrees F. , which makes food much more palatable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some " live " TV from the spacecraft , since a TV camera will be aboard the Apollo 7 . It hopes to put on a short show once a day of what life aboard an Apollo is like . But NASA may have promised more than it can deliver . In the ' first place the pictures may not come in too clearly . In the U.S. average distance from transmitting station to house receiver is only 5 miles . With Apollo 7 it can be as much as 1,000 miles from spacecraft to ground . Then there is the power problem . Ordinary TV broadcast stations transmit an average of 50,000 watts of power . Apollo 7 power will be only 20 watts . Still NASA hopes for what it terms " reasonable clarity . " But a more serious threat to live TV from Apollo 7 is the attitude of the crew . They are not sure they want Mr. and Mrs. America ? not to speak of Mr. and Mrs. Europe , Asia , and Africa ? peering into their combined bedroom , dining room , kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a " by-your-leave . " Astronaut Schirra , for instance , has said emphatically he is not going to be on exhibition clad in his space underwear , which is the suit the crew will wear for at least 90 percent of the trip . It is a nice coverall , but it is still underwear , and privately he has admitted that he does n't quite trust his crew mates not to take some candid shots on the sly . It is n't that he does n't like his team mates . " We 've enjoyed working together , " he said recently . " I 'm something of a punster , and Donn , rather than fight , has joined me . " Incidentally he is a very horrible punster . Walt has had a time trying to keep us level headed on our punning . But I detect he is starting to pun . " So Astronaut Schirra would n't be surprised if there were frequent puns on the air-toground communications . But he does n't want to take a chance that either of his mates gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
