For those who 've noticed some recent subtle differences between the new Time and the old , this is the story of what it might mean to America and who is responsible . Americans have traditionally stressed optimism , a faith in the future , what John Kirk calls " progress , pragmatism , respect for achievement , a belief that rising wealth and expanding technology would ultimately dissipate most individual and social problems . " Yet Americans have seldom examined those values long enough to see the possible inner contradictions . In part , they were too busy carving for themselves a share of the country 's peerless abundance . Men with fabulous opportunities for self-advancement had no time for self-inspection . From the start , the American Dream has contained as much egotism as it has generosity. ? Time Not a bad evaluation of Henry Luce ; a little too restrained , perhaps , for some of his still smoldering targets , but not bad . And there it was in the January 24 , 1969 issue of his brainchild , for forty-six years the weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , twenty-two million readers . True , Henry Luce had been dead almost two years when the passage appeared . Still , like General Motors or the Mormon Tabernacle Choir , Time would always be Time . And yet consider another appraisal that appeared in the same issue : The greatest potential for growth and planning , as well as controlling the quality of what citizens desire , today lies with the great corporations . . .. But they do not yet seem prepared for the idea that the business of business could be this : to sell goods and services whose influence on American taste and values might ? instead of being mediocre and sometimes baneful ? be actively inspiriting and benign . Again , it is too polite , with possibly an unwarranted faith in the potential of corporate liberalism . Nonetheless , hardly the business ethic of The Founder . Clearly , someone was tinkering with Time . In fact , both the above-quoted observations appeared in a document that , when examined carefully ? and strictly in the context of Time 's pinched past ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week of President Nixon 's inauguration , it took the form of a twenty-page supplement entitled , To Heal a Nation ? Special Section : The Task before the President . " Nixon no doubt had other things on his mind that week . But , considering the supplement 's departure from Lucean dogma , it may have been less important as a message to the incoming Administration than as a conspicuous ? if cautious ? declaration of independence by Hedley Donovan , Lure 's handpicked successor as editorial overseer of Time Inc. , and Henry A. Grunwald , the editor Donovan tapped fourteen months ago to give Time a new image . Somewhat tardily , Time had clambered aboard American journalism 's late-rolling bandwagon of social awareness . The cataclysmic events of the 1960s already had rescued most of Time 's peers from everlasting mediocrity . Early in the decade , it slowly ? very slowly ? began to dawn on the journalistic Establishment that the United States bore less and less resemblance to the nation they had so confidently " mirrored " for so many years . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A serious racial crisis teas building . A scandalous amount of poverty and hunger did exist in the land . The war in Vietnam would not go away . The scramble was on . Following its purchase by the Graham family in 1961 , Newsweek made the Negro 's struggle its principal mission , perceptively covering the story with a persistence unmatched by any large-circulation magazine . The New York Times , winged repeatedly by darts from Manhattan 's literary-intellectual salons , finally recognized that quality might be as important as quantity and modified its stultifying middlebrow view of the world , The Wall Street Journal offered some of the most incisive reporting in the nation ? often to the acute embarrassment of the businessmen it serves . Otis Chandler remade the once hopelessly corrupt Los Angeles Times into an alert , respectable newspaper . Spotting a trend , the wire services and the network news departments tried on occasion to view the world as something more than a hot flash . " In depth " became the catch phrase of the profession . Of course , no major publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be counted on the side of radical reform ; but at least the more influential ones had opened their pages and airwaves to intelligent examination of all the issues . Even Robert Sherrill , co-founder of Hard Times , conceded not long ago that no real need existed for the radical weekly . U ntil last year , Time remained aloof from the scramblers . Even after Luce formally retired in 1964 , the magazine continued to view the world with his patent formula of glib simplicity and Olympian arrogance . Donovan , a tall , tight-lipped former Rhodes Scholar , recognized the hardened arteries . All he had to do was look around , especially across town at Newsweek , where editorial hustle and imagination were making it the most talked-about magazine in the industry . Or , if he needed further convincing , he could take the elevator down to the twenty-fifth floor of the Time &; Life Building and talk to a Time editor or writer . The odds were better than even that he would find a bitter , frustrated employee . The target of the bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow-gauge track was the magazine 's autocratic managing editor , Otto Fuerbringer . Technically , Donovan outranked him on the corporate charts . More than once , however , Luce had advised a grousing staffer know you do n't like Otto , but I think he 's a goddamned good editor . " And Harry Luce , though retired , still ran the company . The managing editor of Time may be the single most influential linear journalist in the world . Early each week , like a virtuoso at some prose-producing Mighty Wurlitzer , he sits down , shoots his cuffs , and pulls and pushes stops on 105 correspondents from Washington to Nairobi , ninety editors , writers , and reporters in New York , and coveys of fact-hunting , miniskirted researchers , all of whom seem to be recruited from Alexander Portnoy 's fantasies . With superpolymathic vision , he distills the labor of these far-flung forces down to 50,000 words on everything from Biafra to Beethoven and by the middle of the following week his judgments are writ for the magazine 's twenty-two million readers ? thirty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently . The ripples from this weekly plunge can sometimes roll out like breakers . Last January , the magazine ran a story about a chef who specialized in making omelets for private dinner parties . A footnote reported that the particular pan he used was made by the Bridge Company , a small firm in Manhattan . Within two weeks , 7,000 orders for the pan had swamped the enterprise , and its harried owner , Fred Bridge , was busily planning branches in Chicago and San Francisco . Richard Pollak cams to free-lance writing after suseral strenuous newspaper and magazine assignments : among them , assistant editor of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin ; associate editor of Newsweek ; reporter for the Sunpapers in Baltimore ; editor of the Army 's Ft .

Statesmen treat the magazine with such deference that Time Inc. can make the leaders of eight Asian nations jump simply for the amusement of its advertisers ( see page 47 ) . Fuerbringer loved the power . A Midwestern conservative stoked by a strong sense of Lutheran morality , he felt duty bound to leave his personal stamp on the magazine each week before repairing to his home in Greenwich , Connecticut . If he disapproved of someone or something , the subject seldom sullied the pages of Time . A review of The Autobiography of Malcolm X ? A cover story on Ralph Nader ? Another time . The reasons were usually obvious , but Fuerbringer seldom thought it necessary to explain To the staff , he was " The Iron Chancellor . " When a story was too big to ignore , Fuerbringer indulged his prejudices in other ways . A dedicated Kennedyphobe , he outraged most of his colleagues by running Lyndon Johnson on Time 's cover the week after JFK 's assassination . And for those few who might have missed the point , he devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an exercise in necroflackery . The slain President , explained the letter , " had a special feeling about Time . " In fact , he always had it on hand and regarded it " as the most important magazine in America . " Lee Harvey Oswald , it turned out , had gunned down not the President of the United States , but Time 's " No. 1 subscriber . " For Fuerbringer , the war in Vietnam was a holy crusade . Week after week , the magazine read like a glossy handout from the public relations firm of Johnson , Rusk &; Westmoreland . Let there be no mistake about it , North Vietnam was " engaged in a war of aggression it will not be allowed to win . " Fuerbringer missed few opportunities to advance the cause . When the New York Times ran a hawkish letter from Frederick E. Nolting , Jr. , the former U. S. Ambassador to South Vietnam , Time conveniently found room for it in the magazine 's Press section . Senator J. William Fulbright 's suggestion that Saigon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder that Little Rock and Hot Springs offered " an abundance of whores . " More often than not , Time 's correspondents in Vietnam might just as well have been filing from Tierra del Fuego , Repeatedly , Fuerbringer ignored their dispatches when they failed to support the company line . In a now classic confrontation , Fuerbringer spiked a pessimistic file by Time 's able Saigon bureau chief , Charles Mohr , and instructed a writer in New York to roll the usual ruffles and flourishes . Then , to make sure the message got across , Fuerbringer also ordered up a Press piece accusing reporters in Saigon ( including , presumably , his own of poor-mouthing the war and of covering it by lounging around the Caravelle Hotel interviewing each other . Infuriated , Mohr and a colleague , Mert Perry , resigned . Fuerbringer unquestionably believed in his mission , but he also edited Time secure in the knowledge that the war fit neatly into the Founder 's grand design . Years ago , on the eve of World War II , Luce had decided this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral fervor , he decreed that " it is for America and for America alone to determine whether a system of free economic enterprise ? an economic order compatible with freedom and progress ? shall not prevail in this century . " He saw it as the country 's " manifest duty " to feed all the hungry and destitute people of the world ? " all of them , that is , whom we can from time to time reach consistently with a very tough attitude toward all hostile governments . " Many who knew Luce insist that he modified this view over the years . Perhaps so . But little evidence of it appeared in the magazine of which he once said , not without some accuracy , " Whatever Time prints will be believed because it is in Time . " The magazine 's war coverage and in no small way the very conflict itself ? was the obvious , grindingly dissonant crescendo of the Lucean score . ( It is , of course , unfair to blame it all on Time ; until recently , most other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embraced the clich ? s of the Cold War . ) W hen Henry Luce died in early 1967 , politi- cians , businessmen , and fellow journalists buried him under an obsequious blanket of obituary rhetoric : he was a great editor , a genius , a man ( in Time 's own sendoff ) of " infinite idealism . " As usual on such occasions , almost no one told it like it was : that Henry Luce was a hugely successful entrepreneur who created the world 's largest publishing empire and used its enormous power with little humility , frequent cruelty , and an aggressive lack of wisdom . After waiting a respectful few months , critic Joseph Epstein called the shot squarely in Commentary . " Through the agency of his magazines , " he wrote , " Luce confused more issues than he clarified , harmed more people than he helped , and contributed more to the Gross National Product than to American Culture . " With Lute 's death , editorial control of all Time Inc. magazines passed entirely into the hands of Hedley Donovan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still very much in order : solid Midwestern Re publican background , Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude at the University of Minnesota , Rhodes Scholar at Oxford , Navy intelligence , quick rise to managing editor of Fortune after joining the staff in 1945 , editorial director of Time Inc. by 1959 , Luce 's editorial heir-designate by 1964 , a home in Sands Point , Long Island , and membership in the University Club of New York , the Federal City Club of Washington , and the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club . Cool and unflappable , with the symmetrical good looks of a slightly overweight prep-school headmaster , Donovan makes the perfect model for the essay Time published on Wasps this year . " At his best , " it concluded , " the Wasp has stood for a certain selflessness , a sense of public service , a disinterestedness in the face of brawling passions .

" ( Luce 's capacity for taking himself and his works seriously was boundless ; among the " state papers " is his 1933 edict banishing the comma between " Time " and " Incorporated . " ) Amidst all the ringing affirmation in his talk at the Hilton , Donovan also slipped in a few misgivings . In an understatement that may never be surpassed as a Luce epitaph , he observed that over the years Time Inc. had picked up " some unnecessary enemies whom we acquired rather carelessly .

If editorial quality starts to slip , it takes a while before customers notice . " By early 1968 , Time magazine 's customers had started to notice ? especially the advertisers . Newsweek 's growing reputation along Madison Avenue as a " hot book " had started to lure advertising pages away from Time . By the end of the year , " the numbers " would show Time 's domestic edition ad pages down 9 per cent , compared to a 3 per cent rise for Newsweek .

But , as they know , too much can be made of them . Whatever Newsweek 's rewards fur editorial scrambling in recent years , and whatever its primogenitor 's slippage , Time remains far out in front ? in worldwide circulation and advertising revenue , almost twice as far . Moreover , it is the linchpin of a global publishing network that , besides turning out Time , Life , Fortune , and Sports Illustrated ( combined worldwide 1968 circulation : 15.7 million ) , embraces five television and radio stations and a growing CATV operation ; Time-Life Books , which last year sold almost eighteen million books and records in sixteen languages ; the publishing house of Little , Brown and Company , and a half-dozen other divisions devoted to what the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This hot pursuit of knowledge produced revenues of more than $567 million for Time Inc. last year . Through early spring of last year , Fuerbringer continued his cocksure editing of Time , conceding little to either the world or the scramblers around him . By then , however , the magazine 's imperious tone and fusty politics were so out of phase with the rest of the Establishment press that Donovan could ignore the situation no longer . To friends who badgered him on the subject he admitted delicately , that , yes , perhaps Time had become " a little too predictable . " And then , there was the box office . In May , the eight-year reign of The Iron Chancellor " came to an end . Reluctantly , Fuerbringer accepted a vice presidency , moved upstairs to a subdued cubicle just down the hall from Donovan on the thirty-fourth floor , and took on the task of finding newspapers for Time Inc. to acquire , then the latest development in the corporation 's quest for knowledge . To reprogram Time , Donovan named Henry Anatole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , rotund concertmeister than an editor , Henry Grunwald started out at Time as a copy boy in 1944 .

Since at Time Inc. even angst travels first-class , all were billeted at Castle Harbour , a gleaming white colonial hotel owned in part by Time Inc. president James A. Linen and set on 212 manicured acres of " Fun and Adventure ? Wherever You Turn , " While presumably less troubled guests , golfed and snorkeled in the sun , the agony of the Feurbringer years poured forth to the hum of air-conditioning in a curtained conference room . Like Soviet bureaucrats nervously emerging from the shadow of Stalin , writers rose to denounce the deposed managing editor for his journalistic tyranny and reactionary policies .

Group Journalism , as refined over the years by Time , is like a surrealistic baseball game in which the writer is the only runner and the rest of the players are all pitchers trying to pick him off first base . As a rookie , he may hazard an occasional Jackie Robinson lead ; but after a few innings of diving into the dirt , he soon learns to stick close to the bag . Correspondents try to nail him for allegedly twisting their flawless reportage from the field . Researchers accuse him of concocting quotes and of getting the color of Kosygin 's eyes wrong . But the real terrors of the mound are the senior editors , former runners themselves who stayed close enough to the sack to ensure promotion and now form the elite staff that each weeks pounds , wrenches , hacks , crunches , and utherwise edits the writer 's copy until it is fit ( they hope ) for the eyes of the managing editor , the magazirie 's ace pick- off artist . Paul O'Neil , long a star of Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , summed up the case for the writers ' team years ago in a memo to T. S. Matthews , then the managing editor . " I am inclined to believe , " he wrote , that the theory of Group Journalism is highly overrated , and the brigades of editors , researchers , advisers , and assorted double domes , who are popularly believed to be helping the writer , are actually just riding around on his back , shooting at parakeets , waving to their friends , and plucking fruit from overhanging branches while he churns unsteadily through the swamps of fact and rumor with his big , dirty feet sinking in to the knee at every step , " ? In Bermuda , Stefan Kanfer , the magazine 's young movie critic and a former television gag writer , complained that most of the writing produced under the senior-editor system had all the grace and subtlety of a stand-up comic telegraphing , " Ladies and gentlemen , mother-in-law .

" It was a mass catharsis , " recalls one writer who had come to the magazine only three weeks before . " I was appalled . If they were that unhappy , why did n't they leave ? " Most had thought about it in their early days but long ago had decided to hang on . There were , after all , those benefits ? inventive expense accounts , air travel cards , profit sharing , six-week vacations , free lessons at Berlitz , trips to Bermuda to complain . Henry Grunwald had not left , either . On the contrary . For the last eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his manifold talents to the making of Time and rising to assistant managing editor as a result . Now , after cocktails , dinner , and a day of listening to impassioned criticism of the magazine , he stood up and told the plaintiffs : " I find myself very largely in agreement with a great deal that was said .... It is clearly no secret to you that I 'm for change . I do n't think T was appointed managing editor of Time to preside over the status one . " But the formula must be bent , not broken . " Some of you , from what I 've heard today , " continued Grunwald , " feel perhaps Time ought to become a totally different magazine very quickly , overnight . I do n't think that 's possible . Not so much , as somebody suggested , because we have a good thing here financially and should n't tamper with it , but because Time really is a part of the American scene , a part of American life , and what you do to it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the legend , Grunwald turned to specifics . The constricting and stifling structure of Group Journalism would be measurably loosened , allowing for longer stories and much more personal writing ; there would be more eyewitness reports , interviews , dialogues ; bylines would be used more often , both those of correspondents and of writers ; judgments would be rendered " less arbitrarily , much more coolly , and perhaps occasionally with a becoming sense of fallibility " ; the magazine 's point of view would he counterpointed with opinion from outside ; though the senior-editor system would likely remain , efforts would be made to civilize the editing process . In exchange for these new freedoms , the writers would have to spend mure time reading poetry and fiction and thinking about language because " there is quite a bit of bad writing at Time and there are occasions when the senior editors , despite occasional insensitivities , greatly improve a story . " Most important , Grunwald said , " the magazine must become more intelligent and , although I hate to use the word , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should never shy away from history , philosophy , or theory ; at present , we do shy away from these things quite a bit . " Folding more intellectuality into the weekly editorial mix was a must ; but , warned Grunwald , " we should never play literary games of the sort that are played in The New York Review of Books . " Had Andrew Kopkind drawn blood ? Only a few weeks before , the young radical journalist , a former , Yest Coast correspondent for Time ; had played a lengthy " literary game " with thi-magazine and its corporate carapace . " Time , " wrote Kopkind in The NYR , " is largely a product of what has happened to America in the last half-century : specifically , how corporations have developed an organizational position so controlling that the whole system can be called ' corporatism . ' Time 's movement is nicely illustrative of that process . Since Lute 's death , Time has become more ' liberal ' while burrowing deeper into the corporate ethic .

The recent change in Time 's management editorship ? from the middlebrow Midwestern conservative Otto Fuerbringer to the sophisticated Viennese cosmopolite Henry Anatole Grunwald ? reflects the corporation 's new conception of itself . " S ome weeksafter the Bermuda gathering , Grunwald sat in his twenty-fifth floor office and discussed Kopkind . " I think Andy is a brilliant writer , " he said , " and I 'm sorry he left . I would welcome his style , but I do n't think I would welcome his philosophy . As I understand it , Andy wants to be a revolutionary . I think his ideas and the ideas of other revolutionaries ought to be represented in Time . As a matter of fact , we have discussed having a forum page where someone like Andy or quite a number of other people would present their opinions without Time necessarily endorsing them . I think , however , that Time should and will remain a magazine whose staff is in rough agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give it a label , I would call progressive conservatism . " Whatever his politics , Grunwald has kept the promise he made to skeptics in Bermuda that " things will be done . " Well before the meeting , in fact , Time had started to change markedly . During the summer election campaign , its tired cover portraiture gave way to political cartoons by David Levine and Gerald Scarfe , and late in the spring there had been a pop-art rendering of Robert F. Kennedy by Roy Lichtenstein . To many Time-watchers , the text of that cover story , written shortly before the Senator 's assassination , provided the first substantial indication of the magazine 's new tack : it offered an eminently fair appraisal of the candidate totally free of the old magisterial tone . Inside the magazine , Grunwald " opened up " the long-standing but rigid three-column makeup by frequent use of text blocs , two- and three-column headlines , and larger pictures . This produced a more flexible format , but it sometimes left the impression that Time had been pasted up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night visit to the office . " The magazine has never really been designed , there 's lots of room for improvement , " says Ivan Chermayeff , whose New York graphic design firm was brought in ( originally by Fuerbringer ) to make recommendations for overhauling the entire layout . At Cbermayeffs 's urging , Grunwald excised the black line that framed the magazine 's cover subjects ; he refused , however , to do away with the familiar red border , insisting that without it On February 21 , 1969 , a Pan American Boeing 707 chartered by Time Inc. and comfortably configured for sixty-two first-class seats and a bedroom compartment took off from San Francisco carrying ? along with Scotch , bourbon , gin , vodka , beer , wine , champagne , Cointreau , Drambuic , Benedictine , creme de menthe , cognac , and the company doctor ? twenty-five U.

Burton Pines , a member of Time 's Saigon bureau , reported that the military " provided what has undoubtedly been the heaviest guard for any non-government civilian group which has ever visited the country .

A score or more other proposals , including several new logo possibilities , were shelved pending the end of Grunwald 's intensive search for an art director . Though the senior-editor system remained in force , several of its Fuerbringerized components either left the magazine or were banished by Grunwald to bureaus in Chicago or San Francisco . When James Keogh , who had served with Grunwald as an assistant managing editor and was Fuerbringer 's ideological sidekick , failed to land the top job , he signed up as head of Nixon 's writing and research staff , returning to New York in January for a farewell party at which he complained that Time had slanted its election coverage in favor of Hubert Humphrey , In the months that followed the Bermuda meeting , innovations appeared in almost every issue . Stories examined complex events more thoroughly and , as a result , became both longer and fewer in number .

To show it was now " with it , " Time eagerly pursued pop culture and pop sociology , funneling the latter into a new section labeled " Behavior . " Grunwald even took a fling at fiction , publishing for the first time in English an Easter story by the Soviet novelist , Alexander Solzhenitsyn . In April , the magazine devoted its essay section one week to excerpts from John W. Gardner 's warning delivered in the annual Godkin Lectures at Harvard that " the machinery of the society is not working ... to solve any of our problems effectively . " ( Whether the excerpts qualified as outside opinion depends on how one regards Mr. Gardner : as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Time properly identified him , or as a director of Time Inc. , which he also is and which the magazine neglected to mention . ) Newsweek has yet to publish any Soviet fiction , but many of Time 's other renovations would be distinctly familiar to Newsweek readers , and Grunwald acknowledges the debt . " Mast of you know , " he told a gathering of Time correspondents in Paris last December , " that I have never believed in underrating Newsweek , and I have always thought it rather silly to automatically assume as Fuerbringer did that anything they do is poor and second best to us . " Grunwald went on to insist that the intellectual community , not Newsweek , was the real competition ; but just to cover all bets , Time Inc. a few weeks later signedan exclusive magazine contract with pollster Louis Harris , luring him away from Newsweek . By any measure , the special supplement Tinte published in January stands as its most ambitious and dramatic effort to spin away from the past . Ironically , the exercise attracted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cardinal principles Luce and fellow Yale-man Briton Hadden laid down when they founded the magazine in 1923 . " TIME is interested , " they wrote in their prospectus , " not in how much it gets between the covers ? but in How MUCH IT GETS OFF ITS PAGES INTO THE MINDS OF ITS READERS . " Donovan , whose idea it was to address the supplement to " The Task before the President , " urged that it be limited to six pages . Grunwald wanted thirty . They compromised at twenty ; but , as Donovan feared , the final version emerged looking more like " The Task before the Reader . " Ten sections ; mind-boggling makeup ; almost all text ; often repetitious . Lots of forays into contemporary metaphysics . Heavy going all the way . Yet , for all the thickets of prose , the turnabout was clear by the second paragraph of the introduction , which offered largely unchallenged Sir Denis Brogan 's observation that " this is not going to be the American century . " In the pages that followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the society 's ills , opting for a hopeful future based on Alfred North Whitehead 's thesis that " the major advances in civilization are processes which all but wreck the societies in which they occur . " As if gingerly letting its readers in on reality for the first time , the magazine occasionally couched its new catechism in almost primer-like-terms " What may really hold America back is precisely what has pushed it forward : the American 's prized and highly developed sense of individualism , which can amount to plain selfishness . " More than once , however , the supplement supported specific reforms that must have startled Time 's carefully narcotized audience . In one instance , the supplement agreed , in part , with the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions that the U.S. Constitution is obsolete ; in another , it urged the government to offer sanctuary to thousands of workers as the employer of last resort . In their enthusiasm . Grunwald and Robert Shnayerson , the senior editor who shepherded the supplement , urged so many grandiose projects on the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arithmetic he found they had bankrupted the treasury . Shnayerson rewrote the proposals along more realistic fiscal lines . Still shaking his head over the length . Donovan ultimately pronounced the supplement " better than expected . " With somewhat ' less restraint , Grunwald celebrated his social manifesto by throwing a dinner for its two-dozen contributors in a private dining room at " 21 . " The supplement termed the war in Vietnam a " relative failure " ; and in the weeks that followed , the magazine , like a magician switching birds in the middle of his act , began pulling more and more doves out of its editorial hat . In a March cover story ( " Viet Nam : When Can The U. S. Begin To Leave ? " ) , Time lamented that " the history of the war is all too painfully graven in false optimism ... raised by officials armed with gleaming statistics and Pollyanna rhetoric , " and concluded : For all its mounting pressure and potential fury , the most striking thing about the present debate is the agreement by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an end well short of any outright allied victory . Beyond that , there is MUD-LiMO ? S acceptance of the conclusion that the 17 . S. involvement in the war ? sooner than later ? must begin to dwindle . At his desk not long ago , Henry Grunwald sat nervously balling up tiny strips of Scotch Tape and , like a man uncomfortable about his past , pondered long and hard the question of whether U.S. involvement in Vietnam had been a mistake . " Yes , " he finally answered , " I think it was . I must add , though , that this is said in hindsight . I would describe myself as having been in the past a moderate hawk , if there is such a thing . From the very beginning , I wished we had never gone in . But for a number of years I felt , as did so many others , that once we had gone in we had to continue what seemed to be one logical step after another to support our position . And then I developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great misgivings about what was happening . In my own mind , it came to a head during the 1968 Tet offensive . That tore it from me completely . I do n't think it was a change in philosophy . I think it was a recognition that , putting aside the aim for a moment , the means we had expended had passed all reason for that aim ? an ' independent ' South Vietnam . " Of course , one can argue that even the original aim was wrong . But I think the idea of discouraging Communist governments is a sound one . I think there still is a difference between Communist and non-Communist governments . There are dreadful non-Communist governments , of course , but that 's another story . The radical notion that we must never intervene in Asia or other places in the world under any circumstances ? that it is up to those people to settle their own affairs ? is obviously na ? ve . You can not be a world power and not be interested in what kind of conditions prevail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more subtle way of making our influence felt , more subtle even than the relatively crude economic intervention of the Mar-shalt Plan in Europe . It is quite possible , of course , that if our heavy-handed influence did not work , more subtle measures will not work either . In that case , we may simply have to withdraw for a while . I say a while because these things are not forever . We used to think that a country , once it had gone Communist , was gone forever . That 's nut necessarily so . Besides , we really have no choice . Suppose , for example , the Communists were infiltrating Burma and its present shaky , more or less socialist government began to topple , what do we do ? We certainly do n't send in the Marines . If we ca n't stop it , then we ca n't stop it . " Time 's coverage of race relations needed almost as drastic an overhaul as its Vietnam policy . This came as something of a surprise since , over the years , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a journalistic pioneer in the area . Older staff members point proudly to the fact that Luce and Hadden insisted from the start that all lynchings be reported in the magazine . ( They do not mention , as does the official company history , * that in those days Time also labeled disreputable Negroes " blackamoors " and " blackamorons . " ) In a hull session with some Nieman Fellows at Harvard a few years ago , Donovan sat patiently while they attacked Time 's many biases and then asked why no one had brought up perhaps the magazine 's strongest prejudice . When his listeners proved suitably baffled , he reminded them of Time 's consistent stand in favor of civil rights . On these thin reeds anti-lynching and pro-civil rights ? the case confidently rested ; supporting the laws of the land equaled journalistic leadership . To most Negro journalists , Time 's handling of race relations more accurately equaled honky . As one result , the magazine 's efforts to recruit a quota of blacks to ornament the staff got nowhere . In the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , Yale-educated Negro in Time Inc. ' s personnel department , tried valiantly to rectify the situation . Ile appeared at the home of C. Gerald Fraser , a reporter on the New York Times who that evening was the host to a gathering of black journalists who meet informally from time to time in New York to discuss the problems of working for The Man . Thomas candidly admitted Time Inc. ' s inability to hire Negro reporters and asked the group why . In effect , they told him to go back and read Time , particularly the cover story on the Newark riots of the previous July . Like prior riot coverage under Fuerbringer , the piece had paid a grudging , mumbling lip service to the civil-rights movement but was otherwise almost racist in tone and point of view ? " They the looters went first for the imported Scotch ( Chivas Regal and Johnny Walker Red Label were the preferred brands ) , then for the bourbons and gins , next for vodka and champagne and ? when everything else ran *Dealing in fals e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four years the U. S. government 's chief rhetorician in Saigon , now heads Time Inc. ' s broadcast division . *Time Inc . The Intimate History of a ? Publishing Empire , 1923-1941 , by Robert T. Elson ( Atheneum , 500 pages ) . out ? for cheap muscatels and cordials .... Women pranced through supermarkets with shopping carts , picking and choosing with unwonted indifference to price tags . " Thomas agreed that the coverage could be improved and suggested that it might help the magazine if the reporters would repeat their criticisms to some editors at Time Inc . By the and of the evening , a half-dozen reporters had agreed to attend such a confrontation if Thomas could arrange it . F " just such soft-sell occasions , Time Inc. maintains on the forty-seventh floor a warren of eight private dining rooms quietly catered by Restaurant Associates and abundantly stocked with liquor that is trundled through the carpeted corridors on tinkling bar carts . On August 15 , 1968 , in dining room " E , " Stanley Thomas , Henry Grunwald , Robert Ajemian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graves , Senior Staff Editor of Time Inc. , sat down to lunch with five Negro reporters : Nancy Hicks , Robert Terrell , and Ted Poston , all then of the New York Post ; Gerald Fraser of the Times , where Miss Hicks now works , and Ed Cumberhatch of Newsweek . " It was all pretty ritzy , " recalls Terrell . " We took two elevators to get there . And the waiter who served us cocktails was Puerto Rican . That sort of set the tone for me . " After drinks and some preliminary fumbling with napkins and staring into the roast beef , Thomas broke the silence with a brief review of Time Inc. ' s recruiting problems , concluding with a pitch that in spite of all the guests had heard over the years it really was a great place to work . " How many Negroes actually do work for Time-Life ? " asked Terrell , a strikingly handsome , deep black Negro who found himself sitting at the head of the table . " Very few , " replied Thomas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Hicks . When no answer came , Grunwald quickly interrupted to say that Time was making a substantial effort to improve its coverage of Negro life and that any Negro who joined the staff would find himself in a strong position to influence and help guide that effort . When the Newark cover came up , Grunwald apologized for it ; its execution , he admitted , had caused considerable embarrassment throughout the staff . ( The confession cost Time several intramural points when , toward the end of the meal , all the reporters told Ajemian how admirably they thought Life had handled the same story . ) The debate next swung to Time 's profile of Negro soul singer Aretha Franklin , a cover story written under the new regime . Miss Hicks argued that the piece unnecessarily examined irrelevant sordid details in Miss Franklin 's private life . Grunwald countered that , to the contrary , the information was essential to the story because " the blues can not be sung well unless they have been experienced . " Miss Hicks winced . As the meal drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most established Negro journalists had disliked Time for so long that the chances of recruiting any of them were slim ; he suggested that perhaps Time should concentrate on younger Negroes who might not be as aware of the magazine 's past , In the end , all the polished silverware and good crockery failed to seduce any of the guests and even Thomas departed not long thereafter for a better personnel job with Philip Morris Inc . In the months since the lunch , however , Grunwald has worked hard to redress many of the grievances he heard around the table that day . Features on Negro professionals , once a rarity , now appear regularly in the magazine ; in most cases , agitation is explored with sympathy and sensitivity , and in a recent essay commemorating the death of Martin Luther King , Jr. , Time urged white Americans " to provide every ounce of help they can " to assist Negroes in building a viable black Establishment . H enry Grunwald arrived in the United States with his parents in the fall of 1940 , having fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then eighteen , he enrolled at New York University , graduating in 1944 with a Phi Beta Kappa key and a degree in philosophy . At nights , during his senior year , he began his ascent at Time by working as a part-time copy boy , often taking the long way through the corridors between offices so he could make notes on the stories he was shuttling . " On one occasion , " he recalled recently , " I rewrote a cover story ? I think it was on Germany ? the way I thought it should have been done . When 1 showed it to an editor , he told me with what I thought was a great deal of forbearance that he thought the magazine 's version was better . I must confess , in those days my ambition was to be a playwright . I was fond of journalism , but I did n't intend to make it my career . I came to Time because I thought it would be a convenient place to make telephone calls and write letters . But after a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the writers whose copy he carried , Grunwald began writing short items and showing them to the editors . Whittaker Chambers , then a foreign editor at the magazine and an architect of its hard-line anti-Communism , liked the young Grunwald 's style and recommended that he be hired . In 1945 , Grunwald joined the staff as a writer in the foreign news department . " It was an era , " says Grunwald , " when there was a good deal of passion over how to handle Communism , how to handle Russia , how to handle the Cold War , but as a relatively young writer at the time I was not very deeply involved . If anything , I was on the Chambers side , feeling that Russia could not be blandly taken as just another form of democracy . " Six years later , at twenty-nine , Grunwald became the youngest senior editor in the magazine 's history . One of his early assignments was to help the national affairs department cover the 1952 Eisenhower-Stevenson campaign , which soon developed into the classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own elastic standards of fairness , the magazine offered Ike to its readers as a political demigod and reduced Stevenson to an idealistic pantywaist . " In retrospect , " says Grunwald , " I do n't think we exactly covered ourselves with glory in that campaign , though I must confess I was not convinced Stevenson would make a very good President . I felt a certain softness at the core . A lot of us felt that way about him . Perhaps we were wrong . Well never know . At the time , I felt Eisenhower was a good idea , though I think his Administratration , on the whole , turned out rather disastrously . I do think , though , that Time went too far in tone and emphasis in pushing Eisenhower . I did n't really have too much authority in those days . " Despite his rapid rise in journalism at that point , Grunwald still yearned to be a playwright . " In the mid-Fifties , " he recalls , " I took a leave of absence and went up to Connecticut to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , though , a friend warned me at a cocktail party that ' no great play had ever been written in Connecticut . ' And he was right . At least for me he was right . I do regret never having become a playwright , though I now have a degree of fatalism about it . I guess one does what one has to do . " Once back at the magazine , Grunwald devoted himself to journalism with single-minded ambition . By the time Donovan appointed him managing editor , he had edited almost all departments of the magazine , produced dozens of cover stories on subjects ranging from T. S. Eliot to Coca-Cola , helped Fuerbringer launch three new departments ( Show Business , Modern Living , and Time Essay ) and managed to squeeze in several major free-lance projects on the side , among them the editing of Salinger : A Critical and Personal Portrait , a collection of essays on the author . Throughout his rise , Grunwald 's relationship with Fuerbringer remained , in the words of one colleague , " an uncomfortable one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magazine before him , he coped with his discomfort in the Time-honored tradition : by swallowing hard and blinking . Concentrating on the arts and other nonsensitive areas , he developed a reputation with the staff as a demanding but fair editor more interested in the nuances of style and language than in imposing his opinions . When movie critic Kanfer turned in a negative review of The Graduate , Grunwald , a film votary himself . returned it with the marginalia : " I have a feeling in my hones you are wrong about this . " Nevertheless , the review ran unaltered . To Kanfer and other young writers at Time , Grunwald 's elevation to managing editor is less like the second coming than the first . " Henry 's a man of genuine density , " says one of these acolytes . " He 's a gourmet , he knows opera , he loves Mozart . He has a wonderful European quality about him . Sometimes , with those enormous eyes and that girth , he looks as if he stepped right out of Proust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to work wearing a big , wide-brimmed hat and carrying a long , black cane with a silver rim . Charles Swann , in the flesh . The whole thing is incredible . Imagine , a Jewish copy boy from NYU coming up through all those six-foot-six Yalies . Incredible ! " And so , perhaps , it is . But swallowing hard and blinking are ticks of ambition not easily cured . Donovan said get Time caught up with the rest of the Establishment press , and Grunwald has put the Mighty Wurlitzer in tune . He is unlikely to try many atonalities . " Henry is a brilliant editor , " says one of his closest associates , " but sometimes he . acts with almost Lucean conservatism . " Grunwald 's first deal with an outside writer foundered on just this streak . Last fall , he asked Garry Wills , a gifted young esquire contributing editor whose work he admired , to do an essay for Time . Wills turned in a piece on " The Politics of Obscenity , " a scholarly , almost square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so compelled to use foul language . Far from approving of the behavior , Wills intelligently condemned it , warning that it was " a nihilistic vision of hate that brings the politics of obscenity into increasingly accepted and effective use . " Grunwald liked the conclusion , but not the quoted obscenities sprinkled along the way . " It 's not time for four-letter words in Time , " he explained to an editor who pleaded with him to run the piece as submitted . To try and salvage the situation , Grunwald had the essay put through three euphemizing rewrites ; but when Wills saw the final , sanitized version he refused permission to publish it . ( Embarrassed by the incident , Grunwald partly compensated Wills for his labors by running a flattering story about him in the magazine 's Press section . ) For all its cutting Luce in the past year , Time remains a polite , committed member of the club . No four-Letter words , certainly , even in the most innocent context . But more important , no real passion or anger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost aggressive judiciousness , on-the-one-handing this and on-the-other-handing that to the point where many stories read like the old two-liner : " What do you think of the ABM problem ? " " I definitely think there is one . " That may constitute an improvement over the Fuerbringer style , but it falls far short of the tough-mindedness the late hour demands . Lengthy programmatic essays on how to heal the nation are useful ; but hard-eyed scrutiny of the corrupt powers that made ? and are making it sick is the stuff of good journal-ism . Crusading ( the word sounds almost archaic from disuse ) does not appear , however , to be in the plan . Even crusaders are handled with care . As of this writing Ralph Nader has yet to grace Time 's cover . Grunwald insists he wants to do the profile but has lacked what the newsmagazines call a peg ? a splashy news event on which to hang the story . Earlier this year , however . Time limned a heroic cover portrait of and devoted fifteen columns to Italian automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the fact that his Fiats are creating American-size traffic jams on the Continent . Anyone looking hard enough for a Nader peg could find it in the same issue , which summed up in less than two columns the 1S5-page expos ? Nader 's researchers had put together on the Federal Trade Commission . Grunwald will probably get around to Nader eventually , but the priorities are clear , Automobile manufacturers come first , even foreign ones . The business ethic may be alive and well after all , and living more luxuriously than ever in Rockefeller Center ? albeit now modishly decked out in well-cut Galbraithian threads , Like the Braniff ads cheerfully advising us all to flaunt it if we 've got it , much of Time 's editorial copy remains aimed toward the twin grails of American life , Money and Success . A recent business piece on the proliferation of high salaries for certain skills concluded that " on balance , the people whoare paid best are those who are regularly called upon to display one of the most valuable of all commodities : judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid out pictures of an Episcopal bishop , a commercial jet pilot , General Motors chairman James Roc-he , and Barbra Streisand . As for all those dowdy social workers and ghetto school teachers , let it rain on their parade . Maybe one asks too much . The notion that Time could become a truly liberated , vigorously independent journalistic force in the country is no doubt hopelessly wishful , Half-billion-dollar corporations in the " knowledge industry " do not afford the ideal atmosphere for such quixotic sallying ? especially when the numbers " keep coming up wrong . Despite Grunwald 's redecorating over the past year , advertisers continue to favor Newsweek . In mid-April , the Well StreetJournal 's aggressive man on the publishing beat , A. Kent MacDougall , reported that in the first quarter of this year Newsweek 's domestic ad pages were up 17 per cent , Time 's off 4 per cent . James R. Shepley , Time 's brash , occasionally belligerent publisher , quickly sought to calm Madison Avenue with full-page advertisements in the Journal and the New York Times insisting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent over recent weeks . A house skeptic pasted the ad on a wall in Time 's public-affairs office , adding the graffito : " Nice try . " MacDougall also reported fiscal unfitness in the rest of the shop . Not only was Life in serious trouble , but other Time Inc. divisions were losing money as well . Two days later , after the company 's stock had dropped 91/2 points , management confirmed MacDougall 's digging by announcing to the annual stockholders ' meeting that the corporation had sustained a net operating loss of $300,000 in the first quarter . ( For supplying the executive " judgment " that helped lead to this unhappy arithmetic , Hedley Donovan , Andrew Heiskell , and James A. Linen ? who , as editor-in-chief , chairman , and president , make up the ruling triumvirate at Time Inc , ? are paid each annual salaries of $165,000 . ) Marginal first-quarter losses , of course , do not necessarily portend bankruptcy . But they do tend to make half-billion-dollar corporations edgy . And along with all the mundane , immediate problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are print culture 's hot linear days numbered ? Will post-industrial , post-Chicago man be post-literate as well ? Already television has put its cool whammy on Life . Who 'll be next ? In another ten years ( five years ? ) will anyone want to read newsmagazines ? Or any other kind of magazine ? Or newspapers ? Or books ? No one is quite sure . It 's all a little cosmic for the board room , and very nervous-making . Henry Grunwald is in a tough spot . Under the circumstances , one should be satisfied . In fourteen months , he has made Time a respectable magazine for the first time in its history . Perhaps no more should be asked of any one man .
