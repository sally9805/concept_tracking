Many big-city high schools specialize in some vocation or art and draw commuter students from all over-but few offer the specialty that engages San Francisco 's Lowell High School . It is an all-academic school that welcomes any youngster from any district on the basis of scholarly ability alone , and as a result is the No. 1 college-geared public school in the West . <P> Last week San Francisco hotly debated Lowell 's fate . At issue : School Superintendent Harold Spears 's plan to shift Lowell from its condemned building in downtown San Francisco to new quarters in a middle-income district-and slash its " outside " students to 40% of enrollment . " If you pile up all your top students in one place , " said Superintendent Spears , " you 're hurting the city as a whole . We believe in equality of education . " <P> Two Nobels . Poor boys with rich minds have long flocked to Lowell 's " old brick pile " at Hayes and Masonic streets . The lure is Lowell 's topflight faculty and such courses as calculus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition . While 21% of San Francisco high school students as a whole go on to four-year colleges , the average for Lowell is 49% . Lowell graduates consistently win honors at Caltech , Stanford , M.I.T. and Harvard . <P> Lowell ( named after James Russell ) is the only U.S. high school to claim two Nobel prizewinners : Physicist Albert Michelson ( ' 68 ) , the first U.S. winner , and Physicist Joseph Erlanger ( ' 90 ) . Lowell 's other alumni include such diverse notables as Actress Carol Channing , Paper Tycoon J. D. Zellerbach , Author Irving Stone , Cartoonist Rube Goldberg , Baseball Player Jerry Coleman , the late Publisher ( Washington Post ) Eugene Meyer , Presidential Press Secretary Pierre Salinger , California Governor Pat Brown ( ' 23 ) . <P> One Opinion . When Lowell 's ancient building was condemned in 1953 , the board of education agreed to run its new quarters on the old undistricted basis . But then came a new board and New Superintendent Spears . To share Lowell 's talent with the city 's six other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive school , vocational as well as academic , with 60% of its students from the local district . Spears thought of his 60-40 plan as " a happy situation " that would satisfy everyone . <P> When the public got wind of the plan last month , Spears was astounded at the reaction . A " Save Lowell " committee roared into action , rounded up thousands of signatures in protest . Chinese and Negro leaders argued that a 60-40 school would soon shut out their children . Summed up one prominent businessman : " What they 're really doing is hurting the poor child who wants to go to college and has to rely on public education . Instead of being democratic , they 're really being as undemocratic as they can . " <P> At the board of education meeting called last week to decide the school 's fate , 1,000 citizens heard three hours of speeches against a truncated Lowell . " No matter how thin you slice it , " cried one Spears critic , " this will not be an academic high school . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education voted 6 to 1 in favor of an undistricted new Lowell . A great cheer shook the hall .
