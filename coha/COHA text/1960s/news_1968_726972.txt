txt The basic suspicion with which this country views the necessity of public housing has always been reflected in its housing legislation . It is not only that the law specifies a maximum cost per unit , with construction rigidly cut to the economic bone for minimum standards of " safe and sanitary " shelter ; but built into the legislation is a kind of punitive intent , a guarantee that nothing too good shall be given the poor . While the amount of public housing provided in American cities in thirty years has been only a drop in the bucket of need , the restrictive clauses have succeeded beyond anyone 's wildest dreams in creating the " project look , " that dismal mold that blights cities , neighborhoods and people . The impersonally cheerless barracks called " public housing " have produced a terrifying new breed of slum ? in New York as elsewhere . An amendment to the state public housing law introduced by State Senator Whitney North Seymour Jr. , which would do much to help correct the situation , has now been passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Assembly . It would permit " project cost " for new construction to include excellence of architectural design " compatible with prudent budgeting . " This is no mandate for extravagance . It is merely recognition of the fact that well-designed housing can deal with the emotional arid environmental needs left unsatisfied by the kind of minimal " safe and sanitary " standards that dehumanize and destroy . Man does not live by shelter alone . The desolate " projects " are hated ? in Buffalo they have a 10 per cent vacancy rate  --  and in every city they carry the stigma of personal and environmental poverty and the seeds of despair . " They are hated , " writes James Baldwin , " because they reveal the real attitude of the white world . " They also reveal clearly the attitude of legislators and government agencies . When the Federal Public Housing Administration sponsored some housing of uncommon attractiveness it was promptly condemned by the General Accounting Office for extravagant extras , in spite of the fact that its superior design had been achieved within the specified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it could have been built more cheaply still by eliminating its attractive features ; and although the intent of Federal law includes " livability , " it was held to require the stripping of all amenities to rock-bottom levels . This attitude must change if the nation is seriously changing its thinking about cities and slums . A slum is psychological as well as physical blight . Design is not a frill ; it is not " prettifying " plain buildings ; it is the process of creating housing that looks and works better , not walled off from the community by chainlink fence , but functioning as part of it . Elimination of the quality of self-respect along with quality of environment is false economy . Real economy can be achieved by attacking obsolete codes , bureaucratic delays , restrictive union practices and lack of progressive and experimental housing study and techniques . Anything that moves public housing toward these ends and an atmosphere of human dignity is a step toward solution of the cities ' . social and racial ills .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
