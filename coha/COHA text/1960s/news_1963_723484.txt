txt The home of Arthur D. Shores . a Negro attorney who has played a patt in several civil rights actions , has been bombed twice in the past month Last week he got moze bad news ? The insurance on his home is hemg canceled Such action by insurers has been rare , even in the section There Mr Shores ' $75.000 ranchstyle home is located : this area is known as Dynamite Hill because of a series of bombings which stretches back 15 years But rer'ently , bombings . such as the blast that killed four Negro girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church Sept 15 , have been occurring more frequently As a result , Negro leaders and insurance agents of both races say , more insurance companies are shying from underwriting risky Negro homes , businesses and churches " It 's becoming increasingly difficult to get companies to accept risks in areas subject to arson and bombing , and there are a few instances of them canceling coverage they 've already got , " says William Blair , white president of Leedy-Glover Insurance Agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep getting worse . " he adds . " The insurance companies are n't worried only about the bombing of Negro properties  --  every time there 's a disturbance somebody puts the torch to some white places , too . " Wary Companies Another agent says companies have been wai y of new Negro risks since demonstrations led to xiolence here last May , but that the situation has worsened since the Sept. 15 blast " Two of my companies have already told me this week not to commit them on renewing any Neelo policies they already have ? " he says " Unless law officers catch whoever is responsible for the bombings and put a stop to violence , the situation will become a lot woise as more policies come up for renewal , " says John Drew , Negro president of Alexander &; Co insurance agency . He says many companies are reluctant to gain a reputation of canceling clients during the term of a policy , but are far less loath to renew a questionable risk when the policy expires Because of companies ' reluctance to cancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurch here stands at this moment with no insurance , agents report . This is Bethel Baptist Chun h. a favorite target for bombers when its pastor was the Rev F L Shuttlesworth , the integration leader who held frequent Negro rallies thei e . Ironically , the church 's coverage was canceled after Mr. Shuttlesworth left last year to accept a pastorate in Ohio and integration meetings no longer were held there . Despite the fact it has had no more insurance claims , the church has been unable to obtain new cov-erage Agents say most state licensed companies try to steer clear of likely targets , such as Bethel Baptist , because the state requires them to charge the same premium for properties of equal value even though one has a history of bombings and violence In some cases , an agent can obtain coverage from an outside company which specializes in insuring high risk ' - - at high rates But often this does n't work , either . 1.10 ds Says No " I tried everybody . even Lloyds of London , and no.ne of them would touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church s in-surance The 16th Street Baptist Church , which suffered severe damage in the recent bombing , is covered by Continental Insurance Co A spokesman for the company says it has no plans at the moment to remove its protection but the church 's pastor , the Rev. John L Cross , is far from convinced . " I was convinced even before the bombing that if we were having demonstrations when the church policy comes up for renewal in November . they would probably drop it " he says " I wo n't be a bit surprised now if the payment for our claim is followed by a can , citation notice " Companies and their agents are finding themselves in an uncomfortable position when a long-held risk suddenly turns into an undeeirahle one Such is the case with Negro millionaire A Ci Gaeton , who owns a lavish home and a motel both of which has e been bombed this summer We re loeking at it on a fix% - to- day basis the agert handling insurance on the properties We se had his insurance for 20 years and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eluirien hang hang he s a had one If we elm Bled him v , e cl get the reputation of quit ? 1-tc when the going nets tough . and that s bad for are szent or company we 're just praying things will calm down and nothing else will happen . " The fit st indication that companies are beginning to balk at certain risks , agents say , is when they start reducing the amount of coverage they 'll accept on a property . They estimate this has happened during the past few months to at least 30 Negro churches and other propel ties in Birmingham . At 6th Avenue Baptist Church , a popular place for integration rallies and the scene la't week of the funerals of three of the four bomb victims , a company recently sliced its coverage to $50,000 from $100,000 . The insurer also told its agent to voice no guarantees about renewing the coverage . In this case , as in most others so far , more coverage has been obtained by the agent spreading the risk among several companies in small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a good indication of the climate , " one agent says . " It shows that they 've been scared here for months , and they 're going to be a lot more scared now . "
