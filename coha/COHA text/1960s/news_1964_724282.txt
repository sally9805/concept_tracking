txt WASHINGTON , Oct. 6 ? President Johnson 's ability to get his program through the Congress is recognized by both political parties here , but there is still much confusion about how he does it . One explanation , to use Tommy Corcoran 's phrase , is that the President " knows the deck . " He knows the value of every card . He knows the players intimately . And he works at it night and day . All the popular notions of Johnson the " arm twister " and the " wheeler dealer , " while partly true , debase and distort a much more intricate , delicate and positive art . The problem is to know where the wires of power lie , who are the key men , what one group wants that another opposing group can be persuaded to accept and a third group is likely to tolerate , however unwillingly . Kennedy 's Troubles This involves a whole lot more than " twisting arms " and " knocking heads together , " though these political gymnastics help . It involves mastery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It requires great knowledge of every parliamentary rule and trick in the book . It demands an intuitive understanding of human nature and enough experience to know what arguments will move one man but not another , and precisely when to speak or be quiet . John Kennedy did not " know the deck " and , frankly , he did not like the Executive - Congressional game . It irritated him to spend hours wheedling votes out of the proud and powerful chairmen of the committees . He was not really an insider in the " club " even when he was a member of the House and Senate . He was a back-bencher , who never quite lost the new boy 's deference for the elders of the Congress . Johnson , in contrast , was an insider in the Congress , almost from the first . For nearly 30 years he has been talking and drinking with the senior members , campaigning for them in their districts , visiting with them and their families . Unlike Kennedy , he loves " the game . " It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ; his work and his sport . He does n't separate politics from policy or even front family , but mixes them all up together , which was what he was doing today when he sent Mrs. Johnson off whistle-stopping through the South . Ironically , even Johnson 's success In getting things done perpetuates the illusion that he is a political manipulater who somehow lacks interest in things of the mind . Yet the intellectual requirements of mastering the political art are enormous . He not only has to master legisla ' Ron and men , but he has to know their districts and states , their strengths and weaknesses , their sup ' porters and opponents back home , their ambitions and their fears . President Johnson knew that he had to have Harry Byrd 's cooperation if not his vote to get the tax bill out of the Finance Committee . , He soon learned that the thing could not be done if he did n't agree in advance to keep his budget below the $100 billion mark , so he cut the budget in Byrd 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was not at all satisfied with the poverty bill as it came to him from his executive advisers . He knew instinctively that he would lose one group of voters unless he eliminated some parts of the bill and another group if he did n't add something else . Accordingly , he directed the changes before he let it go to the Hill and wrote some of them himself . This Is what is meant by " knowing the deck . " President Kennedy was a detached man . He talked to the legislators too , but his way was his own . He would call a Senator to his office . He would explain his purpose clearly and precisely and express the hope that the Senator could go along with him . President Johnson does it differently . He takes time for such adventures . He stage-manages them . He is likely to invite to the White House not only the Senator but the Senator 's wife , and while she is going through the house with Mrs. Johnson , the President will " visit " with the Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . Politics of Exhaustion Then he will argue his case . He will know it by heart . He will defend it until any opposition from the Senator will seem like treason or worse . Then he will expound on all Ida troubles from VietnEtm and the Congo , to Cuba and Mississippi , and finally ask the poor exhausted man on his way to the door : " Can count on you ? " By such tactics and many others he got his tax cut and his civil rights bill , his poverty bill and a lot more . A. year ago the political scientists were wondering whether President Kennedy was going to be overwhelmed and broken In a kind of civil war with the Congress , and they were writing ominously about paralysis of the American system of divided powers . In ten months Johnson has changed all this . Now the pedagogues are analyzing his victories , speculating about his domination of the convention and wondering how the poor Republicans are going to get enough seats in Congress to keep him from unbalancing the whole two-party system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
