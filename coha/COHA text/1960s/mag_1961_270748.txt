Ever since Russia resumed nuclear testing , both U.S. and European airplanes , particularly high-flying jetliners , have been bringing home unwanted cargoes of radioactivity . Such hot cargo was a recognized problem in the late 19505 , but during the nuclear-test moratorium that began in 1958 , the radiation level of the high atmosphere gradually decreased , and most airlines stowed their Geiger counters in mothballs . Recent Soviet tests have started the trouble all over again , and this time it is expected to grow worse and last longer . Jetliners of the 19605 fly well up in the stratosphere , where radioactive fission products linger for years . <P> The Dutch airline KLM now checks its airplanes regularly , and issues maps to point out the position of known masses of radioactive air . If a flight plan promises to take an airliner through too many contaminated clouds , a safer course can be chosen . Soon KLM will have radiation detectors riding in its planes to make sure that passengers and crewmen do not get dangerous doses of radiation . <P> Other European airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American has had the closest contact thus far with the high-altitude fallout , because its several near-polar routes take its planes through fresh radioactive clouds from the Russian tests . According to the Public Health Service , which checks Pan Am 's planes , they are already ten times as radioactive as before the Russian tests started . The radioactive material does not cling to smooth , clean surfaces . It nestles in places where the air stream makes abrupt turns . Oily spots , which are sometimes unavoidable , catch the hot particles , which also lodge inside jet engines . <P> So far no passenger or crew member has been endangered in the air . The chief threat of radiation is to ground crews that service the planes . Crewmen are required to wear gloves and check them frequently . The airplanes are washed down with special detergent solutions , and the mops used in this process are also checked . They sometimes prove notably hot , and from them PHS has extracted the 25-odd radioisotopes that make up the most dangerous debris in a cloud of fission products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
