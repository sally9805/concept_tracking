txt The people of Dallas did not want .. lack L. Ruby back among them , boasting of his crime and acquittal . Neither did they want him sentenced to death . " This verdict was almost as shocking to everyone as Ruby 's own shooting had been , " a Dallas newspaper editor said shortly after the jury returned , with a verdict of guilty and directed sentence of death for the slayer of Lee H. Oswald , accused assassin of President Kennedy . A. C. Greene , editor of The Dallas Times Herald editorial page , declared : " The town 's a little bit shaken. - Across the street from the courthouse , a large crowd gathered before noon when news . spread that a verdict would soon be announced . Crowd Awaits Verdict The brisk winds and sunny skies made the waiting pleasant , but the mood of the crowd was somber . When the decision was announced , some drifted away without comment , others stood to watch District Attorney Henry M. Wade interviewed on the courthouse steps . Upstairs , as sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a side exit , one deputy turned to another and remarked : " Too strong . " The other deputy raised ' an eyebrow . " Prison would have been better , " the deputy explained . " This wo n't stand up . " His view was widely shared around the courthouse this afternoon . Then , too , Judge Joe t3 . Brown 's casual manner on the bench had been the despair of some of his colleagues during the trial . The Court of Criminal Appeals will review a capital punishment case more rigorously than it // would a case with a long-term prison sentence , some observers believe . When he was arguing last month for a change of venue , Melvin M. Belli , Ruby 's chief attorney , charged that the civic leaders of Dallas wanted to execute Ruby to show that law and order prevailed here . Mr. Belli , however , had apparently overstated the attitude among the businessmen who influenced this city . For the most part , these men wanted to see Ruby sentenced to a jail term of at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , " one member of the Dallas Citizens Council , a business group , said two months ago . " Whether it 's official or unofficial , I do n't want to see another killing here . " Of recurrent concern here has been the possibility that Mr. Belli would succeed in getting Ruby acquitted . " I can picture the whole thing now , " said one woman who belongs to a loose-knit group of Dallas leaders that Mr. Belli had apparently referred to in 6 talkinct of the " oligarchy . " " Jack Ruby 's out of jail , " she ' declared , " and he 's bought a new strip-tease joint and he 's behind the bar bragging about how he killed Oswald . It gives me nightmares . " Mr. Belli 's handling of the Ruby case had drawn criticism on several grounds . He first alienated much of the state 's legal profession last December when he arrived in Dallas and characterized members of the District Attorney 's staff as " yokels . " " I almost forgot about Jack Ruby as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said today . " And I got the feeling that Mr. Belli had forgotten , too . " The spectators who turned up early each day to watch the proceeding 's rarely expressed opinions about the case . But they were all plainly fascinated by Mr. Belli 's dramatic appearance and urbane air . After the first bail bond hearings , however , opinions among Dallas lawyers had begun to change . " First I thought Belli would eat Henry Wade alive , " one lawyer said after a visit to the courtroom . " But I 'd forgotten that Henry 's a pretty solid prosecutor . " Ruby 's attorneys had based their case almost exclusively on ! the argument that the 52-yearold night-club owner was insane at the time he shot Oswald last Nov. 2 ' 1 . Visitors to Dallas in the last month expressed surprise at the number of people Ruby knew here . " He used to come in often , " a waitress said last night at an all-night diner near the Carousel , Ruby 's nightclub . " The defense asked me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd known him for 15 years and I just did n't have anything good to say about him . " " I know Jack Ruby , " taxi drivers , policemen and local businessmen often said . " and he 's no more crazy than I am . " But for whatever ill will Ruby engendered in 15 years in Dallas , few persons were expressing today . " In the last few months , Ruby has become a household name in Dallas , " one man said . " He 's like a television performer whom you feel you know , just from hearing so much about . him . You ca n't kill someone like that with a clear con-11 science . "
