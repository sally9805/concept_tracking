txt The American autitWorld hunter once found life easy Auto and compartmentalized . Show He bought large cars front Detroit , small cars . from aliroad . If his desire was a vehicle that would withstand the stylei ravages of time , he looked for one of the conservative British models guaranteed to last a lifetime ; if he wanted a car that would include the latest in chrome trim , tail lamps and bumper guards , he would seek out an American make , then trade in his car almost as often as his wife bought a new dress . Today these distinctions are less sharp , as is apparent to even the casual visitor to the fourth annual International Automobile Show , now under way at the Coliseum . For the American manufacturers , who at first ignored the efforts of their foreign counterparts , are now producing small cars with as much verve as they ever did the larger models , and one must almost examine each car carefully in this motor smorgasbord to find out its country of origin . Where this international Battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest foreign Joined models only , with hardly a Detroit-made vehicle in sight , today models from Old World and New World stand cheek-by-jowl . It is almost as if the American manufacturers have thrown out the challenge implied in the words of the popular song : Anything you can do we can do better . Behind the glam orous and tempting array at the Coliseum , which must appeal to every car aficianado , the battle is clearly joined , with all the weapons of hard and soft  --  but always persistent  --  sell . The American manufacturers sing of comfort and the security of familiar names , the Europeans sing of economy and size and Old World workmanship . Both groups have large-scale sales in mind , bringing on something of an about-face on the part of the overseas contingent . Once the darling of the select and avant-garde few , the foreign car , with its purported advantages , is now being dangled in front of the mass market . Once the cry was that you could be the first on your block to own one . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one just like your neighbor 's . But the European Vehicular manufacturers are takBag of ing another tack as Tricks well . Recalling the novelty success of their small cars when they first appeared on American roads a few years back , they are dipping into their vehicular bag of tricks for new novelties . The resilts are visible at the Coliseum . They have developed a new line of sports cars , moderately priced so they can be offered as second cars to ' middle-income families . There are new midget sedans , with frontwheel drives and the engines mounted sideways . There are assemble-it-yourself cars and boltedtogether cars from Great Britain , which dominates the imported sections of the show . There is an amphibious automobile that doubles as a motor boat , giving the owner two status symbols for the price of one . The keen competition that Detroit has shown as a counterbalance to the inroads the foreigners have been making in its profits is being met , in other words , by innovation and invention . All this tempest More Than brews to keep Amen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that matter  --  off its feet and on wheels . The automobile , at least in this country , is more than a convenience . It is a tradition , and it has made traditions . Sociologists credit the family car with an appreciable change in our mores , economists point to the car as the reason for the growth of suburbia . One of the largest in the country , the auto ? motive industry is a major pressure point of the entire economy . A layoff in Detroit has repercussions that are felt from coast to coast , booming " les from the Motor City start a chain reaction that affects the service station hi the remotest ham . let . The sale of the pleasure car then , is no matter of mere pleasure for the automobile manufacturer of any country . Thus , while all h smooth music and soft lights anc sweet talk at the Coliseum , the lead ers of the industry are watchini carefully to see where the eye : linger longest and the heart seem : to yearn most fervently .
