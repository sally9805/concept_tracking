" I remember Mao Tse-tung saying to me that Americans thought the Communists would lose . " Old China Hand Theodore H. White is no mean hand at that kind of name-dropping . He also recalls being warned by Chiang Kaishek , in 1941 , that " the Japanese are a disease of the skin , but the Communists are a disease of the heart . " Such recollections are heart and parcel of China : The Roots of Madness , a 90-minute television documentary to be syndicated on 101 channels in 41 states between Jan. 30 and Feb. 5 . For those whose knowledge of the past century of Chinese history is a little hazy , the White-scripted special should be virtually required viewing . <P> In addition to crackling prose of a caliber rarely heard on TV , the Xerox Corp. - sponsored program is livened by the affecting personal reminiscences of Pearl Buck , among others-and the crisp editing of David Wolper Productions Inc . <P> In the can since last month , the show makes only passing reference to the Red Guards . Even so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present upheaval . The thrust of Roots of Madness is , baldly , that 100 years of colonial humiliation and continuous civil blood shed left a fractious population unifiable only by tyranny and by a paranoiac " primitive hatred of the foreign devil . " <P> Eerie Fanaticism . The earliest foot age , shot in 1900 by Professional Traveler Burton Holmes , contains a profusion of reminiscent vignettes : U.S. occupation troops play broomstick polo in Peking during the Boxer Rebellion ; a throne-room sequence shows the last Manchu ruler , the depraved Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi . There are shots of Sun Yat-sen 's founding of the Kuomintang , and of his 1925 funeral ; and there is a portrait of 33-year-old Mao the next year , already glowing eerily with fanaticism . The impressive wedding ceremony of Sun 's Wellesley-trained sister-in-law to his heir , Chiang , is followed by Mao and Chiang on screen together , toasting each other at the 1945 truce conference arranged by U.S. Ambassador Patrick Hurley . <P> The one omnipresent picture is death - by warlord 's broadsword or Japanese bombardment , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruelty . " The end result is shown in the present generation of young girls caroling : " Last night I dreamed of Chairman Mao . " Teddy White also sees visions of the Commu nist revolutionary he remembers from the 1930s and 1940s . A film of Mao to day comes into view while the voice-over narrates : " His aging mind still lusts for permanent strife ; the theme he preaches to old and young alike is hate . "
