Among those most disturbed by Los Angeles ' race riot this summer was Pope Paul VI ; the tragedy of Watts moved him to hasten a decision to appoint an American Negro bishop . Last week , on the eve of his historic flight to New York , Pope Paul announced his choice : the Rev. Harold R. Perry , 48 , superior of the Southern province of the Society of the Divine Word . Perry 's post : auxiliary bishop of New Orleans . Announcing the appointment , New Orleans ' Archbishop Philip Hannan-himself raised to that position only three days earlier-said warmly , " We welcome the first American-born Negro bishop . " * <P> Bishop Perry 's appointment serves various needs . For one thing , U.S. Roman Catholic bishops have long worried , as one said last week , that " there was no Negro among us . " Significantly , Perry will serve in the Southern city with not only the largest ( 592,000 ) Catholic population , but also with some of the South 's most bitter racial disputes . In 1955 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a Negro priest had been assigned . Three years ago , when the late Archbishop Joseph Francis Rummel ordered parochial schools integrated , Catholics protested so vehemently that three , including Political Boss Leander Perez , were excommunicated . One of the three , Mrs. Bernard J. Gaillot , last week called Bishop Perry 's appointment " another reason why God will destroy the Vatican . " <P> The new bishop knows his diocese and its problems well . One of six children , he was born the son of a rice-mill worker in segregationist Lake Charles , La . The family spoke French at home , and although the parents never got to high school , all six children attended college ; one brother became a surgeon , two of them dentists . Harold Perry entered St. Augustine 's Divine Word Seminary in Mississippi at 13 , was ordained in 1944 , and spent 14 years as a parish priest . Appointed rector of the seminary in 1958 , he worked for better race relations , caught the eye of Archbishop John P. Cody , Rummel 's successor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week joined Archbishop Hannan in announcing the appointment of his protege . <P> Bishop Perry 's selection is likely to resurrect some of New Orleans ' racial dissension . On the other hand , as the Vatican realizes , it will not go unnoticed among U.S. Negroes . Of them , only a meager 723,000 are now numbered among the nation 's 45 million Roman Catholics . <P> <P> * Technically , Perry is not the first . James Augustine Healy , bishop of Portland , Me. , from 1875 to 1900 , was the son of a white Georgia planter and a mulatto slave , once joked about his color by suggesting that a small girl who called him " black as the devil " should rephrase it " black as the ace of spades .
