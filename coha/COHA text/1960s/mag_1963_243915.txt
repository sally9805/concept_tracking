When German Industrialist Friedrich Flick reached his 80th birthday this month , he celebrated by donating more than a million dollars to charity and scientific research . Flick 's generosity is one result of a remarkable accomplishment : the reconstruction of his personal fortune . Just 13 years after his release from Landsberg prison , where he served five years of a seven-year term for using Nazi slave labor in his factories , Flick once again heads Germany 's biggest and most powerful industrial empire . He controls an interlocking maze of 156 companies in autos , steel , chemicals and paper whose annual sales total is more than $2 billion - nearly twice that of the Krupp empire . His personal wealth has been set by tax collectors at $400 million , which makes him Germany 's wealthiest man . <P> Sixth Sense . Flick rode high under the Nazis , with enough holdings in coal and steel to make him a reichsmark billionaire . During his imprisonment , 75% of his wealth was confiscated , and after his release Allied authorities forced him to sell the remainder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter blow , but when the coal industry hit a depression in 1958 Flick turned out to be set with plenty of cash . With an unerring sixth sense for economic trends , he resisted advice to concentrate all he had in steel , decided that most growth would be in autos , chemicals and paper , and set out to pyramid his holdings in each field . He bought 40% control of prestigious Daimler-Benz ( Mercedes ) to form a solid auto base , got a small car to sell by adding the struggling Auto Union . In an age of business managers , Flick is still an imperious and self-confident tycoon . " One must have an eye for how much a plant is worth , " he says . " I fancy myself as having this eye , Because I know how a plant works . " <P> Strong Advice . At 80 , Flick still has a ramrod-straight back . Virtually his only relaxation is strolling alone , head down , through the vast park surrounding Haus Hobeck , his spacious 15-room villa near Dsseldorf . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prodigious amount of work each day at the 100-man headquarters of his holding company on two rented floors in Dsseldorf . He is frequently on the phone to such key managers as Walter Hitzinger of Daimler-Benz , constantly amazes them with his grasp of intricate details . <P> The uncompromising Flick never gives direct orders , but his managers have learned that any " advice " he gives is as good as an order . His oldest son , Otto-Ernst , 47 , made the mistake recently of questioning the old man 's judgment , started a court battle to change the way in which Flick had decided to dispense his wealth after his death . Beaten in court , Otto-Ernst no longer has any connection with his unforgiving father 's industrial combine . His more obedient younger brother , Friedrich-Karl , 36 , is now the heir apparent .
