1 Exterior : Road to Poplar Lodge , Day A hot spring day . A cloudless , slate-blue sky , the sun near its noon zenith . It 's been a dry spring , and the leaves on the evergreens and elms that line the road are already covered with a thin film of dust sprayed up by the few cars that pass that way . Walking down the center of that road is a young man in his early twenties , Vincent Bruce . He walks determinedly , with his hands tucked in his suit pockets and his eyes fixed on the road before him . 2 Exterior : Poplar Lodge Driveway , Day Vincent turns into a driveway past a wooden gate and a small sign on a post that reads POPLAR LODGE 3 Exterior : Poplar Lodge Grounds , Day He pauses for a moment on the driveway to look at the lodge . We see it as Vincent sees it . The drive is flanked by clumps of rose of Sharon bushes . The building itself is set far back behind beautifully landscaped grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . The main building is three stories in height , with wide , screened porches on three sides , from which broad steps descend to the drive . It is an old Gothic structure , full of bays and towers and long dormers , surmounted by a slate mansard roof . Its many windows are barred with heavy diagonal wire netting . On both sides are several auxiliary buildings . 4 Exterior : The Grounds , Day He resumes his walk down the stone steps to the grassy avenue that leads to the main building . Off to the right  --  3  --  sits a man in a soft tweed jacket who is reading a book on one of the stone benches on the side of the lane . &nbsp; VINCENTHi . The man smiles shyly , returning his eyes hurriedly to the pages of his book . Vincent continues on , and the man closes the book to watch him as he walks toward the veranda . Section Details 5 Interior : Second-Floor Room , Day A young woman is watching Vincent 's approach through the wire grate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silken blond hair that cascades over her shoulders , and her fingers as they rest in the diamond-shaped pattern of the grid . 6 Exterior : Main Building , Day Vincent climbs the steps of the veranda and enters the porch through the tall , glass-paneled doors . The light reaches in and penetrates the porch in a curiously oblique manner , so that the lodge seems always to be illumined from without . Heavy greenery can be seen hanging from the walls , and a row of wicker chairs gives the impression of a silent sun deck on some ancient liner . Just inside the doors Vincent meets a woman on her way out . He is obviously asking directions during the brief moment they stand together . The woman points toward the right rear of the lodge , and Vincent nods in thanks and goes off in that direction . 7 Exterior : Occupational Therapy Barn , Day Bea Brice is just opening the doors to the barn as Vincent approaches . She wears a man 's work shirt over her skirt , and is carrying a book and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door the book slips to the ground . Vincent hastens to retrieve it for her .  --  4  --  &nbsp; BEAOh ! Thank you . &nbsp; VINCENTYes , can you tell me where I can find a Miss Brice ? &nbsp; BEAThat 's me . &nbsp; VINCENT ( takes out an envelope from coat pocket ) . I 'm looking for . . . This letter . &nbsp; BEAOh . Please come in . Vincent follows Bea into the O.T . Barn , trying not to look too closely at the few patients there at work on the electric drills , lathes , and potter 's wheels which fill the room . &nbsp; BEAWo n't you sit down ? Would you like some coffee ? &nbsp; VINCENTYes , thank you . &nbsp; BEAHow do you take it ? &nbsp; VINCENTBlack . He sits at a table and waits for Bea to pour the coffee and look over a chart held out to her by a white-smocked therapist . Then she sits down and takes out his letter of application from a manila folder . &nbsp; BEAWell , we can begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my telling you all about us . Which would you rather do ? &nbsp; VINCENTMaybe I 'd better tell you about me . Then you might not want to bother with the rest . &nbsp; BEA ( laughs politely ) . All right . &nbsp; VINCENTWell , there 's not really very much to tell . I been out of the army for a while . I guess I never had a job that I was really interested in . &nbsp; BEAYou live here in Stonemount , do n't you ? &nbsp; VINCENTI 've lived here all my life . I was always kind of curious about this place . &nbsp; BEAWhy ?  --  5  --  &nbsp; VINCENTI do n't know . I guess I just was . &nbsp; BEAAre you interested in a permanent job , or just summer work ? &nbsp; VINCENTNo , I want a permanent job . I want to do some kind of work where I can be a direct help to people . And . . . that 's why I decided to come . Dissolve to : Section Details 8 Interior : Fourth-floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense , fearful , stare dumbly at the two new visitors , Vincent and Bea . The fourth floor to which they have come is divided by a wide corridor running down its center , from which the patients ' rooms , five on each side , open off . These rooms have no doors and are completely unfurnished except for a cot and a locked wardrobe . Each has a single uncurtained window , barred with steel wire . At the end of the hall are the heavy metal doors of two isolation rooms , each with a small observation window at its top . 9 Interior : Fourth-floor Observation Window , Day Vincent and Bea stare silently through the observation window . 10 Interior : Isolation Room , Day Through the window we see a young woman seated on the floor beside her cot . The sheets have been torn apart . Her eyes are open and fixed on a spot somewhere on the ceiling . She makes no other movement . She is catatonic. 11 Interior : Fourth-floor Corridor , Day He turns away from the window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bea follows , locking the metal  --  6  --  door behind her . A chubby young girl , Miss Glassman , sways coquettishly in an open doorway , giggling at Vincent . They pass by the patients milling about in the hallway . A woman steps forward , as if she were going to embrace Vincent , but the muscled arm of a male attendant restrains her . Another woman leans over the banister and spits at Vincent as he descends the stairs . &nbsp; FEMALE PATIENTBastard. 12 Interior : Third Floor , Day There is a sound of a piano playing somewhere as they walk down the corridor for the male patients . It is lined with bridge tables and wicker chairs . Some patients play checkers . Others read . Some stare at their hands . Suddenly a huge , looming figure of a man emerges from an open door and mechanically matches his pace to Bea and Vincent 's . Sensing his presence , Bea puts a hand on Vincent 's shoulder , and turns to face him . &nbsp; BEAAh , Vincent ? I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly . &nbsp; VINCENTHello . &nbsp; BEAThis is Mr. Bruce . Mr. Palakis ' long arms remain glued to his sides . A wide smile creases his face as he stares at Vincent . He continues to smile until an aide turns him around and leads him away . They continue on to the stairs . &nbsp; BEAIt 's not as disturbing on this floor , is it ? Somehow , insanity seems a lot less sinister to watch in a man than in a woman , does n't it ? I thought it best to show you the worst first . 13 Interior : Second-floor Common Room , Day The patients ' common room contains an old upright piano , a writing desk , bridge tables , playing boards , and racks of  --  7  --  tattered magazines . It is now about three o'clock in the afternoon and the room is illuminated with a soft golden glow from the afternoon sunlight . A warm silence prevails there , broken only by the creak of a wicker chair or an idle comment relating to a game . The patients who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is Mrs. Meaghan . She is a slight , fastidious , Latin-looking woman in her middle thirties , with very fine features . She looks up from her game of solitaire to note the entrance of Bea and Vincent . As Bea leaves momentarily to speak to another patient , Vincent wanders past Mrs. Meaghan to gaze out the window . An elderly man with a thin beard , looking very much like a character out of Chekov , looks up from his book and addresses him in a peremptory tone of voice . &nbsp; BEARDED MANHey ! Young man . Are you a new patient ? &nbsp; VINCENTNo , no . I 'm just a visitor . I may go to work here . &nbsp; BEARDED MANTell me , have you read Dostoevski ? &nbsp; VINCENTI 've read Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov . &nbsp; BEARDED MANOh , have you ? Do you believe it ? Do you believe that there is no God ? That there can be no such thing as virtue ? &nbsp; VINCENT ( shrugs ) . No . Do you ? &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you come and work here . We shall be very great friends . &nbsp; VINCENTI hope so . Bea returns , smiling warmly , and they leave . 14 Exterior : The Veranda , Afternoon They walk slowly together down the steps of the veranda and across the lawn toward the O.T . Barn .  --  8  --  &nbsp; BEAYou handled that very well . Have you done a lot of reading ? &nbsp; VINCENTOnly when I was in the army , where you have nothing but time . . . It 's a lot different from a state institution ? &nbsp; BEAYes . Most of these people come from very wealthy families . They pay seven thousand dollars a month to keep them here . Suddenly we hear the staccato giggle of Miss Glassman . She is leaning over the railing of the balcony above , accompanied by the male attendant . &nbsp; MISS GLASSMANHi , Miss Brice . Are you going to have lunch now ? It 's a nice day , is n't it , Miss Brice ? I hope you have a nice lunch , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giggles again ) It certainly is a nice day , is n't it , Miss Brice ? &nbsp; BEAYes , Miss Glassman . It 's a lovely day . It is evident in her warm , responsive smile that she cares for the patients . 15 Interior : Window with Wire Netting , Afternoon The young woman with the long blond hair is still at her window . She watches Bea and Vincent cross the lawn . 16 Exterior : Front Lawn , Afternoon They stand together under the canopy of the refreshment stand erected in the middle of the lawn . &nbsp; BEAIt 's terrible pay , and long hours . It 's dirty , often degrading . Sometimes dangerous . &nbsp; VINCENTDo you know why you work here ? Maybe I should n't ask you that . &nbsp; BEANo , that 's all right . That 's something that all of us who work here have to ask ourselves and we 're better off if we  --  9  --  can answer it as honestly and as thoroughly as possible . I hope you will too . A nurse approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEAThink about it this evening . If you do n't change your mind , I 'll see you in the morning . The nurse throws the coat around Bea 's shoulders , and they walk off . Section Details 17 Exterior : Stonemount , Afternoon It is raining as Vincent trots across Main Street on his way to the bus stop . He passes by the auction house and the hardware store and stops underneath the canopy of the town 's music shop . Then he sees Laura . She has just come out of a nearby grocery store . She is a young woman , not conventionally pretty , who gives off the impression that she is warm and sincere . She spots Vincent through the leaves of her umbrella , and walks over to him . They shake hands . &nbsp; LAURAHi . &nbsp; VINCENTHow are ya ? &nbsp; LAURAFine , how are you ? I heard you were back . &nbsp; VINCENTYeah . I 've been back for a while . &nbsp; LAURAThey told me you were wounded or something . &nbsp; VINCENTYeah . Or something . Gee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . ( Peers anxiously over her shoulder ) Did you get my letter ? &nbsp; VINCENTYes . How 's your husband ? &nbsp; LAURAHe 's very well , thanks . He 's working with the electric power company right now . He 's hoping to be made office manager next fall .  --  10  --  &nbsp; VINCENTRight here in town ? &nbsp; LAURAYes . ( Pause ) In all your letters to me , Vincent , you never once mentioned anything about us , or our future . &nbsp; VINCENTDid n't I ? &nbsp; LAURANo . And since we really never had an understanding of a romantic nature . . . ( Looks around ) There 's my bus . I hope you come and visit us sometime , Vincent . I 'd like you to meet Norman . That 's my husband . &nbsp; VINCENTI will , I will . She waves to him as she hurries across the street toward the idling bus . He watches her leave , then steps back underneath the canopy to gaze into the plate-glass window of the music shop . Through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been tacked up there since Vincent 's boyhood . Then , over the pages of " For Me and My Gal " and " If I Had My Way , " we see , superimposed , the figure of the young , fresh-faced Laura that he knew before his years in the army . A bus grates to a stop and shakes him out of his reverie , and he races to catch it . Dissolve to : Section Details 18 Interior : Vincent 's Home , Night Vincent 's grandmother , a small , plump , sweet-faced old lady with soft white hair framing a gentle visage , places her plate of soup on the lace table spread , and joins Vincent at the dining table . They sit for a while in silence while Vincent toys with his soup and assesses his thoughts . &nbsp; VINCENTI can have the job if I want it . &nbsp; GRANDMOTHERDo you ? &nbsp; VINCENTYeah . &nbsp; GRANDMOTHERYou 've had no training .  --  11  --  &nbsp; VINCENTThey 'll train me . &nbsp; GRANDMOTHERI want the very best for you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VINCENTNothing to be ashamed about . Workin ' in an insane asylum . There 's nothing wrong with curing sick people . Or is there , Grandma ? She avoids his eyes , not knowing what to say . Vincent pushes his chair back and heads for the stairs . &nbsp; VINCENTI 'm goin ' up . &nbsp; GRANDMOTHER ( follows him to the foot of the stairs ) . If your poor mother knew about this job , I think she 'd be very happy . Dissolve to : 19 Interior : Vincent 's Room , Night We see an elaborate silver frame in which Vincent keeps a photograph of his mother . It is a picture of her as she looked as a young woman . Across her white silk blouse there is the inscription : " For little Vincent . . . Love , Mother . " Vincent himself is on his bed , fully clothed , drinking beer out of cans and watching television . All around him on the walls are the things he put up as a boy and has n't bothered to take down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model airplane . He is watching a documentary about World War II pieced together from captured Japanese war footage . Fighter planes swoop downward and strafe civilians fleeing on the ground .

A company of Japanese soldiers are shown ripping apart an American flag . &nbsp; NARRATOROver the bodies of wounded and dying men . . . A machine gun fires .

Learn the marginal rules . And kind of generally orient yourself to the hospital . 21 Interior : Mrs. Meaghan 's Bedroom , Morning Mrs. Meaghan is seated in her chair by the window , reading . A knock is heard . &nbsp; MRS . MEAGHANCome in . &nbsp; CLAYFIELDGood morning . &nbsp; MRS . MEAGHANGood morning . &nbsp; CLAYFIELDI thought you might like to meet Mr. Bruce . He 's the new O.T .

MEAGHANI should enjoy playing cards for a while , if you have the time . ( Opens her book ) I 'll be out in a little while . Clayfield taps Vincent on the shoulder , and they leave . 22 Exterior : Balcony , Morning Through the wire webbing of Lilith 's bedroom window . We see a young man , Steven Evshevsky , at the railing of the balcony , peering through his horn-rimmed glasses at the window . He pays no attention to the game of ping-pong going on before him . 23 Exterior : Balcony , Morning Vincent sits at a wicker table with Clayfield , shuffling cards , awaiting Mrs. Meaghan . He is watching Steven when Mrs. Meaghan makes her appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a chair . &nbsp; VINCENTCan I deal ? &nbsp; MRS . MEAGHANYes . Cut please . She picks up the pack and deals out the cards .

He listens to her studiously . 25 Exterior : Balcony , Morning Mrs. Meaghan drops her hand of cards and looks at Vincent . &nbsp; MRS . MEAGHANShe plays quite nicely , does n't she ? She made it herself . Quite remarkable , is n't it ? Vincent has no reply . His eyes are on Steven , who seems nervous , agitated . &nbsp; STEVENStop playing .

The players toss down their racquets and go inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEVENI understand you 've restricted her playing to certain hours ? I think that 's monstrous . &nbsp; CLAYFIELDIt was a staff decision . Some of the patients complained , I believe . &nbsp; STEVENMonstrous ! Steven turns and walks over to the end of the balcony , to observe her window again . &nbsp; MRS . MEAGHANI do n't feel like playing cards any more . She throws down her cards and hurries toward her room . &nbsp; CLAYFIELD ( following her ) . I 'll be back in a minute . Only Vincent and Steven are left on the balcony . After some thought , Vincent gets up and strolls over to the ping-pong table . &nbsp; VINCENTYou want to play ?  --  15  --  &nbsp; STEVEN ( with an agreeable smile ) . Yes , thank you .

Patients and aides stand around , waiting to go . &nbsp; BEAVincent , try and get her down , will you ? He walks toward the lodge . 28 Interior : The Lodge , Morning He goes through the library to the porch , where he sees Lilith seated at a table . She seems to be dozing . Quietly he takes a seat at a nearby table , waits for her to turn her head toward him . At last she does . &nbsp; LILITHAre we going on a picnic ? He nods . She smiles , gets up at once , and leaves with him to go outside . 29 Exterior : The Driveway , Morning Through Lilith 's window : she strides across the driveway , past Bea and the other aides , and steps into a black sedan .

Steven accepts the burden happily , and the three of them turn to catch up with the group . 31 Exterior : Bridge over Canal , Day The group crosses a bridge that spans a lock . The water here is calm . White ducks paddle peacefully toward the stone banks on the far shore . The reflection of the bridge and the sun in the dark , wavy water seems to excite Lilith . She looks behind her at Vincent to see if he too is enjoying the water . 32 Exterior : Bank of the Canal , Day As they continue along the side of the canal , the tripod slips out of Steven 's hands .

It boils and churns under the bridge , then slides and plummets toward the granite boulders downstream . Lilith moves from side to side of the bridge , childlike , fascinated . All at once she leans over the railing and spits into the roaring foam . Steven laughs softly at her , with a strange , primitive sound of delight . Then Lilith laughs too , openly , joyously . The laughter spreads spontaneously among the other patients . Seeing them all laughing together on the bridge in the hot sun , Vincent is forced to recall that they are all patients , all quite mad . Dissolve to :  --  18  --  34 Exterior : Cloud-covered Sky , Afternoon There is thunder , and a hard rain darkens the boulders in the river . 35 Exterior : Riverbank , Afternoon The heavy rain forces the group to take shelter . Lilith , already drenched , stands with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great boulder . The ground , strewn with shattered boulders , slate , and the rotting trunks of trees , descends almost vertically from the shelf to the river below . The rest of the group is farther up the slope , across the dirt road in the pine-covered picnic site . 36 Exterior : Picnic Grounds , Afternoon Bob Clayfield leaps across a mud puddle in the road to help several patients in out of the rain . They huddle under a pine tree together . Vincent , who has climbed to the top of the slope , stands on a rock across the road and shouts across to Clayfield . &nbsp; VINCENTShould I bring them back ? &nbsp; CLAYFIELDNo . Stay where you are until it lets up . 37 Exterior : Rock Shelf , Afternoon Vincent makes his way down the steep slope and rejoins Steven and Lilith on the shelf . &nbsp; VINCENTHe said we can stay . He spreads a blanket , and Lilith drops immediately to her haunches , her canvas on her lap . She reaches for a cluster of pokeweed berries , crushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fibers on her canvas , making cloudy masses in different tones . The stamens of the wild flags she has collected that day she uses like pencils , touching  --  19  --  their tufts of pollen to her pad , then brushing them with her finger tip to produce points of scattered yellow . It is the tumbling , churning river that she paints . Vincent , seated on a rock , and Steven , with his radio crackling in the background , look on in amazement . &nbsp; STEVEN ( bending down beside her ) . I never knew you could paint like that . Simply with grasses and things of that kind . &nbsp; LILITHThey fade . But there are no colors like them while they last . &nbsp; STEVENI 'd like to paint . Or do anything like that . How do you begin ? What is it that you do ? &nbsp; LILITHI do n't do anything . My hand just moves and I follow it . &nbsp; STEVENAh , that 's it . Your hand moves . Mine does n't .

I know their grammar . But you 've invented one of your own ; that is the greatest gift . &nbsp; LILITHI did not invent it . It was taught to me by my people . &nbsp; STEVENYou actually hear it , then ? I mean you actually hear them speaking it ? I 'm fascinated by languages , you know . Do you think they would speak it to me ? Or perhaps you would teach me ? &nbsp; LILITHNo , I would n't be allowed to teach you , unless it were approved . It 's a language that very few are permitted to speak .  --  20  --  &nbsp; STEVENBut what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could persuade them ? We see the rain-swollen thick bands of water thundering below . &nbsp; LILITHYou would have to demonstrate great courage , and great capacity for joy . &nbsp; STEVENOh , but I can , I can .

She picks up a wet leaf and holds it out to Steven . &nbsp; LILITHEat this then . &nbsp; STEVENOh , they might make me sick . It could be poisonous . Grinning impishly , she stuffs the leaf in her mouth and chews on it . Vincent steps toward her , his arm outstretched . &nbsp; VINCENTDo n't do that . Lilith laughs and dances away from him . &nbsp; LILITHDid I make you angry , Mr. Bruce ? &nbsp; VINCENTRight . They might be poisonous . &nbsp; LILITHWould n't hurt me if it is .

If I learn to trust my hands , will they really lead me to things I love ? She nods , yes , and massages his hand , and it opens , then  --  21  --  moves to stroke the strands of her hair . Vincent looks away , embarrassed by their tenderness . The rain has stopped . He climbs up the hill to see what the others are doing . As he does Lilith and Steven move forward together down the slope toward the river . 38 Exterior : Picnic Grounds , Afternoon The group is folding blankets , preparing to leave . &nbsp; CLAYFIELDVincent , c'm on .

Trying to get closer and closer , he climbs over the edge of the slab , but loses his footing against the crumbling rocks . Far above Lilith watches him clinging to the edge of shelf , unmoved , as if she were dreaming . Vincent rushes down the slope after them . He comes up next to Lilith . There is fear in his face as he peers down at Steven . 40 Exterior : Riverbank , Afternoon From Lilith 's point of view : we see Vincent edge out over the rock slab , grab Steven 's arm , and pull him to safety . Steven scrabbles up the slippery rock cliff , followed by Vincent . Lilith stands there , saying nothing , then turns to follow them up the hill .

You do n't suppose she 's ill ? &nbsp; VINCENTOh no , I do n't think so . ( Stops and faces Steven ) Of course , I think you ought to realize that it would n't be quite right for me to act as a go-between . &nbsp; STEVENOh , I understand . Yes . I beg your pardon . I hope you were n't offended . But I thought you 'd understand my being anxious . &nbsp; VINCENTI do . When I see her I 'll tell her that you asked about her . &nbsp; STEVENWill you ? It 's very kind of you . I did n't mean to embarrass you , Mr. Bruce . But you see , it means a great deal to me . &nbsp; VINCENTI know . &nbsp; STEVENI suppose you think it 's rather foolish , rather absurd , this attachment of mine . &nbsp; VINCENTNo , I do n't think there 's anything foolish about it . &nbsp; STEVENYou do n't ? Not even under these grotesque conditions ? Vincent does n't answer . &nbsp; STEVENStill , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish thing . She is so proud , you know , such a delicate creature . And yet she allowed me to touch her hair for a moment . You saw that she allowed me ? He nods , begrudgingly . &nbsp; STEVENYou see , I really have nothing else to live for . Dissolve to : 45 Exterior : Veranda , Day Vincent looks up for a moment to watch Lilith , far off , strolling casually with a male patient .  --  25  --  Dissolve to : Section Details 46 Interior : Staff Lecture Room , Day The entire staff is collected around a table to hear Dr. Lavrier , Poplar Lodge 's chief psychiatrist , deliver a lecture . &nbsp; DR . LAVRIERSome of these people have such extraordinary minds , such extraordinary sensibilities . Too extraordinary , I think , sometimes . This is all just scientific theory . . . maybe it 's romantic . . . but I often compare them to fine crystal which has been shattered by the shock of some intolerable revelation . I often had a feeling when I talked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instrument . They had been close to some extreme , something absolute , and then blasted by it . As though they 'd been destroyed , one might say , by their own excellence . Regarded in this way , they are the heroes of the universe , its finest product and its noblest casualty . Schizophrenia , however , is far from being an exclusive affliction of superior minds . As a matter of fact , by using a substance from the blood of humans , schizophrenia has been induced in dogs , spiders , as well as men . Dr. Lavrier nods to Clayfield . The lights are turned off , and photographic slides of spiders ' webs are projected onto a screen . &nbsp; DR . LAVRIERAs you will note , the webs of most " normal " spider species are as distinctive and invariable as their coloring . The slide is changed , and a tangled , patterned web is shown . &nbsp; DR . LAVRIERBut the " mad " ones spin out fantastic , asymmetrical , and rather nightmarish designs . A most unsettling fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence at the screen .  --  26  --  Section Details 47 Interior : Lilith 's Room , Day Vincent 's eyes travel over the curious things in Lilith 's room : we see her easel , her cluttered desk , the various instruments and plants on her shelf , her loom , and the inscription " Hiara Pirlu Resh Kavawn " painted in black on her wall . Lilith herself is seated at her desk , studying his face . &nbsp; VINCENTWhat language is that ? &nbsp; LILITHIt 's mine . &nbsp; VINCENTYou have your own language ? She nods . His head drops . He searches for something to say . Sensing his uneasiness , she smiles at him , then moves to a new seat on the edge of her bed . &nbsp; LILITHWhy did you come here ? &nbsp; VINCENTI needed a job . &nbsp; LILITHYou could get a job in a butcher shop , grocery store , gas station . ( He shrugs , agreeing with her ) You were in the army . Were you a hero ? ( He shakes his head : no ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for excitement ? &nbsp; VINCENTThat 's not it . &nbsp; LILITHAdventure ? &nbsp; VINCENTI 'm not an adventurer . &nbsp; LILITHI think you are . &nbsp; VINCENTWhy ? &nbsp; LILITHYou 're ill at ease . Adventurous people are always a little ill at ease . They are n't bold the way people think they are . They go stumbling around , breaking things , being scolded , always looking for a place where they feel they belong . They have that crooked look . &nbsp; VINCENTCrooked look ?  --  27  --  &nbsp; LILITHOf not really matching anything . She continues to scrutinize him until at last he has to look away . &nbsp; LILITH ( lightly ) . I 'd like to go for a walk now . 48 Interior : Common Room , Day Mrs. Meaghan looks up expectantly as Lilith enters the common room . Her presence seems to excite her , and when Lilith holds her crystal up to the light pouring through the windows , she smiles delightedly . Lilith returns her smile , happy to share in her pleasure . It is only when Vincent approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . Dissolve to : 49 Exterior : Front Lawn , Late Afternoon Vincent and Lilith are together on the grass . Vincent 's jacket hangs on a croquet mallet stand . Lilith sits on her knees , her dress spread out around her . &nbsp; LILITHI did n't think they 'd let me go out on any more trips after the picnic . &nbsp; VINCENTWell , they got some pretty smart people here . &nbsp; LILITHMy people punished me . &nbsp; VINCENTHow ? What did they do to you ? &nbsp; LILITHThey wept . That 's how they always punish me . They come and kneel at my bed and sob . Have you ever heard someone you loved weeping ? &nbsp; VINCENT ( pauses ) . Sometimes I hear my mother cry . &nbsp; LILITHDo you ? Is she unhappy ? &nbsp; VINCENTNot now . At least I hope not .  --  28  --  &nbsp; LILITHWhat was your mother like ? She looks at him openly , compassionately . He can not find the words to answer her . So he takes his jacket and walks off toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Day Lilith smiling at Vincent through the blossoms of a rose of Sharon bush . Dissolve to : 51 Exterior : The Grounds , Day They are seated under a tree . Lilith wiggles her fingers , making flickering shadows on the grass . Her smile fades ; her fingers stop moving and the shadow is still . &nbsp; LILITHHands lie so still in death . 52 Exterior : The Grounds , Day Vincent 's hand pushes open a wrought-iron gate . Her hand reaches out and covers his . &nbsp; LILITHYou 've killed with these hands . &nbsp; VINCENTThat 's the burden of a soldier . &nbsp; LILITHYou must love your god a great deal to kill for him and still go on loving him . God never asks that of another . God only asks you to enjoy . Dissolve to : 53 Exterior : Pond , Early Morning A shadowy reflection , rippling in the water . It is of Lilith , with her dress pulled up above her knees . Slowly she bends down and kisses her own reflected image .  --  29  --  &nbsp; LILITHLook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's lovely . My kisses kill her . She is like all of them ; it destroys them to be loved . She looks at Vincent , who is watching her from the shore . &nbsp; LILITHCan I go further ? She wades off through the water into a cloud of morning mist that envelops her . Vincent moves through the brush along the bank . &nbsp; VINCENTLilith ? Lilith ? Suddenly her face emerges out of the thick mist . &nbsp; LILITHYou called me Lilith . Dissolve to : 54 Interior : Lilith 's Room , Day Lilith is bent over her loom , threading the strands of her hair through the warp . &nbsp; VINCENTWell , at least that will be a very unusual kind of cloth . &nbsp; LILITHYes . You think it 's beautiful ? &nbsp; VINCENTYes . Are you going to cut your hair ? &nbsp; LILITHYes . There are some scissors there on the table . Will you hand them to me ? &nbsp; VINCENTNo . &nbsp; LILITHYou wo n't ? What will you do , then ? Leave me chained here by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set you free . He brings the scissors and starts to pry loose her hair , working carefully in order not to tear any . &nbsp; LILITHThis was to be a present for you . A throw for your bed . I made it especially for you to make you dream . You 're very gentle . I 'm glad you 're not leaving . I think  --  30  --  you do a great deal of good here . I think the patients trust you . It would be very foolish if you were to leave . He looks up from his work , puzzled by her words . Dissolve to : Section Details 55 Interior : Dr. Lavrier 's Office , Day Dr. Lavrier looks up from the reports on his desk to confront the troubled face of Vincent , now seated across from him . Bea is perched on a window seat , listening intently to the conversation . &nbsp; VINCENTThese reports of mine : they 're not completely accurate . They 're factual , but they do n't express what really happens . &nbsp; DR . LAVRIERYou feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these reports indicate ? &nbsp; VINCENTYes . &nbsp; DR . LAVRIERAre you disturbed about it ? Vincent indicates that he is . &nbsp; DR . LAVRIERLet me put it quite candidly : do you feel she 's trying to seduce you ? &nbsp; VINCENTWell , it 's not that simple . You could call it that , but it 's not just a physical thing . It 's much more than that . I 'm not sure what it is that she 's trying out , sir . Almost like she wants to share this magical little world of hers , and . . . I do n't know . Does that all sound strange to you ? &nbsp; DR LAVRIERNo . That does n't sound strange . It is n't unknown , you know , for patients to seduce personnel . And vice versa , unfortunately . Vincent laughs a bit , nervously . &nbsp; DR . LAVRIERDo you ever feel inclined to accept ?  --  31  --  &nbsp; VINCENTYes . Yes , sometimes I do . And I . . . I do n't really think that Lilith is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think she is . She 's got some . . . some kind of . . . &nbsp; DR . LAVRIERRapture ? &nbsp; VINCENTWhat was the word ? &nbsp; DR . LAVRIERRapture . &nbsp; VINCENTRapture . That 's a very good word . &nbsp; DR . LAVRIERYes , it is a very good word . In Shakespeare 's time it meant " madness . " As the words " ecstasy " and " innocence " often did . I think all of us here are concerned with rapture in some way . And when a man devotes himself to studying the nature of rapture , he may find himself dispossessed by it . That 's one of the risks we take . Did she ever talk to you about her delusion ? &nbsp; VINCENTYeah . I mean . . . &nbsp; DR . LAVRIERIn any case , it 's seldom possible to tell what 's fantasy and what is fact . Has she ever spoken to you about her family ? &nbsp; VINCENTNo . &nbsp; DR . LAVRIERShe had a brother who was killed accidentally in a fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never tried to question her . &nbsp; DR . LAVRIEROh well , I would n't . It 's apt to be disastrous . &nbsp; VINCENTHow long did you say she 's been here ? &nbsp; DR . LAVRIERSince she was eighteen . &nbsp; VINCENTWell , what do think are the chances ? &nbsp; DR . LAVRIERVery small . Still , you never can tell . She 's been doing very well lately . I 'm particularly pleased with the influence you seem to have had on her . This is a girl  --  32  --  who 's had no contact with any world except her own . I think you 're doing a damn good job . . . It 's a very small chance that we 're talking about . Dissolve to : Section Details 56 Exterior : Bicycle Shed , Day Vincent fumbles with the chains that bind the bicycles to the rack . Lilith stands beside him . On her face is a smile that is a mixture of amusement and contempt . &nbsp; LILITHYou saw Dr. Lavrier last week , did n't you ? Did you talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you say ? ( He is silent ) Tell me . &nbsp; VINCENTYou think I should , huh ? She nods her head , saying yes . &nbsp; VINCENTYou think I would ? &nbsp; LILITHI 've made all kinds of stories for him . About my childhood . &nbsp; VINCENTYou think he believes them ? &nbsp; LILITHHe 'll believe anything about me . Except that I 'm happy . That 's all he 's good for : inventions and confessions . I 'm sure he 'd love to hear some of yours . They start to wheel the bikes toward the road . &nbsp; VINCENTWhat would I tell him ? &nbsp; LILITHDo n't you know ? 57 Exterior : Bicycle Path , Day As they wheel their bicycles toward the front gate , Steven appears . &nbsp; STEVENExcuse me . Good morning , Miss Arthur . I 'm making  --  33  --  something for you . In the shop . They told me next week was your birthday , and I wanted to give you something . I wonder if I should tell you . Still , I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending a lot of time on it . It should be finished in a day or two . Lilith listens to him disinterestedly , her lips playing with a shock of her hair . &nbsp; STEVENAre you going bicycling ? It 's a lovely day for it . May I come with you ? &nbsp; VINCENTSorry . Maybe we can do it another time . &nbsp; STEVENThat 's very disappointing . The two mount their bicycles and pedal off , leaving Steven staring after them through his thick-rimmed glasses . Dissolve to : 58 Exterior : Stonemount , Day The two bicycles make a wobbly turn around a corner of a residential steet in the town of Stonemount. 59 Exterior : Stonemount Street , Day Laura , on her way to her house , stops to watch Vincent and Lilith bicycle by . Dissolve to : 60 Exterior : The Canal , Day In the placid , leaf-covered water we see the reflection of Vincent and Lilith ; they seem to be racing . Lilith speeds around a turn and the bicycle spins out from beneath her , sending her crashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and runs to her . Bending over her he notices the bruises on her face and some blood on her hand . She  --  34  --  pulls at his hand , placing it on top of her breast , holding it there . &nbsp; LILITHTell me now , please . Tell me . Do n't you think I do n't know how you suffer ? Oh , I do . I know how terrible it is to love and not be able to confess your love . But tell me now . I ca n't stand it , I ca n't stand it any longer . &nbsp; VINCENTIt 's a bad cut . We 're gon na have to go back . She reaches forward with her bleeding hand and angrily runs it across his face , smearing blood on his cheek . She groans , and does it again . He stops her only by gripping her wrist . Then he lets go and walks toward his bicycle , wiping the blood off his face with a handkerchief . &nbsp; LILITHYou 've got blood on your face . You feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; VINCENTLilith , I 've never been able to do anything worth-while in my life . I wish you would help me do this one thing well .

Barn , Night &nbsp; THERAPISTWell , how does everybody feel today ? Patients and staff are seated on chairs and on the floor in a giant circle . Most are too shy to speak , or bored , as Lilith seems to be . Miss Glassman , seated next to the sober-faced Steven , giggles openly at the therapist 's mannered question . &nbsp; THERAPISTDoes n't anyone have anything to say ? Miss Merrygold , you 've just come back to us . Is n't there anything you 'd like to say ? Miss Glassman 's strident giggle shatters the atmosphere in the room . Other patients join her , and their laughter drowns out Miss Merrygold 's meek response .  --  35  --  &nbsp; MISS GLASSMANMerrygold ! &nbsp; THERAPISTWhy are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us ? &nbsp; MISS GLASSMANIt 's just . . . Miss Merrygold . . . It 's so funny . &nbsp; THERAPISTAmigo , you said you have something on your mind to tell the group . How about it ? We see a woman fondling a doll on her breast , rocking gently . Another plays with her hands , as if she were knitting . Amigo , a young man in a pullover sweater , steps into the center of the circle , stretching the muscles of his back , preparing his body and his mind for his performance . &nbsp; AMIGODid you ever see a dancer that smoked ? I do n't want it any more . I do n't know why . I was born to do it . I was born to move . I was born to be free . I was born to express , to create . He dances as he speaks , flailing his arms , twisting his torso to punctuate his words . He provokes others to watch him , staff as well as patients . But to Lilith the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at the floor , impatiently waiting for the session to conclude . &nbsp; AMIGOI got nothing left any more . I 'm drained . I do . I do , I know , love . But it seems to be that that love I have I can easily hate . Destroy . Because it seems like it is going to possess me . Levitt , the bearded student of Dostoevski , angrily rises and confronts Amigo . &nbsp; LEVITTWho gives you the right to destroy anything ? Who the hell gives you the right to destroy anything ? &nbsp; AMIGONobody gave me the right . I chose the right . &nbsp; LEVITTYou have no such right . You have no right to destroy the right that God gave you . It belongs to all of us . &nbsp; AMIGOI do n't accept that . It 's my gift . I do with it as I see fit .  --  36  --  &nbsp; LEVITTWho do you think you are ? How dare you take such a prerogative into your own hands ? &nbsp; AMIGOReally ? &nbsp; LEVITTYeah , yeah . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to herself . &nbsp; LEVITTIt is for us to decide whether you have a right to destroy something . &nbsp; AMIGOIt 's not for you to judge anything . &nbsp; LEVITTWhat you lack is a sense of reality . Mrs. Meiser lifts her harsh , age-creased face and stares incredulously at Levitt . &nbsp; MRS . MEISERWhat 's so wonderful about reality ? Miss Glassman falls over backward , laughing hysterically . Mrs. Meiser looks pleased ; she has hurt someone . Her face becomes grotesque as she laughs , a picture of hate and mockery . Suddenly Lilith darts from her seat and runs to the door , like a prisoner escaping . Vincent , in the role of responsible therapist , rushes after her . 62 Exterior : O.T .

Section Details 66 Exterior : Barnsville Fairgrounds , Day Blaring band music and the pounding of horse hoofs are heard as we see a small ring , suspended in an iron clip , snapped into the air by the point of a lance . The lancers , dressed in makeshift medieval costumes , spur their horses down the dirt track , making practice stabs at the target rings . Lilith and Vincent mill with the crowd watching the horsemen . Her face glows with excitement . Everything , the children keeping time to the band 's martial rhythms , the girls in high-peaked hats and Flemish costumes seated on the judges ' platform , the wooden poles wrapped in red and blue crepe paper , attracts her eyes . &nbsp; LILITHIt 's like another time and place . Knights and lances . Vincent stands behind her , his hand on her shoulder . Horsemen continue to gallop down the track .  --  39  --  &nbsp; VINCENTIt 's a very , very old custom brought over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to knock each other off the horses , we spear at those rings . &nbsp; LILITHWe ? &nbsp; VINCENTI used to do this before I was in the service . You know , as a kid . &nbsp; LILITHWere you any good at it ? &nbsp; VINCENTPretty good . They begin to move with the crowd toward the rest of the fairgrounds . The pageantry gives way to the traditional sounds of merry-go-round calliopes and Ferris wheels . He buys her a cone of cotton candy . Then she points to a small doll at a vendor 's stand , and he buys that too . They move easily through the crowd , he with his popcorn , she with her candy and baby doll . 67 Exterior : Punch and Judy Show , Day Lilith 's face pops up amid a group of wide-eyed children watching Punch and Judy in one of their eternal battles . Vincent reaches over their heads and gently leads her away .

Could n't you just let me have a tiny piece ? &nbsp; OLDER BOY ( takes out his ice pick ) Yes ma'am .  --  40  --  &nbsp; LILITHLet me do it . She crouches down beside the tub and hacks at the floating ice . Vincent walks on a few paces , impatient , anxious to move along . Lilith slips the ice chip into her mouth . &nbsp; LILITHIt 's like a diamond . &nbsp; OLDER BOYYes ma'am . &nbsp; YOUNGER BOYShe swallowed a diamond ! &nbsp; OLDER BOYIt 'd cut her all up inside if it was .

( Touches the veins of his temple ) It 's blue . The older boy allows himself to be caressed , swallowing hard . Then he stands straight up , as if to make an end of it . &nbsp; LILITHI do n't have any money . Ca n't pay you for the diamond . Shall I give you a kiss instead ? &nbsp; OLDER BOYYes ma'am . She draws the boy down to her , kissing him gently on the lips , then more sensually along his neck , on his cheek . We see her lips moving . She is whispering something to the boy . His head snaps back at what he hears .  --  41  --  &nbsp; LILITHGoodbye . It was delicious . She ambles off , swinging her cotton candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older boy staring at the ground , struck by her words and the feel of her lips .

Happily , she reaches through the crossbeams and affixes it to his saddle . &nbsp; LILITHBlue and gold . Vincent urges the palomino to step backward , then kicks  --  42  --  him into a gallop around the corral . He returns to the gate that Howie and Lilith have opened for him , very much in control of his mount , his horse prancing nobly toward the file of horsemen waiting for the tournament to begin . Lilith starts to run after him , but stops short . She has forgotten her doll . She goes back to get it , then runs at full speed around horses ' legs and through clusters of spectators to the end of the course . &nbsp; LOUDSPEAKER ( Judge 's voice ) .

She stands next to him , proud and happy . He reaches down to take her hand , and they walk that way to the judge 's stand . 73 Exterior : Judge 's Stand , Day Vincent is still on his horse , and Lilith stands beside him , looking on in wonder .

He stares at her intently , and as he does she lowers her eyes . &nbsp; LILITHDoes it disturb you ? &nbsp; VINCENTWhat ? &nbsp; LILITHMy music .  --  69  --  &nbsp; VINCENTNo . I think it 's beautiful . I heard you the other afternoon . &nbsp; LILITHThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think that 's fair ? &nbsp; CLAYFIELDWe have to consider the comfort of all the patients , Miss Arthur . Most of them enjoy it , I know , but to those who do n't appreciate art , we must be merciful . &nbsp; LILITH ( smiling ) . And have you come to instruct me in mercy also , Mr. Bruce ? &nbsp; VINCENT ( smiling back ) . I hope not . &nbsp; LILITHI 'm glad you liked my flute . &nbsp; VINCENTYes , very much . It has a beautiful tone . I heard you made it up yourself . &nbsp; LILITHNo . That is n't true . It was given to me by the Elders as my wisdom gift . It 's a very old one . Would you like to see it ? &nbsp; VINCENTYes , very much . She goes back to her desk and takes out the flute . It is a double block flute , an instrument of exquisite craftsmanship . He turns it over in his hands . &nbsp; LILITHDo you play ? &nbsp; VINCENTNo . I wish I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiles enigmatically . &nbsp; CLAYFIELDWhy do you prefer to believe the flute 's been given to you ? I 'd be very proud to have made it , myself . &nbsp; LILITH ( ignoring him , to Vincent ) . Can you remember the first wise thing you ever did , Mr. Bruce ? &nbsp; VINCENTNo . I 'm afraid it has yet to occur . &nbsp; LILITH ( gaily ) . Good . Then perhaps I shall have the opportunity of witnessing it .  --  70  --  &nbsp; VINCENTI hope you wo n't have to stay here that long . She sits down on her bed , laces her fingers , and looks down at her bare feet . There is a silence . Suddenly the light changes and the room turns gray . She shudders slightly . &nbsp; LILITH ( suddenly ) . I 'd like to offer you some tea but I have only one cup and saucer . &nbsp; CLAYFIELDI 'll get some cups from the office . He turns and goes down the hall . &nbsp; LILITHWhy did you come here ? &nbsp; VINCENTWell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for adventure ? &nbsp; VINCENTI do n't think so . I 'm not much of an adventurer . &nbsp; LILITHOh , I think you are . &nbsp; VINCENTWhy ? &nbsp; LILITHWill you think I 'm rude ? You will . &nbsp; VINCENTNo . &nbsp; LILITHWell , adventurous people always look ill at ease . They 're shy , you know . . . they 're not bold at all , as people believe . They go stumbling about , being scolded , breaking things , always looking for a place to belong . They have that crooked look . &nbsp; VINCENTCrooked look ? &nbsp; LILITHYes . Of not matching anything . ( Suddenly ) Do you know anything about insanity ? Vincent is silent . She goes over to get a book from a cluster that is on the floor . &nbsp; LILITHIt 's a matter of degree , of course . It 's a very delicate thing to decide . Is it Blake 's visions ? Or St. Theresa 's ? Or the testimony of St. John of the Cross ? Are they revelations , hallucinations ? Perhaps , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . ( Hands him the book ) Here , read this . There 's a passage in it I 've marked off . Vincent looks at it briefly . Then he looks up at her and reads the passage aloud . &nbsp; VINCENT " How can I be substantial if I fail to cast a shadow ? How can I help others if I am myself a fugitive ? " Clayfield comes in with the cups and saucers . &nbsp; LILITH ( to Clayfield , but still looking at Vincent ) . I 'd like to go for a walk now . . . please . Dissolve Section Details II II . Initially , Vincent 's crack-up in the bar ( scene 110 ) occurred as a reaction to the Lilith-Meaghan love relationship . In the edited version , it takes place after Steven 's suicide . III . In the final version of the script Vincent was conceived as more aggressive and cruel . This aspect of his character was modified during the shooting of the film . Thus Vincent 's treatment of Steven on the night of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exterior : Field House , Night Over the scene we hear the sound of a Chopin prelude coming from an open phonograph . Steven sits alone on one of the wicker chairs , his finger tips tapping an imaginary keyboard . Vincent appears and joins him at the table . Steven rises . &nbsp; STEVENShall I turn it off ? &nbsp; VINCENTNo , no . Vincent waves him back into his chair and they both sit there listening . Vincent stares at him continually . We now hear only the creak of the wicker chairs and the beautiful sound of the prelude . The music rises in a grievous frenzy and then after a stark pause the music reaches its climax in three shuddering chords . A silence .  --  72  --  &nbsp; STEVENBeautiful ! &nbsp; VINCENTYes . Vincent 's eyes never leave Steven 's face , except when Steven turns to him directly . Then he drops them , as though the executioner does n't want the victim to see the killer 's lust in his eyes . &nbsp; STEVENYou saw Miss Arthur today ? &nbsp; VINCENTYes . &nbsp; STEVENI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; VINCENTYes , she did , as a matter of fact . &nbsp; STEVENShe did ? Was she . . . did she seem pleased with it ? &nbsp; VINCENT ( dropping his eyes evasively with the proper expression of regret ) . She showed it to me . I thought it was beautifully made . &nbsp; STEVENThank you . Yes , I spent quite a lot of time on it . ( Pause ) You do n't think she seemed . . . particularly glad to get it ? &nbsp; VINCENTI could n't honestly say she did , Steven . I was a little surprised at her indifference ; it 's such a beautiful piece of work . &nbsp; STEVEN ( staring miserably at the windows of the field house , an expression of harrowed resolution growing in his eyes ) . I wonder if you would do something for me , Mr. Bruce ? &nbsp; VINCENTYes , of course . &nbsp; STEVENIt would mean a great deal to me . &nbsp; VINCENTI 'll be happy to do anything I can . &nbsp; STEVENI wonder if you would tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to be ? &nbsp; VINCENT ( pauses to reflect ) . Well , you know , she 's a very  --  well , a very capricious person , Steven . I 'm sure you realize that .  --  73  --  &nbsp; STEVENYes . &nbsp; VINCENTI do n't think she 's a type of person who could ever feel very sincere or lasting affection for anyone . Something she said today made me particularly aware of that . &nbsp; STEVENWhat did she say ? &nbsp; VINCENTWell , there 's no point in repeating it ; it would only be . . . painful . But you can take my word for it that she 's a shallow and very cruel person , really . &nbsp; STEVENI 'd like to know exactly what she said . It 's very important to me . ( Stares at Vincent with a severe , carefully controlled look of desolate but dignified appeal ) You promised to be completely frank . Vincent looks at him with simulated misgiving . &nbsp; VINCENTShe said , " Just because I 've tried to be nice to the poor fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some claim on me . He 's a stupid , fawning creature , and I despise him . " Vincent watches the sudden , swiftly deepening look of pallor on Steven 's face and the odd , involuntary working of his hands . &nbsp; VINCENT ( more gently ) . I 'm sorry . You asked me to be frank , and I thought it might be better , really , if you knew . &nbsp; STEVENYes . Yes . I 'm very glad you told me . Thank you . &nbsp; VINCENTI think it would be much better if you did n't have anything more to do with her at all . It ca n't lead to anything but humiliation , Steven . She is n't worthy of you . &nbsp; STEVEN ( clenching and loosening his hands ) . Yes . Thank you . Steven 's eyes close slowly with a look of great fatigue . Vincent lays his hand on his shoulder and after a moment stands up . &nbsp; VINCENTThank you for the music , Steven . Good night .  --  74  --  &nbsp; STEVENGood night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stops . &nbsp; VINCENTBea . &nbsp; BEAYes , Vincent , what is it ? &nbsp; VINCENTI 'd like permission . . . to live on the grounds . &nbsp; BEAI 'll take it up with Dr. Lavrier . Vincent walks on , leaving Bea with a disturbed look on her face . pp. 38-55 &nbsp;
