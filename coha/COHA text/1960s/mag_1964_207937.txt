A large crowd had gathered around Prague 's ancient Hradeany Castle , clearly hoping to witness the beginning of the downfall of their Communist boss . <P> Inside the castle 's vast Gothic Vladislav Hall , 294 Deputies of the tame Communist Parliament were gathered to elect a new President . For weeks there had been hints that dour Antonin Novotny , 59 , who for seven years has been both President and Communist Party chief , might lose the presidency , possibly as the first step to complete oblivion . Once a Stalinist who survived by ruthlessly killing off his rivals , Novotny had become a slavish follower of the deposed Nikita Khrushchev . During the recent Moscow ceremonies celebrating the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution , Novotny was noticeably absent from the Communist lineup atop Lenin 's Tomb . <P> But when the Prague parliamentary session ended and the castle 's great glass doors swung open , it was Novotny who stepped out on the balcony , having been " unanimously re-elected " for a new five-year term . He had survived once again , obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Communist shakeup . <P> Capitalist Magic . The crowd outside the castle faced Novotny in grim silence - and with good reason . Under Novotny 's inflexible , inept rule , potentially rich Czechoslovakia has suffered a continuous economic crisis . Industrial production has fallen , productivity has stagnated , and last week the official news agency blandly conceded that Czechoslovakia would be compelled to buy 2,200,000 tons of grain abroad be cause of a disastrous domestic harvest . <P> Such dismal conditions have forced Communist planners to resort to that old capitalist magic , the profit motive . <P> In its latest decrees , the government encourages factories that show a profit to reward workers with pay boosts and bonuses By year 's end 162 hopelessly inefficient factories employing 60,000 workers are to be closed down . In another concession to free enterprise , the government is permitting barbers , tailors , shoemakers , locksmiths and other small entrepreneurs to open private shops . <P> Old Party Hacks . Like Khrushchev and his successors , Czechoslovakia 's young Communist technocrats led by Economics Professor Ota Sik , 45 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogma . But while the reformers have sold their economic approach to the party 's Central Committee , they have not been able to bring about a change in the regime 's power structure . <P> Implementing the liberalized economic program will be difficult while Novotny remains in charge , determined to protect the old party hacks who are running most of Czechoslovakia 's economy . As Novotny explained not long ago : There is no need to fire an " old comrade " just because he ca n't count .
