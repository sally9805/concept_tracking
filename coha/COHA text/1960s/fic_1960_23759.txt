A Story by JOHN BERRY Drawings by Harry 0 . Diamond THE TOUCHABLE W E pedaled on across a semi-arid plain with rice paddies in the low places and villages in the high places : a cluster of mud huts with thatched roofs that seemed to rise effortlessly out of the landscape and were in perfect harmony with it ; a pond that was at once the community water supply , public bath , and laundry  --  with hyacinths and lilies and sometimes lotuses growing in it ; parrots in the coconut trees and the date palms ; gray-vested crows everywhere ; tiny , black goats with a preference for dried cow dung ; pale cows with humps on their backs and mysterious elongated eyes out of which the goddess Kali looked ; and perched on these cows , or prospecting about them like common chickens , were white herons , fantastically elegant . Each village had strict zoning ordinances , unwritten , according to caste . The Brahmins lived in one section ; they were , in general , the color of coffee with cream , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oyster . The next castes down , with smaller and smaller amounts of sacred ( Team in their coffee  --  although there was some variety , always duly noted , commented on , and evaluated  --  inhabited the central and less desirable sections of the village . And on the outskirts of the village , resigned to coffee without cream and to life without status  --  for they were not permitted to approach the temple , or even to allow their shadow to touch the shadow of a servant of a Hindu  --  were the Untouchables . And they had to have their own , separate mud puddle . My companion was Aretino Scott  --  Tino  --  a handsome , dark-eyed , auburn-haired American who taught at Bharat University . As the district was familiar to Tino and it was a clement time of year  --  September  --  he had offered to show me the countryside of this part of Bengal . By two o'clock in the afternoon we had finished off the bottle of boiled water we had brought with us ; and although there was plenty of water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life expectancy : in our thirties , we were already far beyond the average age for India . 1 suggested that we stop in the next village for tea , since people generally boiled the water when they made tea . " Yes , " Tino chuckled , " and they wash the cups in the nearest buffalo wallow ! " However , he said , if I could hold out for another half-hour , we should come to a small town with a tea shop where he had connections . The town we were headed for turned out to be considerably more than half an hour away . By the time we got there , I was quite peevish . Tino was wearing an ironic smile , which was apparently uncontrollable , since I had already given him several black looks . I thought he was amused at my discomfiture . So I was not at all happy when we descended at a little open-air tea shop and the proprietor rushed out , made a dive at Tino 's feet , touched the top of his shoes and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent this abasement were quite half-hearted . In fact , he appeared disgustingly happy . 53 Two jolly-looking lads placed a table and benches for us in the shade of a mango tree , at a distance from the other customers  --  for they were Brahmins with sacred threads over their sacred left shoulders and sacred locks of hair looped up in back , and they would feel contaminated by the likes of us . Out of a locked box the proprietor produced special cups and saucers , thus reassuring not us , but the Brahmins : beef-eating lips would not touch their cups , flyway . In such a place even the sight of an Untouchable would have been intolerable to : hem . I was not pleased with India at that moment . 0 V ER the tea and the many tidbits which the proprietor served us in person , I let Tino know that I disapproved of the foot-dusting he had allowed himself to receive  --  even though I knew it was an Indian custom . It seemed to me , I said , that these were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of because of their belief in non-violence . Tino 's ironic smile broadened into a grin , and then at last he gave me the apology and the explanation for which I had been longing . " I see that I must tell you a little story , " he said , " because I have been rude . Since the source of my rudeness is discretion , I will now be indiscreet . In return , you must promise that you will be discreet about it . ' ' As I was already quite mollified , I made the promise , and -I hope to keep it . " At three o'clock in the afternoon , " Tino Scott said , " on August the first , 1952 , I was careening along at breakneck speed through Calcutta traffic , in a rickety bus driven by a bearded Sikh in a turban . Narrowly missing rickshas , oxcarts , bicycles , pedestrians , trans , and flivvers , we were approaching Putiary Station , one of the old districts where Westerners are seldom seen . The bus was not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bees around the front and back openings , clinging for dear life when we rounded corners . An official notice in back of the driver 's seat said : ' Maximum capacity 30 Passengers . ' I estimated that there were at least 65 passengers . I , the only non-Indian , was hanging by one hand from a metal rod suspended from the ceiling  --  there was no room for my other hand . Bodies were crammed against me fore and aft . It was impossible to fall , even if I had died suddenly . I swayed when they swayed , tottered when they tottered , and I waited to be disgorged at the next stop . " Plastered against my forward surface was the thin , elegant backbone of Arjuna-babe , my good friend who had come with me from Bharat University , a hundred miles away by train . An unseen person , himself under pressure from behind , fitted moistly over my entire southern surface . Arjuna twisted his neck around , looked soulfully at me and gave his head a wry flirt which meant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we were . " Suddenly , the brakes squawked , the bus flung itself to a halt , the wooden structure in which we were riding leaned forward , and everyone hurtled into the front of the bus in a wild tangle of bodies . The front door opened and they began to fall out  --  on their feet , surprisingly  --  into a large mud puddle . The unseen person behind me slithered around me and began forcing his way through the door . " On a vague impulse I felt for my wallet , which I kept in my hip pocket . It was gone . Leaping down the steps , I seized the end of a blue Punjabi shirt-tail just as it was disappearing into the crowd . Pulling it in , hand over hand , I found myself confronted by a short , swarthy youth who was glaring at me with an expression of outraged dignity . " ' What is the meaning of this ? ' he demanded in Bengali . " ' I think you picked my pocket , ' I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemptuously . ' Search me ! ' My confidence was vanishing , but I searched him nevertheless , going through all the pockets in his long , blue Punjabi shirt which hung down over his dhoti . Lifting it up , I considered this latter garment : some six yards of white cotton cloth wound loosely around the upper legs and knotted about the waist . Blue Boy sneered . ' Well , Sahib ? ' After all ! " I was about to begin my apologies , when Arjuna dashed up . ' What happened ? ' ' My pocket was picked , but ? ' That was all Arjuna needed . His fist shot out and caught the youth a resounding blow on the jaw . Blue Boy staggered and my wallet promptly dropped out of the inner recesses of his dhoti into the mud . I picked it up . " At least a hundred men were looking on by this time . They made a tight ring around The author of " The Touchable " won the Macmillan Prize Award for 19,59 for his first novel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has traveled much in Europe and Asia and has taught at the University of Southern California and at V iswa Blzarati University in India . 54 THE TOUCHABLE Arjuna , the pickpocket , and me . They began to mutter , then to shout . ' What are they saying , Arjuna ? ' ' They are going to stone him to death , ' Arjuna replied . ' He has brought shame on them before a foreigner . ' " Blue Boy was trembling violently . His eyes darted this way and that , looking for a way of escape . There was none . A hundred or more sell-appointed executioners had suddenly surrounded him and were staring at him with hatred . " ' Look here ! ' I called out to the grim mob around us . ' I got my wallet back . I 'm satisfied . ' They did not budge . ' It was my fault , ' I said . ' I put temptation in his way . It was in my hip pocket . All wrong , see ? ' They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rocks . Two men laid hold of the thief . I pushed them off , grasped Blue Boy by the hand and began to pump it ostentatiously . " ' Hey ! ' I yelled , ' Forgive those who do you evil ! ' And I sermonized further . ft fell on stony soil . Again they laid hold of him , but they were kicking in resolution , perhaps because they unconsciously associated me with the old British overlords , but also , I like to think , because I had my left arm possessively around Blue Boy 's neck , and my right fist , raised high in a theatrical gesture , was ready to descend violently on somebody  --  and Bengalis are small men with delicate bones . ? You criticize America for her lynchings  --  which are ancient history , ' I said . ' And now you 're going to lynch this boy ! ' This time they yelled back at me furiously : ' No , no ! Not lynch ! We stone him ! Stand back ! ' " Still clutching my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop , arguing meanwhile . ' Lynch or stone  --  same thing  --  without due process of law  --  jury of his peers ! You 're just a lynch mob  --  disgrace to India  --  worse than pickpockets ! ' " Instead of shaming them , I merely infuriated them . They howled anti-American slogans at me . By this time , however , I had reached the tea shop . Dragging Blue Boy by the arm , I shoved him down on a bench against the wall , wedged myself against him , and pulled a broad table up against our ribs . Arjuna sat on the other side of me . Across this table we three contemplated the angry mob , which shuffled and glared at us from a distance of four feet . " I ordered tea . Never before had I had such an opportunity of playing the hero without much direct danger to myself , and I enjoyed it to the full . I knew that 1 was absolutely right , for once , that I was actually dominating a situation , and that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered my next move . Arjuna was numb and speechless , but loyal to me . The pickpocket stared blackly at the table  --  he was in the stocks . The mob stirred impatiently . I thought of sending Arjuna for the police , but I was afraid the mob would not let him through . for he was a Bengali like themselves  --  I was the only unknown quantity . If Arjuna tried and failed , it would add perilously to their sense of power . There must be no failures at this point . I sipped tea . Arjuna sipped tea . " Blue Boy sat like a stone , jammed between me and the wall . " ACROSS from the tea shop was a corner around which two sets of tram rails curved . On the nearest one sat an empty tram . Every few minutes a tram came along , stopped on the other side of the empty one , just even with it , and continued on its way . One was approaching now . " Pulling Blue Boy with me , I stood up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a great speech  --  and Bengalis can not resist speeches . Pointing to Heaven , I marched with measured steps straight at the crowd , which opened to permit my demonstration . I did not . have to hold onto Blue Boy  --  he was leaning against me like a Siamese twin , mechanically keeping step with me . The mob was puzzled . We were marching like a doomed man and his priest to the scaffold . Only it was not a scaffold , it was the empty tram , and we were actually climbing into it before they realized that they were being tricked . As the leaders swarmed in after me , I pushed Blue Boy through the door on the other side , into the tram which had just arrived , and turned to confront them . ' Shame on you ! ' I said , bracing myself firmly in the doorway . Looking over my shoulder , I saw Blue Boy walk up to the front of his car , sit down primly in back of the conductor , and stare fixedly ahead of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . " It did move . And I had the leaders of the mob in my empty tram , unable to go forward through me , or to go back through their followers . The other tram was some distance down the tracks and gaining speed before the mob outside quite grasped the situation . They dropped their rocks . Leaning backwards through the doorway , I glimpsed the clapper blue shirt of the pickpocket as his tram rounded another corner . I began to laugh . " Arjuna and I started walking toward Banat -- jipara Road where his friend Biren lived . A group of young men followed us . I turned and faced them . They told me that they had observed everything and were heartily ashamed of their countrymen . ' Fine , ' 1 said . They told me I had taught them a lesson . I said I doubted it . They hoped I would not carry away a bad impression of India . I said India was a big place , that I had many impressions , some good , some bad , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their dharma  --  which means doing your duty . ( Arjuna told me , much later , during some heated words , that I had embarrassed him at this point by what he called my ' cynical self-righteousness . ' But it is so hard to stop being a hero ! ) " AT Bircn 's house that night there was a slight difficulty about sleeping arrangements . Biren had two mosquito curtains : one big one and one little one . The big one had most of one side missing , while the little one had only a few medium-sized holes . Although I protested against preferential treatment , they insisted that I take the little one and sleep on the wooden platform by the window , while they slept on the floor , under the big curtain . I was too tired to argue long . " Arjuna and Biren were snoring gently in unison , and 1 was playing games with mosquitoes , when a head appeared suddenly at the barred , moonlit window beside my bed . An arm in a blue sleeve darted between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain , then disappeared . I sat up . On the paper was written , in English , the words : ' I am taking the dust from your feet . Please come this side . ' Again the head appeared . Blue Boy was urging me to come outside and engage in a ceremony with him . I knew what it would be : He would crouch at my feet , his head nearly on the ground , and either ' take dust from my feet ' with his fingers and put it on his head , or actually ( if he were really carried away ) seize my foot and place it on his head . " I got a pencil out of my shirt and wrote , by moonlight : Not necessary . Just go straight . ' He glanced at the note and disappeared . I thought he had gone , but in fifteen minutes he was back with another note : evidently he had an accomplice  --  a schoolboy , judging from the handwriting  --  who knew English . This note said : ' I 56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am coming your side . ' I wrote back : am going to sleep now . Good night . ' Fifteen minutes later he was at my window again . Gazing steadfastly at me , he wrenched his head to one side  --  which must have meant something very emphatic  --  and disappeared . " The next day I was returning to Bharat University by train , without Arjuna . By good luck I had obtained a tiny second-class compartment , and I was alone in it . I meant to sleep , for I had not slept a wink the night before . The train was passing over the great bridge which spans the Hooghly River  --  one of the mouths of the Ganges  --  and I was gazing peacefully down some hundreds of feet at the fishing boats gliding like toys over the brown water , when a set of dark brown fingers slid around the window frame on the outside , and clutched the bars . There was really nothing to walk on out there , and vet a man was pulling himself slowly along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Blue Boy , somberly staring in at me . I thought of pulling the emergency cord , but then I had a vision of a sudden , lurching halt which would throw him off . I opened the door of the compartment . Very slowly and cautiously he crept along the space between the window and the door . Sinuous toes wriggled in at the door , then fingers , and then , all of a sudden , before I could leap back , Blue Boy was scrabbling at me on the dirty floor of the compartment . It is not easy to stand on one foot in a moving train . I fell heavily into the seat , tugging to get my foot free ; but lie had succeeded in getting it on top of his head . Apparcintl quite contented , Blue Boy remained seated on the floor , gazing up at me . For the first time . I saw him smile . He had won ! " In the confession which followed , Blue Boy , with alarming candor , told me that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to Calcutta , posing as a ' dark ' Brahmin . And he ( lid have a certain dignity about him which helped him carry it off . Blue Boy did n't fret inferior  --  that 's what I liked about him . We agreed that , as far as that went , one fellow was about as touchable as the next . In fact , he said , he did not pick pockets in order to touch people , but merely to steal their money ; for he had been unable to find work in Calcutta , and he hated to beg . Which would I prefer : begging or stealing ? " With a slight loan , which he is repaying , Blue Boy opened a tea shop in a town which I shall not name . If the touch-me-not Brahmins of that town knew that the rather touchable young Brahmin who serves them tea with such a touchingly elegant touch  --  is the most lynchable Untouchable imaginable  --  they would have 999 sacred touchy-fits . " I T occurred to me that the fellow in the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the mango tree , watching my red-haired friend with such intensity , had not really degraded himself by groveling at Tino 's feet . Nor had Tino , obviously . In a way , I thought , and allowing for exotic customs , it very likely fell into the same category and was as problematical as any other act of love .

There yet remains Only the journey through the waste ? Let us make haste . Whatever comes of this , I will remember How you came for my sake To this bewitched domain , where beauties slumber ' Night and day , and never a prince to kiss Their eyes awake , And pitying my still career , Brought morning here .
