THERE ONCE WAS A GURU FROM RISHIKESH PART II Having voyaged to India and satisfied the Maharishi of his good vibrations , our reporter throws toast to a monkey . breathes incense with the students of meditation . listens with Mia Farrow to the scream of a wild peacock and bestows a garland of flowers upon a Beatle . On the heights of the Maharishi s academy in the Himalayas , the sweet , wayward discourse never ceased . The Beatles and the less cele  --  brated guests appeared at stray moments between their meditations , wandering through the teak trees to the picnic table at the edge of the bluff Sometimes holding flowers in their hands , some  --  times throwing bits of toast to the monkeys . they talked of dysentery and cosmic consciousness , of poetry and their troubles with the tailor The place had an air of timelessness about it , and now when I remember , I think of a succession of bland , vegetarian meals and a random sequence of events held together by the weird logic of images in dreams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Ganges kept up its old and sacred progress to Benares and the Bay of Bengal .

Neither did the clamor at the gates , Every day the reporters from the Indian press assembled in increasing numbers on the lower slope of the ash  --  ram , waiting with cameras and tactless skepticism . They remained below the barbed-wire fence , and occasionally in the afternoons the Maharishi ven  --  tured among them to speak gently of " the ocean of happiness within " and the " dive toward truth and light .

Often he referred to them as " the blessed leaders of the world 's youth , " and in his happiest moments he described George Harrison as " a sublime soul for whom God and all the angels give thanks .

Drugs , he said , had lilled a gap and showed him many things , but death still remained what he called " a bit of a hang-up , " which was where phi  --  losophy and religion began to get useful . For more than a year he 'd been practicing yoga and playing Indian music , and he 'd even read of the Maharishi 's technique of meditation . ( The technique requires the silent repetition of a single sound or mantra and promises , among other things , peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the beginning was the word , " Harrison said , " and I knew the mantras were the words . " The difficulty was finding them . In the summer of 1967 the Maharishi arrived in London on one of his annual world tours , and Harrison took John Lennon and Paul McCartney to hear the lecture . " All of a sudden there was this man from India , " he said . " Not in a flash of lightning or anything , but there in the Hilton Hotel . " The next day they called Ringo , and together with the Maharishi they took a train to Bangor , Wales . There . during a week-long seminar for his British followers . the Maharishi initiated them in a ceremony involving many flowers . Concurring in all that Harrison said . Lennon re  --  ferred me both to their photographs and to their records as diaries of their developing consciousness . In the recent photographs , he said , he hoped peo  --  ple might notice " something going on behind the eyes other than guitar boogie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditation . Yes , they 'd had results with it , and no , it was n't a put-on , but beyond that their atti  --  tude implied that it was George 's thing , and if he wanted to go to India , OK , everybody went to India . Ringo and his wife , Maureen , admitted to a little trouble with meditations longer than a few hours , and McCartney regretted the extrav  --  agance of the Maharishi 's praise and the grandiose nature of his metaphysics . " I get a bit lost in the upper reaches of it , " he complained . Also he wished the Maharishi would avoid talk  --  ing to them about subjects that he , McCartney. knew something about . In the mornings the Maharishi held private classes for them on the roof of his house , and occasionally he discussed aspects , f modern life . McCartney found the Maharishi 's support of the draft laws disillusioning , and his girl friend , the British actress , Jane Asher , won  --  dered aloud from time to time what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taj Mahal . The Maharishi 's doting fondness for the Beatles disconcerted a number of the other meditators in residence , some of whom felt themselves too much reminded of headwaiters deferring to show-busi  --  ness personalities in Hollywood . Others , who had followed the Maharishi so faithfully for so many years , at first resented the intrusion of usurpers . Jealousy being so obviously inappropriate to the circumstances . however , most of them managed to stifle it . They argued that the Beatles had at  --  tracted wide notice to their movement and had promised , atter all , to build a meditation academy in London . The extreme interpretation I remember hearing from Anneliese Braun , a small , elfin woman who. so it was said , could heal people by a laying on of hands .

She looked at me in the sly way she had , her eyes glit  --  tering with the opaque brilliance of a cat 's eyes . " It was n't for nothing that Christ 's original disciples were simple men , " she said . " ... Carpen  --  ters and fishermen . you know . " Through Anneliese I met Geoffrey . and it was he who showed me around and introduced me to n-lany of the others . Like Virgil . he said , pointing out the sights to Dante . He enjoyed learned allu  --  sions. and on our walks together we talked of such things as the Punic Wars and the quality of the light in Rembrandt 's last portraits . Yellow flags drooped from long bamboo poles set at random intervals along the paths ; an occasional trellis marked the entrance to a vegetable or flower garden , and on the stone walls of the low bunga  --  lows. in letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SILENCE ZONE . Geoffrey himself was a painter and a teacher of painting in London , He wore a full beard , and his eyes , which were gray , seemed always to stare into the distance , as if he were estimating remote perspectives . He was anxious that I should know the other meditators as responsible citizens who would n't tilt at windmills or trudge after a piper playing a popular dance-hall tune . Thus . when introducing me , he would identify Gunther as the Lufthansa pilot . or Nancy as the wife of a television news analyst , or Tony as the blackjack dealer in a Las Vegas casino . All presumably practical people who knew the odds and were accustomed to hard , technological proofs . Everybody would remain on the ashram for two months , he said . and then they would proceed , by chartered jet , to Kashmir . At Rishikesh they studied to become initiators in their native coun  --  tries . and at Kashmir . where the Maharishi main  --  tained a second establishment aboard a string of houseboats , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Maharishi spoke to us in the lecture hall , a damp and hangarlike building with whitewashed walls and a floor of compressed cow dung . Little paper flags fluttered from the beams across the ceiling ; near the wide doors charcoal fires burned in tin pots . A display of ferns and palm fronds decorated the wooden stage at the far end of the hall . In the cen  --  ter of the stage . behind an array of microphones attached to tape recorders . stood a modest altar dressed with flowers , Christmas tinsel and a paint  --  ing of the Maharishi 's master . the Guru Dev . The Beatles and their wives occupied places in the front row of wood and wicker chairs ; the rest of us sat scattered through the rows in back . Candles on the annrests of the chairs offered a dim and flickering light ; the heavy scent of incense and coal smoke drifted on the night air . The Maharishi invariably appeared at least an hour late , his hands luldrd ni a pious gesture , nod  --  ding and murmuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly down the center aisle . An alrmisl coquettish smile straying across his face , he sal cross-legged on his antelope skin . often toying with a flower or a strand of heads . When he spoke to his voice remained gentle and soothing , as if he were speaking from someplace far away , where ev  --  erything , somehow , was much simpler . Always he began by asking how long everybody had managed to meditate since he 'd last seen them . and I remember a night when a Swedish woman impatiently raised her hand . The Maharishi nodded to her with an encouraging smile . " Yes ? " he said . " How long , please ? " " Forty-two hours , Maharishi , " she said . She wore a dull-colored robe and spoke with the I lat satisfaction of somebody announcing a record . The others turned to notice her , visibly impressed by her accomplishment . The Maharishi clapped his hands together and said , " What joy . " He inquired if the woman 's meditation had been harmonious . Informed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lady thought for an awkward few minutes , and then said , apolo  --  getically , " No , Maharishi . " He smiled with the same encouragement as be  --  fore . assuring her that she had made no mistake , and then he asked if anybody could report 41 hours . Nobody could . He inquired about 40 and 39 hours , and encountering no response then pro  --  ceeded downwards hour by hour . At 30 hours an Englishwoman raised her hand and admitted she had n't managed it all at once . like the Swedish lady , but rather in 10-hour segments interrupted by 15-minute breaks for warm milk and honey sandwiches . " And you felt what , please ? " the Maharishi inquired . In a precise , clinical voice the woman reported " the usual disassociation from my body " in the first segment , followed , in the second segment , by a sensation of intense and pleasurable warmth . During the third segment she 'd begun to sing old music-hall songs . the words to which she thought she 'd forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting . At 23 hours Gunther , the Lufthansa pilot , announced that his friend , George . wanted to say something . George did n't under  --  stand English . and they whispered together for a moment . Gunther then said that George had ex  --  perienced a feeling much like fainting , which de  --  pressed and alarmed him . The Maharishi gave way to a fit of high and infectious laughter , in the midst of which he said . " In hospitals they call it fainting . . . . We call it ranscending . " For meditations of less than seven hours ( pe  --  riods that did n't warrant discussion ) , the Maha  --  rishi asked only for a show of hands . When he finished his review , he answered questions , most of which dealt with matters of considerable sub  --  stance . People asked for a more exact distinction between " God-consciousness " and " supreme knowledge , " or whether " rapturous joy " always accompanied the descent into " pure being . " The Maharishi considered carefully before giv- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pose , in that flickering light and aromatic haze . I could imagine him weighing the destiny of na- tions . ( Geoffrey later explained that all the Ma  --  harishi 's answers took place on at least two levels of meaning , corresponding to the levels of " gross or subtle consciousness " ; to make himself clearer . Geoffrey employed the metaphor of a tree , the profound levels of meaning being analogous to the sap , the superficial to the level of the leaf . ) When all t he questions had been answered , the Maharishi rose and turned toward the altar . There assisted by his monks . he performed a ceremony involving the burning of sandalwood , the chanting of a Vedic hymn and the ringing of tiny bells . Although this constituted a simple offer of thanksgiving to the Guru Des/. many of those past the age of 40 chose to endow it with a larger significance . They groped hesitantly with the unfamiliar words and rhythms of the hymn , and when they could , or when the ceremony seemed to call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold floor . Every now and then John O'Shea wandered up the hill from the town of Swarag Ashram , bring  --  ing the news and gossip of the Laksmi Caf ? . The cafe I 'd seen and remembered as a dingy bazaar on a mud street , into which cows often looked in search of sweets and vegetables . A sign on the wall advertised QUALITY FOOD AND TASTY SNACKS ; slow fans hung from the ceiling , and the clientele drank tea at stone tables . It was , however , the only place in town , and O'Shea and his friends used to go there in the afternoons . They were all of them very hip . having made the approved scenes in places like the Haight  --  Ashbury district . and they 'd come to India , separately and by different roads , in search of their own guru . Swarag Ashram. on the banks of the Ganges , contained many gurus of various per  --  suasions. and among them O'Shea 's friends con  --  ducted their haphazard quest . met him the first day I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maharishi 's ashram. and we used to talk on the lower slopes , on the stony . open ground among the crows and the disen  --  chanted reporters . Dressed in the manner of a sadhu , barefoot and with only a soiled white cloth around his loins . O'Shea often carried a trident symbolic of the Lord Krishna . As yet . he said . they 'd found no guru to teach them , but in the evenings they listened to Bob Dylan records and smoked hashish . They did it elaborately , he said . with a lot of Indians sitting around and the ceremonial blowing of a conch horn . This announced the religious significance of the proceeding and therefore exempted them from trouble with the civil authorities . Lately , however , what with the publicity at  --  tracted by the Maharishi , they 'd felt the tourists moving in on them . As an example of how bad things were getting , O'Shea mentioned an Amer  --  ican friend of his who 'd been in the Laksmi Cafe some days before when an Italian photographer showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McQueen , and the friend figured the photographer was George Harrison . Neither could speak the other 's language i the friend thinking Harrison was putting him on with the nutty talk ) , and it took them an hour to straighten the thing out . " What kind of scene is that . man ? " O'Shea said . " I mean . where are we supposed to be ? " Sometimes O'Shea stayed long enough to at  --  tend one of the Maharishi 's press conferences . but of these he remained critical . The Maharishi he thought too commercial , too often answering ques  --  tions in an equivocal way , as if he had an interest to protect . " Like a politician , you dig , " he said . " A holy man has got to be set to be crucified . right ? " His opinion was shared by a clear majority of the Indian press . When the Maharishi came among them , they listened obediently to the radiant metaphysics , and then , at the end , asked the questions they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the airstrip the Maharishi was building in another part of the forest . The The Maharishi laughed . ' In hospitals they call it fainting , ' he said . ' We call it transcending. ' ( dues ' ions . he found awkward the Nlahare:Iii an  --  swered with ( lights of charmingly evasive laughter . The restrictions against reporters remained in force , and in the evenings they departed in bitter  --  ness to life stories about the congregation of " actors , divorcees and reformed drug addicts . " When the more sarcastic accounts reached the ashram , the monks took pains to hide them from the Nlaharishi . For people with cameras , however , the restric  --  tions sometimes could be waived . Permission to film within the ashram was given to Canadian and Italian television crews , also to a French photographer from Vogue magazine . The photog  --  rapher stayed for several days . wearing a series of costumes designed by Pierre Cardin and ex  --  plaining he 'd been diverted from an assignment to take pictures of the milk-white tigers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously delighting in cameras with the innocent enthu  --  siasm of a child . He even considered himself some  --  thing of a director , and this assumption was never more apparent than at the times he organized his group photographs . First he supervised the building of a tier of bleachers , directing two monks where to place the flowers , the potted plants and the painting of the Guru Dev . His uncle , an old man who lived next to the inquiry office , did nothing but paint portraits of the Guru Dev and ranked as a leading authority on the subject . ) Next the Maharishi drew a diagram indicating where everybody was to sit , and as the meditators appeared ( everybody in their best Indian clothes ) , he hurried them into their places . While we waited for the last of the stragglers one morning , an American television actor named Tom Simcox explained about Mia Farrow . He had known her in California , he said , and they had come up to the ashram in the group with the others . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placing paper crowns on her head and insisting on so many photographs , that she had gone off after five days on a tiger hunt . " Stuff like this , " he said .

" When everything had been arranged to the Maharishi 's satisfaction , the Beatles next to him in the center of the set , he said to the photog  --  rapher , " You must shout one , two , three before you snap . . . . Any snap , you must shout . " The photographer . a man from Rishikesh who worked with an old-fashioned camera under a black cloth , planned an angle the Maharishi thought too low . " Up higher , " he said . " You do n't get good scenes from there . " The photographer dragged his camera several feet up the hill . and the Maharishi , turning to the assembled meditators , smiled and said , " Now come on . cosmic smiles . . . and all into the lens . " More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The morning they arrived , I waited for them on the shore of the Ganges with Nancy Jackson and Larry Kurland. who also loved the helicopters , but for different reasons . A chic . blond woman in her 40 's . Nancy always dressed as if for a late lunch around one of her neighbors ' pools in Beverly Hills . She had a brisk way of talking that suggested she was accus  --  tomed to managing things , and her conversation invariably contained references to the important Min Farrow tolled her pilgrimage " u romp , " hot hod kt't the ashram for a feu ' weeks to go tiger hunting . people she knew . Larry conceived of himself as the archetypal hippie , a traveler returned from trips beyond any destinations dreamed of in John O'Shea 's philosophy . He 'd let his hair and his heard grow ; he wore beads and sandals and Indian cloaks of many colors . He too had been through the drug scene and found it insufficient . and the Maharishi he recognized as " a cat right on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the $500 for the course on the ashram amounted to a lot . of money , but their objections he thought niggling . " Where can you buy nirvana for less ? " he said . While we waited for the helicopters , Nancy made the kind of nervous talk characteristic of women filling in the silences between arriv  --  als of the famous guests . The light had not yet reached across the river , and it was still cold . On the far shore I could see the smoke of cook  --  ing hies in a mud compound inhabited by mendi  --  cant monks . She 'd discovered the Maharishi several years before , Nancy said , on her way through Rishikesh to see the Dalai Lama . She did n't pay much atten  --  tion to the Maharishi that year , but she remem  --  bered that when she and her companions got to Lhasa , the Dalai Lama peeked at them through a rhododendron bush , and she 'd been uncertain about what to say . There had been talk of the Abominable Snow  --  man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrange an expedition . She called it " the yeti . " introducing the term in a casual aside . and with a stick she drew the yeti 's footprint in the sand . The Dalai Lama had n't granted them permission , she said , but had offered instead to loan them three miracle-working lamas . The idea was to take the lamas on tour in the United States , raising money for future expeditions . Among other wonders , the lamas could perform levita  --  tion and materialization , and they could drag the combined weight of seven deranged elephants . " Fantastic , " Larry said . The conversation lapsed , and then , still in a nervous , gossipy way . Nancy said that if I really wanted to write about something interesting , I ought to get in touch with her husband , the tele  --  vision news analyst . Several years ago , she said . he 'd been contacted by people from outer space , and a friend of theirs had gone off forever in a flying saucer . " Wild , " Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation when two helicopters appeared , circling once over the river and then settling onto the beach in a loud swirl of sand . Out of the first of them stepped an obviously American couple , later identified as Fred and Susie Smithline from Scarsdale . N.Y . Susie wore white boots and a basic black dress ; her husband , in dark glasses . a blue blazer and tennis sneakers , got out of the plane already film  --  ing with his home-movie camera . Seeing Larry in his beads and taking him for a more authentic figure than either Nancy or myself . Susie said to him , " Hi . What time does the meditation start ? " " Fantastic . " Larry said again . Walking up the hill to the ashram , Susie ex  --  plained that Fred , her husband , was the American lawyer for Kersi Carnbata , a businessman from Bombay who owned the helicopters and had arrived in the other one . She was terribly excited about the whole thing , she said . because she and Fred had been traveling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to come along , and she could n't believe it really . She 'd heard somuch about the Maharish eshe pronounced it to rhyme with hashish , omitting the final vowel ) , and her friends in Scarsdale had said , just before she left , kiddingly , that she ought to forget about the Tai or any of that , and just go and see the Maharish. and well . here she was . On the path she looked suspiciously around her , as if fearful of snakes or dead things . " Ten days in India and you 're not supposed to be afraid of anything , " she said . In the Maharishi 's house we sat on yellow cushions . and Nancy introduced the Smithlines and the helicopter pilots . The Maharishi already knew Cambata , a follower who had come to advise him about possible sites for his airstrip . The move  --  ment had bought the Maharishi a twin-engine Beechcraft , but he needed a place to land it . " Nothing but the best , Maharishi , " Nancy said . The talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flight that afternoon . first to see his ashram from the air and then to survey construction sites . The aviation gas to re  --  fuel the helicopters had not yet arrived from Delhi by truck . a delay for which Cambata apolo  --  gized , and so Nancy suggested that the rest of us go up the hill to lunch . The assembled meditators looked doubtfully at the Smithlines . Susie refused the food and asked only for a cup of boiled water . into which she emptied a package of powdered Sanka . Fred continued filming , walking around the table and getting shots at artistic angles . While winding his camera he occasionally attempted breezy and encouraging remarks . You go to a cocktail party in New York , " he said at one point , " and all you hear is Indian music . " " It 's very in to be Indian , " Susie said . The others at the table , resplendent in their saris and heads , looked at , her with vague uneasi  --  ness . Thinking they did n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " No kidding , it really is . A lot of people are doing yoga . " Nobody said anything , and Nancy , conscious of the awkward silence , told an anecdote about a Tibetan friend of hers who 'd sold his yak and left his native country a few years ago to marry an American girl . The girl had met him on a world tour , but when the Tibetan arrived at the Los Angeles airport . she thought he looked strange and so abandoned him . " What 's a Tibetan . : upposed to look like , for God 's sake ? " Nancy said . " Nobody looks more like a Tibetan than a Tibetan ? . if you know what I mean . " After lunch , when the aviation gas had arrived . the Maharishi walked solemnly down the hill in front of a straggling procession of monks . Hindu porters , kitchen boys , meditators and frightened animals . John Lennon took movies of the crowd of Indians on the beach ; the Indians with box cameras took pictures of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody . The Maharishi gazed lovingly at the helicopter . like a child looking at an enormous . complicated toy . He absently clutched a bouquet of flowers . which , when the engines started . dissolved in shreds . He hardly noticed , still smiling and never turning away from the noise and the blowing sand . A monk placed his antelope skin on the copilot 's seat , and somebody else handed him a single dahlia as he adjusted his seat belt . Nodding and smiling and waving in mild benediction with his flower , he cast his blessings from higher and higher up as the helicopter lifted into the clear air . The racket of the helicopters circling overhead interrupted many meditations that afternoon , and more than the usual number of people showed up for early tea . The ensuing conversation veered off in the customary oblique directions . Simcox and two or three of the other young Americans raised mild objections to the Maha  --  rishi 's involvement with modern technology . Like O'Shea , they had expected romantic asceticism , of the kind they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live on roots and berries . Their dissent was never harsh . reflecting instead a wist  --  ful disillusionment . " In the beginning , " Simcox said . " everybody was paranoid about expressing one little harmless doubt . " Since the first week , however , they 'd gone hack to smoking cigarettes and wondering if they would finish the course . The meditation they still thought helpful , but they found themselves spend  --  ing less time alone in their rooms , and they talked more frequently of the salads and other pleasures they remembered in California . Mike Love , the lead singer of the Beach Boys . confessed that stray sexual images sometimes intruded upon his meditations . " On a very gross level , man , " he said . Among the many others who came that after  --  noon for tea , Geoffrey reported a meditation the night before in which he 'd seen landscapes such as those painted by Hieronymus Bosch . and Anneliese said she 'd been without sleep for many nights , healing people with unaccountable pain . A hearty. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer in her youth . appeared in leopard pajamas , breathing deeply and swinging her arms in a bracing , athletic way . For some days she 'd complained of her meditations as " a ghastly bore , " but the new light in her face suggested sudden improvements . " Two hours of perfection , darlings , " she said to us . " Absolute perfection . And then you know all the rest is illusion . is n't it so . darlings ? ' ' An Australian poet named 11lichael announced that he 'd been lying in a hammock fur several hours , and there , under his blankets , he 'd tinier-stood the world and everything in it as aspects of " the cosmic joke . " Ile preferred the shorter poetic forms , he said , on the order of Japanese haiku. and usually he began with a heavy sheaf of manu  --  script before he refined the thing down to its essence . His most recent poem he 'd been writing for three months , and he thought he 'd just about got it right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy smile . looking off at the monkeys chasing one another through the trees , he did so . " The Buddha sat , " he said , ' ' and would not say . ' The Beatles arrived toward evening , and Harri  --  son , who was sitting nearest to me at the table , remarked that if lie could turn everybody on to transcendental meditation and Indian music , then lie could go . Somebody asked him what lie meant exactly , and he said , " You know ... out ... on a road tour when you leave for the next town . " Somebody else asked him about his own medi  --  tatioL.s. and he said his mantra was an English word . This caused considerable surprise because it was assumed that into most people 's ears the Maharishi or one of his deputies had whispered unintelligible Sanskrit syllables . Nobody , of course , ever told anyone else his ouara , because to do so would damage them , but that was the common understanding . Harrison further astounded every  --  body by saying he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know for sure , but his appeared in Lennon 's song . I Ann the Walrus . The night the balloons appeared in the lecture hall , Geoffrey mistook them for decorations in honor of the god Shiva 's marriage to the goddess Parvati . The musicians seated on the stage , among them a Sikh wearing slippers that curled at the toes , seemed to support his assumption . ' ' How nice . " lie said . " Shiva day . " We talked of Shiva 's many tricks and dis  --  guises , which so pleased Geoffrey that he did n't mind when it turned out lie was wrong about the balloons , Like the musicians , they had to do with George Harrison 's birthday . The Maharishi brought the Beatles onto the stage with him , and they sat on cushions to one side of his platform while a pundit from Rishi  --  kesh . himself a wise man of wide reputation . began a lyrical Hindu chant . Other monks made their way about the stage on their knees . dabbing yellowish smudges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beatles and their wives . " To cool the nervous system . " Geoffrey said . The chant lasted for what seemed like a long time . Every now and then the Maharishi affec  --  tionately stroked Harrison 's head , and Edna. in her leopard pajamas , moved discreetly through the audience , handing each of us a garland of wet , fresh marigolds . " To give to George , " she said . When the chanting ceased we all walked up to the stage and placed our garlands around Harri  --  son 's neck , until in the end . embarrassed and smil  --  ing sheepishly , he looked like a man in a life jacket . The Maharishi then spoke to us in a long and dreaming soliloquy , his head tilted to the side like a bird 's , and his voice more musical than I 'd ever heard it , as if he were conjuring benign spirits from the incense-heavy air . There was a good time coming , he said , and a great new hope abroad in the world . Ever since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beatles , he knew his movement must succeed and that men would no longer suffer . At the end we all sang Happy Birthday to George . to whom the Maharishi presented a cake with two candles and a plastic globe that he offered upside down , saying , " This is the world . It needs to be corrected . ' The laughter and applause subsided , and then the Maharishi led everyone into a meditation , the long silence at last being softly broken by a single note plucked on a stringed instrument . That note I remember as indescribably loyely. holding within it a glimpse of ( continued on page 88i infinite possibility . as if it had arrived from someplace as far off as the calm height from which the Maharishi spoke to us . Slowly the melody took shape , faintly supported by the rhythm of a drum . Donovan arrived on the evening of the following day , walking up the sandy path to the gate with his guitar over his shoulder and a cigarette drooping from the corner of his mouth . His friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knapsack . From a dis  --  tance I saw them confer with the Hindu guards , who at first did n't recognize them , and then a monk came and con  --  ducted them up the hill past the char  --  coal fires burning at the corners of the paths . Instead of a lecture that night we heard the pundit from Rishikesh in an  --  other chant ( this time , to Geoffrey 's delight , celebrating Shiva 's marriage to Parvati ) , and afterward Donovan and George Harrison discussed the music . They sat across from each other at the table under the trees , the other meditators listening as if for momentous announcements . As always , when pres  --  ent at conversations between high-ranking celebrities , the others assumed the characteristics of townspeople watching from doorways as the sheriff walked out to meet the man named Slade . ) Donovan had light eves and an almost childish face . and both he and Harrison , conscious of the attendant in  --  terest , delayed their opening remarks .

" he said . " That 's what it is . " Everybody smiled , and there fol  --  lowed a general agreement that the chant had been a groove . Harrison briefly mentioned his idea about ear plugs replacing record players ( so that people could hear the music better I and also his conception of the academy the Beatles hoped to build in London . The Maharishi had great hopes for the academy , and Harrison assumed the group could raise enough money to build it by giving a single concert . " Figuring the tax deductions for that sort of thing . " he said . He envisioned a large and colorful place where the kids could dance . and I sadly remembered the proposals of some of the older medi  --  tators. who had spoken to me of remote sanitariums surrounded by neat lawns . The Beatles seldom stayed late at the table . preferring to retire to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had tapes of their own and other people 's music , also a large supply of canned goods . They even had their road manager with them . a man named Malcolm Evans who obligingly practiced the medita  --  tion and if they ran out of anything , Evans sent for more , Before leaving for the night , Harri  --  son and the others filled their hot water bottles from the pots in the primitive kitchen . The nights were still cold atthat lime of year . and I s414iyan , who stayed to drink another cap of tea . borrowed an extra blanket . Dora nain seemed as sweet and vul  --  lierahle as the others , speaking in a eentle voice and talking ahout the ter  --  rible time last summer at t he D.A.H. auditorium in Washington , He 'd found the place unsympa I het ie. and there had hem police in the hack of the hall . wait  --  ing fur Lhe riot that never occurred .

Gypsy Dave . a big . sham  --  bling man with long sideburns , smiled and poured the tea and did n't say much of anything . The next morning it rained . and Mia came back . Simcox confessed his amaze  --  ment , and people who 'd seen her going to the Maharishi 's house reported that she looked much better than when she 'd left , less harassed . they said , and with a clearer light in her eyes . She appeared at lunch , wearing white cotton pajamas and gold-rimmed glasses . In conversation with John Lennon she said she 'd been to Goa , and there , with her brother , she 'd bought a stove for a few rupees and lived on the beach for a week . " You 've got to do it right , to he with the people and never mind the rotten conditions , " she said . " Otherwise you miss the magic of this magical land . " Her voice had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could talk as if to somebody who un  --  derstood . They 'd traveled across the same high plateau of fame , where the air is different than in other places , and they had " all of it " at a young age . They mentioned the " boxed-in " gen  --  eration , the people older than they who lived with silly . artificial rules and in  --  sisted on " putt ing everything in bags . " Later that afternoon , watching therain sineills on the liven she talked alnmi her own pilgrimage to the ash  --  ram . A nano , she called in like being a kid again . " nn flying from Hower to flower , " she said " looking for a place where peo , I lei me be . " in it lung about the tiger hunt or about quitting the place a few weeks before ; the Maharishi had been glad to see her and had restored her to her place in the front row , together with Donovan and the Beatles and Mike Love . There was " great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people missed it because they got hung up with television sets and cars and their names in the paper . " Oh , wow , " she said . " They think bliss consciousness is when you get those things . But when you make it , when you have it all , what then ? " On my last morning there the storm passed over , leaving behind it one of those freakish spring days that shift between sudden clouds and bright sun . At breakfast a porter brought a note from a man at the gate who , he said , wore a jewel in his turban . The note read : " We have shot a tiger . Anyone in  --  terested is welcome to come and see it . " We 'd heard rumors of tigers in the surrounding hills . likewise of elephants , but none of us had ever seen them . Ringo , who also was leaving that day . figured the note to be a photographer 's trick . " A mile down the road , " he said , " and twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He and Maureen missed their chil  --  dren , he said , and the long meditations he thought he could practice just as successfully at home . Also the flies bothered him . With the approach of the hot weather , the flies had begun to settle on the food , and Maureen liked the flies even less than he did . They had consulted the Maharishi on the subject , but the Maharishi told them that to people lost in their meditations , the fliea no longer mattered very much . " But , " said Ringo , " that does n't zap the flies , does it ? ' ' I left him arranging with his road manager about a car and went to say good-bye 10 the Maharishi . He received me in the small porch off his hedroonn and through the windows I could look out on the familiar view of the Ganges . We talked mostly of metaphysical things , about his movement and the revival of a religious spirit in the West . He wanted to make sure . however , that I understood about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his ashram openly discussed marijuana and LSD , but he hoped I knew they no longer used such things . I said I did , and he smiled in a kindly and satisfied way . " Meditation brings the satisfaction in the mind which students seek in drugs , " he said . We talked also about war , which he described as " a nuisance , " and about the American mind , which he thought " so very precious " for the world . The flower of the tree , he said , comparing the other peoples of the earth to the hark and branches . Like the Indian reporters I asked him about the money invested in his organization . but he only laughed and said he had no idea about budgets , " Somebody must know , " he said . " It 's only unknown to me . I keep say  --  ing . ' Do this , do that . ' How they do it is their headache . " Neither would he answer questions about himself . From an assistant I 'd learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dev in a religious pro  --  cession. he 'd studied physics at the university in Allahabad . Beyond that he told me nothing . explaining that he did n't think much about himself and that the personality of a man was but a passing and not very important thing . At the end he presented me with a rose . " Mention my love for my master , " he said . " I consider myself only a loudspeaker . " Walking through the vegetable gar  --  den , I encountered Mia Farrow playing with a flower and smiling at her own secrets . She thought she 'd heard the scream of a wild peacock in the woods , she said . and George Harrison had promised to teach her the guitar . Un  --  happily , she had to go to London next week to do a movie with Elizabeth Taylor , but she knew she would come back to India , and maybe she would buy a place near Bombay . Geoffrey and Anneliese I met on the sandy path leading down to the river . They gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color of the sky . It reminded him of El Greco . and he wondered if I quite ap  --  preciated the subtle textures at the edge of the horizon . I sti31 remembered them smiling at me as I turned away toward the ferry and the passage across the Ganges . From the opposite shore , I saw them all again . at a distance and for the last time . By a trick of the weather on that sudden . shifting day , it was raining on my side of the river , but they remained in the clear sunlight . saw them as small bright figures , sit- ting in a circle on the stony beach against a background of immense trees . I thought I could see the light reflect  --  ing from the Maharishi 's white robe . and I knew they had gathered to listen to Donovan sing . q
