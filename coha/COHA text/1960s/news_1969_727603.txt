txt Robert H. Finch , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , called today for the Federal Government to impose national minimum standards of payments to the nation 's ? 8.5 million welfare clients . Mr. Finch 's endorsement of such a system , made in a television interview , was significant in that the Nixon Administration has welfare reforms near the top of its agenda for domestic affairs . A Nixon Administration study group has suggested , to narrow the disparity between individual states ' payments to welfare clients , a " Federal floor " that would cost the Government at least $1.4-billion a year above its present welfare costs . Mr. Finch was asked whether , in view of the criticism of the welfare system , the Government should move toward a guaranteed minimum income . A Floor ' of Some Kind ' " I think you are going to come down the road to a Federal floor of some kind , " Mr. Finch said . " We have to relate to the enormous disparity between the states ; something like an $8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an enormous effect , obviously , on the flow of people , what motivates them to go from one place to another , and it is up to the Federal Government to rationalize these differences . " Mr. Finch said he was " not sure " that a minimum income was the right way to achieve a Federal floor . He was then asked , in view of the disparities between the states , whether he definitely favored some system of national standards . " I do , " he replied . Mr. Finch and two other members of the Nixon Cabinet ? George Romney , Secretary of Housing and Urban Development , and John A. Volpe , Secretary of Transportation  --  were interviewed together on a special , one-hour presentation of " Meet the Press " on the National Broadcasting Company . The discussion cut across the entire range of urban and social problems facing the new Administration . In welfare , Mr. ' Finch noted that studies were being made to help President Nixon to recommend reforms , which he called for repeatedly ' in his campaign last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year  --  headed by Richard P. Nathan , now a member of the staff of the Bureau of the Budget  --  made recommendations that are receiving favorable consideration in the new Administration . Two alternative approaches , either of which would require Congressional action , were suggested to reduce disparities and to shift more of the cost of welfare to the Federal Government . The first approach , estimated to cost the Federal Government $1.9-billion a year more , would place the needy blind , aged and disabled under the Social Security system , eliminating many administrative costs borne by the states and local governments . It would raise the minimum benefits to all persons under social Security to $70 a month . It would require the states to grant at least $40 a month to dependent children . Present average grants range from $8.50 in Mississippi to $71.75 in New York , with a national average of $41.85 . The Federal Government would agree to reimburse the states in full for the first $30 in payments to dependent children and 50 per cent of the next $40 . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in Federal money , would simply establish minimum benefits for all recipients , without the Social Security system 's being involved . The minimum for dependent children would be the same as under the first approach . Mr. Volpe suggested that in order to improve the air transportation system in the country a trust fund might be established for the construction of airports and other facilities . This is how the interstate highway system , begun under the Eisenhower Administration , is financed . A percentage of the gasoline tax goes into the trust fund . Would not this also work in building mass transit systems for the cities ? Mr. Volpe was asked . " This could work in urban mass transportation , " he treplied . " The way to raise the money is the big job , and this is one of the things that we are starting to review very , very quickly and will have to face up to in order to start tot meet these needs . " Mr. Romney said that the major problem facing him was the construction of low-income housing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed .
