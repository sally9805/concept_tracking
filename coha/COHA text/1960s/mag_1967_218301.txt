In his decade as president of the University of Alabama , Frank Rose has given his state good reason for pride . He has upgraded the faculty , brought in tens of millions of dollars in research money , sharply expanded the graduate departments-and helped build national-championship football teams to boot . Until recently , he has even managed education . No longer . Last week he seemed on the verge of resignation after an angry struggle with legislators over the university 's right to air unpopular opinions . <P> The feud began three weeks ago when Rose refused to lend his name to a protest sponsored by Governor Lurleen Wallace condemning a federal court order that Alabama desegregate all its public schools . But what really fired up the legislators was a student publication called Emphasis ' 67-Revolutions that included articles by Negro Militant Stokely Carmichael on ' Power and Racism , " and by Communist Bettina Aptheker on the U.S. in Viet Nam . The pamphlet provided background for a student-sponsored symposium last month on world problems at which Dean Rusk was a main speaker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the student fund that produced Emphasis . The articles , cried Representative Ralph Slate , indicated that some Alabama students " want to run the university like they do in Berkeley . " Senator Alton Turner contended that Rose had " outlived his usefulness . " Representative Gus Young , a Baptist minister , complained that Rose had used the word " damn " in a speech and asserted that legislators " have just as much right to defend Christianity and democracy as anybody else has to defend Communism . " A bill was introduced in the legislature to ban any speaker at the university who is a Communist , advocates overthrow of the government of the U.S. or the state of Alabama , or pleads the Fifth Amendment on subversive activities . <P> Rose pointed out that the views of Bettina Aptheker had been rebutted in Emphasis by an article by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Earle Wheeler , and that Carmichael 's black-power views were balanced by those of N.A.A.C.P. Executive Director Roy Wilkins . Students marched to Rose 's house to show their support . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared text and vowed to stand behind his students " as long as they are not vulgar , obscene or seditious . " Declared he : " We in Alabama have an inferiority complex . We think everybody in the damn world is against us . We are cursing the land . This must stop . We have got to get along . " As for himself , he warned " those who want to get to me " that " I 'm not for sale , and the University of Alabama , so long as I 'm president , is not for sale . " Added Rose : " I want to be able to sleep at night with a clear conscience . " But if that becomes impossible , " then I guess I 'll have to find another job . "
