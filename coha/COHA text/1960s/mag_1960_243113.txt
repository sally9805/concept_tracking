In the last decade , mutual funds have grown into a $15.8 billion business of 4,300,000 shareholders ' accounts , with surprisingly few complaints from investors or the SEC . Last week the industry had its first major proxy fight-a battle for control of Managed Funds , Inc . Partly as a result of the fight , SEC issued new restrictions on operations of mutual funds . <P> Trouble for Managed Funds began last July when SEC suspended Managed Funds ' registration , stopped the sale of its stock . At fault , said SEC , were the fund 's founders and chief officers , Hilton H. Slayton and Hovey E. Slayton . Although the Slayton cousins had built Managed Funds into a fund with 22,000 stockholders and investments of $80 million , SEC found that as Managed Funds ' managers , the Slay tons left much to be desired . <P> Fees , Fees , Fees . SEC " noted that while Managed Funds claimed that its primary objective was capital growth , the Slaytons manipulated the fund 's stock not for long-term gains but " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high uniform rate " in quarterly dividends . <P> Through their wholly owned company , Slayton Associates , the Slaytons were supposedly the investment advisers to Managed Funds , and collected more than $1,000,000 in five years for deciding what stocks the fund should buy or sell . In fact , said SEC , the Slaytons made no market decisions . They let Stephen M. Jaquith of Manhattan 's Model , Roland &; Stone brokerage firm choose what stocks to trade-and also gave Jaquith Managed Funds ' brokerage business . Jaquith 's commissions : $1,188,155 . Another Model , Roland &; Stone employee , who collected $240,831 : Harold W. Smith , Hovey Slayton 's brother-in-law . <P> Who Does What . When the Slaytons stepped out under SEC fire , the control of Managed Funds was up for grabs . A New Jersey mutual-fund and investment operator , Morris M. Townsend , moved in quickly , took an option to buy the old Slayton sales firms if he won the proxy battle , hired Slayton salesmen to sell Managed Funds shareholders the Townsend case . The Channing Corp. , headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds worth $218 million , challenged Townsend . It pointed out to Managed Funds ' stockholders that , if Townsend won , the Slaytons would reap another profit through the sale of Slayton firms to Townsend . This proved a decisive argument to disgruntled proxy voters ; last week Channing won handily by 500,000 votes . <P> SEC issued new sets of rules for the funds which are designed to eliminate the kind of temptation that got the Slaytons into trouble . Now all investment advisers must be specifically named , together with any fees they receive from mutual funds . Brokers must also be named , along with any " reciprocal business " arrangements they make with mutuals.
