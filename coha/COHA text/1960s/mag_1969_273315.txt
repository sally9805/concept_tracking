AMONG the thousands of groundlings who worked to make Apollo 8 a success , the person most responsible for the flight was a Vienna-born engineer named George Low , who is little known outside the NASA community . Low 's title is that of manager of the Apollo spacecraft program , and as such he was in charge of making certain that all the essential hardware , from the spaceship structure down to the smallest switch and relay , was in working order . But Low 's role in the Apollo program goes far beyond that : other , higher-ranking officials in NASA agree that had it not been for Low 's zeal , there would have been no Apollo 8 flight to the moon . <P> Low , 42 , came with his family from Austria to the U.S. in 1940 , when he was 14 . He took his degrees in aeronautical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NASA 's predecessor ) in 1949 , and nine years later became NASA 's chief of manned space flight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with some sort of circumlunar flight scheduled for some time in the unforeseeable future . In October 1960 , Low made the first official proposal that Apollo 's aim should be to land Americans on the moon . As NASA 's Washington-based chief of manned-space-flight programming , Low wrote : " It has become increasingly apparent that a preliminary program for manned lunar landings should be formulated . This is necessary to provide a proper justification for Apollo . " <P> - <P> Seven months later , as chairman of a committee investigating the problems of lunar landing , Low provided the facts and figures that persuaded newly elected President John F. Kennedy to declare that the nation 's aim should indeed be to achieve lunar landing within the ' 60s . <P> In 1964 , Low moved to Houston as deputy director of the Manned Spacecraft Center . That was his position when , in January 1967 , Astronauts Gus Grissom , Roger Chaffee and Edward White died during a ground test of an Apollo vehicle . <P> That disaster virtually brought the Apollo program to a halt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who could restore order within the program , and Low was the choice . In April 1967 , while preparing for takeoff from Washington National Airport in a small NASA Gulfstream turboprop , he was hustled off the airplane and into a nearby office . Recalls Low : " Everybody in the line of command above me in NASA seemed to be there . They asked me to take over management of Apollo . I probably would have liked some time to think about it , but since anyone I might have wanted to consult was already there in the room , there was no point in waiting . I said ' Yes , sir , ' and went to work . " <P> Ever since , Low has been working six-day weeks of up to 16 hours a day . The Apollo command module , with all its 2,000,000 parts , was torn apart , reexamined , and extensively redesigned at a cost of $75 million , an operation that set back Apollo 's timetable by many months . <P> - <P> Once he was satisfied with the redesigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became apparent that the earth-orbiting December flight of Apollo 8 would be delayed by problems with the lunar module , he proposed a bold plan : an Apollo 8 moon orbital mission-without the LM . He was more than convincing , and that is why Apollo 8 got the go-ahead for its historic trip .
