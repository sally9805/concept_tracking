The most debated experiment in U.S. plane fares in many years is something called one-class service . Started only five months ago by United Air Lines ' peppery President W. A. ( " Pat " ) Patterson , it is an effort to take the cramp out of coach travel and the expense out of first class with a single service that provides some of the first-class amenities at fares somewhat ( 10% ) above coach rates . United , the nation 's largest domestic airline , already uses one-class service on 30 daily flights across the U.S. Next week it will more than double the number of its one-class flights to 71 daily , expanding the service to 15 new U.S. cities . <P> Pat Patterson 's experiment-which only United has so far tried-has set off an argument among the nine other major U.S. airlines over whether they should follow suit . National 's Bud Maytag is an advocate of the single class-but would adopt it only if all other airlines did ; Eastern and Delta indicate that they might follow if United succeeds . But United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service will not spread . Last week Patterson 's archcompetitor , crusty C. R. Smith , 63 , president of second-place American Airlines , made clear how he feels . Said Smith : " A single class of service must be a compromise ; it can offer neither maximum economy nor maximum comfort and convenience . " <P> Less Crowding . What is the argument all about ? Aboard the 14 Boeing 720s that United has already converted into one-class service , five passengers are seated abreast instead of the uncomfortably crowded six in jet coach service ; the cabin is free of the usual class-dividing partitions . The new seats are two inches wider than in coach , and the leg room between seat rows has been slightly increased . A one-class 720 seats 109 passengers , ten fewer than in the usual two classes . Three stewardesses serve the passengers instead of the four on mixed planes . The meals are free , but the emphasis is on substantial food ( chicken , lamb chops ) instead of the gourmet specialties of first class-and the meals are served on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink is served free with meals , but no further liquor is sold on board . For one-class service , the price between New York and Chicago is $48 v. $54.75 for first class and $43.70 for coach . <P> The new fare has greatly simplified United 's reservations operations , but more than just business considerations prompted Pat Patterson to introduce one-class service . Two years ago , when a United DC-8 ran off a runway in Denver and hit a truck , 16 passengers died not from the impact of the crash but from burns and fume inhalation after crowded conditions in the coach section prevented them from getting out . Patterson is still bothered by the tragedy . Asks he : " Do narrow aisles and sardine seating provide adequate evacuation of jet aircraft ? In all good conscience , just how many passengers can you squeeze into a plane ? " Significantly , Patterson 's one-class planes have a 20-in. - wide aisle v. 17 in. in ordinary coach and 16 in. on the even more cramped aisles on some economy flights , which are used mostly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
