txt Coronado , Cal. , Feb. 4 ? When a North Korean boarding party seized the United States intelligence ship Pueblo a year ago , the Communists obtained at least 10 and possibly 11 bags of highly classified manuals , report s , and other secret material . The extent of this capture became public for the first time today when Rear Adm . Edward E. Grimm , member of the inquiry court , questiond Lt. Stephen R. Harris , of Melrose , Mass. , who was chief of the research-intelligence gathering department aboard the Pueblo . Destroy Banner Files Mm . Grimm asked Harris if the , reports from the Banner , the Pueblo 's sister ship which had made 15 trips into the same waters , were in the intelligence files . Harris replied that they were aboard Pueblo . had been classified seccret , arid he added " were destroyed . " " in extremis do you think it is better to burn material and fail and have it fall into the hands of the enemy or should you throw it over the side even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " I think it should go over the side , and that 's what I ordered , even tho Pueblo was only in 35 fathoms , " replied Harris . " That is why we loaded up all the bags we could get together and we got one at least and possibly more over into the water . " " One of 12 , " snapped Grimm . Harris meekly replied , " Yes , sir . " " You had 2 laundry . bags and 10 others of your prepared weighted bags , " Grimm asserted . Harris replied , " I am certain one bag went over , a man was badly wounded in the process , and there may have been more , but we ca n't be sure . " Identifies Red Ship Harris ' story of events within the so-called " spook " department of the Pueblo was a dramatic one . Hams had been called to the bridge when ' the North Korean submarine chaser first appeared to help identfy the type of ship . Returtling to his crypt ) , and research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone to the bridge area , he was not able to follow the action , but did know when the firing started . Altho no warning order was given , Harris said . he was very much aware of the need for destroying certain secret and important communications equipment and much material in printed form over which he had supervision . Within a few minutes after the firing began , altho the ship was not called to general quarters , the captain directed the destruction of the classified material to begin . Because the ship was inside the 100 fathom line , the socalled shallow water destruction plan , burning of all douments , had to be adopted . Decision to Surrender Harris said he had only eight men on duty to begin this work . and there was an enormous amount of printed material . some in book , some in chart form to be disposed of . Many small fires were started in metal waste baskets , and the confined areas of the department were soon filled with smoke , and the fires seemed merely to smoulder . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total disposition of the papers in " less than 10 or 12 hours . " And it was then that he began preparations , despite shallowness of the water , to jettison over the side . First word of the decision to surrender the ship came when Comdr . Lloyd M. Bucher , Pueblo captain , appeared in the communications office and sent a message to navy command , Japan , saying that he was about to give up the ship . Bucher did not say how soon surrender would come , but Harris said this occurred with arrival of the North Korean boarders 20 minutes later . Orders Bags Jettisoned While in the research department , Bucher saw the bags of publications ready for jettisoning and brusquely told Harris : " Get this stuff out of here . " " The captain , of course , already had ordered its destruction , and we were heavily involved in trying to carry it out , " Lt. Harris informed the five admirals . " There was an enormous volume of the paper . We were working under the most trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of the smoke , limited communications , and limited time , we all united in doing the best we could under the conditions . Earlier , Harris told of his and Bucher 's efforts to obtain a proper-sized incinerator for such burning and explosive devices for destroying equipment . Neither materialized , altho the navy , Harris said , recognized the request as " good . " Altho the North Koreans obtained the printed material , they found the secret communications and electronics surveillance gear " smashed virtually to powder " by his men 's sledgehammers , he said . Blindfolded , guarded b y bayonet-fixed riflemen , Harris was herded ashore with the rest of the crew . Then he was hunted out by name by a North Korean officer who returned him to the ship and demanded the opening of a safe-like door to the research department which had a numbered dial . Harris refused , was pounded and kicked for a short time , but insisted he did not know the combination . Eventually his captors took him ashore to his comrades . " They Knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew my name , " he said . Harris told the board that once the destruct order was given , he left his command areas only briefly to carry out a special obligation . This was to empty the registered publications safe and destroy the documents mid codes there . He said , " I did this myself to be sure it was done properly . " During the morning session of the inquiry , Lt. Edward R. Murphy Jr. , . Cal. , executive officer and navigator on the Pueblo , told his story of the abortive 12-day mission ending in the ship 's capture . Murphy , the second in command , insisted that navigation of the Pueblo had been carefully carried out . He vowed to the admirals that his ship had never violated the 12-mile territorial water limitation which North Korea claimed . He also described methods used by North Koreans in arriving at the 17 alleged intrusions into these same territorial waters . The communist captors , he explained , had used the Pueblo 's own charts and navigation logs in determining these alleged intrusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio navigation readings which they found recorded in the log . Under close questioning , Lt. Murphy insisted that the decision to surrender the ship without firing a shot was the only possible one .
