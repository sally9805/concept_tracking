This should be played with the intensity , determination and the control of a football game . At rise of Curtain the Stage is crowded with PEOPLE . No walking space is apparant . They carry banners and placards . Half the signs read : " DOWN WITH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT " ; the other half read : " BURN THE SEX MANIAC . " The Two GROUPS chant their desires , and stomp their feet on the Stage . There is a terrible screaming , and a WOMAN 'S BODY is handed up over the heads of the CROWD . It is mangled and bloody . She is placed in the arms of one of the POLICEMEN who ring the CROWD . POLICEMAN Who is she ? M A protester . She got trampled . POLICEMAN ( Hugs the CORPSE to him and kisses her bloody eyes . ) God have mercy . ( He carries the body Offstage . ) ( The CROWD splits and a wedge of space is formed .

( The PRISONER is held by two MEN in the CROWD . A young WOMAN in a wheel chair is pushed forward by her FATHER . The CROWD gives way to her . The CROWD with the signs saying " DOWN WITH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT " stop their stomping to listen . ) PROSECUTOR ( Addressing the audience who acts as a jury . ) Ladies and gentlemen of the jury . ( He stares seriously at them . ) I ask for your attention . I ask for your moral attention . I ask for the force of your communal judgment to be brought to bear on the unsavory creature who is to be tried here today in a completely fair and unbiased trial as is guaranteed by our great and glorious constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( RANCHMAN is pushed forward to be surveyed . ) R Hi , folks . ( He is dragged back a bit by two POLICEMEN . ) PROSECUTOR The State will prove for the sake of the people that this hideous monster , acting alone , interfered with the sacred bodies and sexual knowledge of four or more citizens of our fair states . The State will prove that this vicious , mad-dog wolf-man , acting alone , seized the physical sections of four or more citizens and violated the orifices of these same citizens . Violated them against their consent , against their will , against the laws of our glorious states and against the laws of God . p. 4 R Wow ! PROSECUTOR The State will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that this person who calls himself Ranchman , acting alone , is the vicious unsavory perpetrator of these crimes against the orifices of four or more separate citizens . And the State will demand and extract the ultimate penalty . R Extract of vanilla  --  or extract of malt ?

It will hurt me more to have to pronounce these words than it will for you to hear them , but justice must be served . R I 'd like mine rare . PROSECUTOR Ladies and gentlemen of the jury , cast your eyes to the witness stand . That 's right . Right there . There you see the four separate or more citizens whose privacy was violated by one Ranchman . ( He gestures to where the WITNESSES are : one young MAN with his hands clasped in front of him , and two middle-aged WOMEN  --  one whose head is fixed in a position in which she can only look up , and one whose head is fixed in a position in which she can only look down . ) Look over these pitiable and broken beings . Once perfect and dignified , once with the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow creatures have been assaulted , their tissues brutalized and torn , but worse still their self-image destroyed and deadened . Their lives twisted and wilted by this unremorseful sullen and violent blot  --  this Ranchman. p. 5 R That 's me , folks . PROSECUTOR This rapist Ranchman , acting alone , attacked under the cover of darkness , he wrenched them from innocent pursuits and took his pleasure . He took hold of their beautiful and silky bodies and forced them to act out his twisted and unnatural fantasies . Ladies and gentlemen of the jury . Look there at Nancy . ( He points to the GIRL in the wheel chair . ) He forced his way into her boy friend 's car , he crushed her boy friend 's skull and then he ( The CROWD gasping to cover what the PROSECUTOR is saying . The PROSECUTOR should use gobbledegook and double talk that sounds like legal terms for rape and perverted acts , but nothing recognizable . ) CROWD Oh , no ! PROSECUTOR Oh , yes . And then he And he And made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he pushed and pulled her and tore off and BURNING CROWD Look at his mouth . Self-satisfied . Lasciviousness drips from his lips . Insolent eyes . Did you notice ?  --  his eyes do n't match . You can tell a sex fiend by his eyes . Put your hand up and divide his face  --  see , one half of the face does n't match the other half . You can see it in the face of any fiend , just pick up any copy of Life magazine and you can see it . This trial is one more reason why we have to clean up the courts . Endless coddling of neanderthals like him . You ca n't even carry a concealed weapon to protect yourself from a maniac . Did you read about the woman who maced an attacker ? The judge found her guilty . This judge is not going to coddle Ranchman  --  it 's time someone stood up for the rights of the victim . He 's not going to be turned loose to dirty up any more lives . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . What 's happened to the good old days ? One man 's sweetheart is another man 's whore . What was that ? How did he do that ? Was there enough room in the front seat or were they in the back seat ? My daughter 's wearing a panty-girdle from now on  --  the way these kids dress nowadays makes everything too easy . This is too brutal . Genuine iniquity . Private citizens should n't have to hear such facts . Look at him dreaming in his chair  --  reliving every one of his defilements , he 's wallowing in the facts of his acts . He should be kept in solitary while we try him in absentia. p. 6 CRUSADER CROWD Look at the Prosecutor , see how he savors every one of those images . He must have done his homework reading the collected works of Marquis de Sade , memorized the Story of O , and confiscated the entire porno collection of Forty-Second Street . Look at his eyes gleam with lascivious righteousness as he terrifies the jury with the facts that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others . They 'll railroad him to atone for our unconscious desires . Sit up , Ranchman , do n't look so dreamy . Be serious , you have supporters . You do n't know what 's happening to you , but we do . If they can kill you , they can kill us too . We 'll fight for ourselves through you , Ranchman . Be impassive , we stand for you , help us to help you . What was that one ? I hav n't heard of it , was it in Latin ? Have you done it ? Is it possible ? Did she confess it , I mean testify ? Could you have said it out loud even if it was true ? Look at that well-dressed well-spoken pig . He 's a pig just the same , he talks like a pig talking to the pigs , and look at them wiggle and o-ing at every so-called act they say Ranchman committed . Some of the images work . I 'm getting hot . Let 's go home at recess and try that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock themselves in the bathroom for an hour before dinner . Why else are they here ? Did you see how they lined up at dawn to get seats ? They 've even brought their lunches in brown paper bags . Typical . R What language is spoken here ? p. 7 PROSECUTOR And because of this vicious mad-dog , Ranchman , our lovely fellow citizen , Nancy , since her brutal violation , has been confined to a mental hospital . Doctors have given up all hope of her recovery . R Chickens ! PROSECUTOR His additional victims in the good Lord knows what order , Mrs. Blue and Mrs. Black . ( He gestures to the SKY WOMAN and the GROUND WOMAN . ) Two mothers , ladies and gentlemen of the jury . Two mothers like those you may have at home or hidden in homes or farmed out , but nevertheless , ladies and gentlemen  --  mothers  --  innocent mothers of sons and daughters . The State will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the filth that had the temerity and the gall to violate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community to the extent that he did lay his body between the legs of these mothers in the dark of the night and that he did know them ; this complete stranger did know your mothers against their will  --  the State will prove that this filth had to be helped by none other than the devil himself . BURNING CROWD What a shame for their families . They 're still suffering . It 's bad enough it happened , but think how awful for them to have to relive it here in public . All to coddle that shit , Ranchman . If you needed any proof about the breakdown of morality in this country this is it . That Prosecutor is really giving it to him . I admire the way he can use words . And those kids spit on education . I bet his family worked hard to send him to law school . I 'd love to have a son like that . I 'd be so proud . They 're not all hippies . Only a tiny percent . They should make those jugheads bathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My friend could n't get a seat today because of those commie protesters squirming their way in . Wait till Wallace gets in  --  he said he 'd drag them by their hair and personally throw each one of those eggheaded-cry-babies into jail right along with Ranchman . He knows how to stand up for America . You can say that again . p. 8 CRUSADER CROWD Be realistic , Ranchman , demand the impossible . The more we make love , the more we want to make revolution , the more we make love . No God , no master , you are God , I am God . The family that disobeys together , stays together . Momism is groovy . My mother still loves me and she always did . I bet Ranchman 's mother would love him if she knew where he was . I love him like a mother . Up against the wall , motherfucker . America needs a bath in truth . Truth sucks . Roses are red , violets are blue , brutality is disgusting and so are you . R That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROSECUTOR Here is the living evidence of the encounter of Ranchman upon the bodies and souls of these once proud mothers . Mothers of our state . Mothers to be found in any state . ( He gestures to the SKY WOMAN and the GROUND WOMAN . ) One can not look down and the other can not look up . The shock of what he forced them to commit with him has caused a permanent hysterical disability . They will carry their scars with them the rest of their lives . Scars carved on their psyches , by this maddog excrement , this Ranchman . R I wonder what the poor people are doing ? PROSECUTOR And finally , ladies and gentlemen of the jury , the hardest task of all . The pice de rsistance , as far as we know . Step forward , William . A boy . One little boy , ladies and gentlemen . A more lovely , pretty little boy , unnaturally attacked in the most natural attractive spot  --  the beach . Ranchman seized and used a once beautiful container but when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wreck on the beach of life . William is now unable to study or think . He has n't slept a wink in six months . p. 9 R ( Genuinely saddened . ) The poor kid . PROSECUTOR Ladies and gentlemen of the jury , can you cast human eyes upon these pitiable creatures , creatures like you and me , and not ask for the supreme penalty from the one who disrupted their sweet sojourn through this vale of tears ? This man has made a mockery of the law and of the order . With the fawning , gleeful aid of the devil in his pants he has made a mockery of the exalted ruler of our spiritual lives . Yes , ladies and gentlemen of the jury , I 'm talking about God . Our God . My God . Your God . Their God . Look now at this blot of excrement dropped from the original sin . Look there at Ranchman , ladies and gentlemen . Judge him in your hearts , your heads . R Hey , and in the seat of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CRUSADER CROWD He gets a fair trial . He gets to speak his piece . Let 's hear his side of it . BURNING CROWD He should be dragged by his hair till his skin is shredded . He should be dragged by heels till his balls have repented . That little girl . A dear little girl . Our little girl was driven mad by the monster , driven mad by the sight , by the facts of his hands upon her . By the fact of his mouth upon her . May God cleanse her heart and blind her eyes to the fact of him . And our mothers ! That son-of-a-bitch dared to tear the dresses off our mothers . He should be drawn and quartered and his private parts fried in a fire before his eyes while he 's still alive . He raped our son . It 's hard enough to become a man these days , but he attacked a sapling who had n't grown its leaves yet . My God , what might he do to our father , he had n't been caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth and roast him slowly over the backyard barbecue . Let that be a lesson to one who would violate a private citizen in his dream of himself.Eye-witnesses . He 's identified . He 's the one . They 've sworn that Ranchman did it . p. 10 CRUSADER CROWD We 've only looked at the witnesses , they have n't proved a thing . Ranchman has n't had a chance to present his own defense . Yes , look at the little girl . A girl that pretty is capable of the wildest fantasies . An innocent face can mask a vibrant body , a soft young voice can be pleading inside for her release into a jungle state . This time is so perverted you get your sex via the media by way of the courtroom . No wonder the young ones are here . No wonder the mothers are here . No wonder the old ones watch on TV . The mothers have n't been anywhere since the Senior Prom anyway . We move for a mistrial ! The crowds and the press have convicted Ranchman before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies have convicted Ranchman already . There is a randy and rangy man , and let 's hear him speak the facts of his whereabouts before you convict him on the excitement of his sheer sexual pre-presence . All that the prosecution has placed on view is a man , who must be presumed innocent ! Did you do it , Ranchman ? Did you do it ? You do n't have to answer that . R You kids are awfully cute , and I enjoy the attention and all but I 'd rather have an apple . BURNING CROWD Get it over with . Lynch him and be done . CRUSADER CROWD Say something in your own behalf . R But I already had a bath . They washed me at the jail so 's I 'd be all shiny in courtroom . The King was in the counting house counting all his money , the Queen was in the parlor house beating bread and honey , the Prince was in the bathroom sinking submarines . And when the pie was opened it was full of birdseed. p. 11 PROSECUTOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you sal hepatica in your nightgown every night , do n't ya , Bobby Boop ! PROSECUTOR Where were you on the night of January 14th ? R Les see . Les see . The night of January 14th ? PROSECUTOR Where were you on the night of January 14th ? Answer yes or no . R What time was it ? PROSECUTOR Night time . R Night time . Oh , night time . Well , that makes a difference . PROSECUTOR Where were you ? R Well , the night time is the right time to counterattack a floating crap game , that is if you ca n't corner a quail . I 'm the guy what can run one if I run into one . JUDGE I direct you to answer the question . R I 'd rather be photographed . PROSECUTOR We have eyewitnesses who have positively identified you . R It was night time . How could they know who it was in the night time ? PROSECUTOR You were positively picked out of a lineup of eighteen men . p. 12 R ( Patting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't flattered , but I really ca n't claim it 's all that much more unique from Everyman 's . BURNING CROWD Get that arrogant bastard . CRUSADER CROWD Do n't talk , Ranchman . Do n't give them fuel for their fire . BURNING CROWD How long are you going to throw the taxpayer 's money down the rathole of that pervert ? I love the dress that Nancy 's wearing . Yes , it matches her eyes . Did it come from Orbach 's ? Looks more like Bendel 's . Gee , her dad went all out . His only daughter . You could eat her with a spoon . Stop coddling sex maniacs ! How many people have to be maimed for life before these perverts are put away for good ? The Prosecutor 's voice makes me cream my pants . Do you think that judge knows what he 's doing ? They 're all in league with the Communist-Mafia conspiracy . We 'll keep the heat on them . Everyone 's always concerned for the criminal 's rights . What about the victim ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak for him ? The courts have turned into a kindergarten for criminals . CRUSADER CROWD We 've got to get him a top lawyer . Who 's free ? He insists on defending himself . But he ca n't read . They 'll murder him . Call the Civil Liberties Union . He wo n't hear of it . He 'll play right into their hands . But he loves it . He says he has n't seen so many excited people in one place in his whole life . God , Nancy 's beautiful . Do you think he Keep your dreams to yourself ! What size shirt does he wear ? Did you see him breathe ? Did you see the way his chest rose under his shirt ? Electric hair . He has electric hair . That 's why they brought him in in the first place .

The other WOMAN 'S head is thrust forward and out , so that her eyes look continually downward . ) SKY WOMAN Have you testified yet ?

Ranchman must of thought the same thing . We collided under a birch . Were you in lover 's lane ? GROUND WOMAN No . My own bed . I heard a noise . If only I 'd kept my eyes closed I would n't have had to identify him . SKY WOMAN You had to come forward . Think of all the women who do n't .

Dogs do n't rape . Dogs are tended . Did you ever see the courtship dance of two dogs ? Have you watched the male kiss the eyes and ears of the female ? Have you seen the tenderness of his tongue and the attentiveness of his whimpers as he prepares her ? There 's nothing violent about dogs  --  unless they too are crazed  --  and provoked while in their madness . But it 's strange  --  when dogs are crazy they only bite men did you ever hear of a crazy dog biting a sane dog ? p. 15 SKY WOMAN He 's still a beast . GROUND WOMAN Yes , perhaps he is , perhaps we are . So unreasonably vicious desperate for something to be right ? A living body is so beautiful . I can understand . SKY WOMAN He should have to play before his inner eye every event of that day . Every gesture , every growl , every moan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over and over and over , as I 'm condemned to do .

PROSECUTOR You 've done enough . R Hi , Nancy . ( NANCY , like a catatonic , looks straight ahead . ) JUDGE Order in the court . I must ask for silence or I shall hold you in contempt . R I agree , Your Honor . Everyone here 's too noisy and mean looking . They look contemptible to me too , except for Nancy . Why are you staring like that , Nancy ? Gee , she has pretty hair .

Until he shined that lamp in my face . That 's the man , sir . That man there . That man called Ranchman there . CRUSADER CROWD See there . She 's the one who 's sick . Ranchman did n't do it . She wanted him to do it to her . She wanted John Jay Kennelworth to do it to her but he did n't , so she conjured Ranchman to do it to her . Any man would have done .

I told all the guys you could tell the girls who 'd do it by the size of their asses . It was me who tied Linda Lawton to the oak tree in the vacant lot . But Ray Miller tore her clothes off .

Enjoy him while you can . ( He starts out. )               @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
