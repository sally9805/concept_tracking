When the Pilgrims first landed , they found the Nauset Indians using a bright red waxy berry that seemed good to eat as well as valuable for making poul tices and preserving game . The Indians called the berry sassamanesh ; the Pilgrims rechristened it the cranberry . At first confined to New England , and mainly to Cape Cod , as a diet staple and profitable source of income , the cranberry gradually conquered the holiday tables of the nation . This month , when Americans buy more cranberries than at any other time of the year , no Thanksgiving dinner will be considered complete without them . The most important fact about the $54 million cran berry industry , however , is that its health no longer depends on just the traditional holiday trade ; cranberry products have grown into year-round sellers that compete with other foods for everyday use . <P> Behind this transformation is Ocean Spray of Hanson , Mass. , which produces 85% of all the cranberries grown in the world , has annual sales of $46 million .
