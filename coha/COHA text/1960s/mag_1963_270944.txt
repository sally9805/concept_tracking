At a meeting in Victoria , campaigning Prime Minister Sir Robert Gordon Menzies was interrupted by a woman who asked what he proposed to do for young married people . " Madam , " Menzies shot back , " I gather you are neither young nor married . " <P> Though 68 and rumored in poor health , Menzies on the stump was brimming with energy , showing himself by turns genial , scornful and witty . Since 1961 his government had balanced on the razor edge of a slender majority of two in Australia 's House of Representatives . By calling national elections a year earlier than legally required , he hoped that Australia 's current prosperity would carry him to victory . Unemployment is down to a negligible 2% , exports are up , car registrations have increased 100,000 over the first half of this year . <P> But the opposition Labor Party under Arthur Calwell , 67 , charged that 14 years in power have left the Liberals stale and tired , attacked Menzies for failure to spur economic growth . Hard-pressed by his party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong antiCommunist , nevertheless sought to embarrass Menzies by demanding 1 ) joint control , rather than exclusive U.S. control , of the huge U.S. Navy Communications Center now abuilding on the barren west coast of Australia , 2 ) a nuclear-free zone in the Southern Hemisphere and 3 ) recognition of Red China . That , countered Menzies , " would give Peking a smashing victory . " Calwell also asked for a treaty with Malaysia , enabling Australian troops to remain in the Malay peninsula . Such a treaty is impossible , Menzies replied , because Malaysia , already accused of " neocolonialism " by Indonesia 's Sukarno , must appear neutral . <P> At week 's end the nation 's 5,800,000 compulsory voters ( failure to vote brings a fine of $4.50 ) handed Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies a landslide victory . With only three seats still to be decided , Menzies ' coalition captured 70 seats , as against 49 for the Labor Party .
