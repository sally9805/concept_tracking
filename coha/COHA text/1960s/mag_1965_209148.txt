Pope Paul <P> Sir : Berks 's sculpture of Pope Paul : magnificent ! Your cover Sept. 24 : great ! Viva Pope Paul ! <P> GABRIELLA LINDO New York City <P> Sir : The cover was a great shock and disappointment to me . It seems a pity that such a great person as the Pope should be pictured as a cracked piece of clay . <P> ( MRS . ) JOSEPHINE RAIMONDI Philadelphia <P> Sir : Your story is a masterful attempt to unconfuse the confused . <P> EDWARD L. OWEN JR . Valhalla , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : I am puzzled by your cover story . It is incompetent , disrespectful , and may harm the ecumenical movement and the papal peace plea at the U.N . <P> DAVID F. REA New York City <P> Sir : You ask : " Will the Pope 's words of peace have any more impact than those he has littered in Rome during the past two years ? " No ! Nothing the Pope utters will have any impact as long as he refuses to expiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other " accursed " people during the almost two millennia of the church 's existence . <P> THOMAS KIERNAN Editor Philosophical Library New York City <P> Sir : Pope Paul might contribute to peace by staying in Rome and working to get the Vatican Council to pass a meaningful statement on religious liberty . He might liberalize his church 's birth-control laws . The population explosion contributes to unrest , and the Pope can slow it down . His trip will do about as much good as the trips of those do-gooders who invaded the South in clerical garb instead of working at home for these worthy causes . <P> ( THE REV . ) F. RICHARD BENKEN The Lutheran Church Madison , Conn . <P> On War <P> Sir : While I salute your Essays as an attack on anti-intellectualism , " On War as a Permanent Condition " Sept. 24 made me rueful . You apologize for our Viet Nam presence by arguing that our interests , political , economic and moral , are served by this engagement . Eventually , we shall see that " freedom " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic-political over the moral . <P> WILLIS E. ELLIOTT United Church Board for Homeland Ministries New York City <P> Sir : You write : " No man of dignity can shrink from war if he is to preserve his freedom . " Quite a few men have done just that : Jesus , Buddha , Francis of Assisi , William Penn , Gandhi and Schweitzer , to name the more illustrious . <P> ALBERT C. SCHREINER Ossining , N.Y . <P> Sir : I laud your Essay . At last somebody has defended war as the expedient it can sometimes be in solving international problems . Too many pacifists and bleeding hearts have vilified war in favor of negotiations , when in some cases water , not words , is needed to extinguish fire . <P> ERIC O. BERGLAND Rockford , Mich . <P> India v. Pakistan <P> Sir : Your cover story on the war in Asia Sept. 17 is the most factual piece I have read . Not only have you dug up the background , but you have interpreted the Pakistani way of thinking . In April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this fight was coming : the Paks were painting their ground equipment battle-grey over the original yellow , were building revetment for their aircraft , etc . Thank you for your article . It will be saved for my son 's children . <P> BERNARD E. ANDERSON Lieutenant Colonel , U.S.A.F. Battle Creek , Mich.
