THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment TT this time of year , gubernatorial inaugurations come around like Christmas bills to remind us of the cost of our past whims . In the January following an off-year election , those who have faith in the efficacy of ceremonies can he forgiven for believing that the reason governors are so often elected President is that everyone sees them in a dress rehearsal  --  hand on the Bible , resolute look in the eye , proud wife sitting nearby . This year , the governors themselves seemed to be carried away by the parallel with the Presidency : Nelson Rockefeller 's inaugural address called for a Just Society , and Ronald Reagan of California proposed a Creative Society . We have never understood why every President since the New Deal has thought he had to have a slogan , or subtitle , of his own to identify his program , like racing colors . If we had our way , anybody who invented a slogan for a President would have to register with the Justice Department , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it , what had possessed him to foist it upon the public , why he was n't in the soap-advertising game if his mind ran in that direction , and what steps lie recommended to purge the language of his brainchild if it turned out to he meaningless or confusing . We are still puzzled by the Great Society . Lately , we have been disturbed to read that the war in Vietnam might mean the end of it  --  before we even know for certain what it is . For some reason , Rockefeller and Reagan , who are supposed to belong to the opposition , have chosen to emulate this sloganeering , and now every governor will probably want a slogan of his own . The new slogans are hound to be created by the same people who think up the state slogans on license plates . It should he said in Reagan 's favor that there was something creative about his inauguration . He managed to build a three-day ceremony around the oath-taking despite the fact that he had inadvertently taken the oath the previous week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed some papers he was n't supposed to have signed , and the press reported that he had been made governor by mistake  --  precisely what the Democrats had been saying all along . We do n't think the premature oath-taking was a mistake ; it was merely the way any experienced actor would handle the assignment . We ca n't imagine how Reagan 's performance at Sacramento could have been any more impressive than it was , even if there had been some reason for the ceremony . We were only surprised at the absence of the announcement " Portions of This Program Have Been Prerecorded . " Although we see the completely ceremonial ceremony as a natural concomitant of the election of actors to public office , Lester Maddox , of Georgia , who was elected governor by the state 's legislature last week , had a reason of his own for using the Reagan method : the fear that if he waited to take the oath until the bleachers were erected and the bunting was tacked on , some court might decide that he was not really the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the November election between Maddox , a poor boy who worked his way up in the world peddling first fried chicken and then segregation , and Howard ( Bo ) Callaway , a rich boy who plunged straight into the segregation field , apparently by choice . It is not unusual in such instances to hear that supporters of one candidate nr the other went to court to argue that their man should be declared the winner . The surprising feature of the Georgia situation was that a number of citizens  --  many of them advertised as particularly conscientious and civic-minded went to court to argue that neither candidate should he made governor . These Georgians showed themselves to be traditionalists in believing in the continued existence of equality of opportunity in the United States , their position being , as we see it , that if Lester Maddox had been given all the advantages of wealth and education , he would have merely grown up to be Howard ( Be ) Callaway . However , although it may not have been their intention , they introduced a revolutionary political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act to perform during a campaign for governor is to work against having a governor . They may seem to have approached heresy in maintaining that the democratic process might best be served by not electing a representative of the people a representative who might want to play charades with the federal government in a schoolhouse doorway , for instance  --  hut , of course , they knew their candidates better than we do . Ford 's Theatre PRESIDENT LINCOLN was not in the audience on August 27 , 1863 , when Ford 's Theatre opened for business on Tenth Street , Northwest , in Washing-to 11W ton , with a play called " The Naiad Queen . " During the next twenty months , however , he was on hand for nine performances there , including , in November , 1863 , " The Marble Heart , " which starred John Wilkes Booth . The last play given in the theatre was " Our American Cousin " ? on Good Friday , 1865 , the night of his assassination . In the next weeks , a number of ministers around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murder was not irrelevant to the tragedy . " Would that Mr. Lincoln had fallen elsewhere than at the very gates of Hell ! " declared one Detroit preacher . " How awful and severe the rebuke which God has administered to the nation for pampering such demoralizing places of resort ! " A hundred and two years will have passed when , on April 14th , Ford 's Theatre again opens its doors looking as it did on the fatal evening . A few days ago , we had a talk with Sointu Syrjala , a Broadway and television scene designer who has been working on the rebuilding of the stage area for the National Park Service of the Department of Interior , which is in charge of the restoration project . A round , smiling man with a round head , round gray eyes , round horn-rimmed glasses , and a neatly curving gray mustache , Syrjala explained that " Sointu " is the Finnish word for " harmony , " his parents having been not only Finnish but musically inclined . He went on to tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , when he was designing the sets for an N.B.C . dramatization of the assassination . " I 'd been in and out of Washington for y ears , and often seen signs pointing to Ford 's Theatre , so , in all innocence , I stopped by the place , expecting to find most of my work done fur me , " he said . " To my astonishment , there was n't a theatre there at all . Although the outer shell looked about as it had in Lincoln 's time , the place had been a government office building since 1865 . There was a small museum , with some relics of the sad occasion  --  a sofa that had been in the Presidential box , for instance , and the flag that Booth caught his spur in when he plunged over the side . But the only sign that there had ever been a theatre there was a curved line of paint on the first floor showing where the stage had been , and some painted footsteps marking Booth 's route as he fled toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Park Service 's chief historian for the Washington area , was able to lend me some pictures , and the TV show went on . That was the end of that until March , 1963 . By then , I was under contract to C.B.S. , shuttling between sets For ' The Guiding Light ' and sets for ' Secret Storm . ' Out of die blue , Colonel Truett called and asked if I 'd he interested in working on the Ford 's Theatre restoration , which Congress was about to appropriate money for . I certainly was interested . " In the summer of 1964 , Congress appropriated $2,073,600 for the proj-ect , and the restoration work began . Clues to exactly what was to he re-stored were remarkably sparse , Syrjala told us . By order of Secretary of War Stanton , Ford 's Theatre had remained closed for three months after the as-sassination , and then he had given or-ders for it to he dismantled and con-vened into a three-story office building fur the use of the War Department . The stage , the proscenium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ripped out , and the first floor was soon piled high with War Department pension records . " As you prob-ably know , some Lincoln-assassination huffs regard almost any-thing Stanton did as evidence of his having helped plot Lincoln 's murder , " Syrjala said . " He does seem to have been in an unseemly hurry to obliterate the scene  --  or scenery  --  of the crime . " In fact , when Stanton heard that Mat-hew Brady , who had a studio on Penn-sylvania Avenue , not far from Ford 's , had managed to photograph the inside of the theatre a few days after the assas-sination , he ordered the plate destroyed . Brady complied , but he made sure that a print survived , and also some other plates , which Stanton apparently did n't know about . " They made all the differ-ence to me , " Syrjala told us , gratefully . " I like to think of Brady ducking around the corner carrying those heavy wet plates that photographers had to work with in those days . Only six of his pho-tographs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these and pored over them as if they were the Dead Sea Scrolls . From them I found nut things like the patterns of the val-ance and the main curtain , and the way the footlights looked . ' Then , with the help of George Olszcwski , who suc-ceeded Colonel Truett about a year ago as the chief historian for the Washing-ton area , I went after the other major source  --  newspaper stories of the time , especially those giving the testimony in the Surratt trial . There I found refer-ences to colors , materials , the position of the scenery painter 's bridge , the way the stage machinery worked . One line of testimony gave us our only descrip-tion of the drop curtain ? a woodland scene with a bust of Shakespeare . ' So I just took an old Thomas Cole land-scape , pulled out sonic of the Taj Mahals he liked to park among his clouds , and stuck Shakespeare up there . But for the main curtain , which Brady photographed , every scroll and loop had to be in place . Somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , authenticity was to he overruled only in favor of utilitarian requirements such as electrical wiring and sir-conditioning and central-heating equipment , Syrjala said . But matters got more complicated about eighteen months ago , when the Interior Department accepted an Actors ' Equity proposal that the new Ford 's he not just a historical replica but a working theatre , where plays popular in the mid-nineteenth century could he given , and perhaps modern plays dealing with Lincoln . Since then " to the sound of some historians sobbing in the wings , I 'm afraid , " in Syrjala 's words  --  there have been a good many further changes . Because of fire laws , for instance , the seating has been reduced from seventeen hundred  --  the capacity in Lin-coin 's day  --  to eight hundred . Delegates from the National Repertory Theatre and some associated groups are still negotiating with the Interior Department about how and when the play season will begin . The only set being built for the theatre so far is one that Syrjala designed for Act III , Scene 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Lincoln was shot  --  and the plan is to have this in place during the dedication ceremony on April 14th . " There is n't going to he any Mme. Tussaud tableau , however , with grisly wax figures in the Presidential box waiting for the worst , " the designer assured us . " The box will be furnished but unoccupied . I expect people 's eyes will steal op there from time to time , but I hope that what they 'll think of is Lincoln rocking hack and forth in his walnut rocking chair , having fun . I 'm glad the capital is finally honoring the other Lincoln  --  the one who did n't worry about what the voters would think if he patronized a place that many of diem considered wicked and disreputable . And who enjoyed laughing at corny jokes . ' Our American Cousin ' is a comedy , you know . " Syrjala hesitated . " I must have tried a. dozen times to get through it , " he went on , shaking his head . " Perfectly znuf ul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happenings , but we were inveigi ci into attending another one  --  or at least a rehearsal for one  --  at a friend 's studio deep in the East- Village the other day at high noon . Ten or twelve other people were there when we arrived , and we sat on an orange crate for half an hour or so watching without any noticeable aesthetic benefit while a blond girl in black rompers and a Negro girl in white rompers self-consciously went about disentangling three or four hundred wire coat hangers that had been woven together into an oval mass and suspended between two coatracks . There was a white backdrop behind the girls , and lights of various colors washed over the scene from time to time . The coat hangers had been painted red , white , and blue , and the girls dropped them on the floor one by one as they pulled them free . We ate a couple of sardines and some crackers that we found on a plate , and drank a paper cup of vague punch that somebody handed us . Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear and sunny , and we headed down toward the East River , not paying much attention to the route we took . Presently , we found ourself in Peck Slip , watching a flock of herring gulls as they swooped and wheeled above the Circle Fish Company , at the corner of Front Street . It was a fine sight . The birds were zeroing in on a box of fish scraps at the edge of the sidewalk , and made exquisite navigation .. al adjustments with their wing tips as they sailed down , but their grace deserted them from the instant they actually landed , lurching and sprawling on the cobblestones , until they regained their balance and folded their long , slender wings . Then they marched straight for the fish scraps . Sometimes two gulls got hold of the same strip of fish and there would be a tug of war . This reminded us of the two girls pulling on the coat hangers , and we wished that the people in the studio could have seen what we were seeing . After a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes in the gloom under the East Side Express Highway and sometimes in the cold sunlight . We were trudging in the shadows when we reached Rutgers Slip , and as we cleared the corner of a bleak warehouse on our right we stopped for a moment to admire a great stark-white ship 's prow thrusting up diagonally , and far over our head , from the slip at Pier 36 , the Belgian Line dock . The ship  --  the Montalto , a nine- or ten-thousand-ton cargo vessel  --  had a pink superstrtictore , and seemed quite deserted . So did the Belgian Line dock , although it was a Friday  --  a workday  --  and only about three o'clock . Then we noticed a small commotion , a stir , at the north end of the slip . A number of uniformed men  --  we took them to be policemen , because of their badges and caps and pistols  --  were moving this way and that in a hurry , as if in the performance of some assigned , urgent duty . An athletic-looking young man in a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the slip , peering over the side . We drew closer , and one of the uniformed men , who seemed to be searching for something , told us as he passed , " They ' got a dog in the water . We need a rope or a board , or something , to get him out . " INre heard a strangled kind of howl just before we reached the end of the slip , where we could see , and there in the filthy water at the northwestern corner of the slip was the dog , a small hrown mongrel . He was pawing futilely at the flotsam accumulated there  --  rotted bits of wood , paper plates , and the usual waterfront scum trying to find something sub-stantial , which would support him . Each stroke of his front legs lifted him out of the water almost to his chest , and every breath was a whimper . " He ai n't gon na last long ! " one of the men shouted . " The water 's too cold ! " The young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog , and he sat down and took his shoes off , but the dog turned just then and swam away , out toward the prow of the Montalto . The dog 's eyes were squinting with his effort to keep afloat , and by this time only his head and his churning forefeet were visible . " Crazy fool ! " the young man shouted angrily , putting his shoes hack on . Another man called , " Here , puppy ! Here , puppy ! " We heard running behind us , and turned to see a heavyset man in uniform hurrying up , carrying a truck 's inner tube with a rope attached to it . He had come from a Wells Fargo armored-car garage directly across the street , and we realized then that the uniformed men were armored-car guards or drivers . The man with the inner tube swung it hack and forth several times , taking aim , and then let fly with it . It fell a little short of the dog , but the dog heard the splash and swam quickly toward this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . He tried to get his chin over its rounded bulk and could n't , and he pawed at it frantically for a moment or two but could find no purchase for his feet . He gave one desperate lunge , trying to climb up on the slippery rubber , but he missed , slid back , and sank out of sight . Everybody groaned as the water closed over the little brown head , but suddenly the dog bobbed up again , gave a gurgling yelp , and headed once more out toward the prow of the Montalto . He was n't giving up , but he seemed to he weakening fast . Everyone tried to call the dog hack inshore . Some of the men cried " Here , puppy ! " over and over , some whistled , and one man got down on his knees and barked . Another guard came running up with a length of white plastic rope , about the thickness of clothesline , and made a lariat of it . He stood swinging it expectantly while the dog brushed against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , the dog turned back toward shore and began paddling for the end of the slip where the men were . When he was about halfway there , the plastic rope shot out toward him , and draped itself over his head and shoulders , but as the man who had thrown it was drawing it in , trying to catch the dog in its coils , he swam right through it . The rope floated on the surface , but the dog put no faith in it , and continued to paddle toward shore . He was whimpering all the while , going " Htnm , hrnm , limm . " A heavy tire casing , flung by still another would-be rescuer , struck the water directly in front of the dog 's nose , and he clutched it with his front legs , only to have it turn over and sink beneath him . The heavy casing carried the dog down with it , but only for an instant . He came up quickly , snorting and shaking his head . He turned first one way and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything seemed to be going wrong for him , but he resumed his course toward the head of the pier . The young man took off his shoes again , and his windbreaker and his beret , and crawled along the edge , searching for a handhold by which he could let himself down into the water . He was a good-looking young man , with black eyes , black hair , and classic Italianate features . " Atta boy , Tommy ! " one of the Wells Fargo men shouted . Several of them gathered around him to do what they could to help . " Do n't jump in there , Tommy ! " another one cautioned . " It 's danger-GUS . It 's full of junk  --  iron chairs , bedsprings , car fenders . " Tommy dropped over the side of the pier , took hold of a big iron stud jutting out of the concrete where a long-vanished timber stringpiece had once been bolted , and lowered himself from that to a surviving stringpiece that was barely visible under a foot and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shivered for a moment and made a face , but then he knelt down and held a hand out toward the dog , who surged toward him as best he could . When the dog was within reach , Tommy grabbed him by the nape of the neck with his left hand and snatched him out , stiff-legged and dripping . Tommy managed to pull himself erect , still holding the dog , and passed him up to one of the older guards , who had to stretch to reach him . The guard cuddled the dog in his arms , like a baby , and ran across the street to the Wells Fargo garage . Several Wells Fargo men ran with him , and the others on the pier were jumping up and down and slapping one another on the shoulders . " Hey ! Somebody give me a hand up ! " yelled Tommy , who was still standing on the stringpiece , almost up to his knees in the ice-cold water . Four or five arms groped down for him , their owners lying fiat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing in his socks on dry land , with both legs and one arm sopping wet . His teeth were chattering , and his forearms and his chin were trembling . He jogged up and down for a moment on his toes , and swung his arms to get the circulation going . " Where 's the pup ? " asked Tommy , pulling on his windbreaker . " Jack Lee took him over to the garage , " someone told him . Tommy pulled on his beret and started across the street , and we followed him , along with the others . One of the guards , a man named Howard Donovan , ran back to get Tommy 's shoes , and as he caught up with us again , we asked him who Tommy was . " That 's Tommy Gallagher , " Donovan told us . " He 's one of us  --  a Wells Fargo driver . " We said that he looked more Italian than Irish , and Donovan said , " That 's funny , you know . He looks Italian , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian and looks Irish . He 's quite a guy . Used to do a lot of fighting  --  amateurs . He won the Golden Gloves subnovice welterweight championship in 1959 , and the All European and the Fifth Corps championships in the Army in 1960 . He came with us after the Army . Lives in Brooklyn . " We asked him whom the dog belonged to . " Never saw him before , " Donovan said . " I was the one that spotted him in the water . I just happened to look , and there he was . " Inside the garage , a one-story building that took up most of the block between Rutgers Shp and Jefferson Street , the dog lay stretched out on a bale of money sacks , and four or five men , kneeling in a huddle , were all trying to massage him at once , using the sacks for towels . He was shaking violently and still whimpering . Tommy , who was shaking , too , looked at him without much expression and put on his shoes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the dog a pat . " Why do n't we take him down to the boiler room , jack ? " one of the guards suggested . " It 's warmer down the re . " Jack Lee , the man who had taken charge of the dog , considered this for a moment and then stood up . He began wrapping the dog in an armful of money sacks , and someone else ran outside and opened the cellar doors on the sidewalk . One after another , the men climbed down a perpendicular steel ladder into a small basement , twelve or fifteen feet square , which had a No. 3 Ideal Red-flash oil-burner set against the far wall , behind a cement parapet about a foot high . They made a pallet of money sacks just inside the parapet , put the dog on it , and covered him with more money sacks . The dog 's eyes were squeezed shut . He was still shaking and crying , and the men rubbed him vigorously . " I know what he needs , " one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back in a moment with a half-pint bottle of bourbon . " Give him a shot of this , " he said . He poured a dollop of the whiskey into an empty bottle he picked up from the boiler-room floor , and handed it to Jack . Then he poured a drink into the cap of his own bottle and offered it to Tommy Gallagher . " Nah ! " said Tommy , shaking his head . " I only had one drink in m3-life . " " Go on , go on You need it to warm you up , " the guard insisted , and the other men nodded encouragement . Tommy accepted the bottle cap and took a hesitant sip . " Boy , that stings ! " he spluttered . Jack Lee poured a little whiskey between the dog 's clenched teeth , but since the dog was lying on his side , it went through his mouth and dripped into the money sacks . Lee lifted the dog 's head , pried his jaws open a fraction , and poured in another dose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his pallet and stood on his hind legs , gasping and stretching himself stiffly as the men restrained him gently . His eyes opened wide , but he was n't looking at anything , and the men cased him back down on the pallet . He was still whimpering , but not quite so piteously . The whiskey seemed to have helped . Tommy Gallagher swallowed the rest of his bourbon and handed the cap back to the man with the bottle . He grimaced , rubbed his mouth with the back of his hand , and pushed his way in to give the dog another pat . " Your first ball of booze , hey , Poochie ? " he said . " Well , it 's my second . " His eyes were shining . He looked at the dog again . " Say , you 're a girlie , ai n't you ? " he said , in surprise . " What are we going to do with her , Tommy ? " Jack Lee asked , still rubbing the dog . " Why not keep her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll call her Fargo . She can be a mascot . " " We better get her some milk , and leave it with the night man , " Jack Lee said . " He can warm it up for her . " " I got to get home and put some dry clothes on , " Tommy said . " So long , guys . See you Monday . " He mounted the ladder , followed by Donovan . AVe climbed up after them and offered our congratulations to Tommy , who accepted them modestly . NVe asked him when he 'd taken his first drink , and he grinned and said , " Hah ! That was the day I got married ! " He got into a Chevrolet hardtop parked under the Highway and drove off toward Brooklyn .
