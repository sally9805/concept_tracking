Just 40 miles south of San Francisco stretch the white sands of San Gregorio . One of the West Coast 's most beautiful beaches , it is also one of the most secluded . The 1-mile stretch is hemmed in by steep sand cliffs , access is difficult and for some thirty years it has been a hideaway for a quiet band of nudists-men , women and sometimes whole families who descend on weekends and merrily remove their clothes . <P> Unlike many nudist colonies , which wall themselves in like monasteries , forbid liquor and anything that smacks of bodily contact , San Gregorio is considered a " free beach , " i.e. where bathers are free to wear or doff what they please . One flamboyant japer paraded around on his first day wearing bright red knee-length socks and nothing else . " Here there are no boundaries , no police , no rules , " said University of California Coed Nancy Harris . " Nobody bugs you . " <P> It took Darrell Tarver , a 28-year-old Air Force veteran and senior at San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a wider public . With a group of friends , he formed the " Committee for Free Beaches , " circularized the campuses of San Francisco and Berkeley , and soon more than 500 nudists each Sunday were wending their way to San Gregorio . " The greatest beach in the world , " said one stark-naked Foothill Junior College student , happily surveying the scene . " This is the best incentive I have to stay slim , " cried a Botticellian Berkeley coed as she raced into the combing breakers . <P> Human Chains . But with crowds , the idyl became chaotic . Bands of enthusiastic gawkers appeared , manning spyglasses from behind the bushes ; planes from nearby Half Moon Bay Airport began buzzing the beach . Then one outraged parent claimed that his 14-year-old daughter had been persuaded to disrobe in public while visiting San Gregorio with another family . The father tried to press charges , but the county district attorney 's office ruled that the incident constituted neither lewd nor obscene conduct , and the case never made it to court . Nonetheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> With reporters prowling the area , Dairy Farmer Walter Bridge , who owns one of the two primitive roads leading to the beach , closed the path when newspapers publicized the fact that he was charging $1 for parking . That left only one access road through the jointly owned property of two avowed anti-nudists , and last week this too was closed with an armed guard to bar the way . But nothing seemed to daunt the enthusiastic nudists , who continued arriving wave on wave . Some made their way around the southern promontory at low tide ; others formed human chains down the dangerous cliffside paths . All kept their sneakers on , at least until they hit the beach .
