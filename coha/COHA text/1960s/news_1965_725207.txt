txt Houston The mission of Gemini 6-7 was a triumphant success . Gone are any lingering doubts that men can adapt to weightlessness and function for lOng periods . in the cramped quarters of a spaceship . The fortnight 's brilliant display of spacemanship by Astronauts Frank Borman and James A. Lovell proved that men can live under such conditions and maintain their alertness , efficiency , and good humor . Gone , too , is any uncertainty about being able to master the difficult art of rendezvous within the next few years . The virtuoso exhibition of piloting given last Wednesday by Astronauts Walter M. Schirra and Thomas P. Stafford showed that American space-flight experts have a firm grasp on how to do that vital job . The knowledge that has thus been gained on long-duration space flight and on rendezvous has moved American space-flight development a giant step forward . Aft ere Irects watched In gaining it , the United States added three orbital " firsts " to its space flight laurels : ? Four astronauts were in orbit at once . ? Astronauts Borman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having logged more than 330 hours and 35 minutes each . ? And , of course , the four astronauts car- ried through the first orbital rendezvous and formation flight . The word from the first physicals was that the astronauts were in good condition ? " better than expected . " Astronauts Borman and Lovell , smiling and waving , walked across the deck of the aircraft carrier Wasp Saturday morning to the debriefing room , after having ended their epic space voyage with splash-down in the Atlantic at 9:05 a.m. e.s.t . Saturday . Early computations indicated that Astronauts Borman and Lovell had splashed down within eight miles of the Wasp . The fact that the astronauts could stand and walk is considered very significant . It // Gemini space effort takes giant leap forward // shows that whatever the effects of weight ! essness may eventually be found to be , the astronauts were not incapacitated upon their return to the earth 's gravitational environment . Even before the Gemini 7 crew reentered the atmosphere , Dr. Charles A. Berry , chief of medical programs for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been learned about weightlessness . At a press conference Friday he remarked , " We sit here with a big smile on our face today because the crew is really in excellent shape . . . . Once they did adapt to weightlessness , well , thejf 've stayed pretty much at that adaptive level . " The adaptation of which he was speaking is a general physiological adjustment . It includes such factors as rate of heart beat which adjusts to the fact that the blood is weightless . Dr. Berry explained that Astronauts Borman and Lovell appear to have adapted to weightlessness in the first three or four days of their 14 ? day flight . It now looks as though once astronauts have so adapted , there is no further adjustment of consequence regardless of how long they stay in orbit . Now , Dr. Berry and his associates are studying the astronauts exhaustively to make sure there are no subtle effects of weightlessness that show up after one returns to the earth . If Astronauts Borman and Lovell do have no more trouble readapting to earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would mean that extended weightlessness holds no danger . " That , " Dr. Berry said , " would be a very valuable and vital piece of information . " Meanwhile , Dr. Berry says he is tremendously pleased with the way the Gemini 7 crew held up under . the cramped conditions of spaceship life . " I think we all had some little doubts inside ourselves about how well man could do in that kind of cramped space for 14 days . . . , " he explained . Now , he said , it has been shown " not only that he can live there , but that he can perform there at a very high level of performance . " He added that " . . . this crew is really in excellent sha'pe . . . . You ca n't help but be impressed by their attitude . " Experiment canceled Among other things . Astronauts Borman and Lovell have done well in carrying out a variety of measurements and experiments assigned them . Astronaut Elliot M. See , one of the capsule communicators in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been extremely successful overall . " One experiment was canceled early in the flight . It involved measuring stars with a photometer . The instrument did not work properly . If you forget about that one experiment , Mr. See said , the degree of accomplishment would average out to 87 percent . This percentage refers to the number of times the astronauts worked taking measurements or making photographs out of all possible chances they had for working . Mr. See explained that only a couple of good observations are needed to give the data wanted . Thus , most of the experiments by far were worked on to the point where the scientists who designed them got the desired information . Viewed from this standpoint , Mr. See said , many of the tasks could be considered fulfilled . " I would say we 've done as good as could possibly be done , " he added . Warning light The Gemini spacecraft also is considered one of the stars of the mission . Minor equipment troubles that had at times loomed large receded into true perspective as Gemini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gemini 6 were remarkably smooth  --  working ships . Shortly after Gemini 7 left Pad 19 at 2:30 p.m. , e.s.t. , Dec. 4 , Frank Borman reported that a warning light was indicating a pressure imbalance in one of two fuel  --  cell batteries . These were the craft 's main source of electric power . As the flight continued , this battery acted as though water were collecting in it . Fuel cells make water as a byproduct . In this case , the water drain may have been partly plugged . This battery was nursed along . Both it and the second full  --  cell assembly provided ample power throughout the flight . But , cn Thursday , there was enough concern about them to raise momentarily the question of cutting short the flight . Tribute to ingenuity Looking back on that , Christopher C. Kraft , assistant director of the Manned Spacecraft Center for flight operations , said that the fuel cells , on the whole , worked excellently . Their performance , he said , is one of the things " that gave us great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them on Gemini five , " he said Friday . " But they have performed now for almost 14 days and I think that that 's a wonderful tribute to all the people who have done all that development . " Fuel cells , he added , " are here to stay in space flight . " Gemini 7 also lost the two rocket engines that turn its nose to the right . This happened toward the end of its flight . Again , it was considered a small matter . Ways were found to use other thrusters to make the same movement . Early Saturday morning partial use of the two thrusters was regained . Indeed , Mr. Kraft listed the over-all performance of the thrusters as one of the things that especially pleased him about Gemini 7 . Speaking of the ship as a whole , he observed that " getting any system to last for 14 days , 24 hours a day , with no major problems is a tribute to the engineering ingenuity of the country . " The problems ground crews had with the Titan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better perspective . It was disappointing to all concerned with the mission when the great rocket engines shut down on the launch attempt Dec. 12 because a tail plug was prematurely pulled out . It was disturbing later to find a plastic dust cap in one of the rocket mechanisms . Faultless rendezvous But the flawless launching at 8:37 a.m. , e.s.t. , Dec. 15 , just 11 days after Gemini 7 left the same pad , is considered a major a chievement . Dr. George C. Mueller , associate administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for manned space flight , called it a " very great tribute to the work and effort of all these people in the ground crews . " Once in orbit , Gemini 6 Astronauts Schirra and Stafford fully justified this tremendous effort . Their faultless rendezvous with Gemini 7 was done so smoothly that few outside of space flight experts know how difficult their task was . Commenting on this at the time , Dr. Robert R. Gilruth , director of the spacecraft center , said , " I think . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is very seldom that you try something totally new and it works perfectly for the first time , which is what happened today Dec. 15 . " Time and effort saved He added that this " means that the boys that worked out the flight plan and designed the equipment and trained the astronauts had a pretty thorough understanding of how the orbital mechanics and the other factors really worked . . . . " . This would indicate that these people do have a pretty good understanding of the rendezvous theory , and would mean that , in the subsequent flights , we can use the rendezvous maneuvers . . . to train pilots . . . and to execute various experiments . . . . " We may be able to get a little more advanced in these flights than we would have if we had had to take three or four or five of them to work out the initial rendezvous maneuver , " Dr. Gilmuth added . Thus it is that the success of Gemini 6 will enable the space agency to move more quickly ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , the record of Gemini 7 Astronauts Borman and Lovell has cleared away much of the uncertainty about men 's ability to withstand extended space flight .
