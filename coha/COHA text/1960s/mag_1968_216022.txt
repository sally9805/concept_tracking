IN THE HEART OF THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY by William Gass. 206 pages . Harper &; Row . $4.95 . <P> <P> There is little doubt that William Gass is speaking for himself when one of the characters in this collection of short stories says : " I ca n't tolerate any more of my sophistries about spirit , mind , and breath . Body equals being , and if your weight goes down , you are the less . " Coming from a man who makes his living teaching philosophy at Purdue University , such a flat-out assertion seems a little unusual . But then William James pledged in his diary to " care little for speculation ; much for the form of my action . " <P> Gass published his fine first novel , Omensetter 's Luck , two years ago , when he was 41 . He shares James 's pragmatism , his commitment to form and to the senses , his cheerless affirmation willed out of an all too obvious despair . The despair seems to rise from the conclusion that ultimate answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of his prose and the intense physicality of his words . Death imagery crackles through these pages like winter wind through a cornfield , yet the characters have exceptional vitality . A youth watches with unblinking fascination as a farmhand tries to knead life back into a child who is " froze like a pump . " A housewife sees beauty in the configurations of dead roaches . In the title story , an intricate prose poem about a small Midwestern town , windows are graves , asphalt crumbles , maples are decapitated to make way for electric wires ( " voices in thin strips " ) , and the narrator sifts the ashes of a cooled love . <P> If things are less than swinging in Gass 's grey heartland , the big cities are worse : immobile with rigor mortis , " swollen and poisonous with people . " Gass pulls a long face at contemporary literary fashions . " It 's not surprising , " he writes , " that the novelists of the slums , the cities , and the crowds , should find that sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're most human when we 're sitting on the John , and that the justest image of our life is in full passage through the plumbing . " <P> It is Gass 's precision with words as physical objects that gives these somber stories a weight out of proportion to their size . In more than one sense , they have a rare specific gravity .
