The scene was the Great Kremlin Hall within whose floodlit , white-marble walls Russian history has unrolled in war and peace . Before the admiring gaze of 1,378 Supreme Soviet delegates , of his wife ( seated alone on a chair placed in an aisle ) , and of galleries packed with diplomats and newsmen , Premier Nikita Khrushchev again claimed his day in history . In a 3-hr . State of the Union address aimed more at the world than his own 212 million subjects ( copies of the speech in English were handed out , an unprecedented thing , as he spoke ) , Khrushchev proclaimed that the Soviet Union intended to reduce its standing armed forces by a third in the next year or two , from 3,623,000 to 2,423,000 . <P> This , reported Pravda , brought " very stormy applause . " What better way to proclaim peaceful intentions on the eve of Khrushchev 's trip to India , Burma and Indonesia ?

We are not trying to sweat anybody , but these are the facts . " Rattling his rockets in the style he used to assail Western " military circles " for doing a few years ago , Khrushchev promised to " wipe from the face of the earth " any aggressor , and boasted : " Though the weapons we have now are formidable indeed , the weapon we have today in the hatching stage is even more formidable . The weapon , which is being developed and is , as they say , in the portfolio of our scientists and designers , is a fantastic weapon . " ( U.S. Atomic Physicist Ralph E.
