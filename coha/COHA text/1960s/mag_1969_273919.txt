The political winds seemed to be blowing just the way the tobacco industry wanted last month , when the House of Representatives voted to protect cigarette advertising from assaults by U.S. regulatory agencies . The House bill was designed to thwart the efforts of the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission , both of which wanted to outlaw all cigarette ads on TV and radio . But last week the tobacco men encountered new trouble from a usually friendly corner : the broadcast industry itself . <P> Blackout . The National Association of Broadcasters ' self-policing TV and radio " code-review boards " proposed that the industry begin a gradual phase-out of cigarette commercials over a three-year period starting next January , and eliminate all cigarette ads by September 1973 . Adoption of the plan by the full N.A.B. is only a formality . The N.A.B. program would affect the three TV networks and about 400 independent TV stations , as well as 6,272 radio stations that subscribe to the N.A.B. code . Many of the non-code stations , which account for 36% of TV and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackout would mean the sacrifice of some $300 million a year in broadcast ad revenues-about $200 million by TV alone , which depends on cigarette commercials for 11% of its advertising . <P> The broadcasters ' decision reflected their feeling that Government controls were not far off . For all its success in the House , the tobacco bill faces some difficult hurdles in the Senate , where anti-smoking sentiment is stronger . Senate cigarette foes , in fact , promise either to pass a tougher law or do nothing-and thus allow the regulatory agencies to impose almost any rules they please . Understandably , N.A.B. officials had been working on their blackout proposal for some time , and their announcement last week came soon after Utah Democrat Frank Moss , head of the Senate Consumer Subcommittee , sent telegrams advising them that they had better " do something " about smoking ads . <P> Next Target . The industry timetable would obviously ease the shock of ending the ads-which may not be much of a shock after all . Presumably , the broadcasters would also be allowed to phase out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million worth of air time a year . Some but by no means all of the loss from cigarette commercials would be made up by the fast-diversifying tobacco companies themselves . As they cut back their cigarette ad budgets , they would spend more on their non-tobacco products . <P> No fadeout can come fast enough to please the cigarette 's most zealous opponents . Utah 's Moss feels that the N.A.B. plan " may take too long . " And he is anxious to move on to his next target : cigarette ads in printed media .
