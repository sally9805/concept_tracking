The word from the White House to Capitol Hill was perfectly plain : Do n't mess around with the Administration 's new voting-rights bill , just pass it fast . Sentiment in Congress was for doing just that . But there were some doubters - and they had some points . <P> Among them was North Carolina Democrat Sam Ervin , a former member of his state 's Supreme Court , now a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee . At the outset of hearings before the committee , Ervin took on Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach for a full seven hours . <P> The Far-Flung Net . Ervin noted that the bill provides for federal voting registrars to be sent into states and counties where there are literacy tests and where 50% of the citizens of eligible age and residence either were not registered as of Nov. 1 , 1964 , or did not vote in the 1964 elections . This farflung net would catch a good many states and counties where hardly anyone pretends that discrimination exists : a county in Maine , for instance , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know : Why did only 44% of those old enough to vote in 1964 go to the polls in Lyndon Johnson 's own Texas ? Snapped Katzenbach : " Poll tax . " Why did barely more than 50% vote in New York City , where a " literacy test is not administered by sinful Southerners ? " Said Katzenbach : " It 's an English language test , " and it keeps thousands of Puerto Ricans from registering . <P> Ervin obviously was smarting because the formula would include 34 counties in North Carolina , a relatively forward Southern state on civil rights . He got Katzenbach to admit that the Justice Department had evidence of discrimination in only one of those 34 counties . <P> <P> " Boom ! " Said Ervin : " I think this constitutes a bill of attainder because it deprives states and counties of certain powers vested in them without a judicial trial . " No , said Katzenbach . Even though a state or political subdivision falls under the 50% formula , if it alleges that it has not discriminated and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Boom ! Summary judgment for the state . That 's all there is to it . " <P> Ah , said Ervin , but the state or county " has to hitchhike a thousand miles to get here . " What he meant was that the bill provides that a three-judge court in the District of Columbia is the only one allowed to adjudicate such matters ; the provision was written into the bill to keep voting issues out of the hands of segregationist Southern judges . Said Ervin : " This seals shut the door of every courthouse except that in the District of Columbia . " He also pointed out that the rules of the D.C. district court allow witnesses to be subpoenaed only from within the District and a radius of 100 miles around it . To Ervin 's general contention , Katzenbach replied that the record shows that Southern states " do n't hesitate to come here to the Supreme Court " to argue their appeals in integration cases .                @ @ @ @ @
