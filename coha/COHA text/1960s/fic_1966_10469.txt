others around the table , " we really must do other things today . Mr. Pott says that Karam  --  " " Wait , wait , " he cried , becoming agitated and rising in his chair . " You do not understand . You are innocents  --  charming , yes , vastly potential , yes , but innocents , you see . You must know the way , the ins , the outs  --  " " No , honestly  --  " " Wait . Come with me now . I will show you my surprise instanter , if you insist . " And he bustled up from the table , the egg uneaten , and back up the stairs toward his room . My wife and I followed , relieved that what must be done could now be done unwitnessed . Mr. Robinson was already coming out of his room as we met him on the second-floor landing . In his haste he had left the door open behind him . Over his shoulder I glimpsed a chaos of tumbled books and wrinkled papers . He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made a list . " I have spent the last hour preparing , " he said , " with a care not incomparable to that of , ih-ihhumm , St. Jerome transcribing the Vulgate , a list ; these are the people that today we will see . " I read the list he held to my face . The offices and titles and names at the top meant nothing to me , but halfway down , where the handwriting began to get big and its slant to become inconstant , there was the word " Chancellor " followed by a huge colon and the name " Lord Halifax . " Something in my face made the paper begin to tremble . Mr. Robinson took it away and held it at his side . With the other hand he fumbled with his lapel . " You 're terribly kind , " I said . " You 've given us a wonderful introduction to Oxford . But today , really , we must go out on our own . Absolutely . "  | " No , no , you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " my wife said sharply . He looked at her , then at me , and an unexpected calm entered his features . The twinkle faded , the jaw relaxed , and his face might have been that of any tired old man as he sighed , " Very well , very well . No shame . " " Thank you so much , " my wife said , and made to touch , but did not quite touch , the limp hand that had curled defensively against the breast of his coat . Knees bent , he stood apparently immobilized on the landing before the door of his room . Yet as we went down the stairs , he did one more gratuitous thing ; he came to the banister , lifted his hand and pronounced , as we quickened our steps to dodge his words , " God bless . God bless . "  |p52THE  GRAPE LEAVES outside my window are curiously beautiful . " Curiously " because it comes upon me as strange , after the long darkness of self-absorption and fear and shame in which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent of our catastrophes they continue to maintain the casual precision , the effortless abundance of inventive " effect , " which is the hallmark and specialty of Nature . Nature : this morning it seems to me very clear that Nature may be defined as that which exists without guilt . Our bodies are in Nature ; our shoes , their laces , the little plastic tips of the laces  --  everything around us and about us is in Nature , and yet something holds us away from it , like the upward push of water which keeps us from touching the sandy bottom , ribbed and glimmering with crescental fragments of oyster shell , so clear to our eyes . A blue jay lights on a twig outside my window . Momentarily sturdy , he stands astraddle , his dingy rumpp53toward me , his head alertly frozen in silhouette , the predatory curve of his beak stamped on a sky almost white above the misting tawny marsh . See him ? I do , and , snapping the chain of my thought , I have reached through glass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is gone . And yet , there , a few lines above , he still is , " astraddle , " his rump " dingy , " his head " alertly frozen . " A curious trick , possibly useless , but mine . The grape leaves where they are not in each other 's shadows are golden . Flat leaves , they take the sun flatly , and turn the absolute light , sum of the spectrum and source of all life , into the crayon yellow with which children render it . Here and there , wilt transmutes this lent radiance into a glowing orange , and the green of the still tender leaves  --  for green persists long into autumn , if we look  --  strains from the sunlight a fine-veined chartreuse . The shadows these leaves cast upon each other , though vagrant and nervous in the wind that sends friendly scavenging rattles scurrying across the roof , are yet quite various and definite , containing innumerable barbaric suggestions of scimitars , flanged spears , prongs , and menacing helmets . The net effect , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricate simultaneoussuggestion of shelter and openness , warmth and breeze , invites me outward ; my eyes venture into the leaves beyond . I am surrounded by leaves . The oak 's are tenacious claws of purplish rust ; the elm 's , scant feathers of a feminine yellow ; the sumac 's , a savage , toothed blush . I am upheld in a serene and burning universe of leaves . Yet something plucks me back , returns me to that inner darkness where guilt is the sun . The events need to be sorted out . I am told I behavedp54wantonly , and it will take time to integrate this unanimous impression with the unqualified righteousness with which our own acts , however admittedly miscalculated , invest themselves . And once the events are sorted out  --  the actions given motivations , the actors assigned psychologies , the miscalculations tabulated , the abnormalitiesnamed , the whole furious and careless growth pruned by explanation and rooted in history and returned , as it were , to Nature  --  what then ? Is not such a return spurious ? Can our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composedly among the mulching leaves ? No : we stand at the intersection of two kingdoms , and there is no advance and no retreat , only a sharpening of the edge where we stand . I remember most sharply the black of my wife 's dress as she left our house to get her divorce . The dress was a soft black sheath , with a V neckline , and Helen always looked handsome in it ; it flattered her pallor . This morning she looked especially handsome , her face utterly white with fatigue . Yet her body , that natural thing , ignored our catastrophe , and her shape and gestures were incongruously usual . She kissed me lightly in leaving , and we both felt the humor of this trip 's being insufficiently unlike any other of her trips to Boston  --  to Symphony , to Bonwit 's . The same search for the car keys , the same harassed instructions to the complacent baby-sitter , the same little dip and thrust of her head as she settled behind the wheel of her car . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the eyes of one who had left them , examined my house as one does a set of snapshots from an irrevocable time , drove through the turning landscape as a man in asbestos cuts through a fire , met my wife-to-be  --  weeping yet smiling , stunned yet brave  --  andp55felt , unstoppably , to my horror , the inner darkness burst my skin and engulf us both and drown our love . The natural world , where our love had existed , ceased to exist . My heart shied back ; it shies back still . I retreated . As I drove back , the leaves of the trees along the road stated their shapes to me . There is no more story to tell . By telephone I plucked my wife back ; I clasped the black of her dress to me , and braced for the pain . It does not stop coming . The pain does not stop coming . Almost every day , a new installment arrives by mail or face or phone . Every time the telephone rings , I expect it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide in this cottage , but even here , there is a telephone , and the scraping sounds of wind and branch and unseen animal are charged with its electric silence . At any moment , it may explode , and the curious beauty of the leaves will be eclipsed again . In nervousness , I rise , and walk across the floor . A spider like a white asterisk hangs in air in front of my face . I look at the ceiling and can not see where its thread is attached . The ceiling is smooth plasterboard . The spider hesitates . It feels a huge alien presence . Its exquisite white legs spread warily and of its own dead weight it twirls on its invisible thread . I catch myself in the quaint and antique pose of the fabulist seeking to draw a lesson from a spider , and become self-conscious . I dismiss selfconsciousnessand do earnestly attend to this minute articulated star hung so pointedly before my face ; and am unable to read the lesson . The spider and I inhabit contiguous but incompatible cosmoses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone remains silent . The spider reconsiders its spinning . The wind continues to stir the sunlight . In walking in and out of this cottage , I havep56tracked the floor with a few dead leaves , pressed flat like scraps of dark paper . And what are these pages but leaves ? Why do I produce them but to thrust , by some subjective photosynthesis , my guilt into Nature , where there is no guilt ? Now the marsh , level as a carpet , is streaked with faint green amid the shades of brown  --  russet , ochre , tan , macron  --  and on the far side , where the land lifts above tide level , evergreens stab upwards sullenly . Beyond them , there is a low blue hill ; in this coastal region , the hills are almost too modest to bear names . But I see it ; for the first time in months I see it . I see it as a child , fingers gripping and neck straining , glimpses the roof of a house over a cruelly high wall . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed with leaves shed from a small elm , and I remember how , the first night I came to this cottage , thinking I was leaving my life behind me , I went to bed alone and read , in the way one reads stray books in a borrowed house , a few pages of an old edition of Leaves of Grass . And my sleep was a loop , so that in awaking I seemed still in the book , and the light-struck sky quivering through the stripped branches of the young elm seemed another page of Whitman , and I was entirely open , and lost , like a woman in passion , and free , and in love , without a shadow in any corner of my being . It was a beautiful awakening , but by the next night I had returned to my house . The precise barbaric shadows on the grape leaves have shifted . The angle of illumination has altered . I imagine warmth leaning against the door , and open the door to let it in ; sunlight falls flat at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of his eye . He turned , his heart frozen . The incredibility of her being here , now , at a table in this one restaurant on the one day when he was back in the city , did not check the anticipatory freezing of his heart , for when they had both lived in New York they had always been lucky at finding each other , time after time ; and this would be one more time . Already , in the instant between recognition and turning , he had framed his first words ; he would rise , with the diffidence she used to think graceful , and go to her and say , " Hey . It 's you . " Her face would smile apologetically , lids lowered , and undergo one of its little shrugs . " It 's me . " " I 'm so glad . I 'm so sorry about what happened . " And everything would be understood , and the need of forgivenessonce again magically put behind them , like a wall of paper flames they had passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman whosep58hair , not really the color of her hair at all , had , half seen , suggested the way her hair , centrally parted and pulled back into a glossy French roll , would cut with two dark wings into her forehead , making her brow seem low and intense and emphasizing her stare . He felt the eyes of his companions at lunch question him , and he returned his attention to them , his own eyes smarting from the effort of trying to press this unknown woman 's appearance into the appearance of another . One of his companions at the table  --  a gentle gray banker whose affection for him , like a generous check , quietly withheld at the bottom a tiny deduction of tact , a modest minus paid as an increment on their mutual security  --  smiled in such a way as to balk his impulse to blurt , to confess . His other companion was an elderly female underwriter , an ex-associate , whose statistical insight was remorseless but who in personal manner was all feathers and feigned dismay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she nodded , for they had , all three , with the gay withering credulity of nonbelievers , been discussing ghosts . The curtain of conversation descended again , but his palms tingled , and , as if trapped between two mirrors , he seemed to face a diminishing multiplication of her stare . The first time they met , in an apartment with huge slablike paintings and fragile furniture that seemed to be tiptoeing , she came to the defense of something her husband had said , and he had irritably wondered how a woman of such evident spirit and will could debase herself to the support of statements so asinine , and she must have felt , across the room , his irritation , for she gave him her stare . It was , as a look , both blunt and elusive : somewhat cold , certainly hard , yet curiouslyp59wide , and even open  --  its essential ingredient shied away from being named . Her eyes were the only glamorous feature of a freckled , bony , tomboyish face , remarkable chiefly for its sharp willingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bared like a skull 's , and when she stared , her great , grave , perfectly shaped eyes insisted on their shape as rigidly as a statue 's . Later , when their acquaintance had outlived the initial irritations , he had met her in the Museum of Modern Art , amid an exhibit of old movie stills , and , going forward with the innocent cheerfulness that her presence even then aroused in him , he had been unexpectedly met by her stare . " We missed you Friday night , " she said . " You did ? What happened Friday night ? " " Oh , nothing . We just gave a little party and expected you to come . " " We were n't invited . " " But you were . I phoned your wife . " " She never said anything to me . She must have forgotten . " " Well , I do n't suppose it matters . " " But it does . I 'm so sorry . I would have loved to have come . It 's very funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties . " " Yes . " And her stare puzzled him , since it was no longer directed at him ; the hostility between the two women existed before he had fulfilled its reason . Later still , at a par.ty they all did attend , he had , alone with her for a moment , kissed her , and the response of her mouth had been disconcerting ; backing off , expecting to find in her face the moist , formless warmth that had taken his lips , he encountered her stare instead.  |p60In  the months that unfolded from this , it had been his pleasure to see her stare relax . Her body gathered softness under his ; late one night , after yet another party , his wife , lying beside him in the pre-dawn darkness of her ignorance , had remarked , with the cool , fair appraisal of a rival woman , how beautiful she  --  she , the other  --  had become , and he had felt , half dreaming in the warm bed he had betrayed , justified . Her laugh no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the secret he and she had made , deepened and seemed to rejoin the girlishness that had lingered in the other features of her face . Seeing her across a room standing swathed in the beauty he had given her , he felt a creator 's , a father 's , pride . There existed , when they came together , a presence of tenderness like a ghostly child who when they parted was taken away and set to sleeping . Yet even in those months , in the depths of their secret , lying together as if in an intimate dungeon , discussing with a gathering urgency what they would do when their secret crumbled and they were exposed , there would now and then glint out at him , however qualified by tears and languor , the unmistakable accusatory hardness . It was accusing , yet that was not its essence ; his conscience shied away from naming the pressure that had formed it and that , it imperceptibly became apparent , he was helpless to relieve . Each time they parted , she would leave behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look that haunted him , like the flat persisting ring of struck crystal . The last time he saw her , all the gentle months had been stripped away and her stare , naked , had become furious . " Do n't you love me ? " Two households were inp61turmoil and the rich instinct that had driven him to her had been reduced to a thin need to hide and beg . " Not enough . " He meant it simply , as a fact , as something that already had been made plain . But she took it as a death blow , and in a face whitened and drawn by the shocks of recent days , from beneath dark wings of tensely parted hair , her stare revived into a life so coldly controlled and adamantly hostile that for weeks he could not close his eyes without confronting it  --  much as a victim of torture must continue to see the burning iron with which he was blinded . Now , back in New York , walking alone , soothed by food and profitable talk , he discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The glittering city bristled with potential prongs . The pale disc of every face , as it slipped from the edge of his vision , seemed to cup the possibility of being hers . He felt her searching for him . Where would she look ? It would be her style simply to walk the streets , smiling and striding in the hope of their meeting . He had a premonition  --  and yes , there , waiting to cross Forty-third Street between two Puerto Rican messenger boys , it was she , with her back toward him ; there was no mistaking the expectant tilt of her head , the girlish curve of her high , taut cheek , the massed roll of hair pulled so glossy he used to imagine that the hairpins gave her pain . He drew abreast , timid and prankish , to surprise her profile , and she became a wrinkled painted woman with a sagging lower lip . He glanced around incredulously , and her stare glimmered and disappeared in the wavering wall-window of a modernistic bank . Crossing the street , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one he knew  --  only some potted tropical plants that looked vaguely familiar . He returned to work . His company had lent him for this visit the office of a man on vacation . He managed to concentrate only by imagining that each five minutes were the final segment of time he would have to himself before she arrived . When the phone on his desk rang , he expected the receptionist to announce that a distraught woman with striking eyes was asking for him . When he went into the halls , a secretary flickering out of sight battered his heart with a resemblance . He returned to his borrowed office , and was startled not to find her in it , wryly examining the yellowed children 's drawings  --  anotherman 's children  --  taped to the walls . The bored afternoon pasted shadows on these walls . Outside his window , the skyscrapers began to glow . He went down the elevator and into the cool crowded dusk thankful for her consideration ; it was like her to let him finish his day 's work before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their scattered hours together , a wife 's dutiful attitude toward him . But now , now she could cease considerately hiding , and he could take her to dinner with an easy conscience . He checked his wallet to make sure he had enough money . He decided he would refuse to take her to a play , though undoubtedly she would suggest it . She loved the stage . But they had too little time together to waste it in awareness of a third thing . He had taken a room at what he still thought of as their hotel . To his surprise , she was not waiting for him in the lobby , which seemed filled with a party , a competition of laughter . Charles Boyer was waiting forp63the elevator . She would have liked that , sitting on the bench before the desk , waiting and watching , her long legs crossed and one black shoe jabbing the air with the prongs of its heel and toe . He had even prepared his explanation to the clerk ; this was his wife . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blush not , after all , inappropriate ) a fight , and impulsively she had followed him to New York , to make up . Irregular , but . . . women . So could his single reservation kindly be changed to a double ? Thank you . This little play was so firmly written in his head that he looked into the bar to make sure the leading actress was not somewhere in the wings . The bar was bluely lit and amply patronized by fairies . Their drawled , elaboratelyenunciating voices , discussing musical comedies in tones of peculiar passion , carried to him , and he remembered how she , when he had expressed distaste , had solemnly explained to him that homosexuals were people , too , and how she herself often felt attracted to them , and how it always saddened her that she had nothing , you know  --  her stare defensively sharpened  --  to give them . " That old bag , she 's overexposed herself , " one of the fairies stridently declared , of a famous actress . He took the elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shared , but nothing was exactly the same , except the plumbing fixtures , and even these were differently arranged . He changed his shirt and necktie . In the mirror , behind him , a slow curve of movement , like a woman 's inquisitive step , chilled his spine ; it was the door drifting shut . He rushed from the suffocating vacant room into the streets , to inhale the invisible possibility of finding her . He ate at the restaurant he would havep64chosen for them both . The waiter seemed fussed , seating a solitary man . The woman of a couple at a nearby table adjusted an earring with a gesture that belonged to her ; she had never had her ears pierced , and this naivete of her flesh had charmed him . He abstained from coffee . Tonight he must court sleep assiduously . He walked to tire himself . Broadway was garish with the clash of mating  --  sailors and sweethearts , touts and tarts . Spring infiltrates a city through the blood of its inhabitants . The side streets were hushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their diminishing perspective . She would look for him on Fifth Avenue ; her window-shopper 's instinct would send her there . He saw her silhouette at a distance , near Rockefeller Center , and up close he spotted a certain momentary plane of her face that flew away in a flash , leaving behind the rubble of a face he did not know , had never kissed or tranquilly studied as it lay averted on a pillow . Once or twice , he even glimpsed , shadowed in a doorway , huddled on a bench tipping down toward the Promethean fountain , the ghostly child of their tenderness , asleep ; but never her , her in the fragrant solidity he had valued with such a strange gay lightness when it was upon him . Statistically , it began to seem wonderful that out of so many faces not one was hers . It seemed only reasonable that he could skim , like interest , her presence from a sufficient quantity of strangers  --  that he could refine her , like radium , out of enough pitchblende . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of absence was unlike her . The moon gratuitously added its stolen glow to the harsh illumination around the iceless skating rink . As ifp65sensing his search , faces turned as he passed . Each successive instant shocked him by being empty of her ; he knew so fully how this meeting would go . Her eyes would light on him , and her mouth would involuntarily break into the grin that greeted all her occasions , however grave and dangerous ; her stare would pull her body forward , and the gathering nearness of his presence would dissolve away the hardness , the controlled coldness , the  --  what ? What was that element that had been there from the beginning and that , in the end , despite every strenuous motion of his heart , he had intensified , like some wild vague prophecy given a tyrannical authority in its fulfillment ? What was the thing he had never named , perhaps because his vanity refused to believe that it could both attach to him and exist before him ? He wondered if he were tired enough now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He walked back to the hotel . The air of celebration had left the lobby . No celebrity was in sight . A few well-dressed young women , of the style that bloom and wither by thousands in the city 's public places , were standing waiting for an escort or an elevator ; as he pressed , no doubt redundantly , the button , a face cut into the side of his vision at such an angle that his head snapped around and he almost said aloud , " Do n't be frightened . Of course I love you . "  |p66EVERYBODY  , from their friends in Boston to the stewards on the boat , wondered why Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Harris should suddenly uproot their family of three young children and take them to the South of France in the middle of November . They had no special affection or aptitude for the country . Janet Harris knew French as well as anyone who had taken six years of it in various respectable schools without ever speaking to a Frenchman , but Kenneth himself knew hardly any  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowingness , an educated person at all . The magazine illustrations , poised somewhere between the ardently detailed earth of Norman Rockwell and the breezy blue clouds of Jon Whitcomb , with which Kenneth earned his living were the outcome of a rather monomaniacal and cloistered youth devoted to art . At his drawing board , in the little room spattered and daubed from floor to ceiling , he was a kind of master , inventive and conscientious andp67mysteriously alert to the oscillations of chic that galvanized the New York market ; outside this room he was impulsive and innocent and unduly dependent upon improvisation . It was typical of him to disembark in Cannes with three exhausted , confused children ( one still in diapers ) and a harried , hurt-looking wife , without a villa , a car , or a single friendly face to greet them , at a time of year when the Mediterranean sunshine merely underlined the actual chill in the air . After a week spent in a deserted hotel whose solicitous Old World personnel , apparently all members of a single whispering family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blundered into an Antibes villa that , if it was not even in floor space equal to their Marlborough Street brownstone , at least had enough beds and a postcard view of Fort Cane and the ( on fair days ) turquoise harbor beyond . It was three more weeks , while Janet wrestled alone with the housekeeping and slowly deciphered the problems of shopping , before they acquired a badly needed baby-sitter . It was not only that Kenneth was incompetent ; he was , like many people whose living comes to them with some agency of luck , a miser . The expense of this trip fairly paralyzed him , and , in truth , . the even greater expense of the divorce to which it was the alternative was , among the decisive factors , not the least decisive . The baby-sitter  --  their English-French dictionary gave no equivalent , and NH-sitter , as a joke , was funnier than une qui s'assied aver les bebes  --  was named , easily enough , ' Marie , and was a short healthy widow of about forty who each noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to Kenneth with a gay , hopeful ring thatp68seemed to promise ripe new worlds of communication between them . She spoke patiently and distinctly , and in a few days had received from Janet an adequate image of their expectations and had communicated in turn such intricate pieces of information as that her husband had died suddenly of a heart attack ( " Cwur  --  bom ! "  --  her arm quickly striking from the horizontal into the vertical ) and that the owners and summer residents of their villa were a pair of homosexuals ( hands fluttering at her shoulders  --  " Pas de femmes . Jamais de femmes ! " ) who hired boys from Nice and Cannes for " dix mille pour une nuit . " " Nouveaux francs ? " Kenneth asked , and she laughed delightedly , saying , " Oui , oui , " though this could n't be right ; no boy was worth two thousand dollars a night . Marie was tantalizing , for he felt within her , as in a locked chest , inaccessible wealth , and he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward grammatical formality , was gaining access either . As a result , the children remained hostile and frightened . They were accustomed , in Boston , to two types of baby-sitters : teen-age girls upon whom his elder daughter , aged seven , inflicted a succession of giggling crushes , and elderly limping women , of whom the grandest was Mrs. Shea . She had a bosom like a bolster and a wispy saintly voice in which , apparently , as soon as the Harrises were gone , she would tell the children wonderful stories of disease , calamity , and anatomical malfunction . Marie was neither young nor old , and , hermetically sealed inside her language , she must have seemed to the children as grotesque as a fish mouthing behind glass . They clustered defiantly around their parents , routing Janet out of her nap , pursuing Kennethp69into the field where he had gone to sketch , leaving Marie alone in the kitchen , whose floor she repeatedly mopped in an embarrassed effort to make herself useful . And whenever their parents left together , the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie tried to rally them with energetic " ooh " s and " ah " s . It was a humiliating situation for everyone , and Kenneth was vexed by the belief that his wife , in an hour of undivided attention , could easily have built between the baby-sitter and the children a few word bridges that would have adequately carried all this stalled emotional traffic . But she , with the stubborn shyness that was alternately her most frustrating and most appealing trait , refused , or was unable , to do this . She was exhausted . One afternoon , after they had done a little shopping for the Christmas that in this country and climate seemed so wan a holiday , Kenneth had dropped her off at the Musee d'Antibes and drove back in their rented Renault to the villa alone . Smoke filled the living room . The children and Marie were gathered in silence around a fire she had built in the fireplace . Her eyes looked inquisitively past him when he entered . " Madame , " he explained , " est , uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her quick face . " Ah , le Musee d'Antibes ! Tres joli . " " Oui . Uh "  --  he thought he should explain this , so she would not expect him to leave in the car again  --  " Madame est marchee . " In case this was the wrong word , he made walking motions with his fingers , and , unable to locate any equivalent for " back , " added , " ici . " Marie nodded eagerly . " A pied . " " I guess . Yes . Oui . "  |p70Then  came several rapid sentences that he did not understand at all . She repeated slowly , " Monsieur , " pointing at him , " travaille , " scribbling with her hands across an imaginary sketchbook . " Oh . Oui . Bon . Merci . Et les enfants ? " From her flurry of words and gestures he gathered an assurance that she would take care of them . But when he did go outdoors with the pad and paintbox , all three , led by Vera , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleas . Flustered , embarrassed , she came onto the patio . " C'est rien , " he told her , and wanted to tell her , " Do n't worry . " He tried to put this into his facial expression , and she laughed , shrugged , and went back into the house . Fort Carre was taking the sun crisply on one chalkyellowside in the cubistic way that happens only in French light , the Mediterranean wore a curious double horizon of hazed blue , and Nice in the distance was like a long heap of pale flakes shed by the starkly brilliant Alps beyond . But Vera accidentally kicked the glass of water into the open paint tray , and as he bent to pick it up the freshly wet sketch fell face down into the grass . He gathered up everything and returned to the house , the children following . Marie was in the kitchen mopping the floor . " I think we should have a French lesson , " he announced firmly . To Marie he added , with an apologetic note of interrogation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ francais , " she said , and they all went into the smoky living room . " Fuzee  --  foof ! " she exclaimed , waving her hands in front of her face and opening the side doors . Then she sat down on the bamboo sofa with orange cushions  --  the two homosexualsp71had a taste for highly colored , flimsy furniture  --  and crossed her hands expectantly in her lap . " Now , " Kenneth said . " Maintenant . Comment ditesvous  --  ? " He held up a pencil . " Le crayon , " Marie said . " Le crayon , " Kenneth repeated proudly . How simple , really , it all was . " Nancy , say , Le crayon . ' " The girl giggled and shuttled her eyes between the two adults , to make sure they were serious . " Luh crrayong , " she said . " Bon , " Kenneth said . " Charlie . Le crayon . ' " The boy was four , and his intelligence had a way of unpredictably sinking beneath waves of infantile willfulness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out " Le crayon " with an expert twang . " And Vera ? Le crayon ' ? " The baby was just learning English , and he did not press her when she looked startled and said nothing . The lesson continued , through le feu , le bois , la cheminee , and le canape orange . Having exhausted the objects immediatelybefore them , Kenneth drew , and Marie identified , such basic components of the universe as l'homme , la femme , le garcon , la jeune fille , le chien , le chat , la maison , and les oiseaux . The two older children took to bringing things from other parts of the room  --  un livre , une bouteille d'encre , un cendrier , and an old soulier of Charlie 's whose mate had mysteriously vanished out in the yard among the giant cactuses . Nancy fetched from her room three paper dolls of great men she had punched . from a copy of Realites left in the house . " Ah , " Marie said . " Jules Cesar , Napoleon , et Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with ap72stale cupcake , which she held out hopefully , her little face radiant . " Gateau , " Marie said . " Coogie , " Vera said . " Gateau . " " Coogie . " " Non , non . Gateau . " " Coogie ! " " Gateau ! " The baby burst into tears . Kenneth picked her up and said , " You 're right , Vera . That 's a cookie . " To the other children he said , " O. K. , kids . That 's all for now . Tomorrowwe 'll have another lesson . Go outside and play . " He set the baby down . With a frightened backward look at the baby-sitter , Vera followed her brother and sister outdoors . By way of patching things up , Kenneth felt he should stay with Marie and make conversation . Both remained sitting . He wondered how much longer it would be before Janet returned and rescued them . The unaccustomed sensation of yearning for his wife made him feel itchy and suffocated . " Le f rancais , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ est difficile pour vous . " " Je suis tres stupide , " he said . " Mais non , non , Monsieur est tres done , tres "  --  her hand scribbled over an imaginary sketch pad  --  " adroit . " Kenneth winced modestly , unable to frame any disclaimer . She directed at him an interrogative sentence which , though she repeated it slowly , with various indications of her hands , he could not understand . " Nyew Yurrk ? " she said at last . " Weshington ? "  | " Oh . Where do I come from ? Here . Les Etats-Unis . " He took up the pad again , turned a new leaf , and drew the Eastern seaboard . " Floride , " he said as he outlined the peninsula and , growing reckless , indicated " Le Golfe de Mexique . " He suspected from her blank face that this was wrong . He put in a few dark dots : " Washington , New York , et ici , une heure nord a New York par avion , Boston ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We live , " Kenneth went on , " uh , nous vivons clans une niaison comme fa . " And he found himself drawing , in avidly remembered detail , the front of their house on Marlborough Street , the flight of brown steps with the extra-tall top step , the carpet-sized front lawn with its wrought-iron fence and its single prisoner of forsythia like a weeping princess , the coarse old struggling vine that winter never quite killed , the tall windows with their many Colonial panes ; he even put the children 's faces in the second-story windows . This was the window of Vera 's room , these were the ones that Nancy and Charlie watched the traffic jams out of , this was the living-room window that at this time of year should show a brightly burdened Christmas tree , and up here , on the third story , were the little shuttered windows of the guest bedroom that was inhabited by a ghost with a slender neck and naked moonlit shoulders . Emotion froze his hand . Marie , looking up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question in which he seemed to hear the words " France " and " pourquoi . " " Why did we come to France ? " he asked her in English . She nodded . He said what he next said in part , no doubt , because it was the truth , but mainly , probably ,  |p74because  he happened to know the words . He put his hand over his heart and told the baby-sitter , " J'aime une autre femme . " Marie 's shapely plucked eyebrows lifted , and he wondered if he had made sense . The sentence seemed foolproof ; but he did not repeat it . Locked in linguistic darkness , he had thrown open the most intimate window of his life . He felt the relief , the loss of constriction , of a man glimpsing light at the end of a tunnel . Marie spoke very carefully . " Et Madame ? Vous ne l'aimez pas ? " There was a phrase , Kenneth knew , something like " Comme ci , comme Fa , " which might roughly outline the immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forlorn feelings toward Janet . But he did n't dare it , and instead , determined to be precise , measured off about an inch and a half with his fingers and said , " Un petit peu pas . " " Ahhhh . " And now Marie , as if the languages had been reversed , was speechless . Various American phrases traditional to his situation  --  " a chance to get over it , " " for the sake of the kids "  --  revolved in Kenneth 's head without encountering any equivalent French . " Pour les enfants , " he said at last , gesturing toward the outdoors and abruptly following the direction of his gesture , for Vera had begun to cry in the distance . About once a day she speared herself on one of the cactuses . Janet was walking up the driveway . As he saw her go in to the baby-sitter he felt only a slight alarm . It did n't seem possible that he could have been indiscreet in a language he did n't know . When he came indoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about whatp75he imagined to be the charm of Le Musee d'Antibes , and it occurred to him that the reserve that had existed between the two women had been as much the babysitter'sas Janet 's . Now , from this afternoon on , Marie became voluble and jolly , open and intire , with her mistress ; the two held long kitchen conversations in which womanly intuition replaced whatever was lost in nuances of diction . The children , feeling the new rapprochement , ceased yowling when their parents went away together , and under Marie 's care developed a somewhat independent French , in which , if pencils were called crayons , crayons must be called pencils . Vera learned the word " gateau " and even the sentence " Je veux un gateau . " As to Kenneth , he was confident , without knowing what the women said to each other , that his strange confession was never mentioned . The MN-sitter kept between herself and him a clear little distance , whether as a sign of disapproval or of respect , he could not decide ; at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged to paint by himself in the fields , and this isolation , wherein his wife 's growing fluency spared him much further trouble of communication , suited his preoccupied heart . In short , they became a menage.  |p76THE  MAPLES had talked and thought about separation so long it seemed it would never come . For their conversations , increasingly ambivalent and ruthless as accusation , retraction , blow , and caress alternated and cancelled , had the final effect of knitting them ever tighter together in a painful , helpless , degrading intimacy . And their love-making , like a perversely healthy child whose growth defies every deficiency of nutrition , continued ; when their tongues at last fell silent , their bodies collapsedtogether as two mute armies might gratefully mingle , released from the absurd hostilities decreed by two mad kings . Bleeding , mangled , reverently laid in its tomb a dozen times , their marriage could not die . Burning to leave one another , they left , out of marital habit , together . They took a trip to Rome . They arrived at night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left hastily , without plans ; and yet , as if forewarned of their arrival , nimble Italians , speaking perfect English , parted them deftly from their baggage ,  |p77reserved  a hotel room for them by telephone from the airport , and ushered them into a bus . The bus , surprisingly , plunged into a dark rural landscape . A few windows hung lanternlike in the distance ; a river abruptly bared its silver breast beneath them ; the silhouettes of olive trees and Italian pines flicked past like shadowy illustrations in an old Latin primer . " I could ride this bus forever , " Joan said aloud , and Richard was pained , remembering from the days when they had been content together , how she had once confessed to feeling a sexual stir when the young man at the gas station , wiping the windshield with a vigorous , circular motion , had made the body of the car , containing her , rock slightly . Of all the things she had ever told him , this remained in his mind the most revealing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman he could never reach and had at last wearied of trying to reach . Yet it pleased him to have her happy . This was his weakness . He wished her to be happy , and the certainty that , away from her , he could not know if she were happy or not formed the final , unexpected door barring his way when all others had been opened . So he dried the very tears he had whipped from her eyes , withdrew each protestation of hopelessness at the very point when she seemed willing to give up hope , and their agony continued . " Nothing lasts forever , " he said now . " You ca n't let me relax a minute , can you ? " " I 'm sorry . Do relax . " She stared through the window awhile , then turned and told him , " It does n't feel as if we 're going to Rome at all . "  | " Where are we going ? " He honestly wanted to know , honestly hoped she could tell him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't want to go back to that . I feel we 've come very far and have only a little way more to go . " She looked out at the quiet landscape a long while before he realized she was crying . He fought the impulse to comfort her , inwardly shouted it down as cowardly and cruel , but his hand , as if robbed of restraint by a force as powerful as lust , crept onto her arm . She rested her head on his shoulder . The shawled woman across the aisle took them for honeymooners and politely glanced away . The bus slipped from the country . Factories and residential rows narrowed the highway . A sudden monument , a massive white pyramid stricken with light and inscribed with Latin , loomed beside them . Soon they were pressing their faces together to the window to follow the Colosseum itself as , shaped like a shattered wedding cake , it slowly pivoted and silently floated from the harbor of their vision . At the terminal , another lively chain of hands and voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi , and carried them to the hotel . As Richard dropped six hundred-lira pieces into the driver 's hand , they seemed the smoothest , roundest , most tactfully weighted coins he had ever given away . The hotel desk was one flight up . The clerk was young and playful . He pronounced their name several times , and wondered why they had not gone to Naples . The halls of the hotel , which had been described to them at the airport as second-class , were nevertheless of rose marble . The marble floor carried into their room . This , and the amplitude of the bathroom , and the imperial purple ofp79the curtains blinded Richard to a serious imperfection until the clerk , his heels clicking in satisfaction with the perhaps miscalculated tip he had received , was far down the hall . " Twin beds , " he said . They had always had a double bed . Joan asked , " Do you want to call him back ? " " How important is it to you ? " " I do n't think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . But  --  " It was delicate . He felt they had been insulted . Until they finally parted , it seemed impertinent for anything , even a slice of space , to come between them . If this trip were to be kill or cure ( and this was , for the tenth time , their slogan ) , then the attempt at a cure should have a certain technical purity , even though  --  or , rather , all the more because  --  in his heart he had already doomed it to fail . And also there was the material question of whether he could sleep without a warm proximate body to give his sleep shape . " But what ? " Joan prompted . " But it seems sort of sad . " " Richard , do n't be sad . You 've been sad enough . You 're supposed to relax . This is n't a honeymoon or anything , it 's just a little rest we 're trying to give each other . You can come visit me in my bed if you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I ca n't understand why I 'm so miserable with you . " He had said this , or something like it , so often before that she , sickened by simultaneous doses of honey and gall , ignored the entire remark , and unpacked with a deliberate serenity . On her suggestion , they walked into the city , though it was ten o'clock . Their hotel was on a shopping street that at this hour was lined with loweredp80steel shutters . At the far end , an illuminated fountain played . His feet , which had never given him trouble , began to hurt . In the soft , damp air of the Roman winter , his shoes seemed to have developed hot inward convexities that gnashed his flesh at every stride . He could not imagine why this should be , unless he was sensitive to marble . For the sake of his feet , they found an American bar , entered , and ordered coffee . Off in a corner , a drunken male American voice droned through the grooves of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , seemed not so much a man 's as a woman 's deepened by being played at a slower speed on the phonograph . Hoping to cure the growing dizzy emptiness within him , Richard ordered a " hamburger " that proved to be more tomato sauce than meat . Outside , on the street , he bought a paper cone of hot chestnuts from a sidewalk vender . This man , whose thumbs and fingertips were charred black , agitated his hand until three hundred lire were placed in it . In a way , Richard welcomed being cheated ; it gave him a place in the Roman economy . The Maples returned to the hotel , and side by side on their twin beds fell easily into a solid sleep . That is , Richard assumed , in the cavernous accounting rooms of his subconscious , that Joan also slept well . But when they awoke in the morning , she told him , " You were terribly funny last night . I could n't go to sleep , and every time I reached over to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in a double bed , you 'd say Go away ' and shake me off . " He laughed in delight . " Did I really ? In my sleep ? "  | " It must have been . Once you shouted Leave me alone ! ' so loud I thought you must be awake , but when I tried to talk to you , you were snoring . " " Is n't that funny ? I hope I did n't hurt your feelings . " " No . It was refreshing not to have you contradict yourself . " He brushed his teeth and ate a few of the cold chestnuts left over from the night before . The Maples breakfasted on hard rolls and bitter coffee in the hotel and walked again into Rome . His shoes resumed their inexplicable torture . With its strange , almost mocking attentiveness to their unseen needs , the city thrust a shoe store under their eyes ; they entered , and Richard bought , from a gracefully reptilian young salesman , a pair of black alligator loafers . They were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they did not pinch with the vital , outraged vehemence of the others . Then the Maples , she carrying the Hachette guidebook and he his American shoes in a box , walked down the Via Nazionale to the Victor Emmanuel Monument , a titanic flight of stairs leading nowhere . " What was so great about him ? " Richard asked . " Did he unify Italy ? Or was that Cavour ? " " Is he the funny little king in A Farewell to Arms ? " " I do n't know . But nobody could be that great . " " You can see now why the Italians do n't have aninferiority complex . Everything is so huge . " They stood looking at the Palazzo Venezia until they imagined Mussolini frowning from a window , climbed the many steps to the Piazza del Campidoglio , and came to the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius on the pedestal by Michelangelo . Joan remarked how like ap82Marino Marini it was , and it was ; her intuition had leaped eighteen centuries . She was so intelligent . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so exquisite in conception and so difficult in execution . They circled the square . The portals and doors all around them seemed closed forever , like the doors in a drawing . They entered , because it was open , the side door of the church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli . They discovered themselves to be walking on sleeping people , life-size tomb-reliefs worn nearly featureless by footsteps . The fingers of the hands folded on the stone breasts had been smoothed to fingershapedshadows . One face , sheltered from wear behind a pillar , seemed a vivid soul trying to rise from the all but erased body . Only the Maples examined these reliefs , cut into a floor that once must have been a glittering lake of mosaic ; the other tourists clustered around the chapel preserving , in slippers and vestments , behind glass , the child-sized greenish remains of a pope . They left by the same side door and descended steps and paid admission to the ruins of the Roman Forum . The Renaissance had used it as a quarry ; broken columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chirico . Joan was charmed by the way birds and weeds lived in the crevices of this exploded civic dream . A delicate rain began to fall . At the end of one path , they peeked in glass doors , and a small uniformed man with a broom limped forward and admitted them , as if to a speakeasy , to the abandoned church of Santa Maria Antiqua . The pale vaulted air felt innocent of worship ; the seventh-century frescoes seemed recently , nervously executed . As they left , Richard read the question in the broom man 's smile and pressed a tactful coin into his hand . The gentle rainp83continued . Joan took Richard 's arm , as if for shelter . His stomach began to hurt  --  a light , chafing ache at first , scarcely enough to distract him from the pain in his feet . They walked along the Via Sacra , through roofless pagan temples carpeted in grass . The ache in his stomach intensified . Uniformed guards , old men standing this way and that in the rain like hungry gulls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain now had blinded Richard to everything but the extremity of his distance from anything that might give him support . He refused admittance to the Basilica of Constantine , and asked instead for the uscita . He did not feel capable of retracing his steps . The guard , seeing a source of tips escaping , dourly pointed toward a small gate in a nearby wire fence . The Maples lifted the latch , stepped through , and stood on the paved rise overlooking the Colosseum . Richard walked a little distance and leaned on a low wall . " Is it so bad ? " Joan asked . " Oddly bad , " he said . " I 'm sorry . It 's funny . " " Do you want to throw up ? " " No . It 's not like that . " His sentences came jerkily . " It 's just a . . . sort of gripe . " " High or low ? " " In the middle . " " What could have caused it ? The chestnuts ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far from anywhere , with you , and not knowing . . . why . " " Shall we go back to the hotel ? " " Yes . I think if I could lie down . " " Shall we get a taxi ? " " They 'll cheat me. "  | " That does n't matter . " " I do n't know . . . our address . " " We know sort of . It 's near that big fountain . I 'll look up the Italian for fountain . ' " " Rome is . . . full of . . . fountains . " " Richard . You are n't doing this just for my benefit ? " He had to laugh , she was so intelligent . " Not consciously . It has something to do . . . with having to hand out tips . . . all the time . It 's really an ache . It 's incredible . " " Can you walk ? " " Sure . Hold my arm . " " Shall I carry your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetie . It 's just a nervous ache . I used to get them . . . when I was little . But I was .. . braver then . " They descended steps to a thoroughfare thick with speeding traffic . The taxis they hailed carried heads in the rear and did not stop . They crossed the Via dei Fori Imperiali and tried to work their way back , against the sideways tug of interweaving streets , to the territory containing the fountain , the American Bar , the shoe store , and the hotel . They passed through a market of bright food . Garlands of sausages hung from striped canopies . Heaps of lettuce lay in the street . He walked stiffly , as if the pain he carried were precious and fragile ; holding one arm across his abdomen seemed to ease it slightly . The rain and Joan , having been in some way the pressures that had caused it , now became the pressures that enabled him to bear it . Joan kept him walking . The rain masked him , made his figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , and sop85dimmed his pain . The blocks seemed cruelly uphill and downhill . They climbed a long slope of narrow pavement beside the Banca d'Italia . The rain lifted . The pain , having expanded into every corner of the chamber beneath his ribs , had armed itself with a knife and now began to slash the walls in hope of escape . They reached the Via Nazionale , blocks below the hotel . The shops were unshuttered , the distant fountain was dry . He felt as if he were leaning backward , and his mind seemed a kind of twig , a twig that had deviated from the trunk and chosen to be this branch instead of that one , and chosen again and again , becoming finer with each choice , until finally there was nothing left for it but to vanish into air . In the hotel room he lay down on his twin bed , settled his overcoat over him , curled up , and fell asleep . When he awoke an hour later , everything was different . The pain was gone . Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw her , as he rolled over , as if freshly , in the kind of cool library light in which he had first seen her ; only he knew , calmly , that since then she had come to share his room . " It 's gone , " he told her . " You 're kidding . I was all set to call up a doctor and have you taken to a hospital . " " No , it was n't anything like that . I knew it was n't . It was nervous . " " You were dead white . " " It was too many different things focusing on the same spot . I think the Forum must have depressed me . The past here is so heavy . Also my shoes hurting bothered me . " " Darley , it 's Rome . You 're supposed to be happy . "  | " I am now . Come on . You must be starving . Let 's get some lunch . " " Really ? You feel up to it ? " " Quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comfortable reminiscent soreness that the first swallow of Milanese salami healed , it was . The Maples embarked again upon Rome , and , in this city of steps , of sliding , unfolding perspectives , of many-windowed surfaces of sepia and rose ochre , of buildings so vast one seemed to be outdoors in them , the couple parted . Not physically  --  they rarely left each other 's sight . But they had at last been parted . Both knew it . They became with each other , as in the days of courtship , courteous , gay , and quiet . Their marriage let go like an overgrown vine whose half-hidden stem has been slashed in the dawn by an ancient gardener . They walked arm in arm through seemingly solid blocks of buildings that parted , under examination , into widely separated slices of style and time . At one point she turned to him and said , " Darley , I know what was wrong with us . I 'm classic , and you 're baroque . " They shopped , and saw , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last of the restaurants that like oases of linen and wine had sustained these level elegiac days , Richard saw that Joan was happy . Her face , released from the tension of hope , had grown smooth ; her gestures had taken on the flirting irony of the young ; she had become ecstatically attentive to everything about her ; and her voice , as she bent forward to whisper a remark about a woman and a handsome man at another table , was rapid , as if the very air of her breathing had turned thin and free . She was happy , and , jealous of her happiness , he again grew reluctant to leave her.  |p87TristanMY  LOVE : Forgive me , I seem to be on a boat . The shock of leaving you numbed me rather nicely to the usual humiliations of boarding  --  why is it that in a pier shed everyone , no matter how well-born and self-confident , looks like a Central European immigrant , and is treated accordingly ?  --  and even though we are now two days out to sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter inaccessibility , I still am unable to focus on my fellow passengers , though for a split second of , as it were , absent-minded sanity , I did prophetically perceive , through a chink in my obsession , that the waiter , having sized me up as one of the helpless solitaries of the world , would give me arrogant service and expect in exchange ,  |p88at  journey 's end , an apologetically huge tip . No matter . The next instant , I unfolded the napkin , and your sigh , shaped exactly like a dove , the blue tint of its throat visibly clouding for a moment the flame of the candle on the table , escaped ; and I was plunged back into the moist murmurs , the eclipsed whispers , the vows instantly hissingly retracted , the exchanged sweats , of our love . The boat shakes . The vibration is incessant and ubiquitous ; it has sniffed me out even here , in the writing room , a dark nook staffed by a dour young Turinese steward and stocked , to qualify as a library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , seventeen gorgeously bound and impeccably unread volumes of D'Annunzio , in of course Italian . So that the tremor in my handwriting is a purely motor affair , and the occasional splotches you may consider droplets of venturesome spray . As a matter of fact , there is a goodly roll , though we have headed into sunny latitudes . When they try to fill the swimming pool , the water thrashes and pitches so hysterically that I peek over the edge expecting to see a captured mermaid . In the bar , the bottles tinkle like some immensely dainty Swiss gadget , and the Daiquiris come to you aquiver , little circlets of agitation spinning back and forth between the center and the rim . The first day , having forgotten , in my landlocked days with you , the feel of an ocean voyage , I was standing in the cabin-class lobby , waiting to try to buy my way toward a higher deck and if possible a porthole , when , without any visible change in the disposition of furniture , lighting fixtures , potted palms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great flat magnet suddenly rendered my blood heavy  --  extraordi/narily heavy . There were people around me , and their facial expressions did not alter by one millimeter . It was quite comic , for as the ship rolled back the other way my blood absolutely swung upward in my veins  --  do you remember how your arm feels in the first instant after a bruise ?  --  and it seemed imminent that I , and , if I , all these dead-panned others too , would lift like helium balloons and be bumpingly pasted to the ceiling , from which the ship 's staff would have to rescue us , irritably , with broom handles . The vision passed . The ship rolled again . My blood went heavy again . It seemed that you were near . Iseult . I must write your name . Iseult . I am bleeding to death . Certainly I feel bloodless , or , more precisely , diluted , diluted by half , since everything around me  --  the white ropes , the ingenious little magnetic catches that keep the doors from swinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the luxurious and pampered textures on every side  --  I seem to see , or touch , or smile over , with you , which means , since you are not here , that I only half-see , only half-exist . I keep thinking what a pity all this luxury is wasted on me , Tristan the Austere , the Perpetually Grieving , the Orphaned , the Homeless . The very pen I am writing this with is an oldfashioneddip , or nib , pen , whose flexibility irresistibly invites flourishes that sit up wet and bluely gleaming for minutes before finally deigning to dry . The holder is some sort of polished Asiatic wood . Teak ? Ebony ? You would know . It was enchanting for me , how you knew the names of surfaces , how you had the innocence to stroke a pelt and not flinch from the panicked little quick-eyed death beneath ; for me , who have always been on the verge of becoming a vegetarian , which Mark , Ip90know , would say was a form of death-wish ( I ca n't describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfairly enough , even what tiny truth there is in him seems backed by this immense capital  --  these armies , this downright kingdom  --  of stupidity , so that even when he says something intelligent it affects me like Gospel quoted in support of social injustice . This parenthesis has gotten out of all control . If it seems ugly to you , blame it on jealousy . I am not sure , however , if I hate your husband because he  --  if only legally  --  possesses you , or if , more subtly , because he senses my own fear of just such legal possession , which gives him , for all his grossness , his grotesque patronization and prattling , a curious moral hold over me which I can not , writhe as I will , break . End parenthesis ) . An especially , almost maliciously , prolonged roll of the boat just slid the ink bottle , unspilled , the width of my cubbyhole and gave me the choice of fixing my eyes on the horizon or beginning to be seasick . Where was I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your response to textures . Your shallowness , as my wife calls it  --  and like everything she says , there is something in it which , at the least , gives dismissal pause  --  broke a new dimension into my hitherto inadequately superficial world . Now , adrift in this luxurious island universe , where music plays like a constant headache , I see everything half through your eyes , conduct circular conversations with you in my head , and rest my hand on the wiped mahogany of the bar as if the tremor beneath the surface is you , a mermaid rising . What are our conversations about ? I make , my mind tediously siftingp91the rubble of the emotional landslide , small discoveries about us that I hasten to convey to you , who are never quite as impressed by them as I thought you would be . Yesterday , for example , at about 3:30 p.m. , when the sallow sun suddenly ceased to justify sitting in a deck chair , I discovered , in the act of folding the blanket , that I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my own . That you were unhappy , I knew . I could diagram the mechanics of the bind you were in , could trace the vivacious contours and taste the bright flat colors of your plight  --  indeed I could picture your torment so clearly that I felt I was feeling it with you . But no , there was a final kind of credence I denied your pain , that cheated it of dimension and weight , and for this I belatedly apologized . In my head you accepted the apology with a laugh , and then wished to go on and discuss the practical aspects of our elopement . Two hours later , pinning a quivering Daiquiri to the bar with my fingers , I rather jerkily formulated this comforting thought : however else I failed you , I never pretended to feel other than love for you , I never in any way offered to restrict , or control , the love you felt for me . Whatever sacrifices you offered to make , whatever agony you volunteered to undergo for me , I permitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , I was the perfect lover . Another man , seeing you flail and lacerate yourself so mercilessly , might have out of timid squeamishness ( calling it pity ) pretended to turn his back , and saved your skin at the price of your dignity . But I , whether merely hypnotized or actually suicidal , steadfastly kept my face turned toward the blaze between us , though my eyes watered , my nose peeled ,  |p92and  my eyebrows disappeared in twin whiffs of smoke . It took all the peculiar strength of my egotism not to flinch and flaw the purity of your generous fury . No ? For several hours I discussed this with you , or rather vented exhaustive rewordings upon your silent phantom , whose comprehension effortlessly widened , like ringing water , to include every elaboration . Then , at last weary , brushing my teeth while the shower curtains moved back and forth beside me like two sluggish , rustling pendulums , I received , as if it were a revelation absolutely gravitational in importance , the syllogism that ( major premise ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is quite out of the question for me to blame you for my pain , though strictly speaking you were the cause ; and , since ( minor premise ) you and I as lovers were mirrors and always felt the same , therefore ( conclusion ) this must also be the case with you . Ergo , my mind is at peace . That is , it is a paradoxical ethical situation to be repeatedly wounded by someone because he or she is beloved . Those small incidentals within my adoration , those crumbs of Mark 's influence that I could never digest , those cinders from past flames unswept from your corners , the flecks of mediocrity , glimpses of callousness , even moments of physical repulsiveness  --  it was never these that hurt me . It was your perfection that destroyed me , demented my logical workings , unmanned my healthy honor , bled me white . But I bear no grudge . And thus know that you bear none ; and this knowledge , in the midst of my restless misery , gives me ease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your presence but your good opinion . I was rather disturbed to learn , from Brangien , justp93before I left , that you are seeing a psychiatrist . I can not believe there is anything abnormal or curable about our predicament . We are in love . The only way out of it is marriage , or some sufficiently pungent piece of overexposure equivalent to marriage . I am prepared to devote my life to avoiding this death . As you were brave in creating our love , so I must be brave in preserving it . My body aches for the fatal surfeit of you . It creaks under the denial like a strained ship . A hundred times a day I consider casting myself loose from this implacable liner and giving myself to the waves on the implausible chance that I might again drift to you as once I drifted , pustular , harping , and all but lifeless , into Whitehaven . But I who slew the Morholt slay this Hydra of yearning again and again . My ship plows on , bleeding a straight wake of aquamarine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the realms of compromise and muddle wherein our love , like a composted flower , would be returned to the stupid earth . Yes , had we met as innocents , we could have indulged our love and let it run its natural course of passion , consummation , satiety , contentment , boredom , betrayal . But , being guilty , we can seize instead a purity that will pass without interruption through death itself . Do you remember how , by the river , staking your life on a technicality , you seized the white-hot iron , took nine steps , and showed all Cornwall your cold clean palms ? It is from you that I take my example . Do you remember in the Isak Dinesen book I gave you the story in which God is described as He who says No ? By saying No to our love we become , you and I , gods . I feel this is blasphemy and yet I write it . The distance between us increases . Bells ring . Thep94Turinese steward is locking up the bookcase . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us live , forever apart , as a shame to the world where everything is lost save what we ourselves deny . T.Iseult of the White HandsDEAR KAHERDIN : Sorry not to have written before . This way of life we 've all been living does n't conduce to much spare time . I have n't read a book or magazine in weeks . Nov the brats are asleep ( I think ) , the dishes are chugging away in the washer , and here I sit with my fifth glass of Noilly Prat for the day . You were the only one he ever confided in , so I tell you . He 's left me again . On the other hand , he 's also left her . What do you make of it ? She is taking it , from appearances , fairly well . She was at a castle do Saturday night and seemed much the same , only thinner . Mark kept a heavy eye on her all evening . At least she has him ; all I seem to have is a house , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The night before he sailed , he explained to me , with great tenderness , etc. , that he married me as a kind of pun . That the thing that drew him to me was my having her name . It was all  --  seven years , three children  --  a kind of Freudian slip , and he was really charmingly boyish as he begged to be excused . He even made me laugh about it . If I had any dignity I 'd be dead or insane . I do n't know if I love him or what love is or even if I want to find out.  |p95I  tried to tell him that if he loved her and could n't help it he should leave me and go to her , and not torment us both indefinitely . I 've never much liked her , which oddly enough offends him , but I really do sympathize with what he must have put her through . But he seems to think there 's something so beautiful about hanging between us that he wo n't let go with either hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous . Mark , who in his bullying way wants to be sensible and fair , had his lawyer on the move , and I was almost looking forward to six weeks on a ranch somewhere . But no . After spending the whole summer climbing fences , faking appointments , etc. , anything that looks like real action terrifies him and he gets on a boat . And through it all , making life a hell for everybody concerned , including the children , he wears this saintly pained look and insists he 's trying to do the right thing . What was really annihilating was n't his abuse of me , but his kindness . I 've mentally fiddled with your invitation to come back to Carhaix , but there seems no point . The children are in school , I have friends here , life goes on . I 've explained his absence as a business trip , which everybody accepts and nobody believes . The local men are both a comfort and a menace  --  I guess it 's their being a menace that makes them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes back to me , this business of managing suitors , keeping each at the proper distance , not too close and not too far , trying to remember exactly what has been said to each . Mark 's eye , for that matter , was heavy on me for a few moments at the party . It 's essentially disgusting . But nothing else is keeping my ego afloat . I could never get out of him what she had that I didn't.  |p96If  you know , as a man , do n't tell me , please . But I ca n't see that it was our looks , or brains , or even in bed . The better I was in bed , the worse it made him . He took it as a reproach , and used to tell me I was beautiful as if it were some cruel joke I had played on him . The harder I tried , the more I became a kind of distasteful parody . But of what ? She is really too shallow and silly even for me to hate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bump , as one drops any solid object , but she , she is sought in her abandonment . His heart rebounds from shapeless surfaces  --  the sky , the forest roof , the sea  --  and gives him back a terror which is her form . The worst of it is , I sympathize . I 'm even jealous of his misery . At least it 's a kind of pointed misery . His version is that they drank from the same cup . It has nothing to do with our merits but she loves him and I do n't . I just think I do . But if I do n't love him , I 've never loved anything . Do you think this is so ? You 've known me since I was born , and I 'm frightened of your answer . I 'm frightened . At night I take one of the children into bed with me and hold him/her for hours . My eyelids wo n't close , it scalds when I shut them . I never knew what jealousy was . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churns and I ca n't focus on anything . I remember how I used to read a newspaper and care and it seems like another person . In the day I can manage , and on the nights when I go out , but in the evenings when I 'm alone , there is an hour , right now , when everything is so hollow there is no limit to how low I and my Noilly Prat can go . I did n't mean to put this into a letter . I wanted to be cheerful , and brave , and funny about it . You have your own life . My love to your family . The physical health here is oddly good . Please , please don'tp97say anything to Mother and Daddy . They would n't understand and their worrying would just confuse me . I 'm really all right , except right now . My fundamental impression I think is of the incredible wastefulness of being alive .

TrPlease return  --  nothing mattersp99Four Sides of One StoryKing MarkMY DEAR DENOALEN : Your advice has been followed with exemplary success . Confronted with the actuality of marriage , the young man bolted even sooner than we had anticipated . The Queen is accordingly disillusioned and satisfactorily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them both may be for the time being halted at this time . By no means , however , do I wish to waive all possibility of further legal action . I am in possession of an interminable , impudent , and incriminating letter written by the confessed lover subsequent to his defection . If you desire , I will forward it to you for photostatic reproductionas a safeguard . In the case that , through some event or events unforeseen , the matter were after all to come to court , I agree wholeheartedly that their plea of having accidentally partaken of a magic potion will not stand up . Yet your strong suggestion that execution should be the punishment for both does not seem to me to allow for what possible extenuating circumstances there are . It is indisputable , for example , that throughout the affair Tristan continued to manifest , in battle , perfect loyalty to me , and prowess quite in keeping with the standards he had set in the days prior to his supposed enchantment . Also , their twin protestations of affection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union , did not ring entirely falsely . It was , after all , Tristan 's feat ( i.e. , slaying the dragon of Whitehaven ) thatp100brought her to Tintagel ; and , while of course this is in no sense a legally defensible claim , I can appreciate that , in immature and excitable minds , it might serve as a shadow of a claim . It will do us both good , as fair-minded Englishmen , to remember that we are dealing here with a woman of Irish blood and a man whose upbringing was entirely Continental . In addition , there is the Queen herself as a political property to consider . Alive , she adorns my court . The populace is fond of her . Further , the long peace between Ireland and Cornwall which our marriage has assured should not be rashly jeopardized . Weighing all these factors , then , and not excluding the private dispositions of my heart , I have settled on a course of action more moderate than that which you now advise . Tristan 's banishment we may assume to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death . The Queen will remain by my side . Her long sojourn in the Wood of Morois has without doubt heightened her appreciation of the material advantages she enjoys in my palace . My power and compassion have been manifested to her , and she is essentially too rational to resist their imperative appeal . As long as her present distracted state obtains , I am compelling her to submit to psychoanalysis . If her distraction persists without improvement , I will have her committed . I am confident this will not be necessary . On the remote chance that the " magic potion " is more than a fable , I have instructed my alchemists to develop an antidote . I am fully in control of matters at last . All the best , ( Dictated but not signed ) MARK : REXp101HE LIVED ALONE , in a room only she had ever made habitable . Each morning he awoke to the same walls and was always slightly surprised at the sameness of the cracks and nail holes and replastered patches , as if this pattern were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not added the merest nick of a new idea . He awoke to the same ticking clock on the mock mantel , the same shivering half-height refrigerator , the same nagging sour smell that , behind the baseboard and around the sink , had come to live with him . He would dress , and boil an egg , and crack it on a piece of toast , and heat last evening 's coffee , and rinse the plate and cup , and take up a book and sit and wait . The chair would grow suffocating . The sense of the words would skid and circle senselessly under the print . He would rise , and walk around the room , pausing at every place where they had lain together , staring , as if terrified , at the bed that still bore two pillows . She was a nurse , and worked afternoons and evenings , andp102used to come to him in the mornings . He was a student , but of what , he had forgotten . As if to remember , he would look out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several brick walls , and a small flat roof of pebbles her bare feet had consecrated in the summer past , and a rusty construct of metal , almost organically complex , that was a chimney or a vent or the mouth of a chute and that may or may not have been in use . In the broad gaps between brick walls he could see a skyline that had a gold dome in it , and delicate smokestacks which the morning sun whittled like church balusters , and parallel plumes of smoke quickly indistinguishable from natural clouds , and a kind of subdued twinkle that testified to the world of activity the city , like the surface of a sea , concealed . At moments his dull attention caught , like a slack sail idly filling , a breath , from this multifaceted horizon , of the hope that set in motion and sustained so many industrial efforts , so much commercial traffic , such ingenious cross-fertilization of profit , such energetic devotion to the metamorphosis of minerals , the transport of goods , the interplay of calculations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes like one of those laborious Asiatic pictorial conceits that compose an elephant out of naked maidens , or depict a tree of gods whose faintest twig doubles as a smile and whose smallest bud is also a fingernail . A sense of human constructiveness would seize him and try to lift him again into the airy realm of fresh ideas , eddying notes , scholarly ambition , and purpose . The forgotten object of his studies would present itself to him like a long-scorned wife who has taken a lover and again grown beautiful . He would panic with jealousy.  |p103But  the pang , like a flitting glimmer from something reflective in the horizon , would pass ; his eyes would shorten their focus and he would leadenly observe how the rectangular windowpanes were being rounded by the infringement of successive layers of paint carelessly applied to the mullions . A kind of demon of disconnectionwould abruptly occupy his body , and he felt his heart as an angrily pulsing intruder , his hands as hanging presences weighted with blood sent from a great distance . He realized within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upheld his life , and felt its complexity as a terrible tenuousness . He would go to the sofa and lift one of the cushions . There , in a dingy sanctum of upholstery , lay a few long hairs , almost invisible on the black cloth . He would study them as if to re-create the head from which they had strayed , and the face that had masked this head with a soul , and the body that had given this soul extension . By picking up one hair and holding it to the light he could detect a faint ghost of the golden color that often had spilled , a vivid gift , across his bare shoulders . He would replace the hair , and restore the cushion , as spinsters press a flower into a Bible . The room was , if anything , bigger than it needed to be . When he sat and tried to read , the unused space seemed to watch him with eyes of knobs and nail holes and knotted configurations in the carpet . The space cried for another person to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; their voices had flattened the walls , pressed the furniture back into its servile state of being wood and cloth , submerged the shuddering of the refrigerator and the ticking of the clock . When he opened the door to her ( she always looked a little startled and wary , but why ?  --  who could she expect it to be but him ? ) , his heart would fill his chest so tightly he had to hold her against him , like a compress , for minutes while the threat of its bursting subsided . From the first , their embrace had seemed predetermined . His hands always went to the same places on her back , one at the nape of her neck , the other at the base of her spine . Always he rested his face on the same side of her head , so that for all he knew now she might have worn a different perfume behind the other ear . The perfume he inhaled was powdery , a hushed fragrance less of flowers than of spice , strangely far away in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in his imagination , with an ethereal sweetness left from the hospital corridors . She was clean , beautifully clean , and he had associated this also with her work in the hospital , work which , it seemed to him , in its daily experience of bodies enabled her to accept , so totally , so frontally , his own . Usually she would be wearing a street dress when she came , blue or green or brown , and when she left , at noon , she would be wearing a nurse 's white uniform . Between these two costumes there was a third , when she was clothed in herself ; so that the morning , which in the days before she first came had been so single in its purpose and so monotonous in its execution , became instead a triptych , whose two side panels , when her footsteps had receded down the stairs and the outer door of the building had closed behind her , folded in memory over the central panel , whose beauty could not be remembered but had to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours took their tint from the pattern of her visits , the hour after nine being blue or green or brown , the hour after that tan and blond and pink and pale , and the final hour , the most hurried , often a few quick minutes , sheer white , like the flash that engulfs the screen when the film has run out and clatters loosely in the projector . Perhaps because these minutes were closest to him , across the long gap that separated him from her last visit , he saw them most distinctly  --  the square folds of her starched blouse , the sudden bun she composed with the hairpins they could find , the flat white shoes and plain cotton stockings that , in innocently shaping her calves and starkly emphasizing her female solidity , revived the erotic fire her natural body , in its pliant naturalness , had damped . He loved her in her uniform , and on the occasions when he had ventured into the hospital for a glimpse of her he felt in the corridors of identically uniformed women as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lascivious nuns who throng French pornography . There was , in her rising from beside him to don white , something blasphemous and yet holy , a reassumption of virginity emblematic of the ( to a man ) mysterious inviolability of a woman . It was like nothing else in his experience . A book , once read , can only be reread ; a machine , used , imperceptibly wears out . But she , she came to him always beautifully clean , and unexperienced , and slightly startled , like a morning , and left , at noon , immaculate . Dressed otherwise , she was in comparison disappointing . Often she left her heels and silk stockings and street dress behind in his room , as a pledge to return . Theirp106presence was not as satisfying as it should have been ; there was an unease surrounding them , a vague request to be explained and justified . And when , in the night , she returned , and passed from the uniform into them , it was a descent . Dressed as other women , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants , and ate the food , and drank sometimes too much , and nervously crossed and recrossed the legs self-consciously lengthened by high spike heels , and talked a little awry . He impossibly expected of her conversation the same total frontal fit her body gave him . The woman separated from him by a restaurant table was a needless addition to the woman who was perfect ; she wished to add needlessly to the love that needed nothing but endless continuance . It was this woman who hinted of marriage , and it was this woman who , in the dim restaurant light , misread his word " unable " to mean " unwilling , " and took offense . These evenings with her , which ended sharply and chastely at midnight , when the curfew fell in the supervised apartment where she lived , were less than entirely real and blended with the cramped dreams that dissolved under the triumphal advent of morning . Morning brought him onto another plane altogether , as when one looks up from a crowded printed page to a pale door upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratefully drink the radiance that renewed every detail of his room , and rise , and shed his dreams , and make enough fresh coffee for them both , and begin to listen . The outer door downstairs would softly open ; there was an alto squeak only she produced from the hinges . Her first steps on the flight of stairs would be inaudible . Her stealth seemed the breathy lightness ofp107expectation . Her feet would press the top treads firmly , evenly , like piano pedals ; an abrasive slither would cross the linoleum hall ; and her knock , three blurred beats with an inquisitive pause between the second and third , would sound . He listened now . The downstairs door opened . In the little skip of silence following the squeak of the hinges , his heart found space to erect a towering certainty , which toppled as the first brutal , masculine steps assaulted the stairs . Still , perhaps she was wearing boots , perhaps in the empty months her manner of mounting had changed , perhaps she was angry , or rigid with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his door , his hand lifted to turn the knob . The footsteps slithered on the linoleum and passed by . He felt relieved . He had lived so long with the vain expectation of her coming that it , the expectation , had become a kind of companion he was afraid of losing . He stared at the wall , dumbstruck by its stupidity . He turned sick of himself , physically sick , so that his arms ached and his stomach fell and the nagging sour smell behind the baseboard seemed the odor of his own rotting body . He returned to the chair and tried to study . The outer door opened again , delicately this time . His heartbeats timed the silence . He saw her , dressed in blue or green or brown , ascending the diagonal corridor toward him , her lips a little parted in the effort of stealth , her hand , slightly reddened and bony from antiseptic scrubbings , lightly touching the wall for balance . The silence lengthened , lengthened beyond recall , and he forced himself to admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind or a child had idly opened the door from outside and let it fall shut . He rose from the chair in a rage ; why did n't she know , know how he wanted her now , not in white , but in blue or green or brown ? This was the woman he wanted , the woman much like other women , the woman who talked awry in restaurants , who wanted to marry him , the woman who came to him and not the woman , in white , who left . He had accepted her leaving because of the pledge to return she left behind , the clothes that at last he recognized as her essential clothes , the everyday clothes that contained her other costumes , as skin is beneath all cloth and white is the spin of all colors . He had dreaded in marriage the loss of their mornings , their transposition into the shadowy scale of night . But she had not explained to him that the mornings were a gift , an extravagance on her part which could be curtailed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was wrong now not to know that he , lagging behind her a distance of months , had followed in the steps of her love and now had reached the exact point she had reached when they had last parted , and that she had only to stop , and turn , and take one step up the stairs to meet him . Yes , she was stupid , hasty , and cruel not to know his heart , not to hear the great cry issuing from this room ; and this blunt vision of her limitations failed to dull his love but instead dreadfully sharpened it , for love begins in earnest when we love what is limited . " My nurse , " he whispered aloud , at last putting forth , in conscious competition with the tiny notched sighing of the clock , the shuddering of the refrigerator , and the empty scratches of sound in the stairway and hallway , a sound of his own . This speaking , this invoking her aloud , was the only action he was capable of taking . To seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence withheld . To leave the room would be to abandon the possibility of receiving her visit . Even to install a telephone would be to heap another silence upon the furious silence of the stairs and of the doors . He did nothing . He did nothing all morning but maintain , with the full strength of his scattered mind and disconnected body , an unanswered vigil . At noon , the day 's reprieve arrived . She could not come now . She would be at work . His strenuous wrestle with her absence could be suspended , and did not need to be resumed until tomorrow morning . Perhaps tomorrow he would be weaker and , therefore , less caring , stronger . He felt that these mornings were aging him ; he looked in the mirror for traces of the strange painless pain that punished him , like a punctual masseur , for three hours each day . The mirror , too , was unanswering . If anything were to show , it would be in the eyes , and one 's eyes , self-confronted , lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel his heart as an intruder . Like someone dressing in clothes wildly scattered about on the night before , he could reassemble his presence and leave the room . He could enter the twinkling city , eat , keep appointments , confront people , confident that his outwardappearance had not altered , that just as his body had refused to burst in its fullness before , so now it failed to collapse in its emptiness . Resuming , in part , a student 's detached interestedness , he heard himself talk , give answers , even laugh . He saw , with a blurring double sense of being a fraud and defrauded both , that a passable life could be patched together out of afternoons and evenings . But his mornings had been destroyed , and the morning of his life taken from him.  |p110BLOWFISH  with light bulbs inside their dried skins glowed above the central fortress of brown bottles . The bar was rectangular ; customers sat on all four sides . A slim schoolteacherish-looking girl , without much of a tan and with one front tooth slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner stool , and asked for a Daiquirion-the-rocks . She wore a yellow halter , turquoise shorts , and white tennis sneakers . The bartender , who was not visibly malformed , nevertheless moved like a hunchback , with a sideways bias and the scuttling nimbleness peculiar to cripples . He wore a powder-blue polo shirt , and now and then paused to take a rather avid sip from a tall glass containing perhaps orange juice ; his face was glazed with sweat and he kept peering toward the outdoors , as if expecting to be relieved of duty . The green sea was turning gray under round pink clouds . A boat dullyp111knocked against the cement wharf , and suddenly the noise had the subtle importance noises in these latitudes assume at night . A member of the steel band , a tall , longjawedNegro , materialized in the rear of the place , on a shallow shadowy platform where the cut and dented steel drums were stacked . After unstacking and mounting them , this Negro , who wore a tattered red shirt and held a dead cigarette in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experimentally tapped into the air a succession , a cluster , an overlapping cascade of transparent notes that for a moment rendered everyone at the bar silent . Then a homosexual with a big head turned to the schoolteacherish girl , who had been served , and said , " See my pretty hat ? " His head seemed big because his body was small , a boy 's body , knobby and slack and ill-fitted to his veined man 's hands and to his face . His eyes were very close together , making him seem to concentrate , without rest , upon a disagreeable internal problem , and his lips  --  which in their curt cut somehow expressed New York City  --  were too quick , snapping in and out of a grin as if he were trying to occupy both sides of his situation , being both the shameless clown and the aloof , if amused , onlooker . He had been talking about his hat , half to himself , since four o'clock this afternoon , and when he held it out to the girl an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the yellow darkness around the bar . The hat was a cheap broadweave straw with a bird 's nest of artificial grass set into the crown , a few glass eggs fixed in the nest , and several toy birds suspended on stiff wires above it , as if in flight . " I designed it myself , " he explained . " For the carnival thisp112weekend . Is n't it marvellously uninhibited ? " He glanced around , checking on the size of his audience . He was well known here . If he had scraped , from the surface of indifference , a few shreds of attention , it was because of the girl . Her coming in here , at this twilight hour , alone , bearing herself with such prim determined carelessness , was odd enough to attract notice , even at a tropical bar , where everything is permitted to happen . " It 's lovely , " she said , of the hat , and sipped her drink . " Do you want to put it on ? Please try it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I designed it myself , " he said , looking around and deciding to make a speech . " That 's the way I am . I just give my ideas away . " He flung up his hands in a gesture of casting away , and a breeze moved in from the street as if to accept his gift . " If I were like other people , I 'd make money with my ideas . Money , monnney . It 's excrement , but I love it . " A brief anonymous laugh rose and was borne off by the breeze . The homosexual returned to the girl with a tender voice . " You do n't have to put it on , " he told her . " It 's not really finished . When I get back to my room , where I 've been meaning to go all day , if that fiend "  --  he pointed at the bartender , who with his slightly frantic deftness was pouring a rum Collins  --  " would let me go . He says I owe him monnney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to add a few touches , here , and here . A few spangly things , just a few . It 's for the carnival this weekend . Are you down here for the carnival ? " " No , " the girl said . " I 'm flying back tomorrow . " " You should stay for the carnival . It 's wonderfully uninhibited . "  | " I 'd like to , but I must go back . " Unexpectedly blushing , she lowered her voice and murmured somethingcontaining the word " excursion . " The homosexual slapped the bar . " Forgive me , forgive me , dear Lord above "  --  he rolled his eyes upward , to the glowing blowfish and the great roaches and tarantulas of straw which decorated the walls  --  " but I must see how my hat looks on you , you 're so pretty . " He reached out and set the hat with its bright hovering birds on her head . She took another sip of her drink , docilely wearing the hat . A child laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful to look at ; it was as if two incisions were being held open by clamps . The child who had laughed was looking straight at him : a bright round face fine-featured as the moon , rising just barely to the level of the bar and topped by hair so fair it was white . The little boy sat between his parents , a man and a woman oddly alike , both wearing white and having stout sun-browned arms , crinkled weather-whipped faces , and irises whose extremely pale blue seemed brittle , baked by days of concentration on a glaring sea . Even their hair matched . The man 's had not been cut in months , except across his forehead , and was salt-bleached in great tufts and spirals , like an unraveling rope of half-dark strands . The woman 's , finer and longer , was upswept into a tumultuous blond crown that had apparently sheltered the roots enough to leave them , for an inch or two , dark . They looked , this husband and wife , like two sexless chieftains of a thickset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were accompanied by a gaunt German youth with swarthy skin , protruding eyes , close-croppedp114hair , and protruding ears . He stood behind and between them , a shadow uniting three luminaries . The homosexual crouched down on the bar and fiddled his fingers playfully . " Hi , " he said . " Are you laughing at me ? " The child laughed again , a little less spontaneously . His parents stopped conversing . " What a gorgeous child , " the homosexual called to them . " He 's so  --  so fresh . So uninhibited . It 's wonderful . " He blinked ; truly he did seem dazzled . The father smiled uneasily toward the wife ; the pale creases around his eyes sank into his tan , and his face , still young , settled into what it would become  --  the toughened , complacent , blind face of an old Scandinavian salt , the face that , pipe in teeth , is mimicked on carved bottle stoppers . " No , really , " the homosexual insisted . " He 's darling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a male Shirley Temple . " The child , his tiny pointed chin lifting in mute delight , looked upward from one to the other of his parents . His mother , in a curious protective motion , slipped from her stool and placed a sandalled foot on the rung of her child 's stool , her tight white skirt riding up and exposing half her thigh . It was stout yet devoid of fat , like the trunk of a smooth-skinned tree . The father said , " You think ? " " I think ? " the homosexual echoed eagerly , crouching further forward and touching his chin to his glass . " I know . He 'd be a male Shirley Temple . My judgment is infallible . If I was willing to leave all you lovely peoplep115and go dig in the dung , I 'd be a stinking rich talent scout living in Beverly Hills . " The father 's face collapsed deeper into its elderly future . The mother seized her thigh with one hand and ruffled the child 's hair with the other . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to draw them back into their radiant privacy . But the homosexual had been stirred . " You know , " he called to the father , " just looking at you I can feel the brine in my face . You both look as if you 've been on the ocean all of your life . " " Not quite , " the father said , so tersely it was n't heard . " I beg your pardon ? " " I have n't been on the sea all my life . " " You know , I love sailing . I love the life of the open sea . It 's so "  --  his lips balked , rejecting " uninhibited "  --  " it 's so free , so pure , all that wind , and the waves , and all that jazz . You can just be yourself . No , really . I think it 's wonderful . I love Nature . I used to live in Queens . " " Where do you live now ? " the girl beside him asked , setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't turn his head , answering as if the sailing couple had asked the question . " I live here , " he called . " In dear old St. Thomas . God 's own beloved country . Do you need a cook on your boat ? " The child tugged at his mother 's waist and pulled her down to whisper something into her ear . She listened and shook her head ; a brilliant loop of hair came undone . The father drank from the glass in front of him and in a freshened voice called across , " Not at the moment . " " I wish you did , I wish to heaven you did , I 'm ap116beautiful cook , really . I make the best omelets . You should see me ; I just put in the old eggs and a little bit of milk and a glass of brandy and some of those little green things , what are they called ?  --  chives , I put in the chives and stir until my arm breaks off and it comes out just wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , I 'd be a chef in the Waldorf . " The child 's whispered request seemed to recall the group to itself . The father turned and spoke to the German boy , who , in the instant before bowing his head to listen , threw , the whites of his eyes glimmering , a dark glance at the homosexual . Misunderstanding , the homosexual left his stool and hat and drink and went around the corner of the bar toward them . But , not acknowledging his approach , they lifted the child and walked away toward the rear of the place , where there was a jukebox . Here they paused , their brilliant hair and faces bathed in boxed light . The homosexual returned to his stool and watched them . His head was thrown back like that of a sailor who has suffered a pang at the sight of land . " Oh dear , " he said aloud , " I ca n't decide which I want to have , the man or the woman . " The schoolteacherish girl sipped her Daiquiri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birdbath . One stool away from her down the bar , there sat a beefy unshaven customer , perhaps thirty years old , drinking a beer and wearing a T-shirt with a ballpoint pen clipped to the center of the sweat-soaked neckline . Squinting intently into space and accenting some inner journey with soft grunts , he seemed a truck driver transported , direct and intact , from the counter of an Iowa roadside diner . Nextp117to him , across a space of empty stools , behind an untouched planter 's punch , sat a very different man of about the same age , a man who , from his brick-red complexion , his high knobbed forehead , the gallant immobility of his posture , and the striking corruption of his teeth , could only have been English . Into the space of three stools between them there now entered a dramatic person  --  tall , gaunt , and sandy . He displayed a decrepit Barrymore profile and a gold ring in one ear . He escorted a squat powdered woman who looked as though she had put on her lipstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . The bartender , unsmiling , awkwardly pivoting , asked , " How 's the Baron ? " " Rotten , " the Baron said ; and as he eased onto his stool his stiff wide shoulders seemed a huge coat hanger left , out of some savage stubbornness , in his coat . The woman set the dachshund on the bar . When their drinks came , the dog lapped hers , which was a lime rickey . When he tried to lap the Baron 's  --  a straight Scotch  --  the man gripped the dachshund 's thirstily wagging rump , snarled " Damn alcoholic , " and sent him skidding down the bar . The dog righted himself and sniffed the truck driver 's beer ; a placid human paw softly closed over the mouth of the glass , blocking the animal 's tongue . His nails clicking and slipping on the polished bar , the dog returned to his mistress and curled up at her elbow like a pocketbook . The girl at the corner shyly peeked at the man beside her , but he had resumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the quality of a threat , or of a scar . The blond family returned from having put a quarter into the jukebox , which played " Loco Motion , " by Littlep118Eva , " Limbo Rock , " by Chubby Checker , and " Unchain My Heart , " by Ray Charles . The music , like an infusion of letters from home , froze the people at the bar into silence . Beyond the overhang that sheltered the tables , night dominated . The bar lit up a section of pavement where pedestrians flitted like skittish actors from one wing of darkness into the other . The swish of traffic on the airport road had a liquid depth . The riding lights of boats by the wharf bobbed up and down , and a little hard half-moon rummaged for its reflection in the slippery sea . The Baron muttered to the painted old woman an angry and long story in which the obscene expressions were peculiarly emphasized , so that only they hung distinct in the air , the connecting threads inaudible . The Englishmanat last moved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a fraction of an inch , making a stoic face afterward , as if the sweetness had hurt his teeth . The homosexual , nettled by the attention received by the drinking dachshund , took off his hat and addressed the ceiling of the bar as if it were God . " Hey there , Great White Father , " he said . " You have n't been very good to me this month . I know You love me  --  how could You help it , I 'm so beautiful  --  but I have n't seen any money coming out of the sky . I mean , really , You put us down here in the manure and we need it to live , like . You know ? I mean , do n't get too uninhibited up there . Huh ? " He listened , and the Baron , undistracted , set another blue word burning in the hushed air . " That'sO.K. , " the homosexual continued . " You 've kept the sunshining , and I appreciate it . You just keep the sun shining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At prayer'sp119end , he put the hat on his head and looked around , his curt lips pursed defiantly . Five Negroes , uncostumed , in motley clothes and as various in size as their instruments , had assembled on the shadowy platform , kidding and giggling back and forth and teasing the air with rapid , stop-and-start gusts of tuning up . Abruptly they began to play . The ping-pong , the highest pan , announced itself with four harsh solo notes , and on the fifth stroke the slightly deeper guitar pans , the yet deeper cello pans , and the bass boom , which was two entire forty-four-gallon oil drums , all at once fell into the tune , and everything  --  cut and peened drums , rubber-tipped sticks , tattered shirtsleeves , bobbing heads , munching jaws , a frightened-looking little black child whipping a triangle as fast as he could  --  was in motion , in flight . The band became a great loose-jointed bird feathered in clashing , rippling bells . It played " My Basket , " and then , with hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You Come to Get Wet ? , " and " Madame Dracula . " Nobody danced . It was early , and the real tourists , the college students and Bethlehem Steel executives and Westchester surgeons , had not yet come down from dinner in the hills to sit at the tables . There was a small dance floor on one side of the bar . A young Negro appeared here . He wore canary-yellow trousers and a candy-striped jersey with a boat neck and threequartersleeves . He had a broad , hopeful face and an athletic , triangular back . From his vaguely agitated air of responsibility , he seemed to be associated with the establishment . He asked the schoolteacherish girl , who looked alone and lost , to dance ; but she , with a painedp120smile and a nervous dip of her head into her second Daiquiri , refused . The young Negro stood stymied on the dance floor , clothed only , it seemed , in music and embarrassment , his pale palms dangling foolishly . When the band , in a final plangent burst cut short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the leader , the long-jawed red shirt on the ping-pong , and said , " Ey mon , le peo-ple wan I bet Yellow Bird . ' " He phrased it , as the West Indian accent phrases all statements , like a question . The leader took offense . He answered deliberately , unintelligibly , as if , the music still ringing in the pan of his skull , he were softly tapping out a melody with his tongue . The man on the bass boom , a coarse thick-lipped mulatto in a blue work shirt unbuttoned down to his navel , joined in the argument and gave the young man a light push that caused him to step backward off the platform . The bass-boom man growled , and the strip of hairy cocoa skin his shirt exposed puffed up like a rooster 's throat . No one had danced ; the band was defensive and irritable . The leader , biting the butt of his cigarette , rattled a venomous toneless tattoo on the rim of his ping-pong . Then the shadow manning the cello pans  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them  --  spoke an unheard word , and all the Negroes , including the boy with the triangular back , broke into disjointed laughter . When the band resumed playing , they began with " Yellow Bird "  --  played flat , at a grudging tempo . The young Negro approached the blond mother of the little boy . She came with him into the center of the floor and lifted her fat fair arms . They danced delicately , sleepily , the preening shuffle of the mambo , her backside switching in its tight white dress , his broad face shiningp121as his lips silently mouthed the words : Ye-ell-o-oh bi-ird , up in the tree so high , ye-ell-o-oh bi-ird , you sit alone like I. Her thick waist seemed at home in the wide curve of his hand . When the song finished , he bowed thank you and she returned to her family by the bar and , as if sighing , let down her hair . Apparently it had been held by one pin ; she pulled this pin , the fluffy sun-bleached crown on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinding stream , and she looked , with her weather-pinched face , like a negative of a witch , or what relates to witches as angels relate to devils . The little boy , as if his heart were climbing the golden rope she had let down , whispered up to her , and she , after bowing her head to listen , glanced up at the homosexual , who was complaining to the bartender that his vodka-and-tonic had gone watery . " You owe me , " the bartender said , " a dollar-fifty , and if you let the drink sit there hour after hour , damn right it 'll melt . " " I do n't have a dollar-fifty , " was the answer . " I have washed my hands , forever and ever , amen , of filthy lucre . People want me to get a job but I wo n't ; that 's the way I am . It 's a matter of principle with me . Why should I work all day for a pittance and starve when I can do nothing whatsoever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at him fascinated . The glow of their faces caught the corner of his eye , and he turned toward them inquisitively ; memory of the snub they had given him made his expressionshy . " I want one dollar and fifty cents from you , " the bartender insisted , with unconvincing emphasis ; hisp122anxious sweat and obscurely warped posture seemed that of a warden trapped in his own prison , among inmates he feared . He gulped some orange from his glass and looked toward the outdoors for relief . Pale square clouds rested above the sea , filtering stars . Laughter like spray was wafted from a party on a yacht . The homosexual called , " Really , he is the most cunning little boy I have ever seen in all my life . In Hollywood he could be a male Shirley Temple , honestly , and when he grows up a little he could be a male what's-her-name  --  oh , what was her name ? Jane Withers . I have a beautiful memory . If I cared , I could go back to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars . " The German boy spoke for the group . " He vuntsyourhatt . " " Does he ? Does he really ? The little angel wants to wear my hat . I designed it myself for the carnival this weekend . " He left his stool , scrambled around the corner , set the hat with its glade of decoration squarely on the child 's spherical head , and , surprisingly , knelt on the floor . " Come on , " he said , " come on , darling . Get on my shoulders . Let 's go for a ride . " The father looked a question at his wife , shrugged , and lifted his son onto the stranger 's shoulders . The birds on their wires bobbed unsteadily , and fear flickered not only in the child 's face but in the grown face to which he clung . The homosexual , straightening up , seemed startled that the child was a real weight . Then , like a frail monster overburdened with two large heads , one on top of the other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to jog around the rectangular bar , his shaved legs looking knobbed and bony in their shorts . The steelp123band broke into a pachanga . Some tourist families had come down from the hills to occupy the tables , and the athletic young Negro , whose flesh seemed akin to rubber , successfully invited a studiously tanned girl with orange hair , a beauty , to dance . She had long green eyes and thin lips painted paler than her skin , and an oval of nakedness displayed her fine shoulder-bones . The Baron cursed and yanked his own lady onto the floor ; as they danced , the dachshund nipped worriedly at their stumbling feet . The Baron kicked the dog away , and in doing so turned his head , so that , to the dizzy little boy riding by , the gold ring in his ear flashed like the ring on a merry-go-round . A stately bald man , obviously a North American doctor , rose , and his wife , a midget whose Coppertone face was wrinkled like a walnut , rose to dance with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last lap around the bar and lifted the child back onto the stool . The airy loss of pressure around his neck led him to exhale breathlessly into the bright round face framed by straw , " You know , Mark Twain wrote a lovely book just about you . " He took the hat from the child 's head and replaced it on his own . The child , having misunderstood the bargain , burst into tears , and soon his mother carried him from the bar . The dancing gathered strength . The floor became crowded . From her high vantage at the corner of the bar , the schoolteacherish girl studied with downcast eyes the dancing feet . They seemed to be gently tamping smooth a surface that was too hot to touch for more than an instant . Some females , of both races , had removed their shoes ; their feet looked ugly and predatory , flickering , spread-toed , in and out of shadows and eclipses of cloth.  |p124When  the music stopped , black hands came and laid , on the spot of floor where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusty nails . A spotlight was focusedon them . The band launched into a fierce limbo . The I young Negro with the handsome rubbery back leaped , nearly naked , into the light . His body was twitching in rhythm , he was waving two flaming torches , and he was clad in knit swimming trunks and orange streamers representing , she supposed , Caribbean slave dress . His eyes shut , he thrust the torches alternately into his mouth and spit out flame . Indifferent applause rippled through the tables . The Baron , drunker than anyone had suspected , pushed off from the bar and , as the young Negro lay down on a board of nails and stroked the skin of his chest with the sticks of fire , lay down beside him and kicked his trousered legs high in parody . No one dared laugh , the Baron 's face was so impassive and rapt . The young Negro , his back resting on the nails , held one torch at arm 's length , so that the flame rested on the Baron 's coat lapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writhed on obliviously , and the smoldering threads winked out . When the Negro stood , now clearly shaken , and with a great mock-primitive grimace leaped on one board of nails with his bare feet , the Baron leaped in his sandals on the other , and through sandy eyelashes blindly peered into the surrounding darkness of applause , his earring glinting , his shoulders still seeming to have a coat hanger in them . Two black waiters , nervous as deer , ventured into the spotlight and seized his upraised arms ; as they led him out of the light , the tall figure of the white man , gasping as if he had surfaced after a ship/wreck , yet expressed , in profile , an incorrigible dignity . There was murmuring at the tables as the tourists wondered if this had been part of the act . The music pitched into an even fiercer tempo . The young Negro , handing away his torches , was given a cloth sack , which he dropped on the floor . It fell open to reveal a greenish heap of smashed bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got down and rolled in it as a dog rolls ecstatically in the rotten corpse of a woodchuck . He rested his back on the pillow of shards and the heavy mulatto left the bass boom and stood on his chest . There was applause . The mulatto jumped off and walked away . The Negro got up on his knees , cupped a glittering quantity of broken glass in his palms , and scrubbed his face with it . When he stood to take the applause , the girl observed that his back , which gleamed , heaving , a foot from her eyes , indeed did bear a few small unbleeding cuts . The applause died , the music halted , and the bright lights went on before the slave , hugging his nail-boards and bag of glass , had reached the haven of the door behind the platform . As he passed among them , the members of the steel band cackled . Now there was an intermission . The bartender , his hands trembling and his eyes watering , it seemed , on the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drinks . More tourists drifted in , and the families containing adolescents began to leave . The traffic on the airport road had diminished , and the bumping of the boats on the wharf , beneath the moon that had lost its reflection , regained importance . The people on the decks of these boats could see the windows burning in the dry hills above Charlotte Amalie , lights spread through thep126middle of the night sky like a constellation about to collide with our Earth but held back , perpetually poised in the just bearable distance , by that elusive refusal implicit in tropical time , which like the soft air seems to consist entirely of circles . Within the bar , the German boy wandered over and spoke to the homosexual , who looked up from under the brim of his hat with alert lips and no longer preoccupied eyes , all business . The very English-appearing man left his place behind the undiminishingplanter 's punch , sauntered around the bar , and commenced a conversation with the now deserted Nordic father ; the Englishman 's first words betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head on the bar and fell asleep . The dachshund licked his face , because it smelled of alcohol . The woman slapped the dog 's nose . The beefy man abruptly pulled the pen from the neck of his T-shirt , removed the cardboard coaster from under his beer , and wrote something on it , something very brief  --  one word , or a number . It was as if he had at last received a message from the ghostly trucking concern that had misplaced him here . The pingpongsounded ; the music resumed . The young Negro , changed out of costume back into his yellow pants and candy-striped boat-necked shirt , returned . Flexing his back and planting his palms on his hips , he again asked the strange girl at the corner of the bar to dance . This time , with a smile that revealed her slightly overlapping front teeth , she accepted.  |p127ORSON  ZIEGLER came straight to Harvard from the small South Dakota town where his father was the doctor . Orson , at eighteen , was half an inch under six feet tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 152 . His eczematous cheeks and vaguely irritated squint  --  as if his face had been for too long transected by the sight of a level horizon  --  masked a definite self-confidence . As the doctor 's son , he had always mattered in the town . In his high school he had been class president , valedictorian , and captain of the football and baseball teams . ( The captain of the basketball team had been Lester Spotted Elk , a full-blooded Chippewa with dirty fingernails and brilliant teeth , a smoker , a drinker , a discipline problem , and the only boy Orson ever had met who was better than he at anything that mattered . ) Orson was the first native of his town to go to Harvard , and would probablyp128be the last , at least until his son was of age . His future was firm in his mind : the pre-med course here , medical school either at Harvard , Penn , or Yale , and then back to South Dakota , where he had his wife already selected and claimed and primed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had taken her virginity . She had cried , and he had felt foolish , having , somehow , failed . It had been his virginity , too . Orson was sane , sane enough to know that he had lots to learn , and to be , within limits , willing . Harvard processes thousands of such boys and restores them to the world with little apparent damage . Presumably because he was from west of the Mississippi and a Protestant Christian ( Methodist ) , the authorities had given him as a freshman roommate a self-converted Episcopalian from Oregon . When Orson arrived at Harvard on the morning of Registration Day , bleary and stiff from the series of airplane rides that had begun fourteen hours before , his roommate was already installed . " H. Palamountain " was floridly inscribed in the upper of the two name slots on the door of Room iq .. The bed by the window had been slept in , and the desk by the window was neatly loaded with books . Standing sleepless inside the door , inertly clinging to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room without being able to locate it ; optically and mentally , he focused with a slight slowness . The roommate was sitting on the floor , barefoot , before a small spinning wheel . He jumped up nimbly . Orson 's first impression was of the wiry quickness that almost magically brought close to his face the thick-lipped , popeyedface of the other boy . He was a head shorter thanp129Orson , and wore , above his bare feet , pegged sky-blue slacks , a lumberjack shirt whose throat was dashingly stuffed with a silk foulard , and a white cap such as Orson had seen before only in photographs of Pandit Nehru . Dropping a suitcase , Orson offered his hand . Instead of taking it , the roommate touched his palms together , bowed his head , and murmured something Orson did n't catch . Then he gracefully swept off the white cap , revealing a narrow crest of curly blond hair that stood up like a rooster 's comb . " I am Henry Palamountain . " His voice , clear and colorless in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His handshake was metallically firm and seemed to have a pinch of malice in it . Like Orson , he wore glasses . The thick lenses emphasized the hyperthyroid bulge of his eyes and their fishy , searching expression . " Orson Ziegler , " Orson said . " I know . " Orson felt a need to add something adequately solemn , standing as they were on the verge of a kind of marriage . " Well , Henry "  --  he lamely lowered the other suitcase to the floor  --  " I guess we 'll be seeing a lot of each other . " " You may call me Hub , " the roommate said . " Most people do . However , call me Henry if you insist . I do n't wish to diminish your dreadful freedom . You may not wish to call me anything at all . Already I 've made three hopeless enemies in the dormitory . " Every sentence in this smoothly enunciated speech bothered Orson , beginning with the first . He himself had never been given a nickname ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his adolescence he had coined nicknames for himself  --  Orrie , Ziggy  --  andp130tried to insinuate them into popular usage , without success . And what was meant by " dreadful freedom " ? It sounded sarcastic . And why might he not wish to call him anything at all ? And how had the roommate had the time to make enemies ? Orson asked irritably , " How long have you been here ? " " Eight days . " Henry concluded every statement with a strange little pucker of his lips , a kind of satisfied silent click , as if to say , " And what do you think of that ? " Orson felt that he had been sized up as someone easy to startle . But he slid helplessly into the straight-man role that , like the second-best bed , had been reserved for him . " That long ? " " Yes . I was totally alone until the day before yesterday . You see , I hitch-hiked . " " From Oregon ? " " Yes . And I wished to allow time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had sewed a fiftydollarbill inside my shirt . As it turned out , I made smooth connections all the way . I had painted a large cardboard sign saying Harvard . ' You should try it sometime . One meets some very interesting Harvard graduates . " " Did n't your parents worry ? " " Of course . My parents are divorced . My father was furious . He wanted me to fly . I told him to give the plane fare to the Indian Relief Fund . He never gives a penny to charity . And , of course , I 'm old . I 'm twenty . " " You 've been in the Army ? " Henry lifted his hands and staggered back as if from a blow . He put the back of his hand to his brow ,  |p131whim|pered  " Never , " shuddered , straightened up smartly , and saluted . " In fact , the Portland draft board is after me right now . " With a preening tug of his two agile hands  --  which did look , Orson realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's  --  he broadened his foulard . " They refuse to recognize any conscientious objectors except Quakers and Mennonites . My bishop agrees with them . They offered me an out if I 'd say I was willing to work in a hospital , but I explained that this released a man for combat duty and if it came to that I 'd just as soon carry a gun . I 'm an excellent shot . I mind killing only on principle . " The Korean War had begun that summer , and Orson , who had been nagged by a suspicion that his duty was to enlist , bristled at such blithe pacifism . He squinted and asked , " What have you been doing for two years , then ? " " Working in a plywood mill . As a gluer . The actual gluing is done by machines , but they become swamped in their own glue now and then . It 's a kind of excessive introspection  --  you 've read Hamlet ? " " Just Macbeth and The Merchant of Venice . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solvent . One wears long rubber gloves up to one 's elbows . It 's very soothing work . The inside of a gluer is an excellent place for revolving Greek quotations in your head . I memorized nearly the whole of the Phaedo that way . " He gestured toward his desk , and Orson saw that many of the books were green Loeb editions of Plato and Aristotle , in Greek . Their spines were worn ; they looked read and reread . For the first time , the thought of beingp132at Harvard frightened him . Orson had been standing between his suitcases and now he moved to unpack . " Have you left me a bureau ? " " Of course . The better one . " Henry jumped on the bed that had not been slept in and bounced up and down as if it were a trampoline . " And I 've given you the bed with the better mattress , " he said , still bouncing , " and the desk that does n't have the glare from the window . " " Thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone . " Would you rather have my bed ? My desk ? " He jumped from the bed and dashed to his desk and scooped a stack of books from it . Orson had to touch him to stop him , and was startled by the tense muscularity of the arm he touched . " Do n't be silly , " he said . " They 're exactly alike . " Henry replaced his books . " I do n't want any bitterness , " he said , " or immature squabbling . As the older man , it 's my responsibility to yield . Here . I 'll give you the shirt off my back . " And he began to peel off his lumberjack shirt , leaving the foulard dramatically knotted around his naked throat . He wore no undershirt . Having won from Orson a facial expression that Orson himself could not see , Henry smiled and rebuttoned the shirt . " Do you mind my name being in the upper slot on the door ? I 'll remove it . I apologize . I did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was all a kind of humor . Orson tried to make a joke . He pointed and asked , " Do I get a spinning wheel , too ? " " Oh , that . " Henry hopped backward on one bare foot and became rather shy . " That 's an experiment . I orderedp133it from Calcutta . I spin for a half hour a day , after Yoga . " " You do Yoga , too ? " " Just some of the elementary positions . My ankles ca n't take more than five minutes of the Lotus yet . " " And you say you have a bishop . " The roommate glanced up with a glint of fresh interest . " Say . You listen , do n't you ? Yes . I consider myself an Anglican Christian Platonist strongly influenced by Gandhi . " He touched his palms before his chest , bowed , straightened , and giggled . " My bishop hates me , " he said . " The one in Oregon , who wants me to be a soldier . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he likes me , either . For that matter , I 've antagonized my adviser . I told him I had no intention of fulfilling the science requirement . " " For God 's sake , why not ? " " You do n't really want to know . " Orson felt this rebuff as a small test of strength . " Not really , " he agreed . " I consider science a demonic illusion of human hubris . Its phantasmal nature is proved by its constant revision . I asked him , Why should I waste an entire fourth of my study time , time that could be spent with Plato , mastering a mass of hypotheses that will be obsolete by the time I graduate ? ' " " My Lord , Henry , " Orson exclaimed , indignantly defending the millions of lives saved by medical science , " you ca n't be serious ! " " Please . Hub . I may be difficult for you , and I think it would help if you were to call me by my name . Now let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you receivedp134all A 's in high school  --  I received rather mediocre grades myself  --  and you 've come to Harvard because you believe it affords a cosmopolitan Eastern environment that will be valuable to you after spending your entire life in a small provincial town . " " Who the hell told you all this ? " The recital of his application statement made Orson blush . He already felt much older than the boy who had written it . " University Hall , " Henry said . " I went over and asked to see your folder . They did n't want to let me at first , but I explained that if they were going to give me a roommate , after I had specifically requested to live alone , I had a right to information about you , so I could minimize possible friction . " " And they let you ? " " Of course . People without convictions have no powers of resistance . " His mouth made its little satisfied click , and Orson was goaded to ask , " Why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ticked them off on two fingers . " Raphael Demos and Werner Jaeger . " Orson did not know these names , but he suspected that " Friends of yours ? " was a stupid question , once it was out of his mouth . But Henry nodded . " I 've introduced myself to Demos . A charming old scholar , with a beautiful young wife . " " You mean you just went to his house and pushed yourself in ? " Orson heard his own voice grow shrill ; his voice , rather high and unstable , was one of the things about himself that he liked least . Henry blinked , and looked unexpectedly vulnerable , so slender and bravely dressed , his ugly , yellowish , flat/nailed feet naked on the floor , which was uncarpeted and painted black . " That is n't how I would describe it . I went as a pilgrim . He seemed pleased to talk to me . " He spoke carefully , and his mouth abstained from clicking . That he could hurt his roommate 's feelings  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply than any of the surprises he had been deliberately offered . As quickly as he had popped up , Henry dropped to the floor , as if through a trapdoor in the plane of conversation . He resumed spinning . The method apparentlycalled for one thread to be wound around the big toe of a foot and to be kept taut by a kind of absentmindedpedal motion . While engaged in this , he seemed hermetically sealed inside one of the gluing machines that had incubated his garbled philosophy . Unpacking , Orson was slowed and snagged by a complicated mood of discomfort . He tried to remember how his mother had arranged his bureau drawers at home  --  socks and underwear in one , shirts and handkerchiefs in another . Home seemed infinitely far from him , and he was dizzily conscious of a great depth of space beneath his feet , as if the blackness of the floor were the color of an abyss . The spinning wheel steadily chuckled . Orson 's buzz of unease circled and settled on his roommate , who , it was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orson , busy as he had been with the practical business of being a good student , had hardly considered . It was also clear that Henry had thought unintelligently . This unintelligence ( " I received rather mediocre grades myself " ) was more of a menace than a comfort . Bent above the bureau drawers , Orson felt cramped in his mind , able neither to stand erect in wholeheartedp136contempt nor to lie down in honest admiration . His mood was complicated by the repugnance his roommate'sphysical presence aroused in him . An almost morbidly clean boy , Orson was haunted by glue , and a tacky ambience resisted every motion of his unpacking . The silence between the roommates continued until a great bell rang ponderously . The sound was near and yet far , like a heartbeat within the bosom of time , and it seemed to bring with it into the room the muffling foliation of the trees in the Yard , which to Orson 's prairie-honed eyes had looked tropically tall and lush ; the walls of the room vibrated with leaf shadows , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or angels of whom several could dance on the head of a pin  --  thronged the air and made it difficult to breathe . The stairways of the dormitory rumbled . Boys dressed in jackets and neckties crowded the doorway and entered the room , laughing and calling " Hub . Hey , Hub . " " Get up off the floor , dad . " " Jesus , Hub , put your shoes on . " " Pee-yew " " And take off that seductive sarong around your neck . " " Consider the lilies , Hub . They toil not , neither do they spin , and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these . " " Amen , brothers ! " " Fitch , you should be a preacher . " They were all strangers to Orson . Hub stood and smoothly performed introductions.  |p137In  a few days , Orson had sorted them out . That jostling conglomerate , so apparently secure and homogeneous , broke down , under habitual exposure , into double individuals : roommates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Young and Carter , Petersen and Fitch . Silverstein and Koshland , who lived in the room overhead , were Jews from New York City . All Orson knew about non-biblical Jews was that they were a sad race , full of music , shrewdness , and woe . But Silverstein and Koshland were always clowning , always wisecracking . They played bridge and poker and chess and Go and went to the movies in Boston and drank coffee in the luncheonettes around the Square . They came from the " gifted " high schools of the Bronx and Brooklyn respectively , and treated Cambridge as if it were another borough . Most of what the freshman year sought to teach them they seemed to know already . As winter approached , Koshland went out for basketball , and he and his teammates made the floor above bounce to the thump and rattle of scrimmages with a tennis ball and a wastebasket . One afternoon , a section of ceiling collapsed on Orson 's bed . Next door , in Room 12 , Dawson and Kern wanted to be writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dawson had a sulky , slouching bearing , a certain puppyish facial eagerness , and a terrible temper . He was a disciple of Anderson and Hemingway and himself wrote as austerely as a newspaper . He had been raised as an atheist , and no one in the dormitory incited his temper more often than Hub . Orson , feeling that he and Dawson came from opposite edges of that greatp138psychological realm called the Midwest , liked him . He felt less at ease with Kern , who seemed Eastern and subtly vicious . A farm boy driven by an unnatural sophistication , riddled with nervous ailments ranging from conjunctivitis to hemorrhoids , Kern smoked and talked incessantly . He and Dawson maintained between them a battery of running jokes . At night Orson could hear them on the other side of the wall keeping each other awake with improvised parodies and musical comedies based on their teachers , their courses , or their fellow-freshmen . One midnight , Orson distinctly heard Dawson sing , " My name is Orson Ziegler , I come from South Dakota . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tend to be a niggler , and masturbate by quota . " Across the hall , in 15 , lived Young and Carter , Negroes . Carter was from Detroit and very black , very clipped in speech , very well dressed , and apt to collapse , at the jab of a rightly angled joke , into a spastic giggling fit that left his cheeks gleaming with tears ; Kern was expert at breaking Carter up . Young was a lean , malt-pale colored boy from North Carolina , here on a national scholarship , out of his depth , homesick , and cold . Kern called him Br'er Possum . He slept all day and at night sat on his bed playing the mouthpiece of a trumpet to himself . At first , he had played the full horn in the afternoon , flooding the dormitory and its green envelope of trees with golden , tremulous versions of languorous tunes like " Sentimental Journey " and " The Tennessee Waltz . " It had been nice . But Young 's sombre sense of tact  --  a slavish drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him  --  soon cancelled these harmless performances . He took to hiding from thep139sun , and at night the furtive spitting sound from across the hall seemed to Orson , as he struggled into sleep , music drowning in shame . Carter always referred to his roommate as " Jonathan , " mouthing the syllables fastidiously , as if he were pronouncing the name of a remote being he had just learned about , like Rochefoucauld or Demosthenes . Cattycorner up the hall , in unlucky 13 , Petersen and Fitch kept a strange household . Both were tall , narrowshouldered , and broad-bottomed ; physiques aside , it was hard to see what they had in common , or why Harvard had put them together . Fitch , with dark staring eyes and the flat full cranium of Frankenstein 's monster , was a child prodigy from Maine , choked with philosophy , wild with ideas , and pregnant with the seeds of the nervous breakdown he was to have , eventually , in April . Petersen was an amiable Swede with a transparent skin that revealed blue veins in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reporter for the Duluth Herald . He had all the newsman 's tricks : the side-of-the-mouth quip , the nip of whiskey , the hat on the back of the head , the habit of throwing still-burning cigarettes onto the floor . He did not seem quite to know why he was at Harvard , and in fact did not return at the end of the freshman year . But , while these two drifted toward their respective failures , they made a strangely well-suited couple . Each was strong where the other was helpless . Fitch was so uncoordinated and unorganized he could not even type ; he would lie on his bed in pajamas , writhing and grimacing , and dictate a tangled humanities paper , twice the requested length and mostly about books that had not been assigned , while Petersen , typing with a hectic two/finger system , would obligingly turn this chaotic monologue into " copy . " His patience verged on the maternal . When Fitch appeared for a meal wearing a coat and tie , the joke ran in the dormitory that Petersen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas out of the superabundance painfully cramming his big flat head . Petersen had absolutely no ideas ; he could neither compare , contrast , nor criticize St. Augustine and Marcus Aurelius . Perhaps having seen , so young , so many corpses and fires and policemen and prostitutes had prematurely blighted his mind . At any rate , mothering Fitch gave him something practical to do , and Orson envied them . He envied all the roommates , whatever the bond between them  --  geography , race , ambition , physical size  --  for between himself and Hub Palamountain he could see no link except forced cohabitation . Not that living with Hub was superficially unpleasant . Hub was tidy , industrious , and ostentatiously considerate . He rose at seven , prayed , did Yoga , spun , and was off to breakfast , often not to be seen again until the end of the day . He went to sleep , generally , at eleven sharp . If there was noise in the room , he would insert rubber plugs in his ears , put a black mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the day , he kept a rigorous round of appointments : he audited two courses in addition to taking four , he wrestled three times a week for his physical-training requirement , he wangled tea invitations from Demos and Jaeger and the Bishop of Massachusetts , he attended free evening lectures and readings , he associated himself with Phillips Brooks House and spent two afternoons a week supervising slum boys in ap141Roxbury redevelopment house . In addition , he had begun to take piano lessons in Brookline . Many days , Orson saw him only at meals in the Union , where the dormitory neighbors , in those first fall months when their acquaintance was crisp and young and differing interests had not yet scattered them , tended to regroup around a long table . In these months there was often a debate about the subject posed under their eyes : Hub 's vegetarianism . There he would sit , his tray heaped high with a steaming double helping of squash and lima beans , while Fitch would try to locate the exact point at which vegetarianism became inconsistent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " Hub said . " You realize that every egg , from the chicken 's point of reference , is a newborn baby ? " " But in fact it is not unless it has been fertilized by a rooster . " " But suppose , " Fitch pursued , " as sometimes happens  --  which I happen to know , from working in my uncle 's henhouse in Maine  --  an egg that should be sterile has in fact been fertilized and contains an embryo ? " " If I see it , I naturally do n't eat that particular egg , " Hub said , his lips making that satisfied concluding snap . Fitch pounced triumphantly , spilling a fork to the floor with a lurch of his hand . " But why ? The hen feels the same pain on being parted from an egg whether sterile or fertile . The embryo is unconscious  --  a vegetable . As a vegetarian , you should eat it with special relish . " He tipped back in his chair so hard he had to grab the table edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " Dawson said , frowning darkly  --  these discussions , clogging some twist of his ego , often spilled him into a vile temper  --  " that psychoanalysis of hens is hardly relevant . " " On the contrary , " Kern said lightly , clearing his throat and narrowing his pink , infected eyes , " it seems to me that there , in the tiny , dim mind of the hen  --  the minimal mind , as it were  --  is where the tragedy of the universe achieves a pinpoint focus . Picture the emotional life of a hen . What does she know of companionship ? A flock of pecking , harsh-voiced gossips . Of shelter ? A few dung-bespattered slats . Of food ? Some flecks of mash and grit insolently tossed on the ground . Of love ? The casual assault of a polygamous cock  --  cock in the Biblical sense . Then , into this heartless world , there suddenly arrives , as if by magic , an egg . An egg of her own . An egg , it must seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must cherish it , its beautiful baldness , its gentle lustre , its firm yet somehow fragile , softly swaying weight . " Carter had broken up . He bent above his tray , his eyes tight shut , his dark face contorted joyfully . " Puhleese , " he gasped at last . " You 're making my stomach hurt . " " Ah , Carter , " Kern said loftily , " if that were only the worst of it . For then , one day , while the innocent hen sits cradling this strange , faceless , oval child , its little weight swaying softly in her wings "  --  he glanced hopefully at Carter , but the colored boy bit his lower lip and withstood the jab  --  " an enormous man , smelling of beer and manure , comes and tears the egg from her grasp . And why ? Because he "  --  Kern pointed , arm fully extended , across the table , so that his index finger , orange with nicotine , almost touched Hub 's nose  --  " he , Saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' he cries voraciously , so that brutal steers and faithless pigs can continue to menace the children of American mothers ! " Dawson slammed his silver down , got up from the table , and slouched out of the dining room . Kern blushed . In the silence , Petersen put a folded slice of roast beef in his mouth and said , chewing , " Jesus , Hub , if somebody else kills the animals you might as well eat ' em . They do n't give a damn any more . " " You understand nothing , " Hub said simply . " Hey , Hub , " Silverstein called down from the far end of the table . " What 's the word on milk ? Do n't calves drink milk ? Maybe you 're taking milk out of some calf 's mouth . " Orson felt impelled to speak . " No , " he said , and his voice seemed to have burst , its pitch was so unsteady and excited . " As anybody except somebody from New York would know , milch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hub , is your shoes . You wear leather shoes . " " I do . " The gaiety left Hub 's defense of himself . His lips became prim . " Leather is the skin of a steer . " " But the animal has already been slaughtered . " " You sound like Petersen . Your purchase of leather goods  --  what about your wallet and belt , for that matter ?  --  encourages the slaughter . You 're as much of a murderer as the rest of us . More of one  --  because you think about it . " Hub folded his hands carefully in front of him , propping them , almost in prayer , on the table edge . Hisp144voice became like that of a radio announcer , but an announcer rapidly , softly describing the home stretch of a race . " My belt , I believe , is a form of plastic . My wallet was given to me by my mother years ago , before I became a vegetarian . Please remember that I ate meat for eighteen years and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other concentrated source of protein , I would not eat eggs . Some vegetarians do not . On the other hand , some vegetarians eat fish and take liver extract . I would not do this . Shoes are a problem . There is a firm in Chicago that makes non-leather shoes for extreme vegetarians , but they 're very expensive and not comfortable . I once ordered a pair . They killed my feet . Leather , you see , breathes ' in a way no synthetic substitute does . My feet are tender ; I have compromised . I apologize . For that matter , when I play the piano I encourage the slaughter of elephants , and in brushing my teeth , which I must do faithfully because a vegetable diet is so heavy in carbohydrates , I use a brush of pig bristles . I am covered with blood , and pray daily for forgiveness . " He took up his fork and resumed eating the mound of squash . Orson was amazed ; he had been impelled to speak by a kind of sympathy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy . He tried to defend himself . " There are perfectly wearable shoes , " he said , " made out of canvas , with crepe-rubber soles . " " I 'll look into them , " Hub said . " They sound a little sporty to me . " Laughter swept the table and ended the subject . After lunch Orson walked to the library with the beginnings of indigestion ; a backwash of emotion was upsetting his stomach . There was a growing confusion inside him hep145could not resolve . He resented being associated with Hub , and yet felt attacked when Hub was attacked . It seemed to him that Hub deserved credit for putting his beliefs into practice , and that people like Fitch and Kern , in mocking , merely belittled themselves . Yet Hub smiled at their criticism , took it as a game , and fought back in earnest only at Orson , forcing him into a false position . ' Why ? Was it because in being also a Christian he alone qualified for serious rebuke ? But Carter went to church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaked in the breast pocket , every Sunday ; Petersen was a nominal Presbyterian ; Orson had once seen Kern sneaking out of Mem Chapel ; and even Koshland observed his holidays , by cutting classes and skipping lunch . Why , therefore , Orson asked himself , should I-Iub pick on him ? And why should he care ? He had no real respect for Hub . Hub 's handwriting was childishly large and careful and his first set of hour exams , even in the course on Plato and Aristotle , had yielded a batch of C 's . Orson resented being condescendedto by an intellectual inferior . The knowledge that at the table he had come off second best galled him like an unfair grade . His situation with Hub became in his head a diagram in which all his intentions curved off at right angles and his strengths inversely tapered intonothing . Behind the diagram hung the tuck of complacence in Hub 's lips , the fishy impudence of his eyes , and the keenly irksome shape and tint of his hands and feet . These images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back and forth to classes , and along the congested streets around the Square ; now and then the glaze of an eye or the flat yellowish nail of ap146big toe welled up distinctly through the pages of a book and , greatly magnified , slid with Orson into the unconsciousnessof sleep . Nevertheless , he surprised himself , sitting one February afternoon in Room 12 with Dawson and Kern , by blurting , " I hate him . " He considered what he had said , liked the taste of it , and repeated , " I hate the bastard . I 've never hated anybody before in my life . " His voice cracked and his eyes warmed with abortive tears . They had all returned from Christmas vacation to plunge into the weird limbo of reading period and the novel ordeal of midyear exams . This was a dormitory , by and large , of public-school graduates , who feel the strain of Harvard most in their freshman year . The privateschoolboys , launched by little Harvards like Exeter and Groton , tend to glide through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundering in alcohol , or sinking into a dandified apathy . But the institution demands of each man , before it releases him , a wrenching sacrifice of ballast . At Christmas , Orson 's mother thought he looked haggard , and set about fattening him up . On the other hand , he was struck by how much his father had aged and shrunk . Orson spent his first days home listening to the mindless music on the radio , hours of it , and driving through farmland on narrow straight roads already banked bright with plowed snow . The South Dakota sky had never looked so open , so clean ; he had never realized before that the high dry sun that made even sub-zero days feel warm at noon was a local phenomenon . He made love to his girl again , and again she cried . He said to her he blamed himself , forp147ineptitude ; but in his heart he blamed her . She was not helping him . Back in Cambridge , it was raining , raining in January , and the entryway of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radcliffe girls in slickers and sneakers . Hub had stayed here , alone in their room , and had celebrated Christmas with a fast . In the monotonous , almost hallucinatory month of rereading , outlining , and memorizing , Orson perceived how little he knew , how stupid he was , how unnatural all learning is , and how futile . Harvard rewarded him with three A 's and a B. Hub pulled out two B 's and two C 's . Kern , Dawson , and Silverstein did well ; Petersen , Koshland , and Carter got mediocre grades ; Fitch flunked one subject , and Young flunked three . The pale Negro slunk in and out of the dorm as if he were diseased and marked for destruction ; he became , while still among them , a rumor . The suppressed whistling of the trumpetmouthpiece was no longer heard . Silverstein and Koshland and the basketball crowd adopted Carter and took him to movies in Boston three or four times a week . After exams , in the heart of the Cambridge winter , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full-year courses , heading into their second half , sometimes put on , like a new hat , a fresh professor . The days quietly lengthen ; there is a snowstorm or two ; the swimming and squash teams lend the sports pages of the Crimson an unaccustomed note of victory . A kind of foreshadow of spring falls bluely on the snow . The elms are seen to be shaped like fountains . The discs of snow pressed by boots into the sidewalk by Albiani 's seemp148large precious coins ; the brick buildings , the arched gates , the archaic lecterns , and the barny mansions along Brattle Street dawn upon the freshman as a heritage he temporarily possesses . The thumb-worn spines of his now familiar textbooks seem proof of a certain knowingness , and the strap of the green book bag tugs at his wrist like a living falcon . The letters from home dwindle in importance . The hours open up . There is more time . Experiments are made . Courtships begin . Conversations go on and on ; and an almost rapacious desire for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , that Orson made his confession . Dawson turned his head away as if the words had menaced him personally . Kern blinked , lit a cigarette , and asked , " What do n't you like about him ? " " Well "  --  Orson shifted his weight uncomfortably in the black but graceful , shapely but hard Harvard chair  --  " it 's little things . Whenever he gets a notice from the Portland draft board , he tears it up without opening it and scatters it out the window . " " And you 're afraid that this incriminates you as an accessory and they 'll put you in jail ? " " No  --  I do n't know . It seems exaggerated . He exaggerates everything . You should see how he prays . " " How do you know how he prays ? " " He shows me . Every morning , he gets down on his knees and throws himself across the bed , his face in the blanket , his arms way out . " He showed them . " God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's medieval . It 's more than medieval . It 's Counter-Reformation . " " I mean , " Orson said , grimacing in realization of howp149deeply he had betrayed Hub , " I pray , too , but I do n't make a show of myself . " A frown clotted Dawson 's expression , and passed . " He 's a saint , " Kern said . " He 's not , " Orson said . " He 's not intelligent . I 'm taking Chem i with him , and he 's worse than a child with the math . And those Greek books he keeps on his desk , they look worn because he bought them second-hand . " " Saints do n't have to be intelligent , " Kern said . " What saints have to have is energy . Hub has it . " " Look how he wrestles , " Dawson said . " I doubt if he wrestles very well , " Orson said . " He did n't make the freshman team . I 'm sure if we heard him play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to miss the point , " Kern said , eyes closed , " of what Hub 's all about . " " I know goddam well what he thinks he 's all about , " Orson said , " but it 's fake . It does n't go . All this vegetarianismand love of the starving Indian  --  he 's really a terribly cold bastard . I think he 's about the coldest person I 've ever met in my life . " " I do n't think Orson thinks that ; do you ? " Kern asked Dawson . " No , " Dawson said , and his puppyish smile cleared his cloudy face . " That 's not what Orson the Parson thinks . " Kern squinted . " Is it Orson the Parson , or Orson the Person ? " " I think Hub is the nub , " Dawson said . " Or the rub , " Kern added , and both burst into grinding laughter . Orson felt he was being sacrificed to the precarious peace the two roommates kept between themselves , and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last , a nickname of sorts : Orson the Parson . Several nights later they went to hear Carl Sandburg read in New Lecture Hall  --  the four adjacent roommates , plus Fitch . To avoid sitting next to Hub , who aggressively led them into a row of seats , Orson delayed , and so sat the farthest away from the girl Hub sat directly behind . Orson noticed her immediately ; she had a lavish mane of coppery red hair which hung down loose over the back of her seat . The color of it , and the abundance , reminded him , all at once , of horses , earth , sun , wheat , and home . From Orson 's angle she was nearly in profile ; her face was small , with a tilted shadowy cheekbone and a pale prominent ear . Toward the pallor of her profile he felt an orgasmic surge ; she seemed suspended in the crowd and was floating , a crest of whiteness , toward him . She turned away . Hub had leaned forward and was saying something into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relayed it to Dawson , who whispered to Kern and Orson ; " Hub said to the girl , You have beautiful hair . ' " Several times during the reading , Hub leaned forward to add something more into her ear , each time springing spurts of choked laughter from Fitch , Dawson , and Kern . Meanwhile , Sandburg , his white bangs as straight and shiny as a doll 's wig of artificial fibre , incanted above the lectern and quaintly strummed a guitar . Afterward , Hub walked with the girl into the outdoors . From a distance Orson saw her white face turn and crumple into a laugh . Hub returned to his friends with the complacent nick inp151the corner of his mouth deepened , in the darkness , to a gash . It was not the next day , or the next week , but within the month that Hub brought back to the room a heap of red hair . Orson found it lying like a diaphanous corpse on a newspaper spread on his bed . " Hub , what the hell is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinning wheel . " Hair . " " Human hair ? " " Of course . " " Whose ? " " A girl 's . " " What happened ? " The question sounded strange ; Orson meant to ask , " What girl 's ? " Hub answered as if he had asked that question . " It 's a girl I met at the Sandburg reading ; you do n't know her . " " This is her hair ? " " Yes . I asked her for it . She said she was planning to cut it all off this spring anyway . " Orson stood stunned above the bed , gripped by an urge to bury his face and hands in the hair . " You 've been seeing her ? " This effeminate stridence in his voice : he despised it and only Hub brought it out . " A little . My schedule does n't allow for much social life , but my adviser has recommended that I relax now and then . " " You take her to movies ? " " Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . "  | " Of course . " Hub took him up on his tone . " Please remember I 'm here on my savings alone . I have refused all financial assistance from my father . " " Hub "  --  the very syllable seemed an expression of pain  --  " what are you going to do with her hair ? " " Spin it into a rope . " " A rope ? " " Yes . It 'll be very difficult ; her hair is terribly fine . " " And what will you do with the rope ? " " Make a knot of it . " " A knot ? " " I think that 's the term . I 'll coil it and secure it so it ca n't come undone and give it to her . So she 'll always have her hair the way it was when she was nineteen . " " How the hell did you talk this poor girl into it ? " " I did n't talk her into it . I merely offered , and she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't see why this should offend your bourgeois scruples . Women cut their hair all the time . " " She must think you 're insane . She was humoring you . " " As you like . It was a perfectly rational suggestion , and my sanity has never been raised as an issue between us . " Well , I think you 're insane . Hub , you 're a nut . " Orson left the room and slammed the door , and did n't return until eleven , when Hub was asleep in his eye mask . The heap of hair had been transferred to the floor beside the spinning wheel , and already some strands were entangledwith the machine . In time a rope was produced , a braided cord as thick as a woman 's little finger , about aThe Christian Roommatesfoot long , weightless and waxen . The earthy , horsy fire in the hair 's color had been quenched in the process . Hub carefully coiled it and with black thread and long pins secured and stiffened the spiral into a disc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the girl one Friday night . The presentation appeared to satisfy him , for , as far as Orson knew , Hub had no further dates with her . Once in a while Orson passed her in the Yard , and without her hair she scarcely seemed female , her small pale face fringed in curt tufts , her ears looking enormous . He wanted to speak to her ; some obscure force of pity , or hope of rescue , impelled him to greet this wan androgyne , but the opening word stuck in his throat . She did not look as if she pitied herself , or knew what had been done to her . Something magical protected Hub ; things deflected from him . The doubt Orson had cast upon his sanity bounced back onto himself . As spring slowly broke , he lost the ability to sleep . Figures and facts churned sluggishly in an insomnious mire . His courses became four parallel puzzles . In mathematics , the crucial transposition upon which the solution pivoted consistentlyeluded him , vanishing into the chinks between the numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbalanced scales clicked down sharply and the system of interlocked elements that fanned from the lab to the far stars collapsed . In the history survey course , they had reached the Enlightenment , and Orson found himself disturbingly impressed by Voltaire 's indictment of God , though the lecturer handled it calmly , as one more dead item of intellectual history , neither true nor false . And in German , which Orson had taken to satisfyp154his language requirement , the words piled on remorselessly , and the existence of languages other than English , the existence of so many , each so vast , intricate , and opaque , seemed to prove cosmic dementia . He felt his mind , which was always more steady than quick , grow slower and slower . His chair threatened to adhere to him , and he would leap up in panic . Sleepless , stuffed with information he could neither forget nor manipulate , he became prey to obsessive delusions ; he became convinced that his girl in South Dakota had taken up with another boy and was making love to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking her virginity . In the very loops that Emily 's ballpoint pen described in her bland letters to him he read the pleased rotundity , the inner fatness of a well-loved woman . He even knew the man . It was Spotted Elk , the black-nailed Chippewa , whose impassive nimbleness had so often mocked Orson on the basketball court , whose terrible ease and speed of reaction had seemed so unjust , and whose defense  --  he recalled now  --  Emily had often undertaken . His wife had become a whore , a sqauw ; the scraggly mute reservation children his father had doctored in the charity clinic became , amid the sliding transparencies of Orson 's mind , his own children . In his dreams  --  or in those limp elisions of imagery which in the absence of sleep passed for dreams  --  he seemed to be rooming with Spotted Elk , and his roommate , who sometimes wore a mask , invariably had won , by underhanded means , the affection and admiration that were rightfully his . There was a conspiracy . Whenever Orson heard Kern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew it was about him , and about hisp155most secret habits . This ultimate privacy was outrageouslyinvaded ; in bed , half-relaxed , he would suddenly see himself bodily involved with Hub 's lips , Hub 's legs , with Hub 's veined , vaguely womanish hands . At first he resisted these visions , tried to erase them ; it was like trying to erase ripples on water . He learned to submit to them , to let the attack  --  for it was an attack , with teethand sharp acrobatic movements  --  wash over him , leaving 1111 him limp enough to sleep . These dives became the only route to sleep . In the morning he would awake and see Hub sprawled flamboyantly across his bed in prayer , or sitting hunched at his spinning wheel , or , gaudily dressed , tiptoeing to the door and with ostentatious care closing it softly behind him ; and he would hate him  --  hate his appearance , his form , his manner , his pretensions with an avidity of detail he had never known in love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrinkles flickering beside his mouth , the slightly withered look about his hands , the complacently polished creases of his leather shoes  --  seemed a poisonous food Orson could not stop eating . His eczema worsened alarmingly . By April , Orson was on the verge of going to the student clinic , which had a department called Mental Health . But at this point Fitch relieved him by having , it seemed , his nervous breakdown for him . For weeks , Fitch had been taking several showers a day . Toward the end he stopped going to classes and was almost constantly naked , except for a towel tucked around his waist . He was trying to complete a humanites paper that was already a month overdue and twenty pages too long . He left the dormitory only to eat and to take more books from the library . One night around nine , Petersen was calledp156to the phone on the second-floor landing . The Watertown police had picked Fitch up as he was struggling through the underbrush on the banks of the Charles four miles away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been told there was enough space to contain God , and proceeded to talk with wild animation to the policechief about the differences and affinities between Kierkegaard and Nietzsche . Hub , ever alert for an opportunity to intrude in the guise of doing good , went to the hall proctor  --  a spindly and murmurous graduate student of astronomy engaged , under Harlow Shapley , in an endless galaxy count  --  and volunteered himself as an expert on the case , and even conferred with the infirmary psychologist . Hub 's interpretation was that Fitch had been punished for hubris . The psychologist felt the problem was fundamentally Oedipal . Fitch was sent back to Maine . Hub suggested to Orson that now Petersen would need a roommate next year . " I think you and he would hit it off splendidly . You 're both materialists . " " I 'm not a materialist . " Hub lifted his dreadful hands in half-blessing . " Have it your way . I 'm determined to minimize friction . " " Dammit , Hub , all the friction between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I do ? Tell me , and I 'll change . I 'll give you the shirt off my back . " He began to unbutton , and stopped , seeing that the laugh was n't going to come . Orson felt weak and empty , and in spite of himself he cringed inwardly , with a helpless affection for his unreal , unreachable friend . " I do n't know , Hub , " he admitted . " I do n't know what it is you 're doing to me. "  |p157A  paste of silence dried in the air between them . Orson with an effort unstuck himself . " I think you 're right , we should n't room together next year . " Hub seemed a bit bewildered , but nodded , saying , " I told them in the beginning that I ought to live alone . " And his hurt eyes bulging behind their lenses settled into an invulnerable Byzantine stare . One afternoon in middle May , Orson was sitting stumped at his desk , trying to study . He had taken two exams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and release like two towering walls of muddy paper . His position seemed extremely precarious : he was unable to retreat and able to advance only along a very thin thread , a high wire of sanity on which he balanced above an abyss of statistics and formulae , his brain a firmament of winking cells . A push would kill him . There was then a hurried pounding up the stairs , and Hub pushed into the room carrying cradled in his arm a metal object the color of a gun and the size of a cat . It had a red tongue . Hub slammed the door behind him , snapped the lock , and dumped the object on Orson 's bed . It was the head of a parking meter , sheared from its post . A keen quick pain cut through Orson 's groin . " For God 's sake , " he cried in his contemptible high voice , " what 's that ? " " It 's a parking meter . " " I know , I can see that . Where the hell did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you until you stop being hysterical , " Hub said , and crossed to his desk , where Orson had put his mail . He took the top letter , a special delivery from the Portland draft board , and tore it in half . This time ,  |p158the  pain went through Orson 's chest . He put his head in his arms on the desk and whirled and groped in the black-red darkness there . His body was frightening him ; his nerves listened for a third psychosomatic slash . There was a rap on the door ; from the force of the knock , it could only be the police . Hub nimbly dashed to the bed and hid the meter under Orson 's pillow . Then he pranced to the door and opened it . It was Dawson and Kern . " What 's up ? " Dawson asked , frowning as if the disturbance had been created to annoy him . " It sounded like Ziegler was being tortured , " Kern said . Orson pointed at Hub and explained , " He 's castrated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hub said . " A car went out of control on Mass . Avenue and hit a parked car , which knocked a meter down . A crowd gathered . The head of the meter was lying in the gutter , so I picked it up and carried it away . I was afraid someone might be tempted to steal it . " " Nobody tried to stop you ? " Kern asked . " Of course not . They were all gathered around the driver of the car . " " Was he hurt ? " " I doubt it . I did n't look . " " You did n't look ! " Orson cried . " You 're a great Samaritan . " " I am not prey , " Hub said , " to morbid curiosity . " " Where were the police ? " Kern asked . " They had n't arrived yet . "  |p159Dawson  asked , " Well why did n't you wait till a cop arrived and give the meter to him ? " " Why should I give it to an agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . " " But it is , " Orson said . " It was a plain act of Providence that placed it in my hands , " Hub said , the corners of his lips dented securely . " I have n't decided yet which charity should receive the money it contains . " Dawson asked , " But is n't that stealing ? " " No more stealing than the State is stealing in making people pay money for space in which to park their own cars . " " Hub , " Orson said , getting to his feet . " You give it back or we 'll both go to jail . " He saw himself ruined , the scarcely commenced career of his life destroyed . Hub turned serenely . " I 'm not afraid . Going to jail under a totalitarian regime is a mark of honor . If you had a conscience , you 'd understand . " Petersen and Carter and Silverstein came into the room . Some boys from the lower floors followed them . The story was hilariously retold . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaken to demonstrate the weight of pennies it contained . Hub always carried , as a vestige of the lumberjack country he came from , an intricate all-purpose pocket knife . He began to pry open the little money door . Orson came up behind him and got him around the neck with one arm . Hub 's body stiffened . He passed the head of the meter and the open knife to Carter , and then Orson experienced sensations of being lifted , of flying , and ofp160lying on the floor , looking up at Hub 's face , which was upside down in his vision . He scrambled to his feet and went for him again , rigid with anger and yet , in his heart , happily relaxed ; Hub 's body was tough and quick and satisfying to grip , though , being a wrestler , he somehow deflected Orson 's hands and again lifted and dropped him to the black floor . This time , Orson felt a blow as his coccyxhit the wood ; yet even through the pain he perceived , gazing into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle with him as he could be . And that he could try in earnest to kill Hub and be in no danger of succeeding was also a comfort . He renewed the attack and again enjoyed the tense defensive skill that made Hub 's body a kind of warp in space through which his own body , after an ecstatic instant of contention , was converted to the supine position . He got to his feet and would have gone for Hub the fourth time , but his fellow-freshmen grabbed his arms and held him . He shook them off and without a word returned to his desk and concentrated down into his book , turning the page . The type looked extremely distinct , though it was trembling too hard to be deciphered . The head of the parking meter stayed in the room for one night . The next day , Hub allowed himself to be persuaded ( by the others ; Orson had stopped speaking to him ) to take it to the Cambridge police headquarters in Central Square . Dawson and Kern tied a ribbon around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good care of my baby . " None of them , however , had the nerve to go with Hub to the headquarters , though when he came back he said the chief was delighted to get the meter , and had thanked him , and had agreed to donate the pennies to thep161local orphans ' home . In another week , the last exams were over . The freshmen all went home . When they returned in the fall , they were different : sophomores . Petersen and Young did not come back at all . Fitch returned , made up the lost credits , and eventually graduated magna cum in History and Lit . He now teaches in a Quaker prep school . Silverstein is a biochemist , Koshland a lawyer . Dawson writes conservative editorials in Cleveland , Kern is in advertising in New York . Carter , as if obliged to join Young in oblivion , disappeared between his junior and senior years . The dormitory neighbors tended to lose sight of each other , though Hub , who had had his case shifted to the Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and once gave an evening lecture , " Why I Am an Episcopalian Pacifist . " As the litigation progressed , the Bishop of Massachusetts rather grudgingly vouched for him , and by the time of his final hearing the Korean War was over , and the judge who heard the case ruled that Hub 's convictions were sincere , as witnessed by his willingness to go to jail . Hub was rather disappointed at the verdict , since he had prepared a three-year reading list to occupy him in his cell and was intending to memorize all four Gospels in the original Greek . After graduation , he went to Union Theological Seminary , spent several years as the assistant rector of an urban parish in Baltimore , and learned to play the piano well enough to be the background music in a Charles Street cocktail lounge . He insisted on wearing his clerical collar , and as a consequence gave the bar a small celebrity . After a year of overriding people of less strong convictions , he was allowed to go to South Africa , wherep162he worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he leave the country . From there he went to Nigeria , and when last heard from  --  on a Christmas card , with French salutations and Negro Magi , which arrived , soiled and wrinkled , in South Dakota in February  --  Hub was in Madagascar , as a " combination missionary , political agitator , and soccer coach . " The description struck Orson as probably facetious , and Hub 's childish and confident handwriting , with every letter formed individually , afflicted him with some of the old exasperation . Having vowed to answer the card , he mislaid it , uncharacteristically . Orson did n't speak to Hub for two days after the parking-meter incident . By then , it seemed rather silly , and they finished out the year sitting side by side at their desks as amiably as two cramped passengers who have endured a long bus trip together . When they parted , they shook hands , and Hub would have walked Orson to the subway kiosk except that he had an appointment in the opposite direction . Orson received two A 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining three years at Harvard , he roomed uneventfully with two other colorless pre-med students , named Wallace and Neuhauser . After graduation , he married Emily , attended the Yale School of Medicine , and interned in St. Louis . He is now the father of four children and , since the death of his own father , the only doctor in the town . His life has gone much the way he planned it , and he is much the kind of man he intended to be when he was eighteen . He delivers babies , assists the dying , attends the necessary meetings , plays golf , and does good . He is honorable and irritable . If not as much loved as his father , he is perhapsp163even more respected . In one particular only  --  a kind of scar he carries without pain and without any clear memory of the amputation  --  does the man he is differ from the man he assumed he would become . He never prays.  |p164THE  MAN stood up when the woman entered the room , or , to be exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . She closed the door behind her . The room was square and furnished in a strange cool manner , midway between a home ( the pale-detailed Japanese prints on the wall , the thick carpet whose blue seemed a peculiarly intense shade of silence , the black slab sofa with its single prism-shaped pillow of Airfoam ) and an office , which it was , though no instruments or books were on view . It would have been difficult to imagine the people who could appropriately inhabit this room , were they not already here . The man and woman both were impeccably groomed . The woman wore ar linen suit , with white shoes and a white pocketbook , her silvery blond hair done up tightly in a French roll . She neverp165wore a hat . Today she wore no gloves . The man wore a summer suit of a . may slightly lighter than the woman 's , though perhaps it was merely that he stood nearer the light of the window . In this window , like the square muzzle of a dragon pinched beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Venetian blinds dimmed the light , which , since this side of the building faced away from the sun , was already refracted . The man had a full head of half-gray hair , rather wavy , and scrupulously brushed , a touch vainly , so that a lock overhung his forehead , as if he were a youth . The woman had guessed he was about ten years older than she . In addition to the possibility of vanity , she read into this casually overhanging forelock a suggestion of fatigue  --  it was afternoon ; he had already listened to so much  --  and an itch to apologize , to excuse herself , scratched her throat and made her limbs bristle with girlish nervousness . He waited to sit down until she had done so ; and even such a small concession to her sex opened a window in the wall of impersonality between them . She peeked through and was struck by the fact that he seemed neither handsome nor ugly . She did not know what to make of it , or what she was expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy and petulant . It lifted , and innocent expectation seemed to fill it . The customary flutter of panic seized her . Both bare hands squeezed the pocketbook . The purring of the air conditioner threatened to drown her first words . She felt the lack in the room of the smell of a flower ; in her own home the sills were crowded with potted plants . " I saw him only once this week , " she said at last . Out of polite habit she waited for a reply , then rememberedp166that there was no politeness here , and forced herself to go on alone . " At a party . We spoke a little ; I began the conversation . It seemed so unnatural to me that we should n't even speak . When I did go up to him , he seemed very pleased , and talked to me about things like cars and children . He asked me what I was doing these days , and I told him , Nothing . ' He would have talked to me longer , but I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't his voice so much , it was his smile ; when we were .. . seeing each other , I used to think that there was a smile only I could bring out in him , a big grin whenever he saw me that lit up his whole face and showed all his crooked teeth . There it was , when I walked up to him , that same happy smile , as if in all these months .. . nothing had changed . " She looked at the catch on her purse and decided she had begun badly . The man 's disapproval was as real to her as the sound of the air conditioner . It flowed toward her , enveloped her ine r coolness , and she wondered if it was wrong of her to feel it , wrong of her to desire his approval . She tried to lift her face as if she were not flirting . In another room she would have known herself to be considered a beautiful woman . Here beauty ceased to exist , and she was disarmed , realizing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wondered if she should try to express this . " He sees through me , " she said . " It 's what made him so wonderful then , and what makes him so terrible now . He knows me . I ca n't hide behind my face when he smiles , and he seems to be forgiving me , forgiving me for not coming to him even though . . . I ca n't . " The man readjusted himself in the chair with ap167quickness that she took for a sign of impatience . She believed she had an honest gift for saying what he did not want to hear . She tried to say something that , in its frankness and confusion , would please him . " I 'm suppressing , " she said . " He did say one thing that if he had n't been my lover he would n't have said . He looked down at my dress and asked me , in this shy voice , Did you put that on just to hurt me ? ' It was so unfair , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many dresses , and I ca n't throw out all the ones that . . . that I wore when I was seeing him . " " Describe the dress . " ' When he did speak , the level of his interest often seemed to her disappointingly low . " Oh , " she said , " an orangey-brown one , with stripes and a round neckline . A summer dress . He used to say I looked like a farm girl in it . " Yes . " He cut her short with a flipping gesture of his hand ; his occasional rudeness startled her , since she could not imagine he had learned it from any book . She found herself , lately , afraid for him ; he seemed too naive and blunt . She felt him in constant danger of doing something incorrect . Once she had a piano teacher who , in performing scales with her side by side on the bench , made a mistake . She had never forgotten it , and never learned the piano . But as always she inspected his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in their conversations , again and again to this rural fantasy , as if , being so plainly a fantasy , it necessarily contained an explanation of her misery . Perhaps he was , with this appearance of merely male impatience , trying to lead her into acknowledgment that she was too eager to dive top168the depths . His effort , insofar as it was visible , seemed rather to direct her attention to what was not obvious about the obvious . He asked , " Have you ever worn the dress here ? " How strange of him ! " To see you ? " She tried to remember , saw herself parking the car , Thursday after Thursday , locking the door , feeding the meter , walking down the sunny city street of bakeries and tailor shops and dentists ' signs , entering the dour vestibule of his building , with its metal wall-sheathing stamped with fleurs-de-lis , seeing the shadow of her gloved hand reach to darken his bell . . . . " No . I do n't think so . " " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's nothing profound about it . It 's a casual dress . It 's young . It 's not the identity a woman comes to the city in . I do n't come in just to see you ; I buy things , I visit people , sometimes I meet Harold afterward for a drink and we have dinner and go to a movie . Do you want me to talk about how I feel in the city ? " She was suddenly full of feelings about herself in the city , graceful , urgent feelings of sunlight and release that she was sure explained a great deal about her . He insisted . " Yet you wore this quite informal dress to a dinner party last weekend ? " " It was a party of our friends . It 's summer in the suburbs . The dress is simple . It 's not shabby . " " When you picked it to wear to this party where you knew he would see you , did you remember his special fondness for it ? " She wondered if he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't remember , " she said , realizing ,  |p169with  a flash of impatience , that he would make too much of this . " You think I did . " He smiled his guarded , gentle smile and shrugged . " Tell me about clothes . " " Just anything ? You want me to free-associate about clothes in general ? " " What comes to your mind . " The air conditioner flooded her silence with its constant zealous syllable . Time was pouring through her and she was wasting her session . " Well , he "  --  it was queer , how her mind , set free , flew like a magnet to this pronoun  --  " was quite funny about my clothes . He thought I overdressed , and used to kid me about what an expensive wife I 'd make . It was n't true , really ; I sew quite well , and make a lot of my things , while Nancy wears these quiet clothes from R. H. Stearns that are really quite expensive . I suppose you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd bury his face in them after I 'd taken them off , and in making love sometimes he 'd bring them back , so they 'd get all tangled up between us . " She stared at him defiantly , rather than blush . He was immobile , smiling the lightest of listening smiles , his brushed hair silvered by the window light . " Once I remember , when we were both in the city together , I took him shopping with me , thinking he 'd like it , but he did n't . The salesgirls did n't know quite who he was , a brother or a husband or what , and he acted just like a man  --  you know , restless and embarrassed . In a way , I liked his reacting that way , because one of my fears about him , when I was thinking of him as somebody I owned , was that he might be effeminate . Not on thep170surface so much as down deep . I mean , he had this passive streak . He had a way of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt she was journeying in the listening mind opposite her and had come to a narrow place ; she tried to retreat . What had she begun with ? Clothes . " He was quite lazy about his own clothes . Do you want to hear about his clothes , or just my clothes ? Next thing , I 'll be talking about the children 's clothes . " She permitted herself to giggle . He did n't respond , and to punish him she went ahead with the topic that she knew annoyed him . " He was sloppy . Even dressed up , the collars of his shirts looked unbuttoned , and he wore things until they fell apart . I remember , toward the end , after we had tried to break it off and I had n't seen him for several weeks , he came to the house to see how I was for a minute , and I ran my hand under his shirt and my fingers went through a hole in his T-shirt . It just killed me , I had to have him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well , but something about the idea of this man , who had just as much money as the rest of us , with this big hole in his undershirt , it make me weak . I suppose there was something mothering about it , but it felt the opposite , as if his dressing so carelessly made him strong , strong in a way that I was n't . I 've always felt I had to pay great attention to my appearance . I suppose it 's insecurity . And then in lovemaking , I 'd sometimes notice  --  is this too terrible , shall I stop ?  --  I 'd notice that his fingernails were dirty . " " Did you like that ? " " I do n't know . It was just something I 'd notice . " " Did you like the idea of being caressed by dirty hands ? "  | " They were his hands . " She had sat bolt upright , and his silence , having the quality of a man 's pain , hurt her . She tried to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like being  --  what 's the word , I 've suppressed it  --  debased ? But is n't that a sort of womanly thing that everybody has , a little ? Do you think I have it too much ? " A , The man reshifted his weight in the chair and his hands moved in the air diagrammatically ; a restrained agitation possessed his presence like a soft gust passing over a silver pond . " I think there are several things working here , " he said . " On the one hand you have this aggressiveness toward the man  --  you go up to him at parties , you drag him on shopping expeditions that make him uncomfortable , you go to bed with him , you 've just suggested , on your initiative rather than his . " She sat shocked . It had n't been like that . Had it ? The man went on , running one hand through his hair so that the youthful lock , recoiling , fell farther over his forehead . " Even now , when the affair is supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress that had a special meaning for him . " " I 've explained about the dress . " " Then there is this dimension , which we keep touching on , of his crooked teeth , of his being effeminate , feeble , in tatters ; of your being in comparison healthy and masterful . In the midst of an embrace you discover a hole in his undershirt . It confirms your suspicion that he is disintegrating , that you are destroying him . So that , by way of repair in a sense , you take him to bed . " " But he was fine in bed . " " At the same time you have these notions ofp172womanliness . ' You feel guilty at being the dynamic party ; hence your rather doctrinaire slavishness , your need to observe that his fingernails are dirty . Also in this there is something of earth , of your feelings about dirt , earth , the country versus the city , the natural versus the unnatural . The city , the artificial , represents life to you ; earth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who comes to you in the country and is out of his element shopping with you in the city , is of the earth . By conquering him , by entangling him in your clothes , you subdue your own death ; more exactly , you pass through it , and become a farm girl , an earth-girl , who has survived dying . These are some of my impressions . It is along these lines , I think , that we need more work . " She felt sorry for him . There it was , he had made his little Thursday effort , and it was very pretty and clever , and used most of the strands , but it did n't hold her ; she escaped . Shyly she glanced at the air conditioner and asked , " Could that be turned lower ? I can hardly hear you . " He seemed surprised , rose awkwardly , and turned it off . She giggled again . " I 'm just being masterful . " He returned to his chair and glanced at his watch . Street noises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking rapidly  --  entered the room through the new silence at the window , and diluted its unreal air . " Ca n't earth , " she asked , " mean life as much as death ? " He shrugged , displeased with himself . " In this sort of language , opposites can mean the same thing . " " If that 's what I saw in him , what did he see in me ? " " I feel you fishing for a compliment . " " I 'm not , I 'm not fishing . I do n't want complimentsp173from you , I want the truth . I need help . I 'm ridiculously unhappy , and I want to know why , and I do n't feel you 're telling me . I feel we 're at cross-purposes . " " Can you elaborate on this ? " " Do you really want me to ? " He had become totally still in his chair , rigid  --  she brushed away the impression  --  as if with fright . " Well "  --  she returned her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a mute focus that gave her leverage to lift herself  --  " when I came to you , I 'd got the idea from somewhere that by this time something would have happened between us , that I , in some sort of way , perfectly controlled and safe , would have . . . fallen in love with you . " She looked up for help , and saw none . She went on , in a voice that , since the silencing of the air conditioner , seemed harsh and blatant to her . " I do n't feel that 's happened . What 's worse  --  I might as well say it , it 's a waste of Harold 's money if I keep anything back  --  I feel the opposite has happened . I keep getting the feeling that you 've fallen in love with me . " Now she hurried . " So I feel tender toward you , and want to protect you , and pretend not to reject you , and it gets in the way of everything . You put me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or weak , or herself . You make me be strategic , and ashamed of what I feel toward Paul , because it bothers you . There . That 's the first time today either of us has dared mention his name . You 're jealous . I pity you . At least , in a minute or two  --  I saw you look at your watch  --  I can go out into the street , and go buy a cheesecake or something at the bakery , and get into the car and drive through the traffic over the bridge ; at least I loved somebody who loved me , no matter how sillyp174you make the reasons for it seem . But you  --  I ca n't picture you ever getting out of this room , or getting drunk , or making love , or needing a bath , or anything . I 'm sorry . " She had expected , after this outburst , that she would have to cry , but she found herself staring wideeyedat the man , whose own eyes  --  it must have been the watery light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chair and spread his hands on the glass top of his desk . " One of the arresting things about you , " he said , " is your insistence on protecting men . " " But I was n't like that with him . I mean , I knew I was giving him something he needed , but I did feel protected . I felt like nothing when I was with him , like the  --  center of a circle . " " Yes . " He looked at his watch , and his nostrils dilated with the beginnings of a sigh . " Well . " He stood and made worried eyebrows . A little off guard , she stood a fraction of a second later . " Next Thursday ? " he asked . " I 'm sure you 're right , " she said , turning at the door to smile ; it was a big countryish smile , regretful at the edges . The white of it matched , he noticed with an interior decorator 's eye , her hair , her suit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am neurotic . " She closed the door . The sigh that he had begun while she was in the room seemed to have been suspended until she had left . He was winning , it was happening ; but he was weary . Alone , in a soundless psychic motion like the hemispherical protest of a bubble , he subsided into the tranquil surface of the furniture.  |p175OUR  LIVES submit to archeology . For a period in my life which seems longer ago than it was , I lived in a farmhouse that lacked electricity and central heating . In the living room we had a fireplace and , as I remember , a kind of chocolate-colored rectangular stove whose top was a double row of slots and whose metal feet rested on a sheet of asbestos . I have not thought of this stove for years ; its image seems to thrust one corner from the bottom of a trench . It was as high as a boy and heated a rectangular space of air around it ; when I was sick , my parents would huddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stove , and I would try to align myself with its margin of warmth while my fever rose and fell , transformingat its height my blanketed knees into weird , intimate mountains at whose base a bowl of broth seemed a circular lake seen from afar . The stove was fueled with what we called coal oil . I wonder now , what must have been obvious then , if coal oil and kerosene are exactly the same thing . Yes , they must be , for I remember filling thep176stove and the kerosene lamps from the same can , a fivegalloncan with a side spout and a central cap which had to be loosened when I poured  --  otherwise by some trick of air pressure the can would bob and buck in my hands like an awkwardly live thing , and the spurting liquid , transparent and pungent , would spill . What was kerosene in the lamps became coal oil in the stove : so there are essential distinctions as well as existential ones . What is bread in the oven becomes Christ in the mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run outdoors . From where we lived not a highway , not a tower , not even a telephone pole was visible . We lived on the side of a hill , surrounded by trees and grass and clouds . Across a shallow valley where a greening meadow lay idle , another farm faced ours from a mirroring rise of land . Though the disposition of the barns and sheds was different , the houses were virtually identical  --  Pennsylvania sandstone farmhouses , set square to the compass and slightly tall for their breadth , as if the attic windows were straining to see over the trees . They must have been built at about the same time in the last century , and had been similarly covered , at a later date , with sandy , warm-colored stucco now crumbling away in patches . On chill April and May mornings , thin blue smoke from the chimney of the far house would seem to answer the smoke from the chimney of ours and to translate into another dimension the hissing blaze of cherry logs I had watched my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run by a mother , Carrie , and a son , Harvey . Even in her unimaginable prime Carrie could not have been muchp177over five feet tall . Now she was so bent by sixty years of stooping labor that in conversation her face was roguishly uptwisted . She wore tight high-top shoes that put a kind of hop into all her motions , and an oldfashionedbonnet , so that in profile she frightened me with her resemblance to the first bogy of my childhood , the faceless woman on the Dutch Cleanser can , chasing herself around and around with a stick . Harvey  --  called , in the country way , Harv  --  was fat but silent-footed ; his rap would rattle our door before we knew he was on the porch . There he would stand , surrounded by beagles , an uncocked shotgun drooping from his arm , while my parents vainly tried to invite him in . He preferred to talk outdoors , and his voice was faint and far , like wind caught in a bottle ; when at night he hunted coons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his beagles seemed to be escorting a silent spirit that traveled through the trees as resistlessly as the moon overhead traveled through the clouds . In the spring , Hary hitched up their mule and horizontallyplowed the gradual rise of land that mirrored the one where I stood . The linked silhouettes of the man and the mule moved back and forth like a slow brush repainting the parched pallor of the winter-faded land with the wet dark color of loam . It seemed to be happening in me ; and as I age with this century , I hold within myself this memory , this image unearthed from a pastoral epoch predating my birth , this deposit lower than which there is only the mineral void . The English excavators of Ur , as they deepened their trench through the strata of rubbish deposited byp178successive epochs of the Sumerian civilization , suddenly encountered a bed of perfectly clean clay , which they at first took to be the primordial silt of the delta . But measurements were taken and the clay proved too high to be the original riverbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clay stopped , yielding to soil again pregnant with flints and potsherds . But whereas Sumerian pottery had been turned on a wheel and not painted , these fragments bore traces of color and had been entirely hand-formed . In fact , the remnants were of an entirely different civilization , called " al Ubaid , " and the eight feet of clay were the physical record of the legendary Flood survived by Noah . My existence seems similarly stratified . At the top there is a skin of rubbish , of minutes , hours , and days , and the events and objects that occupy these days . At the bottom there is the hidden space where Harv  --  who since his mother died has sold the farm and married and moved to Florida  --  eternally plows . Between them , as thick as the distance from the grass to the clouds and no more like clay than fire is like air , interposes the dense vacancy where like an inundation the woman came and went . Let us be quite clear . She is not there . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the curious hollowness of virtually every piece of debris examined in the course of scavenging the days . While of course great caution should attend assertions about evidence so tenuous , so disjointed , and so befouled with the mud of phlegm and fatigue , each fragment seems hollow in the same way ; and a kind of shape , or at least a tendency of motion which if we could imagine it continuing uninterrupted would produce a shape , might be hypothesized . But wep179will be on firmer ground simply describing the surface layer of days . Abundantly present are small items of wearing apparel , particularly belts and shoelaces ; china plates , patterned and plain ; stainless-steel eating implements ; small tables with one loose leg ; glasses containing , like irregular jewels hurriedly stashed at the cataclysmic end of an antique queen 's reign , ice cubes ; children 's faces , voices , and toys ; newspapers ; and isolated glimpses of weather , sky , towers , and vegetation . The order of occurrence is not random ; generally , in the probing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered , often followed by an automobile gearshift and a ballpoint pen , or a fountain pen which is invariably dry . Contraceptive devices and phials apparently of medicine are not uncommon . Sometimes the page of a book is found involved with a bar of soap , and confusing snowstorms of cigarette filters and golf balls must be painstakingly worked through . Care is crucial ; days , though in sum their supply of rubbish seems endless , are each an integument of ghostly thinness . At Ur , in the delicate excavations of the tomb of Queen Shub-ad , a clumsy foot might crush a hidden skull , or a pick driven an inch too deep might prematurely bring to light a bit of gold ribbon , or a diadem , or a golden beech leaf more fragile than a wafer . So , too , the days of my life threaten , even where the crust appears to be most solid , to crumble and plunge my vision into a dreadful forsaken gold . At the touch of an old hope , the wallpaper parts and reveals the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman 's hair engulfs me . Guitar music drifts from a window , and I turn to see ifp180she notices , and newly discover that she is not there : grief fills the cavern of my mouth with a taste like ancient metal , and loss like some sweeping hypothesis of ethereal physics floods the transparent volume between the grass and the clouds . Vast streets open up , stream outward , under the revelation , and the entire world , cities and trees , seems a negative imprint of her absence , a kind of tinted hollowness from which her presence might be rebuilt , as wooden artifacts , long rotted to nothing , can be re-created from the impress they have left in clay , a shadow of paint and grain more easily erased by a finger than the dusty pattern on a butterfly 's wing . Imagine a beach . At night . The usual immutable web of stars overhead . Boats anchored , lightly swapping slaps with the water , off the sand . Many people , a picnic ; there is a large bonfire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , is there , here . Cold with fear , under the mantle of darkness , I go up to her ; restored beside my shoulder , her human smallness amazes and delights me . " How are you ? " " Fine , just fine . " " No . Really . " " Do n't ask me . I 'm all right . You 're looking very well . " " Thank you . " The nervous glitter of her eyes , looking past my shoulder into the fire , translates into yet another dimension the fire my father had set to burning aeons ago . She looks at last at me . The fire goes out in her eyes . She asks , " Would you like some coffee ? " " I do n't have a cup . "  | " I have a cup . " " Thank you . You 're very kind . " I add , touching the cup that she is touching ( our fingertips do n't touch ) , " Do n't hate me . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The taste of metal follows the taste of coffee in my mouth . " I 'm glad , " I say . " For me , it 's still bad . " " You like to think that . You enjoy suffering because you do n't know what suffering is . " And from the trapped quickness with which she moves her head from one side to the other , toward the fire and away , I realize that she is struggling not to cry ; a towering exultation seizes me and for a moment I am again her master , riding the flood . I protest , " I do know . " " No . " " I 'm sorry you hate me , " I say , to wrench a contradictionfrom her . The contradiction does not come . " I do n't think that 's what it is , " she says thoughtfully , and takes our cup from my hand , and sips as if to give her words precision . " I think it 's just that I 'm dead . I 'm dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name . " Please try to understand . I expect nothing from you ; it 's a great relief . I 'm very tired . All I want from you is to be left alone . " And I find myself saying , " Yes , " as she walks away , her long hair bouncing on her back with the quick light step she has preserved , " yes , " as if I am giving assent , aloof and scholarly , to the invincible facts around me : the rigid spatter of stars above , the sand that in passing accepts the print of my feet , the sea absent-mindedly tipping pale surf over the edge of darkness  --  ribbons ofp182phosphorescent white that unravel again and again , always in the same direction , like a typewriter carriage . ' Where am I ? It has ceased to matter . I am infinitesimal , lost , invisible , nothing . I leave the fire , the company of the others , and wander beyond the farthest ring , the circumference where guitar music can still be heard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stars in their near clarity press upon my face , bear in upon my guilt and shame with the strange , liquidly strong certainty that , humanly considered , the universe is perfectly transparent : we exist as flaws in ancient glass . And in apprehending this transparence my mind enters a sudden freedom , like insanity ; the stars seem to me a roof , the roof of days from which we fall each night and survive , a miracle . I await resurrection . Archaeology is the science of the incredible . Troy and Harappa were fables until the shovel struck home . On the beach at night , it is never totally dark or totally silent . The sea soliloquizes , the moon broods , its glitter pattering in hyphens on the water . And something else is happening , something like the aftermath of a plucked string . What ? Having fallen through the void where the woman was , I still live ; I move , and pause , and listen , and know . Standing on the slope of sand , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the line where water and air maintain their elemental truce . Hary is plowing now.  |p183MY  NAME is Alfred Schweigen and I exist in time . Last night I heard a young priest tell of a change in his Church 's attitude toward the Eucharistic wafer . For generations nuns and priests , but especially ( the young man said ) nuns , have taught Catholic children that the wafer must be held in the mouth and allowed to melt ; that to touch it with the teeth would be ( and this was never doctrine , but merely a nuance of instruction ) in some manner blasphemous . Now , amid the flowering of fresh and bold ideas with which the Church , like a tundra thawing , responded to that unexpected sun the late Pope John , there has sprung up the thought that Christ did not say Take and melt this in your mouth but Take and eat . The word is eat , and to dissolve the word is to dilute the transubstantiated metaphor of physical nourishment . This demiquaver of theology crystallizes with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mass have been instructed to unlearn the science of ap184dough translucent to the tongue and to prepare a thicker , tougher wafer  --  a host , in fact , so substantial it must be chewed to be swallowed . This morning I read in the newspaper that an acquaintance of mine had been murdered . The father of five children , he had been sitting at the dinner table with them , a week after Thanksgiving . A single bullet entered the window and pierced his temple ; he fell to the floor and died there in minutes , at the feet of his children . My acquaintance with him was slight . He has become the only victim of murder I have known , and for such a role anyone seems drastically miscast , though in the end each life wears its events with a geological inevitability . It is impossible , today , to imagine him alive . He was a computer expert , a soft-voiced , broad-set man from Nebraska , whose intelligence , concerned as it was with matters so arcane to me , had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my apprehension of him , the dignity of an iceberg , which floats so serenely on its hidden mass . We met ( I think only twice ) in the home of a mutual friend , a professional colleague of his who is my neighbor . We spoke , as people do whose fields of knowledge are miles apart , of matters where all men are ignorant  --  of politics , children , and , perhaps , religion . I have the impression , at any rate , that he , as is often the case with scientists and Midwesterners , had no use for religion , and I saw in him a typical specimen of the new human species that thrives around scientific centers , in an environment of discussion groups , outdoor exercise , and cheerful husbandry . Like those vanished gentlemen whose sexual energy was exclusively spent in brothels , these men confine their cleverness to their work , which ,  |p185being  in one way or another for the government , is usually secret . With their sufficient incomes , large families , Volkswagen buses , hi-fi phonographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seem to have solved , or dismissed , the paradox of being a thinking animal and , devoid of guilt , apparently participate not in this century but in the next . If I remember him with individual clarity , it is because once I intended to write a novel about a computer programmer , and I asked him questions , which he answered agreeably . More agreeably still , he offered to show me around his laboratories any time I cared to make the hour 's trip to where they were . I never wrote the novel  --  the moment in my life it was meant to crystallize dissolved too quickly  --  and I never took the trip . Indeed , I do n't believe I thought of my friend once in the year between our last encounter and this morning , when my wife at breakfast put the paper before me and asked , " Do n't we know him ? " His pleasant face with its eyes set wide like the eyes of a bear gazed from the front page . I read that he had been murdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this morning , though there seems to be one . I am trying to locate it this afternoon , while sitting in a music school , waiting for my daughter to finish her piano lesson . I perceive in the two incidents a common element of nourishment , of eating transfigured by a strange irruption , and there is a parallel movement , a flight immaculately direct and elegant , from an immaterial phenomenon ( an exegetical nicety , a maniac hatred ) to a material one ( a bulky wafer , a bullet in the temple ) . About the murder I feel certain , from my knowledge ofp186the victim , that his offense was blameless , something for which he could not have felt guilt or shame . When I try to picture it , I see only numbers and Greek letters , and conclude that from my distance I have witnessed an almost unprecedented crime , a crime of unalloyed scientific passion . And there is this to add : the young priest plays a twelve-string guitar , smokes mentholated cigarettes , and seemed unembarrassed to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like my late computer friend , a man of the future . But let me describe the music school . I love it here . It is the basement of a huge Baptist church . Golden collection plates rest on the table beside me . Girls in their first blush of adolescence , carrying fawn-colored flute cases and pallid folders of music , shuffle by me ; their awkwardness is lovely , like the stance of a bather testing the sea . Boys and mothers arrive and leave . From all directions sounds  --  of pianos , oboes , clarinets  --  arrive like hints of another world , a world where angels fumble , pause , and begin again . Listening , I remember what learning music is like , how impossibly difficult and complex seem the first fingerings , the first decipherings of that unique language which freights each note with a double meaning of position and duration , a language as finicking as Latin , as laconic as Hebrew , as surprising to the eye as Persian or Chinese . How mysterious appears that calligraphy of parallel spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sharps and flats ! How great looms the gap between the first gropings of vision and the first stammerings of percussion ! Vision , timidly , becomes percussion , percussion becomes music , music becomes emotion , emotion becomes  --  vision . Few of usp187have the heart to follow this circle to its end . I took lessons for years , and never learned , and last night , watching the priest 's fingers confidently prance on the neck of his guitar , I was envious and incredulous . My daughter is just beginning the piano . These are her first lessons , she is eight , she is eager and hopeful . Silently she sits beside me as we drive the nine miles to the town where the lessons are given ; silently she sits beside me , in the dark , as we drive home . Unlike her , she does not beg for a reward of candy or a Coke , as if the lesson itself has been a meal . She only remarks  --  speaking dully , in a reflex of greed she has outgrown  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love taking her , I love waiting for her , I love driving her home through the mystery of darkness toward the certainty of supper . I do this taking and driving because today my wife visits her psychiatrist . She visits a psychiatrist because I am unfaithful to her . I do not understand the connection , but there seems to be one . In the novel I never wrote , I wanted the hero to be a computer programmer because it was the most poetic and romantic occupation I could think of , and my hero had to be extremely romantic and delicate , for he was to die of adultery . Die , I mean , of knowing it was possible ; the possibility crushed him . I conceived of him , whose professional life was spent in the sanctum of the night ( when , I was told , the computers , too valuable to be unemployed by industry during the day , are free , as it were , to frolic and to be loved ) , devising idioms whereby problems might be fed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music of truth  --  Ip188conceived of him as being too fine , translucent , and scrupulous to live in our coarse age . He was to be , if the metaphor is biological , an evolutionary abortion , a mammalian mutation crushed underfoot by dinosaurs , and , if the metaphor is mathematical , a hypothetical ultimate , one digit beyond the last real number . The title of the book was to be " N + 1 . " Its first sentence went , As Echo passed overhead , he stroked Maggy Johns ' side through her big-flowered dress . Echo is the artificial star , the first , a marvel ; as the couples at a lawn party look upward at it , these two caress one another . She takes his free hand , lifts it to her lips , warmly breathes on , kisses , his knuckles . His halted body seemed to catch up in itself the immense slow revolution of the earth , and the firm little white star , newly placed in space , calmly made its way through the older points of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hushed moment under the ominous sky of technological miracle , the plot was to develop more or less downhill , into a case of love , guilt , and nervous breakdown , with **26;6963;TOOLONG ( I had to do some research here ) that would kill the hero as quietly as a mistake is erased from a blackboard . There was to be the hero , his wife , his love , and his doctor . In the end the wife married the doctor , and Maggy Johns would calmly continue her way through the comparatively faint . . . Stop me . My psychiatrist wonders why I need to humiliate myself . It is the habit , I suppose , of confession . In my youth I attended a country church where , every two months , we would all confess ; we kneeled on the uncarpetedfloor and propped the books containing the service on the seats of the pews . It was a grave , longp189service , beginning , Beloved in the Lord ! Let us draw near with a true heart and confess our sins unto God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of accompanying music in the noise of the awkward fat Germanic bodies fitting themselves , scraping and grunting , into the **25;6991;TOOLONG . We read aloud , But if we thus examine ourselves , we shall find nothing in us but sin and death , from which we can in no wise set ourselves free . The confession complete , we would stand and be led , pew by pew , to the altar rail , where the young minister , a blackhairedman with very small pale hands , would feed us , murmuring , Take , eat ; this is the true body of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , given unto death for your sins . The altar rail was of varnished wood , and ran around three sides , so that , standing ( oddly , we did not kneel here ) , one could see , one could not help but see , the faces of one 's fellow-communicants . We were a weathered , homely congregation , sheepish in our Sunday clothes , and the faces I saw while the wafer was held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes held a watery look of pleading to be rescued from the depths of this mystery . And it distinctly seems , in the reaches of this memory so vivid it makes my saliva flow , that it was necessary , if not to chew , at least to touch , to embrace and tentatively shape , the wafer with the teeth . We left refreshed . We give thanks to thee , Almighty God , that Thou bast refreshed us through this salutary gift . The church smelled like this school , glinting with strange whispers and varnished highlights . I am neither musical nor religious . Each moment I live , I must think where to place my fingers , and press them down with nop190confidence of hearing a chord . My friends are like me . We are all pilgrims , faltering toward divorce . Some get no further than mutual confession , which becomes an addiction , and exhausts them . Some move on , into violent quarrels and physical blows ; and succumb to sexual excitement . A few make it to the psychiatrists . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , as the priest sat in the circle of my friends , a woman entered without knocking ; she had come from the lawyers , and her eyes and hair were flung wide with suffering , as if she had come in out of a high wind . She saw our black-garbed guest , was amazed , ashamed perhaps , and took two backward steps . But then , in the hush , she regained her composure and sat down among us . And in this grace note , of the two backward steps and then again the forward movement , a coda seems to be urged . The world is the host ; it must be chewed . I am content here in this school . My daughter emerges from her lesson . Her face is fat and satisfied , refreshed , hopeful ; her pleased smile , biting her lower lip , pierces my heart , and I die ( I think I am dying ) at her feet.  |p191HELPLESSLY  Caroline Harris , her husband and son having seized the first chair , found herself paired with Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their knees and hurled upward . When Caroline had been a child , her father , conceited in his strength , would toss her toward the ceiling with the same brutal , swooping lurch . Alice snapped the safety bar , and they were bracketed together . It was degrading for both of them . Up ahead , neither Norman nor Timmy deigned to glance back . From the rear , hooded and armed with spears , they were two of a kind , Timmy at twelve only slightly smaller than his father ; and this , too , she felt as a desertion , a flight from her womb . While she was dragged through the air , rudely joggled at each pier , the whiteness of the snow pressed on the underside of her consciousness with the gathering insistence of a headache . Her ski boots weighed ; her feet felt captive . Rigid with irritation and a desire not to sway , she smoked her next-to-last cigarette , which wasp192cheated of taste by the cold , and tried to decide if the woman beside her were sleeping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northward into New Hampshire , there had been in the automobile an excessive ease , as if the four of them knew each other better than Caroline remembered reason for . There had been , betweenAlice and Norman , a lack of flirtation a shade too resolute , while on sleepy , innocent Timmy the woman had inflicted a curiously fervent playfulness , as if warm messages for the father were being forwarded through the son , or as if Alice were seeking to establish herself as a sexual nonentity , a brotherly sister . Mrs. Harris felt an ominous tug in this trip . Had she merely imagined , during their fumbling breakfast at Howard Johnson 's , a poignance in the pauses , and a stir of something , like toes touching , under the table ? And was she paranoid to have suspected a deliberate design in the pattern of alternation that had her and her son floundering up the T-bar together as the other two expertly skimmed down the slope and waited , side by side , laughing vapor , at the end of the long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all rejoined at lunch , by Alice 's smile , faintly flavored with a sweetness unspecified in the recipe . Alice had been her friend first . She had moved to their neighborhood a year ago , a touching little divorcee with pre-school twins , utterly lost . Her only interest seemed to be sports , and her marital grief had given her an awkward hardness , as if from too much exercise . Norman had called her pathetic and sexless . Yet a winter later he rescued his skis from a decade in the attic , enrolled Timmy in local lessons , and somehow guided his wife inp193the same dangerous direction , as irresistibly as this cable was pulling them skyward . They were giddily lifted above the tops of the pines . Caroline , to brace her voice against her rising fear , spoke aloud : " This is ridiculous . At my age women in Tahiti are grandmothers . " Alice said seriously , " I think you do terribly well . You 're a natural dancer , and it shows . " Caroline could not hate her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some timid loyalty , perhaps , in Norman 's betraying her with a woman she had befriended . She felt , indeed , less betrayed than diluted , and , turning with her cigarette cupped against the wind , she squinted at the girl as if into an unfair mirror . Alice was small-boned yet coarse ; muscularity , reaching upwardthrough the prominent tendons of her throat , gave her face , even through the flush of windburn , a taut , sallowtinge . Her hair , secured by a scarlet ear warmer , was abundant but mousy , and her eyes were close-set , hazel , and vaguely , stubbornly inward . But between her insignificantnose and receding chin there lay , as if in ambush , a large , complicated , and ( Caroline supposed ) passionate mouth . This , she realized , as the chair swayed sickeningly , was exactly what Norman would want : a mouse with a mouth . Disgust , disgust and anger , swung through her . How greedy men were ! How conceited and heedless ! The sky enlarged around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With deft haste Alice undid the safety bar ; Caroline involuntarily transposed the action into an undoing of Norman 's clothes . Icy with contempt for herp194situation , she floated onto the unloading platform and discovered , slipping down the alarming little ramp , that her knees were trembling and had forgotten how to bend . Of course , they were abandoned . The men had heedlessly gone ahead , and beckoned , tiny and black , from the end of a tunnel tigerishly striped with the shadows of birches . On whispering skis held effortlessly parallel , Alice led , while Caroline followed , struggling clumsily against the impulse to stem . They arrived where the men had been and found them gone again . In their place was a post with two signs . One pointed right to GREASED LIGHTNING ( EXPERT ) . The other pointed left to THE LIGHTNING BUG ( INTERMEDIATE-NOVICE . " I see them , " Alice said , and lightly poled off to the right . " Wait , " Caroline begged . Alice christied to a stop . A long lavender shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful instant , as her lithe body inquisitively straightened , she seemed beautiful . " How expert is it ? " The Harrises had never been to this mountain before ; Alice had been several times . Caroline saw her surrounded by tan and goggled men , and perceived her own ineptitude at skiing to be a functionof her failure to be divorced . " There 's one mogully piece you can sideslip , " Alice said . " The Bug will take you around the other side of the mountain . You 'll never catch the men . " " Why do n't you follow them and I 'll go down the novice trail ? I do n't trust this mountain yet . " It was a strange mountain , one of the lesser Presidentials , ratherp195recently developed , with an unvarnished cafeteria and very young boys patrolling the trails in rawly bright jackets chevron-striped in yellow and green . At lunch , Norman said he twice had seen members of the ski patrol take spills . His harsh laugh , remembered at this bare altitude , frightened her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingertips were stinging in their mittens . Alice crisply sidestepped back up to her . " Let 's both go down the Bug , " she said . " You should n't ski alone . " " I do n't want to be a sissy , " Caroline said , and these careless words apparently triggered some inward chain of reflection in the other woman , for Alice 's face clouded , and it was certain that she was sleeping with Norman . Everything , every tilt of circumstance , every smothered swell and deliberate contraindication , confirmed it , even the girl 's very name , Smith  --  a nothing-name , a prostitute'salias . Her hazel eyes , careful in the glare of the snow , flickeringly searched Caroline 's and her expressive mouth froze on the verge of a crucial question . " Track ! " The voice was behind them , shrill and young . A teenagedgirl , wearing a polka-dot purple parka , and her mother , a woman almost elderly , who seemed to have rouged the tip of her nose , turned beside them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caroline , shamed , said , " The hell with it . The worst 1 can do is get killed . " Murderously stabbing the snow next to Alice 's noncommital buckle-boots , she pushed off to the right , her weight flung wildly back , her uphill ski snagging , her whole body burning with the confirmation of her suspicions . She would leave Norman . Unsteady asp196a flame she flickered down the height , wavering in her own wind . Alice carefully passed her and , taking long traverses and diagrammatically slow turns , seemed to be inviting her not to destroy herself . Submitting to the sight , permitting her eyes to infect her body with Alice 's rhythm , she found the snow yielding to her as if under the pressure of reason ; and , swooping in complementary zigzags , the two women descended a long white waterfall linked as if by love . Then there was a lazy flat run in the shadow of reddish rocks bearded with icicles , then another descent , through cataracts of moguls , into an immense elbow-shaped stage overlooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodge , a tessellated parking lot , and , vast and dim as a foreign nation , a frozen lake mottled with cloud shadows and islands of evergreen . Tensely sideslipping , Caroline saw , on the edge of this stage , at one side of the track , some trouble , a heap of dark cloth . In her haste to be with the men , Alice would have swept by , but Caroline snowplowedto a halt . With a dancing waggle Alice swerved and pulled even . The heap of cloth was the woman with the red-tipped nose , who lay on her back , her head downhill . Her daughter knelt beside her . The woman 's throat was curved as if she were gargling , and her hood was submerged in snow , so that her face showed like a face in a casket . Efficiently , Alice bent , released her bindings , and walked to the accident . Each print of her boots in the snow was a decisive , perfect intaglio . " Is she conscious ? " she asked  | " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rapt relation with the sky . The dab of red was the only color not drained from it . Tears trickled from the corner of one eye into a fringe of sandy permed hair . " Do you think it 's broken ? " There was no answer , and the girl impatiently prompted , " Mother , does it feel broken ? " " I ca n't feel a thing . Take off the boot . " " I do n't think we should take off the boot , " Alice said . She surveyed the woman 's legs with a physical forthrightnessthat struck Caroline as unpleasant . " We might disturb the alignment . It might be a spiral . Did you feel anything give ? " The impact of the spill had popped both safety bindings , so the woman 's skis were attached to her feet only by the breakaway straps . Alice stooped and unclipped these , and stood the skis upright in the snow , as a signal . She said , " We should get help . " The daughter looked up hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , and a secondary face , the angular face of a woman , had been stencilled over its features . " If you 're willing to stay , " she said , " I 'll go . I know some of the boys in the patrol . " " We 'll be happy to stay , " Caroline said firmly . She was conscious , as she said this , of frustrating Alice and of declaring , in the necessary war between them , her weapons to be compassion and patience . She wished she could remove her skis , for their presence on her feet held her a little aloof ; but she was not sure she could put them back on at this slant , in the middle of nowhere . The snow here had the eerie unvisited air of grass beside a highway . The young daughter , without a backward glance , snappedp198herself into her skis and whipped away , down the hill . Seeing how easy it had been , Caroline dared unfasten hers and discovered her own bootprints also to be sharp intaglios . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wristwatch . The third woman moaned . Caroline asked , " Are you warm enough ? Would you like to be wrapped in something ? " The lack of a denial left them no choice but to remove their parkas and wrap her in them . Her body felt like an oversized doll sadly in need of stuffing . Caroline , bending close , satisfied herself that what looked like paint was a little pinnacle of sunburn . The woman murmured her thanks . " My second day here , I 've ruined it for everybody  --  my daughter , my son ... " Alice asked , " Where is your son ? " " Who knows ? I bring him here and do n't see him from morning to night . He says he 's skiing , but I ski every trail and never see him . " " Where is your husband ? " Caroline asked ; her voice sounded lost in the acoustic depth of the freezing air . The woman sighed , " Not here . " Silence followed , a silence in which wisps of wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers of powder . The dense indigo shadow thrown by the woods grew heavy , and cold pressed through the chinks of Caroline 's sweater . Alice 's thin neck strained as she gazed up at the vacant ridge for help . The woman in the snow began , tricklingly , to sob , and Caroline asked , " Would you like a cigarette ? " The response was prompt . " I 'd adore a weed . " The woman sat up , pulled off her mitten , and hungrily twid/died her fingers . Her nails were painted . She did not seem to notice , in taking the cigarette , that the pack became empty . Gesturing with stabbing exhalations of smoke , she waxed chatty . " I say to my son , What 's the point of coming to these beautiful mountains if all you do is rush , rush , rush , up the tow and down , and never stop to enjoy the scenery ? ' I say to him , I 'd rather be oldfashionedand come down the mountain in one piece than have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he saw me now , he 'd have a fit laughing . There 's a patch of ice up there and my skis crossed . When I went over , I could feel my left side pull from my shoulders to my toes . It reminded me like having a baby . " " Where are you from ? " Alice asked . " Melrose . " The name of her town seemed to make the woman morose . Her eyes focused on her inert boot . To distract her , Caroline asked , " And your husband 's working ? " " We 're separated . I know if I could loosen the laces it would be a world of relief . My ankle wants to swell and it ca n't . " " I would n't trust it , " Alice said . " Let me at least undo the knot , " Caroline offered , and dropped to her knees as if to weep . She did not as a rule like self-pitying women , but here in this one she seemed to confront a voluntary dramatization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both the outer and inner laces  --  the boot was a new Nordica , and stiff . " Does that feel better ? " " I honestly ca n't say . I have no feeling below my knees whatsoever . " " Shock , " Alice said . " Nature 's anesthetic. "  | " My husband will be furious . He 'll have to hire a maid for me . " " You 'll have your daughter , " Caroline said . " At her age , it 's all boys , boys on the brain . " This seemed to sum up their universe of misfortune . Nothing was left to say . In silence , as dark as widows against the tilted acres of white , they waited for rescue . The trail here was so wide skiers could pass on the far side without spotting them . A few swooped close , then veered away , as if sensing a curse . One man , a merry ogre wearing steel-framed spectacles and a raccoon coat , smokinga cigar , and plowing down the fall line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign language . But the pattern of the afternoon  --  the sun had shifted away from the trail  --  yielded few skiers . Empty minutes slid by . The bitterly cold air had found every loose stitch in Caroline 's sweater and now was concentrating on the metal bits of brassiere that touched her skin . She remembered how erotic her husband had pretended to find her when , dressing this morning , she had put on her Norwegian waffle-weave undershirt . " Could I bum another coffin nail ? " the injured woman asked . " I 'm sorry , that was my last . " " Oh dear . Is n't that the limit ? " Alice , so sallow now she seemed Oriental , tucked her hands into her armpits and jiggled up and down . She asked , " Wo n't the men worry ? " Caroline took satisfaction in telling her , " I doubt it . " Looking outward , she saw only white , a tilted rippled wealth of colorlessness , the forsaken penumbra of thep201world . Her private desolation she now felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all three abandoned , cut off , wounded , unwarmed , too impotent even to whimper . A vein of haze in the sky passingly dimmed the sunlight . When it brightened again , a tiny upright figure , male , in green and yellow chevron-stripes , stood at the top of the cataracts of moguls . " That took eighteen minutes , " Alice said , consulting her wristwatch again . Caroline suddenly doubted that Norman , whose pajama bottoms rarely matched his tops , could love anyone so finicking . The woman in the snow asked , " Does my hair look awful ? " Down , down the tiny figure came , enlarging , dipping from crest to crest , dragging a sled , a bit clumsily , between its legs . Then , hitting perhaps the same patch of ice , the figure tipped , tripped , and became a dark star , spread-eagled , a cloud of powder from which protruded , with electric rapidity , fragments of ski , sled , and arm . This explosive somersault continued to the base of the precipitous section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women had watched with held breaths . The woman from Melrose moaned , " Oh dear , dear God . " Caroline discovered herself yearning , yearning with her numb belly , for their rescuer to stand . He did . The boy ( he was close enough to be a boy , with lanky legs in swankishly tight racing pants ) scissored his skis above his head ( miraculously , they had not popped off ) , hopped to his feet , jerkily sidestepped a few yards uphill to retrieve his hat ( an Alpine of green felt , with ornamentalp202breast feathers ) , and skated toward them , drenched with snow , dragging the sled and grinning . " That was a real eggbeater , " Alice told him , as one boy to another . " Who 's hurt ? " he asked . His red ears protruded and his face swirled with freckles ; he was so plainly delighted to be himself , so clearly somebody 's son , that Caroline felt herself forced to share his absurd pride . And as if with this clown there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ski patrol sprang from the snow , bearing blankets and bandages and brandy , so that Caroline and Alice were pushed aside , as it were , from themselves . They retrieved their parkas , refastened their skis , and tamely completed their run to the foot of the mountain . There , Timmy and Norman , looking worried and guilty , were waiting beside the lift shed . Her momentum failing , Caroline Harris actually skated  --  what she had never managed to do before , lifted her skis in the smooth alternation of skating  --  in her haste to assure her husband of his innocence.  |p203THE  DARK , he discovered , was mottled ; was a luminous collage of patches of almost-color that became , as his open eyes grew at home , almost ectoplasmically bright . Objects became lunar panels let into the air that darkness had given flat substance to . Walls dull in day glowed . Yet he was not comforted by the general pallor of the dark , its unexpected transparence ; rather , he lay there waiting , godlessly praying , for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the windows by the headlights of automobiles pausing and passing outside . Some were slits , erect as sentinels standing guard before beginning to slide , helplessly , across a corner , diagonally warping , up onto the ceiling , accelerating , and away . Others were yellowish rectangles , scored with panes , windows themselves , but watery , streaked , the mullions dissolved , as if the apparition silently posed on a blank interior wall were being in some manner lashed from without by a golden hurricane.  |p204He  wondered if all these visitations were caused by automobiles ; for some of them appeared and disappeared without any accompaniment of motor noises below , and others seemed projected from an angle much higher than that of the street . Perhaps the upstairs lamps in neighboring homes penetrated the atmosphere within his bedroom . But it was a quiet neighborhood , and he imagined himself to be , night after night , the last person awake . Yet it was a rare hour , even from two o'clock on , when the darkness in which he lay was untouched ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger passing across velvet , there would occur one of those intrusions of light which his heart would greet with wild grateful beating , for he had come to see in them his only companions , guards , and redeemers . Sounds served in a much paler way  --  the diminishing drone of an unseen car vanishing at a point his mind 's eye located beyond the Baptist church ; the snatched breath and renewed surge of a truck shifting gears on the hill ; the pained squeak , chuffing shuffle , and comic toot of a late commuting train clumsily threading the same old rusty needle ; the high vibration of an airplane like a piece of fuzz caught in the sky 's throat . These evidences of a universe of activity and life extending beyond him did not bring the same liberating assurance as those glowing rectangles delivered like letters through the slots in his room . The stir , whimper , or cough coming from the bedroom of one or another of his children had a contrary effect , of his consciousness touching a boundary , an abrasive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a tight limit seemed reached . The blind , moist motor of her oblivious breathing seemed to follow the track of ap205circular running of which he was the vortex , sinking lower and lower in the wrinkled bed until he was lifted to another plane by the appearance , long delayed , on his walls of an angel , linear and serene , of light stolen from another world . While waiting , he discovered the dark to be green in color , a green so low-keyed that only eyes made supernaturally alert could have sensed it , a thoroughly dirtied green in which he managed to detect , under opaque integuments of ambiguity , a general pledge of hope . Specific hope he had long given up . It seemed a childhood ago when he had moved , a grown man , through a life of large rooms , with white-painted moldings and blowing curtains , whose walls each gave abundantly , in the form of open doorways and flungbackFrench windows , into other rooms  --  a mansion without visible end . In one of the rooms he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of space , he had moved to dismiss the unease and the door handle had rattled , stuck . The curtains had stopped blowing . Behind him , the sashes and archways sealed . Still , it was merely a question of holding one 's breath and finding a key . If the door was accidentally locked  --  had locked itself  --  there was certainly a key . For a lock without a key is a monstrosity , and while he knew , in a remote way , that monstrosities exist , he also knew there were many more rooms ; he had glimpsed them waiting with their whitepaintedand polished corners , their invisible breeze of light . Doctors airily agreed ; but then their expressions fled one way  --  cherubic , smiling  --  while their words fled another , and became unutterable , leaving him facing the blankness where the division had occurred . He tapped hisp206pockets . They were empty . He stooped to pick the lock with his fingernails , and it shrank from his touch , became a formless bump , a bubble , and sank into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . There was nothing left for him but to hope that the impenetrability of walls was in some sense an illusion . His nightly vigil investigated this possibility . His discoveries , of the varied texture of the dark , its relenting phosphorescence , above all its hospitality to vivid and benign incursions of light , seemed at moments to confirm his hope . At other moments , by other lights , his vigil seemed an absurd toy supplied by cowardice to entertain his last months . He had months and not years to live . This was the fact . By measuring with his mind ( which seemed to hover in fear some distance from his brain ) the intensity of certain sensations obliquely received , he could locate , by a kind of triangulation , his symptoms in space : a patch of strangeness beneath the left rib , an inflexible limitation in his lungs , a sickly-sweet languor in his ankles , which his mind 's eye located just this side of the town wharf . But space interested him only as the silver on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that utterly polished surface , that he searched for his reflection , which was black as a Negro 's , only thin-lipped and otherwise familiar . He wondered why the difference between months and years should be qualitative when mere quantities were concerned , and his struggle to make " month " a variant of " year " reminded him of , from his deepest past , his efforts to remove a shoehorn from between his heel and shoe , where with childish clumsiness he had wedged it . How impossibly tight the fit had seemed ! How feeble and small he must have been !  |p207He  did not much revisit the past . His inner space , the space of his mind , seemed as irrelevant as the space of his body . His father 's hands , his mother 's tears , his sister 's voice shrilling across an itchy lawn , the rolls of dust beneath his bed that might , just might , be poisonous caterpillars  --  these glints only frightened him with the depth of the darkness in which they were all but smothered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His " life . " Considered as a finite noun , his life seemed unequal to the infinitude of death . The inequality almost made a ledge where his hope could grip ; but the leaden sighing of his wife 's sagging mouth dragged it down . Faithlessly she lay beside him in the arms of her survival . Her unheeding sleep deserved only dull anger and was not dreadful like the sleep of his children , whose dream-sprung coughs and cries seemed to line the mouth of death with teeth . The sudden shortness of his life seemed to testify to the greed of those he had loved . He should have been shocked by his indifference to them ; should have grubbed the root of this coldness from his brain , but introspection , like memory , sickened him with its steep perspectives , afflicted him with the nausea of futile concentration , as if he were picking a melting lock . He was not interested in his brain but in his soul , his soul , that outward simplicity embodied in the shards and diagonal panes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed in the street below . From three o'clock on , the traffic was thin . As if his isolation had turned him into God , he blessed , with stately wordlessness , whatever errant teen-ager or returningphilanderer relieved the stillness of the town . THE MUSIC SCHOOLThen , toward four , all such visits ceased . There was a quietness . Unwanted images began to impinge on the dark : a pulpy many-legged spider was offered wriggling to him on a fork . His teeth ached to think of biting , of chewing , eyes , fur .. . It was time to imagine the hand . He , who since infancy had slept best on his stomach , could now endure lying only on his back . He wished his lids , even if they were closed , to be pelted and bathed by whatever eddies of light animated the room . As these eddies died , and the erosion of sleeplessness began to carve his consciousness fantastically , he had taken to conceiving of himself as lying in a giant hand , his head on the fingertips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not picture the hand with total clarity , denied it nails and hair , and with idle rationality supposed it was an echo from Sunday school , some old-fashioned print ; nevertheless , the hand was so real to him that he would stealthily double his pillow to lift his head higher and thereby fit himself better to the curve of the great fingers . The hand seemed to hold him at some height , but he had no fear of falling nor any sense of display , of being gazed at , as a mother gazes at the baby secure in her arms . Rather , this hand seemed something owed him , a basis upon which had been drawn the contract of his conception , and it had the same extensive , impersonal life as the pieces of light that had populated , before the town went utterly still , the walls of his room . Now the phosphor of these walls took on a blueness , as if the yellowness of the green tinge of the darkness were being distilled from it . Still safe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lie on his side and touch withp209his knees the underside of his wife 's thighs , which her bunched nightie had bared . Her intermittently restless sleep usually resolved into a fetal position facing away from him ; and in a parallel position  --  ready at any nauseous influx of terror to return to his back  --  he delicately settled himself , keeping the soft touch of her flesh at his knees as a mooring . His eyes had closed . Experimentally he opened them , and a kind of gnashing , a blatancy , at the leafy window , which he now faced , led him to close them again . A rusty brown creaking , comfortableand antique , passed along his body , merging with the bird song that had commenced beyond the window like the melodious friction of a machine of green and squeaking wood . He smiled at himself , having for an instant imagined that he was adjusting his stiff arms around a massive thumb beside his face . Comfort ebbed from the position ; his wife irritably stirred and broke the mooring . Carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of components any one of which might deflect his parabolic course , he moved to lie on his stomach , pressing himself on the darkness beneath him , as if in wrestling , upon some weary foe . Panic jerked his dry lids open . He looked backward , past his shoulder , at the pattern of patches that had kept watch with him . A chair , with clothes tossed upon it , had begun to be a chair , distinctly forward from the wall . The air , he saw , was being visited by another invader , a creature unlike the others , entering not obliquely but frontally , upright , methodically , less by stealth than like someone hired , like a fine powder very slowly exploding , scouring the white walls of their moss of illusion ,  |p210|polishing  objects into islands . He felt in this arrival relief from his vigil and knew , his chest loosening rapidly , that in a finite time he would trickle through the fingers of the hand ; would slip , blissfully , into oblivion , as a fold is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PoEMS . Are they difficult ? " She smiled and , unaccustomed to speaking English , answered carefully , drawing a line in the air with two delicately pinched fingers holding an imaginary pen . " They are difficult  --  to write . " He laughed , startled and charmed . " But not to read ? " She seemed puzzled by his laugh , but did not withdraw her smile , though its corners deepened in a defensive , feminine way . " I think , " she said , " not so very . " " Good . " Brainlessly he repeated " Good , " disarmed by her unexpected quality of truth . He was , himself , a writer , this fortyish young man , Henry Bech , with his thinning curly hair and melancholy Jewish nose , the author of one good book and three others , the good one having come first . By a kind of oversight , he had never married . His reputation had grown while his powers declined . As he felt himself sink , in his fiction , deeperp212and deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for plain truth carried him further and further into treacherous realms of fantasy and , lately , of silence , he was more and more thickly hounded by homage , by flat-footed exegetes , by arrogantly worshipful undergraduates who had hitchhiked a thousand miles to touch his hand , by querulous translators , by election to honorary societies , by invitations to lecture , to " speak , " to " read , " to participate in symposia trumped up by ambitiousgirlie magazines in shameless conjunction with venerable universities . His very government , in airily unstampedenvelopes from Washington , invited him to travel , as an ambassador of the arts , to the other half of the world , the hostile , mysterious half . Rather automatically , but with some faint hope of shaking himself loose from the burden of himself , he consented , and found himself floating , with a passport so stapled with visas it fluttered when pulled from his pocket , down into the dim airports of Communist cities . He arrived in Sofia the day after a mixture of Bulgarian and African students had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overturned Chevrolet . The cultural officer , pale from a sleepless night of guard duty , tamping his pipe with trembling fingers , advised Bech to stay out of crowds and escorted him to his hotel . The lobby was swarming with Negroes in black wool fezzes and pointed European shoes . Insecurely disguised , he felt , by an astrakhan hat purchased in Moscow , Bech passed through to the elevator , whose operator addressed him in German . " Jet , vier , " Bech answered , " danke , " and telephoned , in his bad French , for dinner to be brought up to his room . He remained there all night , behind ap213locked door , reading Hawthorne . He had lifted a paperbackcollection of short stories from a legation window sill littered with broken glass . A few curved bright crumbs fell from between the pages onto his blanket . The image of Roger Malvin lying alone , dying , in the forest  --  " Death would come like the slow approach of a corpse , stealing gradually towards him through the forest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet a nearer tree "  --  frightened him . Bech fell asleep early and suffered from swollen , homesick dreams . It had been Thanksgiving Day . In the morning , venturing downstairs for breakfast , he was surprised to find the restaurant open , the waiters affable , the eggs actual , the coffee hot , though syrupy . Outside , Sofia was sunny and ( except for a few dark glances at his big American shoes ) amenable to his passage along the streets . Lozenge-patterns of pansies , looking flat and brittle as pressed flowers , had been set in the public beds . Women with a touch of Western chic walked hatless in the park behind the mausoleum of Georgi Dimitrov . There was a mosque , and an assortment of trolley cars salvaged from the remotest corner of Bech 's childhood , and a tree that talked  --  that is , it was so full of birds that it swayed under their weight and emitted volumes of chirping sound like a great leafy loudspeaker . It was the inverse of his hotel , whose silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Socialist world . Lights flickered off untouched and radios turned themselves on . Telephones rang in the dead of the night and breathed wordlessly in his ear . Six weeks ago , flying from New York City , Bech had expected Moscow to be ap214blazing counterpart and instead saw , through the plane window , a skein of hoarded lights no brighter , on that vast black plain , than a girl 's body in a dark room . Past the talking tree was the American legation . The sidewalk , heaped with broken glass , was roped off , so that pedestrians had to detour into the gutter . Bech detached himself from the stream , crossed the little barren of pavement , smiled at the Bulgarian militiamen who were sullenly guarding the jewel-bright heaps of shards , and pulled open the bronze door . The cultural officer was crisper after a normal night 's sleep . He clenched his pipe in his teeth and handed Bech a small list . " You 're to meet with the Writer 's Union at eleven . These are writers you might ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're among the more progressive . " Words like " progressive " and " liberal " had a somewhatreversed sense in this world . At times , indeed , Bech felt he had passed through a mirror , a dingy flecked mirror that reflected feebly the capitalist world ; in its dim depths everything was similar but left-handed . One of the names ended in " - ova . " Bech said , " A woman . " " A poetess , " the cultural officer said , sucking and tamping in a fury of bogus efficiency . " Very popular , apparently . Her books are impossible to buy . " " Have you read anything by these people ? " " I 'll be frank with you . I can just about make my way through a newspaper . " " But you always know what a newspaper will say anyway . " " I 'm sorry , I do n't get your meaning . " " There is n't any . " Bech did n't quite know why the Americans he met irritated him  --  whether because theyp215garishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so solemnly sending him on ridiculous errands . At the Writer 's Union , he handed the secretary the list as it had been handed to him , on U.S. legation stationery . The secretary , a large stooped man with the hands of a stonemason , grimaced and shook his head but obligingly reached for the telephone . Bech 's meeting was already waiting in another room . It was the usual one , the one that , with small differences , he had already attended in Moscow and Kiev , Yerevan and Alma-Ata , Bucharest and Prague : the polished oval table , the bowl of fruit , the morning light , the gleaming glasses of brandy and mineral water , the lurking portrait of Lenin , the six or eight patiently sitting men who would leap to their feet with quick blank smiles . These men would include a few literary officials , termed " critics , " high in the Party , loquacious and witty and destined to propose a toast to international understanding ; a few selected novelists and poets , mustachioed , smoking , sulking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the head of the AngloAmericanLiterature department , speaking in a beautiful withered English of Mark Twain and Sinclair Lewis ; a young interpreter with a moist handshake ; a shaggy old journalist obsequiously scribbling notes ; and , on the rim of the group , in chairs placed to suggest that they had invited themselves , one or two gentlemen of ill-defined status , fidgety and tieless , maverick translators who would turn out to be the only ones present who had ever read a word by Henry Bech . Here this type was represented by a stout man in ap216tweed coat leather-patched at the elbows in the British style . The whites of his eyes were distinctly red . He shook Bech 's hand eagerly , made of it almost an embrace of reunion , bending his face so close that Bech could distinguish the smells of tobacco , garlic , cheese , and alcohol . Even as they were seating themselves around the table , and the Writer 's Union chairman , a man elegantly bald , with very pale eyelashes , was touching his brandy glass as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bech , " Your Travel Light was so marvellous a book . The motels , the highways , the young girls with their lovers who were motorcyclists , so marvellous , so American , the youth , the adoration for space and speed , the barbarity of the advertisements in neon lighting , the very poetry . It takes us truly into another dimension . " Travel Light was the first novel , the famous one . Bech disliked discussing it . " At home , " he said , " it was criticizedas despairing . " The man 's hands , stained orange with tobacco , lifted in amazement and plopped noisily to his knees . " No , no a thousand times . Truth , wonder , terror even , vulgarity , yes . But despair , no , not at all , not one iota . Your critics are dead wrong . " " Thank you . " The chairman softly cleared his throat and lifted his glass an inch from the table , so that it formed with its reflection a kind of playing card . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wet writer , no . You are a dry writer , yes ? You have the expressions , am I wrong in English , dry , hard ? " " More or less . " " I want to translate you ! "  |p217It  was the agonized cry of a condemned man , for the chairman coldly lifted his glass to the height of his eyes , and like a firing squad the others followed suit . Blinking his white lashes , the chairman gazed mistily in the direction of the sudden silence , and spoke in Bulgarian . The young interpreter murmured in Bech 's ear . " I wish to propose now , ah , a very brief toast . I know it will seem doubly brief to our honored American guest , who has so recently enjoyed the , ah , hospitality of our Soviet comrades . " There must have been a joke here , for the rest of the table laughed . " But in seriousness permit me to say that in our country we have seen in years past too few Americans , ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hope in the next hour to learn from him much that is interesting and , ah , socially useful about the literature of his large country , and perhaps we may in turn inform him of our own proud literature , of which perhaps he knows regrettably little . Ah , so let me finally , then , since there is a saying that too long a courtship spoils the marriage , offer to drink , in our native plum brandy slivovica , ah , firstly to the success of his visit and , in the second place , to the mutual increase of international understanding . " " Thank you , " Bech said and , as a courtesy , drained his glass . It was wrong ; the others , having merely sipped , stared . The purple burning revolved in Bech 's stomach and a severe distaste for himself , for his role , for this entire artificial and futile process , focused into a small brown spot on a pear in the bowl so shiningly posed before his eyes . The red-eyed fool smelling of cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor for me to meet the manp218who , in Travel Light , truly added a new dimension to American prose . " " The book was written , " Bech said , " twelve years ago . " " And since ? " A slumping , mustached man sat up and sprang into English . " Since , you have written what ? " Bech had been asked that question often in these weeks and his answer had grown curt . " A second novel called Brother Pig , which is St. Bernard 's expression for the body . " " Good . Yes , and ? " " A collection of essays and sketches called When the Saints . " " I like the title less well . " " It 's the beginning of a famous Negro song . " " We know the song , " another man said , a smaller man , with the tense , dented mouth of a hare . He lightly sang , " Lordy , I just want to be in that number . " " And the last book , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chosen that took six years to write and that nobody liked . " " I have read reviews , " the red-eyed man said . " I have not read the book . Copies are difficult here . " " I 'll give you one , " Bech said . The promise seemed , somehow , to make the recipient unfortunately conspicuous ; wringing his stained hands , he appeared to swell in size , to intrude grotesquely upon the inner ring , so that the interpreter took it upon himself to whisper , with the haste of an apology , into Bech 's ear , " This gentleman is well known as the translator into our language of Erewhon . "  | " A marvellous book , " the translator said , deflating in relief , pulling at his pockets for a cigarette . " It truly takes us into another dimension . Something that must be done . We live in a new cosmos . " The chairman spoke in Bulgarian , musically , at length . There was polite laughter . Nobody translated for Bech . The professorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . " Tell me , is it true , as I have read "  --  his phrases whistled slightly , like rusty machinery  --  " that the stock of Sinclair Lewis has plummeted under the Salinger wave ? " And so it went , here as in Kiev , Prague , and Alma-Ata , the same questions , more or less predictable , and his own answers , terribly familiar to him by now , mechanical , stale , irrelevant , untrue , claustrophobic . The door opened . In came , with the rosy air of a woman fresh from a bath , a little breathless , having hurried , hatless , a woman in a blond coat , her hair also blond . The secretary , entering behind her , seemed to make a cherishing space around her with his large curved hands . He introduced her to Bech as Vera Something-ova , the poetess he had asked to meet . None of the others on the list , he explained , answered their telephones . " Are n't you kind to come ? " As Bech asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he expected some sort of an answer . She spoke to the interpreter in Bulgarian . " She says , " the interpreter told Bech , " she is sorry she is so late . " " But she was just called ! " In the warmth of his confusion and pleasure Bech turned to speak directly to her , forgetting he would not be understood . " I 'm terribly sorry to have interrupted your morning . "  | " I am pleased , " she said , " to meet you . I heard of you spoken in France . " " You speak English ! " " No . Very little amount . " " But you do . " A chair was brought for her from a corner of the room . She yielded her coat , revealing herself in a suit also blond , as if her clothes were an aspect of a total consistency . She sat down opposite Bech , crossing her legs . Her legs were very good ; her face was perceptibly broad . Lowering her lids , she tugged her skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of her having hurried , hurried to him , and of being , still , graciously flustered , that most touched him . He spoke to her very clearly , across the fruit , fearful of abusing and breaking the fragile bridge of her English . " You are a poetess . When I was young , I also wrote poems . " She was silent so long he thought she would never answer ; but then she smiled and pronounced , " You are not old now . " " Your poems . Are they difficult ? " " They are difficult  --  to write . " " But not to read ? " " I think  --  not so very . " " Good . Good . " Despite the decay of his career , Bech had retained an absolute faith in his instincts ; he never doubted that somewhere an ideal course was open to him and that his intuitions were pre-dealt clues to his destiny . He had loved , briefly or long , with or without consummation , perhaps a dozen women ; yet all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approximation , of narrowly missing an undisclosed prototype . The surprise he felt did not have to do with the appearance , at last , of this central woman ; he had always expected her to appear . What he had not expected was her appearance here , in this remote and abused nation , in this room of morning light , where he discovered a small knife in his fingers and on the table before him , golden and moist , a precisely divided pear . Men travelling alone develop a romantic vertigo . Bech had already fallen in love with a freckled Embassy wife in Prague , a buck-toothed chanteuse in Rumania , a stolid Mongolian sculptress in Kazakhstan . In the Tretyakov Gallery he had fallen in love with a recumbent statue , and at the Moscow Ballet School with an entire roomful of girls . Entering the room , he had been struck by the aroma , tenderly acrid , of young female sweat . Sixteen and seventeen , wearing patchy practice suits , the girls were twirling so strenuously their slippers were unravelling . Demure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was doubled in depth by a floor-to-ceiling mirror . Bech was seated on a bench at its base . Staring above his head , each girl watched herself with frowning eyes frozen , for an instant in the turn , by the imperious delay and snap of her head . Bech tried to remember the lines of Rilke that expressed it , this snap and delay : did not the drawing remain/that the dark stroke of your eyebrow/swiftly wrote on the wall of its own turning ? At one point the teacher , a shapeless old Ukrainian lady with gold canines , a prima of the thirties , had arisen and cried something translated to Bech as , " No , no , the arms free , free ! " And in demon/stration she had executed a rapid series of pirouettes with such proud effortlessness that all the girls , standing this way and that like deer along the wall , had applauded . Bech had loved them for that . In all his loves , there was an urge to rescue  --  to rescue the girls from the slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own marble , the Embassy wife from her boring and unctuous husband , the chanteuse from her nightly humiliation ( she could not sing ) , the Mongolian from her stolid race . But the Bulgarian poetess presented herself to him as needing nothing , as being complete , poised , satisfied , achieved . He was aroused and curious and , the next day , inquired about her of the man with the vaguely contemptuous mouth of a hare  --  a novelist turned playwright and scenarist , who accompanied him to the Rila Monastery . " She lives to write , " the playwright said . " I do not think it is healthy . " Bech said , " But she seems so healthy . " They stood beside a small church with whitewashed walls . From the outside it looked like a hovel , a shelter for pigs or chickens . For five centuries the Turks had ruled Bulgaria , and the Christian churches , however richly adorned within , had humble exteriors . A peasant woman with wildly snarled hair unlocked the door for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than thirty worshippers , it was divided into three parts , and every inch of wall was covered with eighteenth-century frescoes . Those in the narthex depicted a Hell where the devils wielded scimitars . Passing through the tiny nave , Bech peeked through the iconostasis into the screened area that , in the symbolism of Orthodox architecture , represented the next , the hidden world  --  Paradise  --  andp223glimpsed a row of books , an easy chair , a pair of ancient oval spectacles . Outdoors again , he felt released from the unpleasantly tight atmosphere of a children 's book . They were on the side of a hill . Above them was a stand of pines whose trunks glistened with ice . Below them sprawled the monastery , a citadel of Bulgarian national feeling during the years of the Turkish Yoke . The last monks had been moved out in 1961 . An aimless soft rain was falling in these mountains , and there were not many German tourists today . Across the valley , whose little silver river still turned a water wheel , a motionless white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a brooch . " I am an old friend of hers , " the playwright said . " I worry about her . " " Are the poems good ? " " It is difficult for me to judge . They are very feminine . Perhaps shallow . " " Shallowness can be a kind of honesty . " " Yes . She is very honest in her work . " " And in her life ? " " As well . " " What does her husband do ? " The other man looked at him with parted lips and touched his arm , a strange Slavic gesture , communicating an underlying racial urgency , that Bech no longer shied from . " But she has no husband . As I say , she is too much for poetry to have married . " " But her name ends in - ova . ' " " I see . You are mistaken . It is not a matter of marriage ; I am Petrov , my unmarried sister is Petrova . All fe-males. "  | " How stupid of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's so charming . " " In America , only the uncharming fail to marry ? " " Yes , you must be very uncharming not to marry . " " It is not so here . The government indeed is alarmed ; our birth rate is one of the lowest in Europe . It is a problem for economists . " Bech gestured at the monastery . " Too many monks ? " " Not enough , perhaps . With too few of monks , something of the monk enters everybody . " The peasant woman , who seemed old to Bech but who was probably younger than he , saw them to the edge of her domain . She huskily chattered in what Petrov said was very amusing rural slang . Behind her , now hiding in her skirts and now darting away , was her child , a boy not more than three . He was faithfully chased , back and forth , by a small white pig , who moved , as pigs do , on tiptoe , with remarkably abrupt changes of direction . Something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's parting smile and the unself-conscious way her hair thrust out from her head , something in the mountain mist and spongy rutted turf into which frost had begun to break at night , evoked for Bech a nameless absence to which was attached , like a horse to a meadow , the image of the poetess , with her broad face , her good legs , her Parisian clothes , and her sleekly brushed hair . Petrov , in whom he was beginning to sense , through the wraps of foreignness , a clever and kindred mind , seemed to have overhead his thoughts , for he said , " If you would like , we could have dinner . It would be easy for me to arrange . " " With her ? " " Yes , she is my friend , she would be glad . "  | " But I have nothing to say to her . I 'm just curious about such an intense conjunction of good looks and brains . I mean , what does a soul do with it all ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry , I ca n't . I 'm scheduled to go to the ballet , and the next night the legation is giving a cocktail party for me , and then I fly home . " " Home ? So soon ? " " It does not feel soon to me . I must try to work again . " " A drink , then . Tomorrow evening before the ballet ? It is possible ? It is not possible . " Petrov looked puzzled , and Bech realized that it was his fault , for he was nodding to say Yes , but in Bulgaria nodding meant No , and a shake of the head meant Yes . " Yes , " he said . " Gladly . " The ballet was entitled Silver Slippers . As Bech watched it , the word " ethnic " kept coming to his mind . He had grown accustomed , during his trip , to this sort of artistic evasion , the retreat from the difficult and disappointingpresent into folk dance , folk tale , folk song , with always the implication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really one 's heart 's own darling , the proletariat . " Do you like fairy tales ? " It was the moist-palmed interpreter who accompanied him to the theatre . " I love them , " Bech said , with a fervor and gaiety lingering from the previous hour . The interpreter looked at him anxiously , as when Bech had swallowed the brandy in one swig , and throughout the ballet kept murmuring explanations of self-evident events on thep226stage . Each night , a princess would put on silver slippers and dance through her mirror to tryst with a wizard , who possessed a magic stick that she coveted , for with it the world could be ruled . The wizard , as a dancer , was inept , and once almost dropped her , so that anger flashed from her eyes . She was , the princess , a little redhead with a high round bottom and a frozen pout and beautiful free arm motions , and Bech found it oddly estatic when , preparatory to her leap , she would dance toward the mirror , an empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would emerge from the wings and perform as her reflection . And when the princess , haughtily adjusting her cape of invisibility , leaped through the oval of gold wire , Bech 's heart leaped backward into the enchanted hour he had spent with the poetess . Though the appointment had been established , she came into the restaurant as if , again , she had been suddenly summoned and had hurried . She sat down between Bech and Petrov slightly breathless and fussed , but exuding , again , that impalpable warmth of intelligence and virtue . " Vera , Vera , " Petrov said . " You hurry too much , " Bech told her . " Not so very much , " she said . Petrov ordered her a cognac and continued with Bech their discussion of the newer French novelists . " It is tricks , " Petrov said . " Good tricks , but tricks . It does not have enough to do with life , it is too much verbal nervousness . Is that sense ? " " It 's an epigram , " Bech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whom I dop227not feel this : Claude Simon and Samuel Beckett . You have no relation , Bech , Beckett ? " " None . " Vera said , " Nathalie Sarraute is a very modest woman . She felt motherly to me . " " You have met her ? " " In Paris I heard her speak . Afterward there was the coffee . I liked her theories , of the , oh , what ? Of the little movements within the heart . " She delicately measured a pinch of space and smiled , through Bech , back at herself . " Tricks , " Petrov said . " I do not feel this with Beckett ; there , in a low form , believe it or not , one has human content . " Bech felt duty-bound to pursue this , to ask about the theatre of the absurd in Bulgaria , about abstract painting ( these were the touchstones of " progressiveness " ; Russia had none , Rumania some , Czechoslovakia plenty ) , to subvert Petrov . Instead , he asked the poetess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicately modelling the air , rounding into nuance , as it were , the square corners of her words . " After her talk , we  --  talked . " " In French ? " " And in Russian . " " She knows Russian ? " " She was born Russian . " " How is her Russian ? " " Very pure but  --  old-fashioned . Like a book . As she talked , I felt in a book , safe . " " You do not always feel safe ? " " Not always . "  | " Do you find it difficult to be a woman poet ? " " We have a tradition of woman poets . We have Elisaveta Bagriana , who is very great . " Petrov leaned toward Bech as if to nibble him . " Your own works ? Are they influenced by the nouvelle vague ? Do you consider yourself to write anti-romans ? " Bech kept himself turned toward the woman . " Do you want to hear about how I write ? You do n't , do you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told them , told them shamelessly , in a voice that surprised him with its steadiness , its limpid urgency , how once he had written , how in Travel Light he had sought to show people skimming the surface of things with their lives , taking tints from things the way that objects in a still life color one another , and how later he had attempted to place beneath the melody of plot a countermelody of imagery , interlocking images which had risen to the top and drowned his story , and how in The Chosen he had sought to make of this confusion the theme itself , an epic theme , by showing a population of characters whose actions were all determined , at the deepest level , by nostalgia , by a desire to get back , to dive , each , into the springs of their private imagery . The book probably failed ; at least , it was badly received . Bech apologized for telling all this . His voice tasted flat in his mouth ; he felt a secret intoxication and a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , as of an impossibly noble and quixotically complex experiment , to his failure when at bottom , he suspected , a certain simple laziness was the cause . Petrov said , " Fiction so formally sentimental could notp229be composed in Bulgaria . We do not have a happy history . " It was the first time Petrov had sounded like a Communist . If there was one thing that irked Bech about these people behind the mirror , it was their assumption that , however second-rate elsewhere , in suffering they were supreme . He said , " Believe it or not , neither do we . " Vera calmly intruded . " Your personae are not moved by love ? " " Yes , very much . But as a form of nostalgia . We fall in love , I tried to say in the book , with women who remind us of our first landscape . A silly idea . I used to be interested in love . I once wrote an essay on the orgasm  --  you know the word ?  --  " She shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  on the orgasm as perfect memory . The one mystery is , what are we remembering ? " She shook her head again , and he noticed that her eyes were gray , and that in their depths his image ( which he could not see ) was searching for the thing remembered . She composed her fingertips around the brandy glass and said , " There is a French poet , a young one , who has written of this . He says that never else do we , do we so gather up , collect into ourselves , oh  --  " Vexed , she spoke to Petrov in rapid Bulgarian . He shrugged and said , " Concentrate our attention . " "  --  concentrate our attention , " she repeated to Bech , as if the words , to be believed , had to come from her . " I say it foolish  --  foolishly  --  but in French it is very well put and  --  correct . "  |p230Petrov  smiled neatly and said , " This is an enjoyable subject for discussion , love . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words as if the language were not native even to him , " one of the few things that still deserve meditation . " " I think it is good , " she said . " Love ? " he asked , startled . She shook her head and tapped the stem of her glass with a fingernail , so that Bech had an inaudible sense of ringing , and she bent as if to study the liquor , so that her entire body borrowed a rosiness from the brandy and burned itself into Bech 's memory  --  the silver gloss of her nail , the sheen of her hair , the symmetry of her arms relaxed on the white tablecloth , everything except the expression on her face . Petrov asked aloud Bech 's opinion of Durrenmatt . Actuality is a running impoverishment of possibility . Though he had looked forward to seeing her again at the cocktail party and had made sure that she was invited , when it occurred , though she came , he could not get to her . He saw her enter , with Petrov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yugoslav Embassy and his burnished Tunisian wife ; and , later , when he was worming his way toward her diagonally , a steely hand closed on his arm and a rasping American female told him that her fifteenvear-oldnephew had decided to be a writer and desperately needed advice . Not the standard crap , but real brass-knuckles advice . Bech found himself balked . He was surrounded by America : the voices , the narrow suits , the watery drinks , the clatter , the glitter . The mirror had gone opaque and gave him back only himself.  |p231He  managed , in the end , as the officials were thinning out , to break through and confront her in a corner . Her coat , blond , with a rabbit collar , was already on ; from its side pocket she pulled a pale volume of poems in the Cyrillic alphabet . " Please , " she said . On the flyleaf she had written , " to H. Beck , sincerelly , with bad spellings but much "  --  the last word looked like " leave " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he begged , and went back to where his ravaged pile of presentation books had been and , unable to find the one he wanted , stole the legation library 's jacketless copy of The Chosen . Placing it in her expectanthands , he told her , " Do n't look , " for inside he had written , with a drunk 's stylistic confidence , Dear Vera GlavanakovaIt is a matter of earnest regret for me that you and I must live on opposite sides of the world.
