Seattle 's excited buzz had nothing to do with the Christmas holidays : the city was in the frantic final stages of preparing for the 1962 Seattle World 's Fair , which will open next April for a six months ' run , attracting some 7,500,000 tourists ( hopefully , as many as 10 million ) , to the Pacific Northwest . <P> Getting a Facelift . Hotels , receiving reservation requests at a 10,000-a-week clip , were already nearly sold out for the three summer months . By last week advance sales of tickets had topped $700,000 . In the shadow of Queen Anne Hill , on a 74-acre tract of land , fair buildings were rising dramatically . For Seattle , the experience was like that of the perennial wallflower who suddenly finds herself the belle of the ball . The town was mostly pleased , but partly dazed-and just a mite suspicious . There was dark talk about the girlie shows that are planned . Local businessmen were skeptical about the " New York money " that has poured into the fair and that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers have refused to relax the Sunday curfew on liquor . But these are minor matters , and most of Seattle has pitched in with a will , dolled up the city to a fare-thee-well . Trees and colorful news kiosks have sprouted on downtown streets ; and parking meters now come in pastel hues . Some 131 projects are being renovated to give the old town a facelift . <P> No Joke . The $80-million fair is the result of luck , audacity-and hard work . The notion for a world 's fair was born seven years ago when three leading citizens met for drinks at the Washington Athletic Club . Two members of the Chamber of Commerce and a newspaperman convivially agreed that it would be nice for Seattle to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition with another , grander fair . By the time the three reached the label on the bottle , the fair was no joke , and things began to happen . The city pledged $10 million for an opera house , a theater and an exhibition hall . The state put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounded up another $4.5 million , and finally the Federal Government appropriated $9,000,000 . Then Joseph E. Gandy , Ford dealer and fair president , went to Paris and brashly asked the Bureau of International Expositions to designate the Seattle Fair as the only international fair it would recognize in the U.S. for a decade . To his surprise , * B.I.E. agreed . As of last week , 27 foreign nations , from Brazil to Yugoslavia , had signed up for exhibitions . <P> Although some local citizens attempted to impose their own ideas , the officials wisely brought in architects and entrepreneurs from all over the U.S. to plan the big show . " When I came here a year ago , " says Harold Shaw , performing arts director for the fair , " the first response was , ' Well , he 's from New York . Watch him . ' They wanted local entertainment . The local Gilbert and Sullivan troupe . Dancers from the local studios . The local Little Theater groups . I told them , ' Look , this is supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grow up . ' " The result of such determination has set a high standard . Among the fair 's highlights :
