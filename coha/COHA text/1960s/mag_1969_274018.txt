In Davenport , Iowa , telephone number 323-1819 rang . The call was answered by a 71-year-old woman , a retired schoolteacher . " Hello , " she said pleasantly . " This is your listener . " Her caller said " Hello " back , but there was uncertainty in her voice . " Is this your first call to us ? " the schoolteacher prompted gently . " Yes , " came the reply . The subsequent conversation between two strangers went like this : <P> I 'm a widow living in this house alone . I was so lonesome tonight I had to talk to someone . What bothers me is the loneliness , not talking to anyone . <P> I 'm glad you thought of us . I hope you call any time you want to visit . <P> You 're only the second caller I 've had tonight . I was getting lonesome too . <P> I like to sit out on the porch when there 's a breeze . But there 's not a breath of air moving . The air 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I know why I 'm so lonely . It was just about this time of year my husband died . We would have been married 45 years next Christmas . <P> It must be an especially difficult time for you . <P> The talk ranged over a variety of personal concerns-the shading elm tree in the front yard that had to come down , a son who seldom came to visit , all the small but vital concerns of an old woman in a house and a life that for many years had been too empty . In content , it was very little different from the 150 calls a month received by 323-1819 , which is the number of a service known as Dial-a-Listener . At the receiving end is a rotating staff of ten volunteers-including the schoolteacher , a nurse , an author , a civil engineer-who keep the number open around the clock . At the other end are the lonely people of Davenport who hunger for the sound of a sympathetic human voice . <P> Although intended primarily to serve the aged , Dial-a-Listener occasionally gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents work , phones nearly every day after school , and sometimes late at night when he ca n't get to sleep . " I think I 'm a homosexual , " began another youthful caller . " Where can I get help ? " He was referred to a social agency . Crank calls are rare . One high school girl rang up to ask how to divide 182 by 9 ; her listener , no arithmetician , was stumped . <P> Sympathetic Voice . This modest effort in human relations was begun last March by the Senior Citizens ' Pilot Project under the sponsorship of the Scott County Commission on Aging . Unlike the numerous Dial-a-Prayer switchboards and suicide-prevention centers , its purpose is neither to deliver canned messages of hope nor to cope with life-and-death crises , but to offer lonely callers a simple human connection . The service costs almost nothing : less than $700 a year for telephone equipment and a few office supplies . Not everyone can be a listener . " We 're very selective about our volunteers , " says Clayton Moore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will survive the impersonality of the telephone : a warm , sympathetic voice and , above all , the willingness to listen .
