A view of the Newquist apartment . The living room , dining area , foyer and front door slowly fade into view ( by means of a scrim or any other workable method ) , in sync with the rising sound of city street noises . The apartment is typically Upper West Side , dominated by overstuffed furniture , enormous multipaned windows and walls with too much molding . At the moment , mid-morning , it is empty . As the apartment fades into view the level of noise rises  --  morning noise : construction , traffic and helicopters . In the next few minutes both light and noise change : shadows shift , lengthen and darken in sync with the fading of construction sounds , replaced by the late afternoon cries of children at play . This too fades into the quieter monotone of early evening traffic . The apartment darkens accordingly and we may even see the setting sun as reflected in the apartment windows across the street . ( The only view of the world outside is of other buildings , other windows . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the apartment , from mid-morning to dusk . Throughout , a steady patina of soot has drifted in through one of the half-open windows , and specks of plaster may now and then drop from the ceiling . The telephone rings . Other sounds : police sirens , fire engines , etc . The front door unlocks ; this takes time , since there are two double locks on the door . The door slowly pushes open , revealing two enormous shopping bags . Almost completely hidden behind them is MARJORIE , small , energetic , in her fifties . She switches on the foyer light with an elbow and bustles across to the kitchen . MARJORIE NEWQUIST Do n't let a draft in ! ( As she disappears through the swinging door that leads to the kitchen , KENNY enters reading a paperback . He is listless , in his early twenties . Leaving the door open he starts slowly across the room , engrossed in his reading . On the return swing of the kitchen door , MARJORIE reappears sans coat and shopping bags , this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to need your help , young man . ( KENNY enters bathroom , closes door loudly ) Do n't dawdle ! ( MARJORIE runs sponge across dining-room table . It comes up pitch black ) Filth ! ( She unfolds tablecloth in one motion . It falls perfectly into place ) They 'll be here any minute , Kenny ! ( She disappears into kitchen with sponge , reappears on return swing of door with serving cart piled high with dishes and silver . She is about to set table when an explosion of automobile horns drives her to window , which she slams shut with great effort . She hastens to other window and switches on air conditioner  --  a loud hum . CAROL enters , carrying brief case . He is a short , thickset , energetic man in his fifties , about MARJORIE 's size ) p. 3 CAROL NEWQUIST What the hell is that for ? This is February ! ( Switches off air conditioner ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( A cheerful but uninterested hug ) It drowns out the traffic . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Slips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have guests . We do n't want people to think we 're crazy . Did the liquor come ? MARJORIE NEWQUIST It came . ( Suspicious ) Why are you so interested in liquor ? CAROL NEWQUIST Do n't worry . You 've got nothing to worry about . MARJORIE NEWQUIST You called up twice from the office to ask about the liquor . CAROL NEWQUIST That 's all right . That 's perfectly all right .

CAROL NEWQUIST That poor boy wants to marry my Patsy ! And do n't call me Carol ! ( Sounds of toilet flush and door slam . KENNY enters from bathroom , reading ) p. 4 MARJORIE NEWQUIST But  --  dear  --  you have n't even met him ! KENNY NEWQUIST ( Matter-of-fact ) He 's an artsy-fartsy photographer . Patsy says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAROL NEWQUIST ( To KENNY ) Are you reading again ? ( He grabs paperback ) Harlots of Venus ! Is that what I spend seven thousand a year on graduate school for ? Get dressed ! KENNY NEWQUIST You lost my place ! ( KENNY exits ) CAROL NEWQUIST Why is she doing this to me ? MARJORIE NEWQUIST He 'll be a fine boy . I know it in my bones . CAROL NEWQUIST What are you talking about ? Do you have the slightest idea what you 're talking about ? She 's only known him three weeks ! I bet he 's a fag ! MARJORIE NEWQUIST Carol ! CAROL NEWQUIST ( Vicious ) I hate that name ! I told you never to call me that name . You deliberately do that to annoy me ! ( Shouts ) Call me dear ! ( Subsides ) You refuse to look at the facts .

CAROL NEWQUIST Swish ! And that actor , the one who she went camping up in Maine with ? MARJORIE NEWQUIST Roger . He was very muscular . CAROL NEWQUIST Swish ! And the musician . And the stockbroker . And the Jewish novelist ! MARJORIE NEWQUIST Oh , they 're not like that  --  CAROL NEWQUIST Swish ! Swish ! Swish ! I can spot ' em a mile away . She draws ' em like flies . Too strong for real men . Too much stuff ! ( Proudly ) She 's got too much stuff ! Wait , you 'll see . This new one  --  what 's his name ? MARJORIE NEWQUIST Alfred . CAROL NEWQUIST A swish name if I ever heard one . You 'll see . He 'll come in . Be very polite . Very charming . Look handsome . Well dressed . Have a strong handshake . Look me right in the eye .

And when he gets up to start walking  --  ( He is about to mimic walk . Offstage sound of shots . CAROL and MARJORIE rush to window . He struggles , but ca n't get it open ) Damn ! Goddamn ! p. 6 MARJORIE NEWQUIST Hurry ! ( Shots fade . Offstage siren , loud , then fading ) They 're miles away by now . You take forever . ( Doorbell ) PATSY 'S VOICE Hey , everybody ! ( CAROL outpaces MARJORIE to door . PATSY and ALFRED enter . Much excitement , laughter . CAROL is more involved with his daughter than MARJORIE , who is just a touch restrained .

CAROL NEWQUIST ( Ignoring ALFRED , to PATSY ) Hey , you were n't in that business down there ? p. 7 PATSY NEWQUIST What business ? CAROL NEWQUIST Well , from now on just be more careful . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Her eyes on ALFRED ) I do n't think we need worry any longer , dear . Patsy 's finally got herself a man ! ( CAROL scowls ) PATSY NEWQUIST Where 's my Kenny ?

MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Somewhat catty ) Alfred , have you ever seen such a madhouse ? ( ALFRED smiles diffidently ) CAROL NEWQUIST He 's in the house for three minutes and she 's already putting him on the spot . Have you ever seen anything like it , Alfred ? ( ALFRED smiles diffidently ) PATSY NEWQUIST Kenny ! You 're so handsome ! I ca n't get over it ! ( To ALFRED ) I 've always had a mad thing on my kid brother !

PATSY NEWQUIST Mother , what have you done to this room ? ( Lights flicker and black out in apartment , and in windows across the street ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Lighting candles ) Nothing special . A little bit of this . A little bit of that . ( Offstage sirens begin ) CAROL NEWQUIST ( Self-pityingly ) If you bothered to come here more often  --  MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Studying PATSY 's face by candlelight ) I do n't like your looks . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Studying PATSY ) What 's the matter ? The day that girl does n't look like a million dollars  --  MARJORIE NEWQUIST You 've got black rings under your eyes . PATSY NEWQUIST Mother , that 's eyeliner . MARJORIE NEWQUIST Makes you look exhausted . KENNY NEWQUIST ( Studying PATSY ) I like it . p. 9 MARJORIE NEWQUIST Always together !

MARJORIE NEWQUIST I ca n't be expected to remember everything . It 's not as if you still lived here . KENNY NEWQUIST Hey , Al , want to see Patsy 's old room ? PATSY NEWQUIST Alfred , Kenny . And he 's not interested in that ! KENNY NEWQUIST I bet he is ! Want to ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Maybe later . p. 10 KENNY NEWQUIST ( Rejected ) Why should I care ? CAROL NEWQUIST ( To KENNY ) He does n't want to ! Stop acting silly ! ( To ALFRED ) What 's your pleasure , young fellow ? MARJORIE NEWQUIST Alfred , may I shake your hand ? My mother taught us that you could tell a lot about a person by the way he shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good hand . ( Flirtatious ) Better look out , Patsy ! I 'll steal your boy friend ! ( Releases ALFRED 's hand . Short laugh . To ALFRED ) I 'm only joking . KENNY NEWQUIST Let me try . ( Shakes ALFRED 's hand ) You do n't squeeze so hard . ( Disengages ) Dad ? CAROL NEWQUIST This is the silliest business I 've ever heard of ! I think we all need drinks . What 's your pleasure , young fellow ? MARJORIE NEWQUIST Alfred , is something the matter with your face ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( To PATSY ) Is there ? PATSY NEWQUIST ( Subdued annoyance ) Just the usual assortment of bruises , Mother . p. 11 MARJORIE NEWQUIST What kind of talk is that ? Modern talk ? PATSY NEWQUIST ( Not overjoyed to be on the subject ) Alfred is always getting beat up , Mother . At least once a week . ( To ALFRED ) Or is it more ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Shakes his head to indicate it is not more ) I do n't get hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look at that boy ! His face is a mass of bruises !

PATSY NEWQUIST ( Resigned ) Ask him ! ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Not interested but making an effort , mindful that this is his first attempt at conversation ) Look . ( Long pause . Others stir uncomfortably ) There are lots of little people who like to start fights with big people . They hit me for a couple of minutes , they see I 'm not going to fall down , they get tired and they go away . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( After an embarrassed pause ) So much tension . Rush . Rush . Rush . My mother taught me to take dainty , little steps . She 'd kill me if she saw the stride on Patsy . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Puzzled . The beginnings of contempt ) Do n't you defend yourself ? p. 13 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I ask them not to hit my cameras . They 're quite good about that . ( Cheerful ) Surprising ! CAROL NEWQUIST Let me get this straight . You just stand there and let these hooligans do whatever they want to you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worry about it . At the risk of sounding arrogant , this has been going on for ten years and I 've yet to be knocked unconscious . CAROL NEWQUIST But why do n't you fight back ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I do n't want to . CAROL NEWQUIST Christ Jesus , you 're not a pacifist ? PATSY NEWQUIST ( Warning ) Daddy  --  ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Slowly shakes his head ) An apathist . ( Blank stares from CAROL and MARJORIE ) I want to do what I want to do , not what they want me to do . CAROL NEWQUIST So you just stand there . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN It does n't hurt . CAROL NEWQUIST Getting your face beat in does n't hurt ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Not if you daydream . I daydream all through it . About my work . I imagine myself standing there , in the same spot , clicking off roll after roll of film , humming to myself with pleasure . I hum to myself when I work . There are times when I get so carried away that I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . Muggers tend to get very depressed when you hum all the while they 're hitting you . It 's not something I choose to happen . It 's just one of those things you learn to live with . p. 14 PATSY NEWQUIST ( To family ) Look , this is an old argument and it does n't really concern you . Why do n't we get on something else ? CAROL NEWQUIST ( Indignant ) It certainly does concern me , young lady ! PATSY NEWQUIST ( Placating ) Oh , Daddy  --  CAROL NEWQUIST I want you to know it concerns me very much . ( To ALFRED ) How do you get into these things ? You must do something to get them mad  --  ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN No  --  CAROL NEWQUIST Well , Goddamnit , you 're getting me mad ! MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Taking the heat off ) Alfred , do you try talking to them ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( The patient old pro ) There 's no way of talking someone out of beating you up if that 's what he wants to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a riot ! ( She slaps at him . He playfully eludes her ) PATSY NEWQUIST Have n't we had enough of this ? I 'm going to make some drinks . p. 15 KENNY NEWQUIST Vodka and tonic . MARJORIE NEWQUIST Just one , young man . CAROL NEWQUIST I 'll make them ! PATSY NEWQUIST No , Daddy . I want to get my hands busy . Alfred ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Nothing right now . CAROL NEWQUIST You do n't drink either . Is that right ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I drink beer . CAROL NEWQUIST Get him a beer , Kenny . KENNY NEWQUIST Why is it always my turn ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Not now , thanks . CAROL NEWQUIST He does n't drink . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I 'll drink later . CAROL NEWQUIST You do n't drink . You do n't fight . PATSY NEWQUIST I fight , Daddy ! MARJORIE NEWQUIST Carol , leave the poor boy alone . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Shouts ) How many times do I have to tell you  --  MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Hurt ) I 'm sorry . Whatever I do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey . What 's dat ? Dat my best goil talking ? Hey . ( He hugs her from behind ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Kittenish ) Kenny ! What will Alfred think ? He 'll thing you 're always making love to your mother ! CAROL NEWQUIST ( Sourly ) He is always making love to his mother . MARJORIE NEWQUIST Well , someone has to  --  ( She smiles into CAROL 's glare ) dear . PATSY NEWQUIST ( Serving drinks ) What 's this ? What 's this ? I thought I was your best girl , Kenny ? ( KENNY tries to release MARJORIE and go to PATSY . She grabs his arms and holds on ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To ALFRED ) When Patsy lived at home we used to go on like this all the time . KENNY NEWQUIST ( Whining ) Let go , Mom ! CAROL NEWQUIST Stop all this silliness and drink your liquor ! ( MARJORIE releases KENNY , who goes over to PATSY ) p. 17 MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Flirtatious ) You 're an intelligent-sounding man , Alfred . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd realize the sort of person you were and go away . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN What can you say that 's sensible to a drunk who you have n't been staring at , when he shoves you in the chest and says , " Who do you think you 're staring at , fatface ? " If you deny you 've been staring at him , you 've as much as called him a liar . For that you get hit . If you stutter in confusion , you 've as much as admitted your guilt . For that you get hit . If you tell him you were staring at him because he reminds you of a kid you went to school with in Chicago , he turns out to hate Chicago . And for that you get hit . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To PATSY ) I did n't know he went to school in Chicago . Nobody tells me anything . ( To ALFRED ) We went to Chicago in 1946 . Whereabout did you live in Chicago , Alfred ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN The South Side . MARJORIE NEWQUIST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's another story . Does your family still live there ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I do n't know . CAROL NEWQUIST You do n't know ! What kind of answer is that ? You do n't know ! That 's the silliest answer I 've ever heard ! p. 18 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I have n't kept up contact . ( CAROL frowns , disapproving ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST There seems to be so little cohesiveness in families today . We never went anywhere . We were too unsophisticated to know that home would n't serve . ( At PATSY ) Today they run off here , they run off there  --  KENNY NEWQUIST ( Hugs her ) I 'll never leave you , Mom . CAROL NEWQUIST Will you two break it up ? How about another round ? Name your poison , Alfred . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Sadly ) We 've had our share of tragedy  --  PATSY NEWQUIST ( Warning ) Mother  --  ( Phone rings . CAROL starts for it . MARJORIE beats him to it ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST Let me , dear . It 's never for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Hello . Hello . Who is this ? Hello . ( PATSY starts toward her ) The most curious business . Hello . ( PATSY takes phone , listens and hangs up ) PATSY NEWQUIST ( To MARJORIE ) You get it too . p. 19 CAROL NEWQUIST What ? ( PATSY looks toward MARJORIE , who smiles but does not answer ) What ? MARJORIE NEWQUIST Never mind , dear . It 's not important . ( CAROL frustrated . PATSY goes to him ) PATSY NEWQUIST The Breather , Daddy . Do you get many of these , Mother ? MARJORIE NEWQUIST He 's the pleasantest of the lot . You should hear the ones who talk ! I grit my teeth , turn my ears right off , and wait politely for them till they 've finished their business . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Exasperated ) Will somebody please explain to me  --  PATSY NEWQUIST I get them every night . You know , Daddy  --  these oddballs who call you up at all hours and just breathe at you . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Appalled ) Late at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) And you do n't fight back ? ! ( Doorbell ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST I 'll get it ! ( She crosses to door and opens peephole ) Who is it ? I 'm sorry , I ca n't understand you ! Will you please stand closer to the peephole ? I ca n't see you  --  take your hand off the peephole . I warn you , I 'm calling the doorman ! ( PATSY starts for door . MARJORIE shuts peephole and intercepts her . She returns , musing ) If it happens once , it happens a dozen times a day . And we gave that doorman fifteen dollars for Christmas . ( PATSY protectively puts her arms around her . MARJORIE lightly shrugs it off ) p. 20 CAROL NEWQUIST ( To ALFRED ) What are you going to do if you 're on the street with my daughter ? PATSY NEWQUIST Do n't be silly , Daddy . I 'm quite capable of taking care of myself . KENNY NEWQUIST ( Proudly ) She 's as strong as an ox . When we were kids we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PATSY NEWQUIST ( Enjoying herself ) Daddy , I assure you , no one 's going to pick on me . I 'm a big , strapping girl ! I do n't daydream , and I do hit back . When I take Alfred home every night , I guarantee you there 's no trouble . CAROL NEWQUIST You let her take you home ? PATSY NEWQUIST He does n't let me . He does n't have anything to say about it . Every time I leave him alone somebody in this crazy city mugs him . Once I have him safely married ( CAROL and KENNY wince ) , I wo n't let him out of my sight for five minutes . ( Pinches ALFRED ) He 's too cute to get beat up  --  by anyone but me . ( She throws a playful but entirely masculine punch at ALFRED . He smiles happily as it connects . KENNY exits . Offstage door slam ) p. 21 MARJORIE NEWQUIST Are n't they adorable ? CAROL NEWQUIST ( Quietly to MARJORIE ) What did I tell you about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he 's very sweet . CAROL NEWQUIST That 's a sure sign . You think they 're all sweet . I 'll be damned ( Louder ) if I 'd let myself stand by and let a woman fight my battles for me . PATSY NEWQUIST ( Hugging CAROL from behind ) They do n't make frontier fighters like my father any more . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Looks about ) Kenny ! ( Shakes her head in exasperation and smiles seductively at ALFRED ) Alfred , would you mind giving me a hand ? ( They exit ) CAROL NEWQUIST ( Delighted ) Come on . Stop being silly . Cut it out . PATSY NEWQUIST ( Playful , squeezing tighter ) Let 's see how good you are , tiger . Break my grip ! Come on ! ( Momentary look of panic in CAROL 's eyes . PATSY releases him . They laugh ) p. 22 CAROL NEWQUIST ( Slaps her cheek playfully ) Who 's my baby girl , eh ? ( Suddenly serious ) I wish you had as much brains as you have brawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Daddy ? CAROL NEWQUIST Do n't put words in my mouth . PATSY NEWQUIST Then you do like him ? CAROL NEWQUIST I want to know more about him before I make up my mind  --  PATSY NEWQUIST Not to like him . CAROL NEWQUIST Do n't bully me , young lady . You know I do n't like it when you bully me . PATSY NEWQUIST You love it when I bully you . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Chuckles ) You 're too damned fast for the old man . ( Slaps her cheek playfully ) But I know a thing or two . ( Deadly serious ) Never settle for less . PATSY NEWQUIST Daddy , I 'm not ! CAROL NEWQUIST Never sell yourself short . PATSY NEWQUIST Oh , Daddy , when have I ever  --  p. 23 CAROL NEWQUIST The right man will come along . PATSY NEWQUIST Daddy , I 'm twenty-seven . The right men all got married two years ago . They wo n't get their first divorce for another five years , and I just do n't have the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to wait . CAROL NEWQUIST I do n't want to hear you knocking yourself . You 've got ten people working under you ! ( Proudly ) You 're five-foot eight ! PATSY NEWQUIST After a while it does n't matter that you can do everything better than everyone else . I 've been the best for years now , and all it comes down to is that I 'm efficient . CAROL NEWQUIST You do n't know what you 're talking about . You 're very popular . PATSY NEWQUIST When they want a woman they can collapse without shame in front of  --  they come to me . CAROL NEWQUIST Why not ? You 're trusted ! PATSY NEWQUIST Oh , to meet a man who is ashamed to collapse in front of me ! Daddy , I get dizzy spells from being so strong ; I get migraine from being so damnably dependable . I 'm tired of being Mother Earth ! Daddy , Alfred 's the only man I know who is n't waiting for me to save him . Do n't you know how that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to save him ! ( She embraces CAROL , who blissfully returns embrace . ALFRED enters uncorking the wine and surveys scene . CAROL quickly disengages ) p. 24 MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Enters wheeling serving cart ) Come an ' git it ! ( To ALFRED as she starts serving ) My mother always used to say that to us children at mealtimes . I 've always found it a charming family tradition . So I say , " Come an ' git it ! " to our children . I dream of the day when I can hear Patsy say , " Come an ' git it ! " to her children . ( To KENNY , who is offstage ) Kenny ! Did n't you hear me say come an ' git it , or do you need a special invitation ? KENNY NEWQUIST ( Still offstage ) In a minute ! MARJORIE NEWQUIST Not a minute , young man ! Right now ! ( To ALFRED ) It 's so stuffy in here . Alfred , would you open a window like a good fellow ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises ) No , I asked Alfred , dear .

( To ALFRED ) The son of a bitch refuses to open ! ( ALFRED gives strong jerk . Window opens . Traffic , construction and airplane noise ) p. 25 MARJORIE NEWQUIST Thank you , Alfred . ( To CAROL ) You see , I had my reasons . ( Light film of soot wafts through window ) CAROL NEWQUIST I loosened it ! KENNY NEWQUIST He loosened it ! That 's a riot ! ( Convulses himself ) CAROL NEWQUIST ( Slams window shut . To KENNY ) Now you open it ! ( KENNY airily dismisses him ) No , you 're the smart one around here ! Let 's see you open it !

MARJORIE NEWQUIST Will someone please open the window ? ( PATSY leaps up before ALFRED can rise , strides to window , kicks off heels , jerks window open . Noise and dust . KENNY and CAROL bend over their plates , embarrassed . PATSY returns to table ) When Patsy lived at home I always knew I had someone to do my heavy lifting for me . I was always too petite . ( PATSY shrinks over her plate . All quietly eat ) You do n't know what a pleasure it is to have my family all together this way . ( Lights flicker and black out , as before . Sounds of eating ) Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subways , in total darkness for as long as four hours without bringing their newspapers down from in front of their faces ? ( Long silence . Eating sounds . MARJORIE lights candles ) It would be nice if someone else , on occasion , would think of lighting the candles . Kenny , come back here ! ( Offstage door slam . KENNY returns carrying paperback ) I 'm the watchdog around here , Alfred . I can imagine what Patsy must have told you about me. p. 26 PATSY NEWQUIST ( Bored ) Must you , Mother ? ( They exchange long stares . MARJORIE rises and exits . Door slam . Lights go on ) CAROL NEWQUIST ( Up quickly ) I 'm going to make myself another drink . KENNY NEWQUIST Make me one . PATSY NEWQUIST Me too . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Scotch neat . ( CAROL stops , stares at him , goes over to bar , grinning .

MARJORIE frowns as PATSY accepts drink ) That 's your second tonight , is n't it ? And I suppose you 're still smoking as much ? ( PATSY salutes with glass . Drains it ) Drinks like a fish . Smokes like a chimney . ( PATSY has mock cough spasm ) It 's the ones who think they 're indestructible who do the most damage to themselves . Kenny , is that a new drink ? ( KENNY bolts drink . MARJORIE shakes head , looks warily at CAROL . He bolts drink , scratches his hand nervously . To ALFRED , with photographs ) You 're a photographer , Alfred , so I thought you 'd be interested in seeing these pictures of Patsy 's dead brother , Steve . ( PATSY covers her face with her hands ) p. 27 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN He looks very handsome in his swimsuit . MARJORIE NEWQUIST He won five gold cups . He was ten years older than Patsy .

A brilliant future in electronics , not an enemy in the world , whoever dreamed he 'd be shot down in his tracks on the corner of Ninety-seventh Street and Amsterdam Avenue .

( PATSY puts a cigarette in her mouth ) And she 's right about your smoking too much , Goddamnit ! ( PATSY turns to CAROL , cigarette in mouth , waiting for a light . He resists for a moment , then lights it ) PATSY NEWQUIST ( In command ) Thank you . ( CAROL scratches his hand . Softly to ALFRED ) I 'm sorry you had to be subjected to this honey , ( To CAROL , taking his hand , placating ) Alfred knows all about Steve , Daddy . ( CAROL revives ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN They still do n't have any idea who did it ? CAROL NEWQUIST That 's all right . The boys down at Homicide have worked long and hard and imaginatively on this case ( With pride ) Many have become close personal friends . ( Toilet flush , door slam . MARJORIE enters , eyes red but smiling . She is clutching a handkerchief . KENNY rises and exits in her direction . Door slam ) p. 29 MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only one helping . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN No , thank you , Mrs. Newquist . I 've had plenty . PATSY NEWQUIST ( Ingratiating ) It was delicious , Mother ! CAROL NEWQUIST It was delicious ! MARJORIE NEWQUIST Kenny ! Where are you ? KENNY NEWQUIST ( Offstage , muffled ) It was delicious ! MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To ALFRED ) A big man like you . Now , do n't just stand on politeness  --  ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN No . I 'm really quite stuffed , thank you . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To PATSY ) Well , then I 'll have to turn to my best customer . PATSY NEWQUIST I could n't eat another bite , Mother . It was delicious . CAROL NEWQUIST I could n't eat another bite . It was delicious . KENNY NEWQUIST ( Offstage , muffled ) I could n't eat another bite . It was delicious ! ( Toilet flush . Door slam . He enters carrying paperback ) I could use another drink , though . ( He detours on his way back from bar to surreptitiously pick up PATSY 's heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) p. 30 CAROL NEWQUIST ( Rises ) I think I 'll have another . ( At the bar ) Patsy ? PATSY NEWQUIST ( Rises ) Leave out the water this time . ( She goes to bar ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Scotch neat . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Not really approving ) Well , it 's a special occasion . PATSY NEWQUIST ( Looks around ) Where the devil did I leave my shoes ? ( KENNY looks away ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Gathering photographs from table ) I 'd better put these in a safe place before someone spills liquor on them . I 'm sorry to have taken your time , Alfred . Knowing you were a photographer I thought you 'd be interested . ( Waits for response ; there is none ) Exactly what sort of work do you do ? Portraits ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN No . PATSY NEWQUIST ( Returns protectively . Hands ALFRED drink ) Stop cross-examining him , Mother . MARJORIE NEWQUIST I do n't know why everything I do is wrong . Alfred , do you object to my asking you about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that interesting , actually . MARJORIE NEWQUIST You do n't do portraits ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN No . MARJORIE NEWQUIST Do you do magazine photography ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN No . PATSY NEWQUIST Has somebody got a cigarette ? MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To PATSY ) Must you ? Ca n't you give in to me just this once ? ( CAROL sits , hands PATSY cigarette . KENNY lights it . Barely in control , to ALFRED ) Advertising photography ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Well , I used to . I do n't any more . CAROL NEWQUIST Fashion photography ? ( He nudges KENNY ) KENNY NEWQUIST ( Rolls his eyes ) Woo ! Woo ! ( CAROL and KENNY exchange joyful glances . Stifle laughs ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN It 's sort of complicated . Are you sure you want to hear ? PATSY NEWQUIST ( Resigned ) You may as well  --  p. 32 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Well , I began as a commercial photographer  --  PATSY NEWQUIST He began as a painter . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN A very bad painter . PATSY NEWQUIST Says you ! CAROL NEWQUIST For Christ sakes , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAROL , are surprised by outburst ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I began as a commercial photographer , and was doing sort of well at it . PATSY NEWQUIST Sort of well ! You should see his portfolio . He 's had work in Holiday , Esquire , The New Yorker , Vogue  --  CAROL NEWQUIST Vogue ! KENNY NEWQUIST ( Rolls his eyes ) Woo ! Woo ! ( He and Carol exchange nudges , joyful glances . PATSY glares . They subside ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN It 's an overrated business . But after a couple of years of doing sort of well ( PATSY slaps his hand lightly ) at it , things began to go wrong . I began losing my people . Somehow I got my heads chopped off . Or out of focus . Or terrible expressions on my models . I 'd have them examining a client 's product like this ( Expression of distaste )  --  the agencies began to wonder if I did n't have some editorial motive in mind . Well , it was n't true . But once they 'd planted the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I shot an airline ad , or deaths on the highway every time I shot an automobile ad , or price-rigging every time I shot a pharmaceutical ad  --  and power failures when I shot Con Edison ads . ( Lights go out ) p. 33 MARJORIE NEWQUIST I do n't mean to interrupt , dear . ( Lights match and candles ) " How far better it is to light a match than curse the darkness . " My mother told us that . Go on . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Well , my career suffered . But there was nothing I could do about it . The harder I tried to straighten out , the fuzzier my people got and the clearer my objects . Soon my people disappeared entirely , they just somehow never came out . But the objects I was shooting  --  brilliantly clear . ( Snaps fingers . Lights come back on ) So I began to do a lot of catalogue work . ( MARJORIE blows out candles ) Pictures of medical instruments , things like that . There was  --  well , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw out of inanimate things that other photographers did n't seem to be able to get . I suppose the real break came with the I.B.M . show . They had me shoot thirty of their new models . They hired a gallery and had a computer show . One hundred and twenty color pictures of computers . It got some very strange ( Whimsical smile ) notices , the upshot of which was that the advertising business went " thing " crazy , and I became commercial again . MARJORIE NEWQUIST You just be extremely talented . p. 34 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( More to himself than to family ) I got sick of it ! Where the hell are standards ? That 's what I kept asking myself . Those people will take anything ! Hell , if I gave them a picture of shit they 'd give me an award for it ! ( All stiffen . PATSY looks wary ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST Language , young man ! ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Mm ? So that 's what I do now . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Hesitantly ) What ? ALFRED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Language ! This is my table ! ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I do n't mean to offend you , Mrs. Newquist . I 've been shooting shit for a year now , and I 've already won a half-dozen awards . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Slowly thaws ) Awards ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN And Harper 's Bazaar wants me to do its spring issue . KENNY NEWQUIST ( Rolling his eyes ) Woo ! Woo ! CAROL NEWQUIST ( Angry , to KENNY ) Do n't kid ! p. 35 MARJORIE NEWQUIST That 's a very respectable publication . ( Rises shakily gathers up dishes ) It all sounds very impressive .

PATSY NEWQUIST ( Threatening ) Kenny ! ( PATSY starts for him . He jumps up from table , grabbing his drink , and runs out . He has on PATSY 's heels . Door slams . Offstage sound of distant sirens ) Well , my friend  --  p. 36 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN They asked me what I did for a living . ( Shrugs ) PATSY NEWQUIST ( Gives him a long stare ) I do n't know what to do with you . You 're the toughest reclamation job I 've ever had . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN You might try retiring on your laurels . You 've reformed five fags in a row , why press your luck with a nihilist ? PATSY NEWQUIST Because you 're wrong !

Because for every bad thing there are two good things  --  no  --  four good things !

( ALFRED goes into his daydream ) Alfred , come back here ! ( Long pause ) Alfred , if everything is so hopeless  --  why do anything ? p. 37 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Okay . PATSY NEWQUIST That 's why you do n't hit back . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN There is n't much point , is there ? PATSY NEWQUIST ( Explodes ) Do you know what you 're talking about ? Do you have the slightest idea ( Catches herself , shakes her head )  --  I always talk like my father when I 'm in this house . Alfred if you feel that way about things why get married ?

( He exits ) ALFRED ! ( Starts after him , muttering to herself ) He does n't know how to fight ; that 's why I 'm not winning . ( Exits and brings him back ) Damn it ! Are n't you willing to battle over anything ? Even me ? ( She anticipates what he is about to say ) p. 38 ALFRED AND PATSY There is n't much point , is there ?

And each and every Christmas we will send out personalized Christmas cards  --  with a group family portrait on the front  --  taken by Alfred Chamberlain . Daddy ! Mother ! I have an announcement ! ( CAROL and MARJORIE rush in . Sounds of toilet flush , door slam . KENNY rushes in , adjusting his trousers ) Alfred and I are getting married ( CAROL and KENNY freeze ) Next week !

Picks up again and begins to dial ) Mrs. Newquist , when you speak to the minister , you 'd better tell him  --  we do n't want any mention of God in the ceremony .

Surprising , is n't it , how the name of God is still respected in this town . ( Studies PATSY ) Carol Newquist 's daughter . ( Sighs ) Your father and me go back a long ways , young lady . He 's done me a lot of favors . Got me tickets to shows  --  ( Sighs .

Four infants in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat , she was so happy to be out of Russia alive . Across the ocean alive . More dead than alive , if you want to know the truth . Sixteen days in the steerage . Fifteen people got consumption . Five died . My father , thank God he 's not alive today , came over two years earlier , sixty-seven years ago . Worked like a son of a bitch to earn our passage ( To PATSY )  --  Pardon my French . You do n't want God in the ceremony , so you 're probably familiar with it .

With the bathtub in the kitchen and the toilet down the hall . One-forty-two Hester Street . Three families used the toilet . An Italian family . A colored family . A Jewish family . Three families with different faiths , but one thing each of those families had in common . They had in common the sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . What they had in common was persecution . So they were n't so glib about God . God was in my mother 's every conversation about how she got her family out of Russia , thank God , in one piece . About the pogroms . The steerage . About those who did n't make it . Got sick and died . Who could they ask for help ? If not God , then who ? The Great Society ? The Department of Welfare ? Travelers Aid ? Mind you , I 'm a good Democrat , I 'm not knocking these things . Although sometimes  --  there were n't any handouts in those days . This city was a  --  a  --  concrete jungle to the families that came here . They had to carve homes and lives out of concrete  --  cold concrete !

My father , thank God he 's not alive today , worked sixteen hours a day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tenth of what you pay today makes meat loaf out of this suit .

So tired , so broken in spirit , when he climbed the six flights of stairs each night to the three-room unheated cold-water flat the five of us were crowded in  --  one-seventy-one Attorney Street  --  that he did not have the strength to eat . The man did not have the strength to eat . Turning thinner and yellower by the day for lack of what ? A well-balanced diet ? Too much cholesterol ? Too many carbohydrates and starchy substances in his blood ? Not on your sweet life ? For lack of everything ! What was God to my father ? I 'll tell you  --  sit down , I 'm not finished !  --  I 'll tell you what God was to my father ! God got my father up those six and a half flights of stairs , not counting the stoop , every night .

The hands of a worker ! I worked ! These hands toiled from the time I was nine  --  strike that , seven . Every morning up at five , dressing in the pitch black to run down seven flights of stairs , thirteen steps to a flight  --  I 'll never forget them  --  to run five blocks to the Washington market , unpacking crates for seventy-five cents a week . A dollar if I worked Sundays . Maybe ! Based on the goodness of the bosses ' hearts . Where was my God then ? Where , on those bitter cold mornings , with my hands so blue with frostbite they looked like ladies ' gloves , was God ? Here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will always be !

FIRST GUEST Call the police . ( Guests have begun to drift away from the window . Two more gunshots , which they ignore ) p. 44 THIRD GUEST I learned to kill with the edge of a rolled-up newspaper . FIRST GUEST I carry a hunting knife . ( The family enters and the guests applaud ) CAROL NEWQUIST ( To FIRST GUEST ) Nothing like a little excitement  --  ( Loses smile as he watches PATSY cross to ALFRED and hug him . Scattered cheers , drinks raised in toast ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To SECOND GUEST ) Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's wonderful to marry a big man . There are so many complications when you marry a man shorter than yourself . CAROL NEWQUIST ( To THIRD GUEST ) I gave them twenty-five hundred . It 's just a token . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To SECOND GUEST ) And she 's so big herself . Many 's the time I gave up hope she 'd find a man bigger than she is . CAROL NEWQUIST ( To FOURTH GUEST ) Twenty-five hundred  --  MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To SECOND GUEST ) Or heavier . It 's always amazed me the size of her . I 've always been such a little peanut . p. 45 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( To FIFTH GUEST ) No . My family 's not here . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To SECOND GUEST ) You 'd think almost anybody I 'd married would have to be bigger than me ; well , that 's the way life works out . KENNY NEWQUIST ( To SIXTH GUEST ) I have n't made up my mind . I may go into teaching . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To THIRD GUEST ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does collages for Harper 's Bazaar . ( General laughter . MARJORIE looks around to see what she 's missing ) And he 's terribly independent . I always thought Patsy was independent , but this time I think she 's met her match . PATSY NEWQUIST ( To SECOND GUEST ) Well , the first year at least we 'll live at my place . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To THIRD GUEST ) No God in the ceremony , he says . Yes , God in the ceremony , she says . Well , you see who won that one . CAROL NEWQUIST Twenty-five hundred  --  ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( To FIRST GUEST ) No . My family is n't here . p. 46 MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To THIRD GUEST ) I would never have the nerve to stand up to her . Her father has never stood up to her . Her brother has never stood up to her . But this time she did n't get her way . ( Gaily ) There 's not going to be any God in the ceremony . KENNY NEWQUIST ( To SECOND GUEST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To FOURTH GUEST ) Poor children , these past few weeks they 've really had a rough time of it . Nobody wanted to marry them . Even the state of New York has God in the ceremony . They looked everywhere . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( To SECOND GUEST ) No . My family 's not here . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To FOURTH GUEST ) Ethical Culture told them they did n't have to have God in the ceremony , but they had to have ethical culture in the ceremony . PATSY NEWQUIST ( To FIRST GUEST ) I plan to go on working into my eighth month . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To FOURTH GUEST ) Finally , they found this man ( Doorbell . All pause tensely . CAROL checks peephole , unlocks door . DUPAS enters )  --  there he is now  --  Alfred found him , really  --  Reverend Dupas .

He 's pastor of the First Existential Church  --  the one that has that sign in front that says  --  REVEREND DUPAS ( To ALFRED ) My bike would n't start up . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To FOURTH GUEST , quoting ) " Christ died for our sins . Dare we make his martyrdom meaningless by not committing them ? " CAROL NEWQUIST ( To DUPAS , with feigned good cheer ) No atheists in foxholes these days , eh , Reverend ? They 've all gone into the ministry . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To FOURTH GUEST ) Two Sundays ago he gave a sermon on the moral affirmation in Alfred 's photographs . CAROL NEWQUIST Can I see you for a minute in private , Reverend ? ( He leads him off ) KENNY NEWQUIST ( Starts off ) Hey , that 's my room ! p. 48 PATSY NEWQUIST ( Looking after them , puzzled ) They 'll be right out . MARJORIE NEWQUIST They 'll be right out , dear . KENNY NEWQUIST How do they know I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARJORIE blocks his way ) I need a handkerchief ! ( Tries to get around her but is blocked ) I 've got a right to go into my own room ! MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Conciliatory ) Why do n't you go into the bathroom , dear ? KENNY NEWQUIST ( To PATSY ) Why ca n't you do your things in your own room ? PATSY NEWQUIST Kenny  --  ( Reaches for him . He turns away ) Why are you mad at me ? ( KENNY storms away . The phone rings . KENNY gets it . Amplified breathing ) KENNY NEWQUIST ( Into phone ) Faggot ! ( Hangs up . Sound of gunshots . All ignore them . CAROL enters with his arm around DUPAS , who disengages and crosses to ALFRED ) REVEREND DUPAS ( To ALFRED ) Your father-in-law wants me to sneak the deity into the ceremony . p. 49 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN What did you tell him ? REVEREND DUPAS He offered me a lot of money . I told him I 'd make my decision in a few minutes . ( DUPAS checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulated , scratching his hand and staring intently at DUPAS ) If it 's all right with you I 'd like to take the money , and then not mention the deity . First Existential can use the money . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN He 'll stop the check . REVEREND DUPAS I thought he might . Still , it would serve as a lesson ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I do n't know what to tell you , Henry . REVEREND DUPAS Well , we 'll see . ( He crosses over to CAROL . They exit ) KENNY NEWQUIST ( Starts off ) I need something out of my bedroom . MARJORIE NEWQUIST Kenny ! ( Blocks his way . KENNY tries to charge past her . She intercepts and they begin to struggle . With forced gaiety ) Ha ! Ha ! Look , everybody ! We 're dancing ! ( CAROL and DUPAS enter  --  wrestling match breaks up . CAROL , hiding triumph , crosses over to ALFRED ) p. 50 CAROL NEWQUIST ( Slaps him on back ) Nervous , young fellow ? ( ALFRED turns to look for PATSY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been looking forward to this day for a long , long time . It would only take one thing more to make it perfect . ( ALFRED smiles politely , looks for PATSY . CAROL squeezes his arm ) To hear you call me Dad . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I did n't call my own father Dad . CAROL NEWQUIST What did you call him ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I did n't call him anything . The occasion never came up . ( Amiably ) I could call you Carol . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Winces ) Look , if it 's this God business that 's bothering you , I 'm willing to be open-minded . I would n't let this on to Marjorie or the kids  --  ( Winks ) I do n't believe in God . But to me it 's not a matter of belief in God . It 's a matter of belief in institutions . I have great belief in institutions . You could n't concede me one Dad ? ( No response ) Not all the time  --  but every once in a while , " Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " REVEREND DUPAS May we proceed ? p. 51 CAROL NEWQUIST " You like some of my tobacco , Dad ? " ( ALFRED tries to free his arm . CAROL hangs on , hisses ) I want an answer ! ( PATSY crosses , kisses CAROL , takes ALFRED away . All take their positions for the ceremony ) REVEREND DUPAS ( In a gentle , folksy manner ) You all know why we 're here . There is often so much sham about this business of marriage . Everyone accepts it . Ritual . That 's why I was so heartened when Alfred asked me to perform this ceremony . He has certain beliefs that I assume you all know . He is an atheist , which is perfectly all right . Really it is . I happen not to be , but inasmuch as this ceremony connotates an abandonment of ritual in the search for truth , I agreed to perform it . First , let me state frankly to you , Alfred , and to you , Patricia , that of the two hundred marriages I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odds are not good . We do n't like to admit it , especially at the wedding ceremony , but it 's in the back of all our minds , is n't it ? How long will it last ? We all think that , do n't we ? We do n't like to bring it out in the open , but we all think that . Well , I say why not bring it out in the open ? Why does one decide to marry ? Social pressure ? Boredom ? Loneliness ? Sexual appeasement ? Um , Love ? I do not put any of these reasons down . Each , in its own way , is adequate . Each is all right . I married a musician last year who wanted to get married in order to stop masturbating . ( Guests stir ) Please do n't be startled . I am not putting it down . That marriage did not work . But the man tried . Now the man is separated , and still masturbating  --  but he is at peace with himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a mistake , it turned out all right . Last month I married a novelist to a painter , with everyone at the wedding under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs . The drug quickened our mental responses but slowed our physical responses . It took two days to perform the ceremony . But never had the words so much meaning . That marriage should last . Still , if it does not  --  well , that will be all right . For , do n't you see , any step that one takes is useful , is positive , has to be positive , because it is part of life . And negation of the previously taken step is positive . It too is part of life . And in this light , and only in this light , should marriage be regarded . As a small , single step . If it works  --  fine ! If it fails  --  fine ! Look elsewhere for satisfaction . Perhaps to more marriages  --  fine ! As many as one likes  --  fine ! To homosexuality  --  fine ! To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each of these is an answer  --  for somebody . For Alfred , today 's answer is Patsy . For Patsy , today 's answer is Alfred . I wo n't put them down for that . So what I implore you both , Alfred and Patricia , to dwell on as I ask the questions required by the State of New York in order to legally bind you  --  sinister phrase , that  --  is that not only are the legal questions I ask you meaningless but so , too , are those inner questions you ask of yourselves meaningless . Failing one 's partner does not matter . Sexual disappointment does not matter . Nothing can hurt if we do not see it as hurtful . Nothing can destroy if we will not see it as destructive . It is all part of life . Part of what we are . So now , Alfred . Do you take Patricia as your lawfully wedded wife , to love  --  whatever that means  --  to honor  --  but is not dishonor , in a sense , a form of honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in prosperity and adversity  --  what nonsense !  --  Forsaking all others  --  what a shocking invasion of privacy ! Rephrase that to more sensibly say : if you choose to have affairs you wo n't feel guilty about them  --  as long as you both shall live  --  or as long as you 're not bored with each other ? p. 52 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Numb ) I do . REVEREND DUPAS So . Patricia . Do you take Alfred here as your lawfully wedded husband , to love  --  that harmful word  --  ca n't we more wisely say : communicate ?  --  to honor  --  meaning , I suppose , you wo n't cut his balls off . Yet some men like that . And to obey  --  well , my very first look at you told me you were not the type to obey , so I went through the thesaurus and came up with these alternatives : to be loyal , to show fealty , to show devotion , to answer the helm  --  general enough , I would think , and still leave plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all the rest of that gobbledegook , as long as you both shall live ? PATSY NEWQUIST ( Struggling to suppress her fury ) I do . REVEREND DUPAS Alfred and Patsy . I know now that whatever you do will be all right . And Patsy 's father , Carol Newquist  --  I 've never heard that name on a man before , but I 'm sure it 's all right  --  I ask you , sir , not to feel guilt over the $250 check you gave me to mention the deity in this ceremony . What you have done is all right . It is part of what you are , what we all are . And I beg you not to be overly perturbed when I do not mention the deity in this ceremony . Betrayal , too , is all right . It is part of what we all are . And Patsy 's brother , Kenneth Newquist , in whose bedroom I spent a few moments earlier this afternoon and whose mother proudly told me the decoration was by your hand entirely : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all right  --  ( KENNY and CAROL , followed by MARJORIE and GUESTS , charge DUPAS . Outraged screams and cries as they mob and beat him . PATSY staggers off as DUPAS , crying " It 's all right , it 's all right , " is driven out the door . CAROL turns on ALFRED and begins to slug away at his body . ALFRED , unflinching , begins to hum ) @x Four hours later . The Newquist apartment is strewn with wedding litter . ALFRED and CAROL have not moved since last scene . They stand in half dark , CAROL sluggishly pounding away at ALFRED , who is humming obviously in a dream world . The phone rings several times . PATSY enters , answers phone  --  amplified breathing . PATSY NEWQUIST ( Into phone ) You 're all we need today . ( Hangs up . To CAROL ) Daddy , you 've been at it for hours . Will you please come away from there ? ( She helps CAROL off . ALFRED does n't move . She reenters , stares a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed and Kenny 's disappeared with my wardrobe . I hope you 're pleased with your day 's work . ( She goes to him ) You can stop daydreaming , Alfred . Nobody 's hitting  --  ( Stops . Takes off wedding glove . Cocks back fist . Holds , undecided . Distant gunshot ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Coming out of trance ) I thought it was a very nice ceremony . ( She drops fist ) A little hokey  --  PATSY NEWQUIST ( Controlling herself ) Alfred ? ( Waves hand in front of his face ) What 's going to become of us if you go on this way ? Were n't you there ? Were n't you listening ? I wanted a wedding ! What in God 's name do you use for feelings ? p. 55 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I feel . PATSY NEWQUIST You do n't feel . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Have it your way . PATSY NEWQUIST There you go again ! You wo n't fight ! ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN You knew I would n't fight before you married me . I did n't realize it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More and more I think it is . If you do n't fight you do n't feel . If you do n't feel you do n't love . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I do n't know  --  PATSY NEWQUIST ( Finishing his sentence ) What love is . Of course you do n't know ! Because you do n't feel . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I feel what I want to feel . PATSY NEWQUIST ( An impulsive kiss ) It 's like kissing white bread . You do n't feel . Alfred , what is it with you ? It gets worse instead of better ! I 've never had a man do this to me before . It 's not just pain you do n't feel , you do n't feel pleasure ! ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I do feel pleasure . PATSY NEWQUIST About what ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN A lot of things . p. 56 PATSY NEWQUIST Name one . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Pause ) My work . PATSY NEWQUIST Name another . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Pause ) Sleeping . PATSY NEWQUIST Work and sleeping ! That 's just great ! What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep better . PATSY NEWQUIST Alfred , do you mean half the things you say ? You must feel something ! ( No response . Snaps her fingers in his face . No response . Holds her head ) Jesus Christ ! ( Very tired ) Alfred , why did you marry me ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Pause ) You 're comfortable . PATSY NEWQUIST I 've never made men comfortable ! I 'm popular because I make them uncertain . You do n't understand the first thing about me ! ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Patsy , you 're screaming . PATSY NEWQUIST Screaming ! You son of a bitch , I 'll tear you limb from limb ! I married you because I wanted to mold you . I loved the man I wanted to mold you into ! But you 're not even there ! How can I mold you if you 're not there ? p. 57 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Everything I say makes you unhappy . We used to get along so well  --  PATSY NEWQUIST Because I did all the talking ! My God ! That 's why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Sure I was . PATSY NEWQUIST Do n't lie , Alfred . I used to stare into those eyes of yours , so warm , so complete with understanding  --  and now I remember where I 've seen those eyes since  --  When my father was hitting you ! That 's the way you look when you 're daydreaming ! ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN You do n't get hurt that way . PATSY NEWQUIST Honey , I do n't want to hurt you . I want to change you . I want to make you see that there is some value in life , that there is some beauty , some tenderness , some things worth reacting to . Some things worth feeling ( Snaps fingers in front of his eyes )  --  Come back here ! I swear , Alfred , nobody is going to kill you . ( Distant gunshots ) But you 've got to take some chances some time ! What do you want out of life ? Just survival ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Nods ) And to take pictures . p. 58 PATSY NEWQUIST Of shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , not enough ! I 'm not going to have a surviving marriage . I 'm going to have a flourishing marriage ! I 'm a woman ! Or , by Jesus , it 's about time I became one . I want a family ! Oh , Christ , Alfred , this is my wedding day . ( Pause . Regains composure ) I want  --  I want to be married to a big , strong , protective , vital , virile , self-assured man . Who I can protect and take care of . Alfred , honey , you 're the first man I 've ever gone to bed with where I did n't feel he was a lot more likely to get pregnant than I was . ( Desperate ) You owe me something ! I 've invested everything I believe in you . You 've got to let me mold you . Please let me mold you . ( Regains control ) You 've got me begging . You 've got me whining , begging and crying . I 've never behaved like this in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out finger ) That 's a tear . I never cried in my life . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Me neither . PATSY NEWQUIST You never cried because you were too terrified of everything to let yourself feel ! You 'd have to learn crying from a manual ! Chop onions ! I never cried because I was too tough  --  but I felt everything . Every slight , every pressure , every vague competition  --  but I fought . And I won ! There has n't been a battle since I was five that I have n't won ! And the people I fought were happy that I won ! Happy ! After a while . Alfred , do you have any idea how many people in this town worship me ? ( To herself , quickly ) Maybe that 's the attraction  --  you do n't worship me . Maybe I 'd quit loving you if you did worship me . Maybe I 'd lose all respect for you if you did all the things I want you to do . ( Thinks about it ) Alfred , you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not saying I 'm better or stronger than you are . It 's just that we  --  you and I  --  have different temperaments . ( Explodes ) And my temperament is better and stronger than yours ! ( No reaction ) You 're a wall ! ( Circles around him ) You do n't fight ! You hardly even listen ! Dear God , will somebody please explain to me why I think you 're so beautiful ? ( Phone rings . She picks it up . Amplified breathing ) Leave me alone ! What do you want out of me ? Will you please leave me alone ? ( ALFRED , startled by outburst , takes phone away . PATSY buries her head in her hands ) p. 59 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Into phone ) She ca n't talk now . ( Hangs up . Distant siren . PATSY brings hands down from her face : all life has been drained out of it ) PATSY NEWQUIST ( Empty ) Alfred , it 's all shit . How come I never noticed before ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Patsy  --  PATSY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just dense . I 'm the one who does n't feel . It 's all terrible . Terrible . Terrible . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Come on , Patsy . PATSY NEWQUIST ( Empty ) No more reason for anything . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Uncomfortable , weakly ) Mrs. Newquist ! PATSY NEWQUIST ( Flat ) The only true feeling is no feeling . The only way to survive . You 're one hundred percent right . Hold my hand . ( ALFRED backs away . PATSY drops hand ) I 'm sorry I 'm not this weak , really . You know how tough I am . I 'll be just as tough again , I promise . I just have to learn to be tough about shit . And I will . ( ALFRED backs off to a chair ) p. 60 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I feel weak . PATSY NEWQUIST ( Flat ) Alfred , we ca n't both feel weak at the same time . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Patsy , you 're beginning to get me nervous . You have to listen to me for a minute  --  PATSY NEWQUIST ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything is the way you say . ( Begins to withdraw ) You sit . ( Sits ) You get old . ( Freezes ) You die . ( Stares as if in one of ALFRED 's daydreams . ALFRED goes to her . Touches her head . No reaction . Lifts her arm . It drops limply to her side . He stares at her horrified , then goes into his daydream stare . He slides into the chair opposite hers . Both stare blankly into space . Phone rings . Many rings . ALFRED finally rises , crosses to phone , numbly lifts it . Amplified breathing ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Dazed , into phone ) Thanks . I 'm up . ( Hangs up . Stares thoughtfully at PATSY . Then , slowly , deliberately ) During Korea  --  I was in school then  --  the government could n't decide whether I was a security risk or not  --  I wore a beard  --  so they put a mail check on me . ( Passes a hand in front of her eyes . No reaction ) Every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be bent . Corners torn . Never sealed correctly . Like they did n't give a damn whether I knew they were reading my mail or not . I was more of a militant in those days , so I decided to fight fire with fire . I began writing letters to the guy who was reading my mail . I addressed them to myself , of course , but inside they went something like : " Dear Sir : I am not that different from you . All men are brothers . Tomorrow , instead of reading my mail in that dark , dusty hall , why not bring it upstairs where we can check it out together . " I never got an answer . So I wrote a second letter . " Dear Sir : There are no heroes , no villains , no good guys , no bad guys . The world is more complicated than that . Come on up where we can open a couple of beers and talk it all out . " ( Checks PATSY . No reaction ) Again no answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been thinking too much of my own problems , too little of yours . Yours can not be a happy task  --  reading another man 's mail . It 's dull , unimaginative . A job  --  and let 's not mince words  --  for a hack . Yet , I wonder  --  can this be the way you see yourself ? Do you see yourself as a hack ? Do you see yourself as the office slob ? Have you ever wondered why they stuck you with this particular job , instead of others who have less seniority ? Or was it , do you think , that your supervisor looked around the office to see who he 'd stick for the job , saw you and said , No one will miss him for a month ! " ( Checks PATSY ) That letter never got delivered to me . So then I wrote : " Dear Friend : Just a note to advise  --  you may retain my letters as long as you deem fit . Reread them . Study them . Think them out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Who , at this very moment , is sitting at your desk , reading your mail ? I do not say this to be cruel , but because I am the only one left you can trust  --  " No answer . But , the next day a man , saying he was from the telephone company , showed up  --  no complaint had been made  --  to check the phone . Shaky hands . Bloodshot eyes . A small quaver in the voice . And as he dismembered my phone he said , " Look . What nobody understands is that everybody has his job to do . I got my job . In this case it 's repairing telephones . I like it or I do n't like it , but it 's my job . If I had another job  --  say , for example , with the F.B.I . or someplace , putting in a wiretap , for example , or reading a guy 's mail  --  like it or do n't like it , it would be my job ! Has anyone got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wrote one more letter  --  expressing my deep satisfaction that he and I had at last made contact , and informing him that the next time he came , say , to read the meter , I had valuable information , photostats , recordings , names and dates , about the conspiracy against him . This letter showed up a week after I mailed it , in a crumpled , grease-stained , and Scotch-taped envelope . The letter itself was torn in half and then clumsily glued together again . In the margin , on the bottom , in large , shaky letters was written the word : " Please ! " I was n't bothered again . It was after this that I began to wonder : If they 're that unformidable , why bother to fight back ? ( PATSY stirs ) It 's very dangerous to challenge a system unless you 're completely at peace with the thought that you 're not going to miss it when it collapses . Patsy  --  You ca n't be the one to change . ( PATSY stares , uncomprehending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 61 PATSY NEWQUIST ( Tired ) Alfred , what are you talking about ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN When I first met you I remember thinking , this is the most formidable person I have ever known . I do n't stand a chance ! I 'll try to stay the way I am . I 'll try desperately ! ( Happily ) But I do n't stand a chance ! It 's only a matter of time . Very soon now I 'll be ( Smiles )  --  different . I 'll be able to look at half-empty glasses of water and say , This glass is n't half empty . This glass is half full ! You ca n't be the one to sell out . I was supposed to sell out . ( Stares miserably at the disheveled , slumped-over PATSY he 's created ) Why does n't somebody beat me up now ? ( Starts off ) I 'm going out to Central park ! ( He exits ) PATSY NEWQUIST ( Watches him go . Slowly straightens ) Alfred  --  Come back here ! ( A long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens when you start fooling around with the rules ? ( Recovering , holds out her arms ) It begins with weddings and it ends with  --  well , there 's no telling where it ends . ( More affirmative ) There are reasons for doing things the old way . ( With growing assurance she takes his hands ) Do n't look for trouble and trouble wo n't look for you . ( Very strong ) I do n't say there are n't problems but you have to fight . You are going to fight . ( Squeezes her arms around him ) Starting now . Is that right ? ( Pause . Finally he nods ) And you are going to feel . Starting right now . Is that right ? ( Pause . He finally nods ) I do n't want a nod . I want an answer . Say " Yes , Patsy. " p. 62 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Yes , Patsy . PATSY NEWQUIST Yes , Patsy , what ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Yes , Patsy  --  I 'm going to feel . PATSY NEWQUIST Starting when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . PATSY NEWQUIST Starting when ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Starting now . PATSY NEWQUIST And what 's your first feeling ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN It 's sort of distant . PATSY NEWQUIST Do n't be ashamed of it . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN It 's worship . PATSY NEWQUIST Of God ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Of you . PATSY NEWQUIST You 're doing fine . ( Kisses him . Puts her arms around him ) My lover . ( Kisses him ) My hero ! ( Kisses him . ALFRED tentatively responds . Embrace builds . CAROL and MARJORIE enter . React with warm surprise . They put their arms around each other ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST Are n't they an attractive couple ? ( Sound of gunshot . Window shatters . Explosion of blood as PATSY 's hand flies up to her head . She drops . CAROL and MARJORIE freeze . ALFRED stares down at PATSY , then melting into his daydream pose , slowly turns away . The street noise is loud through the shattered window ) p. 63 Blackout p. 64 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 The Newquist apartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackout drapes cover the windows . Large photographic blowups of PATSY 's eyes , nose , hair , smiling lips and teeth are hung unframed on the walls , and are in evidence in several two- and three-foot high stacks on the floor . ( These pictures can be premounted on the reverse sides of the molded sections of the walls and pivoted about during the scene change . ) ALFRED is bent over a small photo stand , shooting away with a camera , humming to himself . He looks happy . Sporadic gunfire is heard in the background . He pays no attention . Doorbell . ALFRED takes a quick last look at the work on the stand , goes to the door , detouring past the couch to pick up a long cardboard carton and shove it out of sight under the couch . He has the beginnings of a black eye . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN One minute . ( He checks through keyhole and unlocks door . There are now four different kinds of locks and bolts on door , including a police bar ) One more minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEWQUIST ( Enters carrying bulging brief case ) It 's murder out there . ( ALFRED tries to relieve him of brief case . CAROL brusquely pushes him aside ) p. 65 ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Hey , Dad , you 're limping ! CAROL NEWQUIST ( Shouts ) How many times have I told you not to call me Dad ! ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I ca n't call you " Dad . " I ca n't call you " Carol . " What can I call you ? " Dear " ? ( Long exchange of stares , ALFRED 's good-humored , CAROL 's sullen ) CAROL NEWQUIST Call me " Mr. Newquist . " ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN You 're just in a bad mood , Dad . Let me fix you a drink . ( Crosses to bar ) CAROL NEWQUIST ( Sits ) I do n't want you to fix me  --  Bourbon . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Serving drink ) The family that drinks together sinks together . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Drinks ) Maybe I 'd feel better if you turned on the air conditioner . It blots out the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's here to stay . I might as well get used to it . ( Conspiratorial ) I dropped by police headquarters this afternoon . That 's why I 'm late . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Are you late ? p. 66 CAROL NEWQUIST ( Annoyed ) Yes , I 'm late ! I 'm four hours late . I told you I 'd be finished with my deliveries at one . Any calls ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN The breather , once or twice . He 's picking up the pace again . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Mutters ) Asthmatic bastard ! ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I never told you , but the day after Patsy died he rang up . I went a little crazy  --  I started screaming , " Did n't you hear the news ? No need to call any more ! Patsy 's dead ! " In no more than ten seconds , he called back . And he spoke ! He said , " I do n't know what to say . I 'm terribly sorry . " And then before hanging up he said , " What can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another breath out of him until this week . In mourning , I suppose . CAROL NEWQUIST You sure it 's the same one ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN You think we 're on a mailing list ? God , I hope it 's the same one . CAROL NEWQUIST This damned business ! ( Conspiratorial ) Keep this under you hat  --  but I paid an unexpected call on police headquarters this afternoon . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I 'm surprised they did n't shoot you . p. 67 CAROL NEWQUIST They did shoot me . ( Rubs his leg ) It was my own damned fault . I did n't give the password . ( Hands empty glass to ALFRED , who pours drink ) I feel sorry for those poor bastards . I know a lot of them by their first names . I call them Jimmy , and Mac and Phil . They call me Carol . ( Quickly ) It sounds different when they say it . I had a fifteen-minute talk with Lieutenant Practice . Busy as hell but he found fifteen minutes to talk to me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN What conspiracy ? CAROL NEWQUIST Three hundred and forty-five unsolved murders in six months . There 's got to be a conspiracy ! ( ALFRED shrugs ) There 's got to be some logic behind all this . Any other calls ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN You mean orders ? No . CAROL NEWQUIST I have to admit to you these new pictures are really catching on ! Fifty orders of Patsy Number Seven last week , ten orders so far this week of Patsy Number Eight and Fifteen , and five orders from an uptown gallery for the entire Patsy series . ( Thickly ) We would n't have come through this without you , Alfred . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Shrugs ) I had to do something after I abandoned my shit series . p. 68 CAROL NEWQUIST ( Emotional ) But you did n't have to put me to work . Nobody asked . ( Suddenly defensive ) I did n't ask  --  ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN You 're a top-notch salesman , Dad . CAROL NEWQUIST I 'm an order taker and a messenger boy . But when I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time . CAROL NEWQUIST Who knows if they 'll even want me back at the office . Six months  --  ( Shakes his head ) You 've been very good  --  to us . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Forget it . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Nods ) I 'll do that . ( A pained sigh ) I wish I resented you less . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Keep up the fight , tiger . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Sadly ) Patsy used to call me tiger . Everything you say these days reminds me of Patsy . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Thoughtful , a little sad ) I owe Patsy a lot . ( Cheerful again ) Why should n't I talk like her ? p. 69 CAROL NEWQUIST Just as long as you do n't dress like her . Where 's Kenny ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN In her closet . CAROL NEWQUIST Little son of a bitch ! Christ , I hope it 's only a phase . I do n't see where that Doctor Harm is helping any  --  ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Doctor Good . CAROL NEWQUIST Yeah ? Well , I suppose he must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidding . ( Depressed ) Agh  --  I do n't understand anything any more . You know how I get through the day ?  --  do n't say a word of this to Marjorie  --  in planned segments . I get up in the morning and I think , Okay , a sniper did n't get me for breakfast , let 's see if I can go for my morning walk without being mugged . Okay , I finished my walk , let 's see if I can make it back home without having a brick dropped on my head from the top of a building . Okay , I 'm safe in the lobby , let 's see if I can go up in the elevator without getting a knife in my ribs . Okay , I made it to the front door , let 's see if I can open it without finding burglars in the hall . Okay , I made it to the hall , let 's see if I can walk into the living room and not find the rest of my family dead . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight , tiger . p. 70 CAROL NEWQUIST You do enough fighting for one family . Where 'd you get that eye ? ( He indicates ALFRED 's mouse ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Some kid was staring at me in the park . I hit him . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Tired ) Another fight ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN What could I do ? The little bastard was staring at me ! ( CAROL turns away in disgust . Placating ) I beat the crap out of him  --  ( CAROL reluctantly smiles . ALFRED starts to spar with him ) Let 's go a couple of quick ones , tiger . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Retreating ) Come on . Cut it out . Cut it out . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Sparring ) Pow ! Pow ! Pow ! Boy if Patsy could have only been there ! ( Mimes a wicked kick ) And she said I did n't feel . Every time I get into one of these things , I think of her  --  I think of her alive and me coming home weary , every night  --  you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me at the door , looking up at me with eyes full of pride , and she takes my swollen fists in her hands , and she kisses my knuckles  --  what a dream . Why is it we only learn when it 's too late ? ( Spars ) Pow ! Pow ! It was my fourth fight this week . I suppose all that euphoria takes something out of you . Anyhow , I got very faint , so I sat down on a park bench to rest  --  and I found this lying there . ( He holds up the Daily News ) p. 71 CAROL NEWQUIST ( Reading ) " Hippie Minister Slain at Church Happening . " They 're sure giving that son of a bitch a hell of a lot of free publicity ! ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN It was n't so much the story that interested me . I do n't have the patience for facts , or any of that nonsense any more . What interested me was ( Shows CAROL newspaper ) this photograph of the body  --  what does it look like ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes closed . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Excited ) No ! Look closer ! ( He raises newspaper to CAROL 's face ) CAROL NEWQUIST What do I want to look for ? This is the silliest  --  ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Do n't you see the dots ? CAROL NEWQUIST What dots ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Here ! The little black dots that make up the photograph . Use your eyes , Dad ! CAROL NEWQUIST ( Pushes paper away ) Okay . I see them ! So what ! ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Keep staring at them . ( Raises paper closer to CAROL 's face ) You see how they slowly begin to move ? ( Takes paper away from CAROL ) I was sitting on the park bench looking at this photograph of the body and the little black dots began to break apart  --  they began detaching themselves from the body  --  the dots that make up his eyes  --  the little black dots that make up his mouth  --  and the top of his head  --  they just lifted off his body  --  and broke apart . Until it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but millions of little black dots coming at me until I thought I was going to be sucked in alive . I panicked ! I wanted to close off ! But then I thought , Wait a minute , that 's the old you , the pre-Patsy you . So I let go and I was swallowed . Into a free-floating constellation of dots . Fantastic ! I swung my eyes away from the photograph  --  I looked up at a tree . Do you know how many trillions of dots there are in one Central Park tree ? And then the dots that made up the tree merged with the dots that made up the sky merged with the dots that made up the park bench and the grass and the dirt path and the three colored kids walking toward me carrying bicycle chains . Do you know the wild arrangement of dots that 's made every time you punch somebody out ? Those poor kids must 've thought I was crazy  --  humming as I beat their heads against the sidewalk . ( Offstage muffled shot ) I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a way of decomposing everything into dots . p. 72 CAROL NEWQUIST I do n't know why you want to fool around . We 're doing extremely well with our current line . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN There gets to be something ultimately stifling about taking photographs of old photographs . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Reasonably ) You enlarge them . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN It 's limited ! I want to do life ! If I could somehow make people see themselves as trillions upon trillions of free-wheeling , interchanging dots  --  ( Loses himself in thought . CAROL shakes his head , says nothing . Doorbell . ALFRED puts an arm on CAROL 's shoulder and goes to door ) One minute . ( Looks through peephole . Begins the process of unlocking the door ) One more minute . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Enters , flushed , carrying leaking shopping bag ) Will you look at this mess ? They shot a hole in my shopping bag . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Stricken ) You could have been killed ! MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Annoyed ) I get shot at every day . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it is . ( To ALFRED ) I saw that nice Lieutenant Practice in the lobby . He looks simply awful . I invited him up for coffee just as soon as he gets finished investigating the new murder . p. 73 CAROL NEWQUIST What new murder ? MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Bored ) I do n't know . It 's in the other wing . ( ALFRED reaches under couch and slides out long carton he concealed at start of scene . It is not the box he intended to pull out . He slides it back and reaches for a smaller box , which he hands to MARJORIE ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Mom . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Opens box ) Alfred . Oh , Alfred ! ( Removes flowers ) Are n't they beautiful ! Look , Carol , they 're flowers ! ( Clutches them to her . Cries ) I 'm sorry  --  there is so little thought left of giving today that I 've forgotten how to receive . ( Drops flowers . Rushes offstage , holding her hands to her face . Offstage ) Kenny ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door slams . KENNY camps in , wearing dark glasses , carrying Vogue . CAROL , who can not look at him , exits . KENNY sees flowers on floor . He picks them up ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN You want ' em ? KENNY NEWQUIST ( Drops flowers ) What do I want with your fruity flowers ? ( ALFRED returns to camera stand . MARJORIE enters ) p. 74 MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Staring down at flowers ) Alfred , you are a love . ( ALFRED , distracted , waves from camera stand ) When I was twelve-and-a-half my mother and father would cart the whole pack of us out to the country and we would always picnic near the flowers . There were so many more flowers in those days . We 'd pick every last one and bring it back to the city . ( To KENNY as she stoops for flowers ) No one does the cleaning up around here except me . ( Doorbell . KENNY starts for door ) I 'll get it . ( KENNY spots protruding edge of the carton under the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer and turn your face into the light please ? ( She checks peephole , starts to unlock door . KENNY slides out carton , is about to lift lid ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Still peering into camera on stand ) That 's  --  not  --  a  --  good  --  idea  --  KENNY NEWQUIST ( Whirls ) Who died and made you boss ? ( Shot splinters window near KENNY 's head just as LIEUTENANT PRACTICE enters . KENNY shakes fist at window , screams ) Fags ! MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( To PRACTICE ) You 'll have to pardon the mess . p. 75 CAROL NEWQUIST ( Enters , glances over to KENNY at window , hurries over to PRACTICE , shakes his hand ) Well , well , well . This is an unexpected pleasure . Alfred , look who 's decided to pay us a visit . Lieutenant Practice ! ( ALFRED , at work , gives a perfunctory wave of hand . CAROL whispers ) He 's working . Goes on day and night . It 's no accident he 's successful . LIEUTENANT PRACTICE And I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm ) I did n't mean that . You 're making great strides . Nobody expects very much anyway . ( PRACTICE draws arm away ) Nobody 's complaining . MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Cheerful ) We certainly have n't complained . And if anyone has a right to  --  LIEUTENANT PRACTICE ( Sad ) Can I please have a glass of milk , Mrs. Newquist ? ( He sits down ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST Of course , dear . LIEUTENANT PRACTICE And a cookie . Jeez , I 'm depressed . There 's got to be some logical explanation to all of this . ( MARJORIE exits ) p. 76 CAROL NEWQUIST You 've got nothing to be ashamed of . You 'll figure it out . LIEUTENANT PRACTICE ( Hands CAROL envelope ) I really stopped by to return this . I do n't know what got into me this afternoon . CAROL NEWQUIST ( Looks nervously around ) It 's all right . It 's yours ! Forget it ! LIEUTENANT PRACTICE I ca n't accept a $250 check . I know your heart was in the right place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not gon na make us find your daughter 's murderer any quicker . CAROL NEWQUIST Keep it ! Keep it ! You never can tell  --  MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Enters with glass of milk ) Drink this . You 'll feel better . Carol , are you giving money away again ? You know , Lieutenant , every time we pass a policeman he hands him five dollars . CAROL NEWQUIST I just want the boys on the beat to know somebody still has faith in them . LIEUTENANT PRACTICE ( Drinks ) I needed this . ( ALFRED slides carton back under couch ; KENNY watches with interest . PRACTICE examines hand holding glass . It has a tremor ) I was n't like this when I met you six months ago , was I ? Was n't I a lot more self-confident ? Jeez , the way I used to enter the scene of a crime ! Like I owned the Goddamned world ! Can you put a little Scotch in this milk , please ? And a piece of cheese on this cookie ? There 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred and forty-five murders and none of them get solved . ( Angry ) Somebody has to be elected fall guy ! ( Accepts drink ) Thank you . Maybe a piece of ice like a good fellow . ( Hands drink back ) Somewhere there 's a logical pattern to this whole business . There has to be . ( Accepts cookie ) I did n't ask for butter on the cookie , just cheese . ( Hands cookie back ) Thank you . And these damned vigilante groups  --  they 're not helping matters . Black against white . White against black . What ever became of human dignity ? ( Accepts drink ) Oh , for Christ sakes , only one piece of ice ? Let 's get it right , huh ? Say , what kind of cheese is this ? Sharp cheddar ? You ought to know by now with my stomach I ca n't take sharp cheddar ! Come on ! Will you shape up ? ( Reflective ) Sooner or later there 's a pattern . Sooner or later everything falls into place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would n't want to wake up to see the sun tomorrow morning . ( CAROL and MARJORIE scrambling from different directions with drink and cheese ) Is this what I asked for ? Goddamnit , I want some cooperation ! ( A shot  --  milk glass explodes in his hand . All except PRACTICE stare toward window . He stares at remnant of glass in his hand ) Every crime has its own pattern of logic . Everything has an order . If we ca n't find that order it 's not because it does n't exist , but only because we 've incorrectly observed some vital piece of evidence . Let us examine the evidence . ( Places glass in handkerchief , handkerchief in pocket ) Number one . In the last six months three hundred and forty-five homicides have been committed in this city . The victims have ranged variously in sex , age , social status and color . Number two . In none of the three hundred and forty-five homicides have we been able to establish motive . Number three . All three hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much for the evidence . A subtle pattern begins to emerge . What is this pattern ? What is it that each of these three hundred and forty-five homicides have in common ? They have in common three things : a ) that they have nothing in common ; b ) that they have no motive ; c ) that , consequently , they remain unsolved . The pattern becomes clearer . Orthodox police procedure dictates that the basic question you ask in all such investigations is : 1 ) who has the most to gain ? What could possibly be the single unifying motive behind three hundred and forty-five unconnected homicides ? When a case does not gel it is often not because we lack the necessary facts , but because we have observed our facts incorrectly . In each of these three hundred and forty-five homicides we observed our facts incorrectly . Following normal routine we looked for a cause . And we could find no cause . Had we looked for effect we would have had our answer that much sooner . What is the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is loss of faith in law-enforcement personnel . That is our motive . The pattern is complete . We are involved here in a far-reaching conspiracy to undermine respect for our basic beliefs and most sacred institutions . Who is behind this conspiracy ? Once again ask the question : Who has the most to gain ? People in high places . Their names would astound you . People in low places . Concealing their activities beneath a cloak of poverty . People in all walks of life . Left wing and right wing . Black and white . Students and scholars . A conspiracy of such ominous proportions that we may not know the whole truth in our lifetime , and we will never be able to reveal all the facts . We are readying mass arrests . ( Rises to leave ) I 'm going to try my best to see that you people get every possible break . If there is any information you wish to volunteer at this time it will be held in the strictest confidence . ( Waits for response . There is none . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against any of you trying to leave town . ( Quickly exits ) p. 77 CAROL NEWQUIST ( Gradually exploding ) What 's left ? What 's there left ? I 'm a reasonable man . Just explain to me what I have left to believe in . I swear to God the tide 's rising ! Two hundred and fifty dollars . Gim me , gim me . We need honest cops ! People just are n't being protected any more ! We need a revival of honor . And trust ! We need the Army ! We need a giant fence around every block in the city . An electrically charged fence . And everyone who wants to leave the block has to have a pass . And a haircut . And ca n't talk with a filthy mouth ! We need respect for a man 's reputation . TV cameras ! That 's what we need ! In every building lobby , in every elevator , in every apartment , in every room . Public servants who are public servants ! And if they catch you doing anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the door and beat the living  --  A return to common sense ! We have to have lobotomies for anyone who earns less than ten thousand a year . I do n't like it but it 's an emergency . Our side needs weapons too . Is it fair that they should have all the weapons ? We 've got to train ourselves ! And steel ourselves ! It 's freedom I 'm talking about ! There 's a fox loose in the chicken coop ! Kill him ! I want my freedom ! ( He collapses ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Let 's get him inside . ( ALFRED and MARJORIE carry CAROL off . KENNY watches after them , quickly crosses to box , slides it out and lifts lid as MARJORIE enters . KENNY slams down lid . MARJORIE grabs bottle from bar and exits . KENNY lifts rifle out of box , goes to window , parts curtain slightly , aims  --  ALFRED enters . KENNY , startled , holds rifle out to him ) p. 78 KENNY NEWQUIST I thought it was more flowers . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it for ? I 've only been in analysis four months . I 've never fired one of these in my life . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Me too . KENNY NEWQUIST ( Suspicious ) Why 'd you get it ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Shrugs ) It was on sale . ( Stares at rifle in KENNY 's hands . Goes to door , relocks it . To KENNY ) Put it away  --  ( KENNY begins to ) No . ( ALFRED crosses to KENNY , takes rifle , studies it ) You notice , if you stare at it long enough it breaks into dots ? KENNY NEWQUIST ( Studies rifle ) No  --  ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Turns rifle in his hand ) Trillions of dots  --  ( Pulls trigger . A loud click ) It 's not loaded . ( Puts it down ) KENNY NEWQUIST Why do n't you load it ? ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN I do n't know how . ( Hands rifle to KENNY , who backs away from it ) p. 79 KENNY NEWQUIST ( Shakes his head ) The Army rejected me four times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again they 'd have me arrested . ( Reaches into box . Takes out instruction booklet , turns page , reads ) " Nomenclature . " ( Turns page ) " Trigger housing group . " ( Turns page ) " To load : hold the weapon by the forearm of the stock with left hand . Rotate the safety to its on position . Lock the bolt open . With right hand insert the magazine into the magazine opening and push up . " MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Enters . Looks over ALFRED 's shoulder as he struggles to insert magazine clip ) I do n't know about these things dear , but I found the best way to deal with the unfamiliar is to think things back to their source . ( She takes rifle out of his hands ) Now , it would seem to me that this goes in  --  ( Struggles . CAROL enters . Observes ) Damn it ! They must have given you the wrong  --  ( CAROL takes rifle out of her hands . expertly loads it , tosses it to ALFRED . MARJORIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle back to CAROL ) Go on , Dad . You loaded it . You go first . p. 80 CAROL NEWQUIST ( Solemnly hands rifle back ) It 's yours . KENNY NEWQUIST Where 'd you learn that , Dad ? It 's a trick , right ? ( CAROL stares scornfully at KENNY , takes rifle . ALFRED parts curtains ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Can you see well enough ? ( CAROL aims , fires ) KENNY NEWQUIST I think you got somebody . MARJORIE NEWQUIST Let me see ! I never can see ! ( ALFRED boosts her ) Yes ! Yes ! Somebody 's lying there ! CAROL NEWQUIST ( To ALFRED ) Why do n't you try your luck ? ( Hands over rifle ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Hands rifle to KENNY ) You first , Kenny . KENNY NEWQUIST Gee . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Reassuring ) I 'll go right after you . ( KENNY quickly gets up with rifle . Fires out window ) CAROL NEWQUIST Miss ! KENNY NEWQUIST You made me nervous ! You were looking ! p. 81 CAROL NEWQUIST ( Takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No fair ! You shook my arm . ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Let him have another shot . ( KENNY aims carefully , fires ) CAROL NEWQUIST ( Looking into street . Very proud ) Son of a bitch ! MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Hugs him ) You did it ! You did it ! ( CAROL reloads , hands rifle to ALFRED ) KENNY NEWQUIST ( Cool , manly ) Dad I got our two . ( CAROL puts his arm around KENNY 's shoulder . ALFRED aims out window , fires ) CAROL NEWQUIST You know who I think he got ? MARJORIE NEWQUIST Lieutenant Practice ! ( All jump up and down in self-congratulations  --  ad lib shouts , Texas yells . ALFRED , CAROL and KENNY in unison ; none of the following is intelligible ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN Fantastic ! What a picture ! Unbelievable ! Fantastic ! What a picture ! CAROL NEWQUIST Some hell of a team , eh , boys ! Now we 're moving ! Now we 'll show ' em ! Show the whole Goddamn world ! p. 82 KENNY NEWQUIST Son of a bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son of a bitch ! Goddamn ! See me , Alfred ? ( During all of this MARJORIE has made a sprightly exit , instantly reentering , wheeling serving cart . She lights candles on dining-room table ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST Come an ' git it ! ( The others , wrestling , horsing around , move slowly toward table ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST Boys ! ( Admist great noise , bustle , serving of drinks , they finally sit . More ad lib cries , friendly shoving ) ALFRED CHAMBERLAIN ( Over the others ) Hey , how about Mom trying her luck after dinner ? ( Cheers , ad lib agreement ) MARJORIE NEWQUIST ( Serving ) It 's so nice to have my family laughing again . You know , for a while I was really worried .
