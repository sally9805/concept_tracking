THE BRIGADIER AND THE GOLF WIDOW by John Cheever. 275 pages . Harper &; Row . $4.95 . <P> Lazing beside the Westerhazys ' green pool one Sunday afternoon , Neddy Merrill decides to swim home . It pleases him to imagine that his neighbors ' swimming pools form the course of a broad river winding through fertile fields to the grounds of his own fine house . He names the river after his wife Lucinda and sets out at a choppy crawl . At the Grahams ' he is given a drink , and at the Bunkers ' , where a pool party is going on , he gets another . " Oh , how bonny and lush were the banks of the Lucinda River ! Prosperous men and women gathered by the sapphire-colored waters , while caterers ' men in white coats passed them cold gin . " <P> But the afternoon turns cold , Neddy tires , and beyond the difficult portage of Route 424 he begins to see odd un-familiarities that are not on his mental map . The lawns of friends are weed-grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the hostess , who is a social inferior , snubs him . Someone offers a word of sympathy for Neddy 's financial troubles , and Neddy , vaguely uneasy , can not recall that he has any . Chilled , and more tired than seems reasonable , he doggedly swims the last leg of his trip and hurries home to his wife and four tennis-playing daughters . They are gone : the house is locked and empty , and it is obvious that no one has lived there for a long time . <P> Real Edges . The story is typical of one preoccupation of John Cheever ( TIME cover , March 27 ) : the prosperous suburbanite who turns an unsuspected corner and falls off the edge of things into outer darkness . In synopsis , the occult shading of these stories can seem affected , but Cheever is persuasive . His edges are real , and the corners that one turns to reach them seem very near . <P> Kafka evokes the terror of a citizen forced by a faceless and brutalizing state to stand trial for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that of citizens richly and pointlessly rewarded by an equally faceless society . Unsupported by arrogance of family or formal rank , equipped with no irreplaceable skill , the well-to-do suburbanite wonders vaguely and passionately why he deserves the country clubs , the trips to Bermuda and the swimming pools . More sharply , he wonders how long it will last . Will the money stop ? Will the unpredictable demons of alimony or Internal Revenue turn treacherous ? The sickness unto death is not the artisan 's fear that his arm will go lame ; the suburbanite arm could not earn him the price of his quinine water . It is a less specific and less bearable fear : there are gods to be appeased , and the suburbanite has forgotten even their names .
