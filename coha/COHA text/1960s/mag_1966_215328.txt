When his commander ordered his decimated squadron to withdraw from the Battle of Copenhagen , Admiral Nelson clapped a telescope to his blind eye , exclaiming : " I really do not see the signal ! " He ended , of course , by winning the battle . His namesake , New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller , can also affect a blind eye when he chooses , and so far it has served him well . <P> Six months ago , for example , after he had pushed through New York 's first state sales tax , every opinion poll had Rockefeller on the rocks . Party leaders even threatened mutiny if he should be so overbearing as to seek reelection in 1966 . Today , blind as ever to the signals , Rocky gives every indication of being well on his way toward a third four-year term . <P> His success comes partly from default . A strong Democrat , perhaps , could topple him in November . Yet a strong candidate appears the least likely choice of the bitterly divided Democratic Party . Though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious political liabilities : <P> &gt; Frank O'Connor , 56 , New York 's city council president , seemed the odds-on favorite after an impressive victory in the city election last November , but has since lost ground by petty partisan bickering with Republican Mayor John Lindsay , and , in any event , carries little weight outside New York City . <P> &gt; Eugene Nickerson , 47 , chief executive of Long Island 's populous Nassau County , promises-with phrases and gestures borrowed from John Kennedy - to make New York " first " again , but to date has made little impact beyond his own bailiwick . <P> - Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. , 51 , now chairman of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , longs for the job his father once had , but has not yet convinced party leaders that he is remotely equal to that opportunity . <P> Of several Democratic dark horses , the brightest is Representative Samuel Stratton , 49 , an aggressive campaigner who has repeatedly beaten the G.O.P. in a traditionally Republican district , and would likely give Rockefeller the toughest race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic senatorial nomination in 1964 to Robert Ken nedy , whose subsequent election made him the party 's top panjandrum in the state , Stratton 's hopes of organization endorsement are slim . According to some readings , in fact , Kennedy would rather see Rockefeller win again in 1966 than have a strong Democratic Governor to challenge his control of New York 's delegations to the 1968 and 1972 Democratic conventions . <P> The Governor , meanwhile , is cruising around the state as if the election were tomorrow , and looks hardier day by day . Though unloved for imposing the highest state taxes in the nation , he can point to an impressive record . During the eight years of Rockefeller rule , New York has made bold , pioneering advances in housing , education and conservation . Putting the telescope to his other eye , Nelson Rockefeller will undoubtedly descry the Great Society within the Empire State .
