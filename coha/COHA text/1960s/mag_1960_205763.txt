Like many another U.S. millionaire , William Black , president of Chock Full O ' Nuts Corp. , has discovered one of the true pleasures of hard work and good fortune . Last week short , chunky Bill Black gave $5,000,000 to Columbia University toward an 18-story medical-research building . It was the largest gift from a living person ever received by Columbia . Said Black : " I have found that there is a tremendous joy in giving . It is a very important part of the joy of living . " Brooklyn-born Bill Black had no such joys when he worked his way through Columbia by loading potatoes in a waterfront market . He could barely afford nickel meals of bread pudding . But after graduation ( 1920 ) , he took to selling nuts in a cubbyhole Times Square shop , soon had 18 stores . When the Depression killed nut sales , Black shrewdly converted the stores to lunch bars , featuring coffee and nutted-cheese sandwiches . Today his 28 New York-area restaurants serve 125,000 customers daily , add up to a $30 million-a-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 ' Nuts coffee in 14 states . Black now lives on a New Rochelle estate formerly owned by Millionaire Tommy Manville , and is married to Singer Jean Martin , who once warbled " heavenly coffee " Chock Full O ' Nuts TV commercials . <P> Black is so generous with his 1,000 employees , whose personnel manager is onetime Brooklyn Dodger Jackie Robinson , that he gives them 10% of his profits as a Christmas bonus . But his big-scale generosity began in 1957 , when his chief company auditor contracted Parkinson 's disease , joining 1,500,000 other U.S. victims . Black promptly launched the Parkinson 's Disease Foundation . He has given the foundation $250,000-just part of the total $1,000,000 that he had already given to medical causes before his outright gift to Columbia . <P> Where Black got that much ready cash is partly explained by a comfortable business transaction that he made in 1958 . Black converted Chock Full O ' Nuts from private ownership to public by selling 400,000 shares of the 720,000 he owned ( out of 800,000 outstanding ) at $15 a share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neat $3,800,000 . He still owns 33-5% of the stock , which was listed last week on the New York Stock Exchange at $46.50 a share . In his philanthropy , Black shows no less financial hustle . The one string he attached to his Columbia gift is a stipulation that the Parkinson 's Disease Foundation get all the interest on the $5,000,000 until Columbia gets to work on the new medical building . Since delay means a sizable loss to Columbia ( at least $175,000 yearly ) , the university hopes to start construction immediately . Says Philanthropist Black : " I want to see with my own eyes the results of my good intentions . "
