txt President Johnson 's plan to set up a central agency for the " environmental sciences " could do for the earth what NASA has done for space . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration brought the national effort to explore space and develop space flight to a powerful focus . The proposed Environmental Science Service Administration ( ESSA ) could likewise concentrate much of the effort to understand and forecast weather , earthquakes , and tidal waves , and to explore and exploit the sea . Weather a target The budget of ESSA probably would not reach the $5 billion height of that of NASA . But it could grow to be very substantial . The challenges and opportunities the new agency would face are vast . In terms of foreseeable practical benefits , they far outweigh anything the manned space flight program is likely to produce for decades . For example , ESSA might be able to mount a far bigger program to develop long-range weather forecasting than the Weather Bureau can , with its limited budget . It has been estimated that a practical long-range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year to the American gross national product . ESSA would be formed by merging the Weather Bureau , the Coast and Geodetic Survey , and the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards . Its formation is proposed as an administrative reorganization plan . This means that it will automatically go into effect if there is no congressional objection within 60 days . A national focus ' ESSA would be part of the Department of Commerce . It would be headed by a presidentially appointed administrator . The offices of chief of the Weather Bureau and director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey would be abolished . In announcing his plan Thursday , President Johnson said , " The new administration will . . . provide a single national focus to describe , understand , and predict the state of the oceans , the state of the lower and upper atmosphere , and the size and shape of the earth . " This is a very large order . To accomplish it means establishing a worldwide network of automatic observing stations on land and sea . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This in turn means joining an international program to observe weather and the sea on a global scale . The groundwork for this is already being laid by the Weather Bureau , working with international groups . This is only part of the effort that will be required . It will take a massive research in geology and seismology to learn to forecast earthquakes . Likewise , the science of the sea will demand tremendous research . Questions left The Johnson plan leaves unanswered how much of the government 's oceanography program the new agency would assume . The Navy now has a program that involves spending several hundreds of millions of dollars by 1970 . It features deep-diving research submarines and developing means for men to live for weeks at a time on the sea bed . The Navy program is billed as an effort to develop a general capability to explore the sea more fully and to exploit its re* // *Johnson proposes NASA ' for earth sciences // sources ; especially on the continental shelves .

Work now diversified Right now , the government 's oceanography projects are spread over more than a dozen agencies . The Weather Bureau handles much of the atmospheric research . But it has had trouble getting adequate funds because Congress has not considered it a research agency . In fact , geophysics generally has never been pulled together in an over-all program in which its research needs were adequately met and its practical benefits fully developed . The administration has been under fire from Congress and other critics because of the fragmentation of its efforts in geophysics , especially in oceanography . There has been serious talk of setting up a department of oceanography with Cabinet status . The Johnson plan for ESSA is seen as an answer to this criticism . It was announced With dramatic suddenness . Many geophysicists and other observers have sensed that something like this was in the wind . But very few knew of the specific plan in advance . It remains to be seen how well it goes down with the Congress .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
