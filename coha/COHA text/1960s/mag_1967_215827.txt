The Wall has long since pulled down the shutters on West Berlin 's " show window to the East , " robbing the city of its old excitement and sense of purpose . To make matters worse , the West German recession has caused a severe Berlin business slump . On top of all that , Mayor Willy Brandt went to Bonn last December and turned his job over to Heinrich Albertz , a hapless **26;3492;TOOLONG who was unable to rule his own party , let alone the largest ( pop . 2,191,000 ) city in Germany . <P> Mayor Albertz had been in office only six months when he began to lose his grip . His trouble started with the Shah of Iran 's visit in June , when West Berlin police fired on student demonstrators , killing one of them . Albertz backed up his police , but later had to back down when the city 's parliament decided that the police had , in fact , used too much muscle . After that , internal party squabbles forced Albertz to resign . Last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin parliament gave the problem-packed mayoral post to energetic Klaus Schtz , 41 . <P> High Price . A Berliner , Schtz studied politics at Harvard in the late ' 40s , returned to the U.S. in 1960 to observe the Kennedy-Nixon contest . He helped campaign for Willy Brandt in Brandt 's unsuccessful attempt to unseat Konrad Adenauer in 1961 . Brandt , who liked Schtz 's work , sent him to Bonn as the city 's special representative to the federal government . When Brandt became Foreign Minister last year , he brought Schtz along as his No. 2 man . <P> Though he was not anxious to lose his protg , Brandt could hardly object to Schtz 's return to Berlin . Schtz quickly made it clear that he , has little faith in Albertz 's plan to rebuild West Berlin prosperity by turning the city into a center for trade and cultural exchange between East and West . Not that he is against " building bridges , " said Schtz , but he is unwilling to pay the price the Communists demand for their cooperation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City " without ties to West Germany and without the protection of an Allied military presence . " West Berlin must not go off half-cocked , " said its new boss . " Berlin 's economy and jobs are guaranteed only by our tie to the West . " <P> Schtz also hopes to cool off the students at the Free University , which has become a haven for draft dodgers ( West Berlin residents are exempt from West Germany 's 18-month conscription ) and police-baiting left-wingers who want peace with East Germany at any price . " Rowdies once and for all will be put in their place , " he says . The students are likely to resent his toughness , but they can hardly challenge his credentials . He was , after all , one of the students who founded the Free University in 1948 as a protest against Communist domination of the old Berlin University in the city 's East Sector .
