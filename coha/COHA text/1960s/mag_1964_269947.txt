The trouble in Panama has repercussions that echo all the way to the Livermore , Calif. , laboratories of Project Ploughshare , where the AEC is investigating the peaceful uses of atomic energy . Ploughshare scientists are bringing their calculations to a high polish , for if a new Isthmian canal is to be dug , nuclear explosives may be used . And Ploughshare men are sure that they can blast a wide sea-level canal in a couple of years at a fraction of the cost of conventional digging . <P> Ploughshare optimism is based on studies of a long series of craters blasted by both chemical and nuclear explosives in the Nevada desert . The first , called Buster Jangle-U. ( 1951 ) , used a crude atom bomb with a yield of 1.2 kilotons . It dug a circular hole 53 ft. deep and 258 ft. in diameter . The next shot , Teapot-Ess , had the same yield , but it was placed deeper and it dug a deeper and wider crater . With these and other shots , Ploughshare scientists built up a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Latest and largest cratering shots , Sedan ( 100 kilotons ) and Danny Boy ( 400 kilotons ) , were fired in 1962 and proved that the Ploughshare rules for nuclear explosives work just as well in hard , heavy rock as in loose soil . <P> Best Depth . The rules are remarkably precise . If a shot is placed at too shallow a depth , as Buster Jangle-U. was , it wastes most of its energy on the air . If it is too deep , it lifts a great amount of soil and broken rock , but lets most of the stuff fall back into the crater . <P> When placed just right , it throws most of the rubble over the lip of a steep-sided hole . A 100-kiloton shot should be placed 600 ft. below the surface , while a one-megaton shot calls for a depth of 1,300 ft . <P> Ploughshare has yet to dig any canal-like ditches with long lines of nuclear explosions , but it has experimented elaborately with chemical shots and believes it knows the basic laws that govern both kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings " with the distance between them equal to half the diameter of the crater that a single shot would dig , and if they are exploded simultaneously , they will excavate a smooth-bottomed ditch , throwing the rock to the sides . One hundred shots , for instance , of 100 kilotons each , will dig a ditch 1,600 ft. wide , 350 ft. deep and 16 miles long . If its bottom is 60-odd ft. below sea level , it can serve as a spacious ship canal . <P> Clean Clouds . When a crater-making shot is fired , a mushroom of earth grows out of the ground above the explosion . A jet of hot gas raises a dust cloud high in the air . Most of the dust and debris settle immediately , and hardly any dust falls more than 21 miles from the crater . This dust is not very radioactive . Nearly all of the shot 's radioactivity is buried deep under the rubble that falls back into the hole . Ploughshare men are sure that if modern , " clean " explosives are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Permanent population may have to keep away from the neighborhood of the new-dug canal for at least six months , but men under medical supervision may start working there in two weeks .
