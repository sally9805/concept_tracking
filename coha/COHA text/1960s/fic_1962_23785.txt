T H E man had knotted his handkerchief and put it on his head , but this did not protect the back of his neck into which the sun was drilling . His nape was dark red and beginning to blister , even though his shirt collar was turned up . It was a short-sleeved shirt and the outer side of his left forearm was also inflamed , the sun being no longer straight overhead but standing a little behind him and to his left . He was wearing brown leather shoes and no socks . Both his heels were so badly chafed that an hour earlier lie had taken his shoes off and tried walking barefoot . The road was too stony for it He put his shoes on again , swearing , almost weeping at the pain . Had there been any shade he would have dropped clown in it , given up . But there was , and went on being , no shade at all , much further than his eye could see . The road was little more than an unsurfaced ledge hacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitched down into sea . To his right the land rose less steeply to an undulating crest , but he could rarely see this , only the rough wall of rock out of which the road was terraced . The sun would go down into the sea and the only shadows which would grow as it moved imperceptibly through the afternoon would be the man 's own and those of the boulders lying loose here and there . The latter would make pools of shade so small that he would have to lie flat and put his head in one of them to get any relief . The man felt as though the inside of his nose , his mouth , his whole head were coated with dust . He knew that his thirst was not a danger because when he had last looked at a map there had been a place-name about twenty miles ahead and already he must have covered some ten of those miles , but he found its relentless increase alarming beyond reason . He had been walking since one o'clock and now it was three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . The man 's name was Donald Fox .

" I bet , " he had said not long ago , " that all these forms go to some decrepit clerk who staples them into pads and hangs them in the customs officers ' lavatory . " Now he hoped that he had been wrong . Before long it would be necessary for someone at the center of things in this country to have the means of linking him up with himself . Until that year he had done his traveling with friends and in fairly comfortable places : the south of France and Italy , and once he had shared a house by the sea in Spain with five others . lie had found travel snobs annoying . He had seen it as presumptuous to suppose that he could establish the least foothold in any other life when he was given only a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . Play was all he had aspired to . But in spite of this he had , fur some years , felt increasingly impatient of his holidays because Ile felt increasingly impatient of his own life , of his friends , of his girls . Per-haps it was because he had , at odd times during those years , been attempting to write a novel . It was supposed to be a funny one about the things he knew best : the television rat race and intricate love affairs in mews flats . He could make his friends laugh when he talked of such things and at last he began to take them seriously when they said , " My God , Donald , you ought to put it all in a book . " It was the first time he had ever examined business maneuvers or the conduct of couples . Absurd he had always found them , but now he became nagged by the feeling that they were unnecessary as well . People invented so much of their lives , it seemed , and always those parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented the necessity for this or that kind of car to drive , clothes to wear , house to inhabit , success to score , or anguish to suffer from . Donald disliked the thought of himself as a naive man , so he never openly questioned his circle 's necessities , but inside himself , secretly , he became a little simple . He would lie in his bath and think : " Money . That 's only an invention . Or the value of diamonds . What in God 's name possesses the human race ? " He gave up his novel and got books on oriental religions out of the public library . He thought he needed to be alone for a bit , in some place where life was as bare as possible and where the real necessities could show . He chose for his next holiday a country in which , if he went off the beaten track , he could fall inconspicuously between two stools : It was too rough , still , for the play-seekers , while he would be too inexpert to rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who translate the laments sung in the hill villages ( he could not translate more than the politenesses and " How much ? " ) . He would never become godfather to any shepherd 's son , would never play tric-trac in a dark caf ? with the village elders , would never know why X became Minister of the Interior instead of Y , or he lent illuminated manuscripts , as an exception , by a xenophobic abbot . He would simply be alone to watch the places and the people , to talk when he could communicate , to be rid , for a short time , of much , and to gain God knows what . He suspected that he should go on foot and by local Diana Achill is a partner in the London publishing house , Andre Deutsch , Ltd .

He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , he had one ) was small and ridiculous , so he talked about it to no one and hugged it to himself . He drove at first over roads less bad than he had expected , then over tracks much worse . Twice he was bitten by fleas , twice he had to share a room in an inn with strangers , every night he lay on hard beds under thick sheets which , even when newly washed , smelled of other bodies because water was too precious for much rinsing . He was elated at not minding these things or even ( much ) the water closets , when there were any . Courteous and inquisitive people , landscapes of a fierce or delicate beauty , the realization that comfort is simply a matter of being warm or coo/ enough , having enough to eat , and being able to sprawl when weary : it was good . Sometimes when he lay down in a bare little thick-walled room , listening to a dog barking or a donkey braying or voices muttering outside in words he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being so far away ; would hover on the edge of fear . What was he doing in this bed , in this distant , foreign village , its life all the more mysterious for being proved real ? Then he would slide into the blank , easy sleep which comes with freedom , to wake early and smoothly to a world in which every whitewashed wall , every geranium in its pot , every chicken scratching in the dust was given an extra value by his awareness . If there was a tap outside the house , or water trickling from a pipe in a wall , he would go out to scrape his chin , watched by children , indulging a secret feeling of belonging . Then , with his money and his car , m he would move on . He chided himself that of course the people in that place were much the same as people anywhere else , that an old woman spinning under an olive tree need he no different from an old woman knitting in a deck chair ; but he could feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express mostly resignation , simplicity , wisdom , and courage were doing their work . He would return to London with a dream . T HE N came the day of this story : a long drive over a stretch of country most of which gave no sign of habitation . Mile after mile of eroded mountain , how could the road ( such as it was ) have been made ? Donald had with him wine , a flask of water , bread , cheese , and tomatoes . Knowing that he would at one 92 MAN ON A ROAD time be following the coast , he planned to swim at midday , when he ate his lunch . He pulled up about half-an-hour after he first sighted the sea , when he came to a place where rock had fallen and been cleared , leaving a raw half-moon on the side away front the drop . He left the car there , fairly sure that if another vehicle came by ( which was unlikely  --  he had seem only one bus all morning ) it could get past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just possible to scramble down , at the bottom of which a couple of tumbled rocks threw a little shade . There he sat and ate , the noises he made sounding either too small or too loud . It was a place where land went into sea . He was surprised at how startling this was . It struck him that people had collected for so long on shores , beaches , bays , that they had made of them a special kind of territory , an ambiguity between two elements . There might be a documentary in it : what the human race had done to the fringes of land . It would be too arty , of course . Here there was none of that . Rock went down and water rose and fell against it . It was a still day so that the water moved only a few inches , but the idea of diving into it off that rock was frightening . The water was so deep , almost black . The rock , if waves hashed a holy against it , would be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A shipwrecked man might struggle out and lie exhausted , in the great silence , and a sea-bird might swoop down to pick out his eyes . This is the furthest I have ever been , thought Donald , perhaps the furthest I shall ever be , from what we have made of life . He felt that he should sit quite still , for a long time , experiencing it ; but the quietness was too much . After another swig of wine he climbed down to a ledge just above the water 's highest lapping , kicked off his shoes and dipped his feet in the sea . It was almost as though he were daring something . On either side of him his hands gripped the rock , until he noticed them and deliberately relaxed them . Before he stripped he looked round , absurdly , to make sure that no one was watching . The last person he had seen had been a woman , many miles back , spinning as she kept an eye on some black goats , and for the next twenty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be built on it . Over the crest of the mountain there might be , he supposed , villages quite near as the crow flies , but they would not send their flocks over to the seaward slope . There was nothing there for them to eat . Wonderful , he thought , to he so free . If he had a woman there , he could lie on this rock and screw her in the sun 's eye , like Adam with Eve . But he felt smaller than the thought . If he had been able to do such a thing the discomfort would , undoubtedly , have been great : the rock unaccommodating- , the sun hammering his back . As it was he could feel his skin threatening to shrivel under it . Such still water , he told himself , no different from slipping off a raft at Antibes , so he edged himself in , swam out a little way and turned on his back to float . He had to shelter his eyes with his hand before he could look up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not see the road . It was hidden by a shoulder of rock . But when after halfa-minute ( the sun burning his face ) he righted himself and shook water out of his cars , he heard a motor grinding along the hillside . Another bus , he thought , or a truck . When he had dressed he splashed water on his head against the heat of the climb back to the road . Stones slid tinder his feet and lie often had to use his hands , but he enjoyed it more than he had enjoyed the descent or the meal or the swim . Then he had been pushing against the pressure of the place 's emptiness . Now he was coming back from a small achievement . He would remember that swim when he got home . I E DID not see that the car had gone until he hauled himself up onto the road . He told himself that he must have come up at the wrong angle , he must be looking at another wide place ahead of the one where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he formed the thought that it was not so . His stomach sucked downwards . He stood panting , looking at the marks where the wheels had been and where , in starting up , they had spun splinters of stone out of the dust . Standing there , he was horrified to feel pure terror closing down on him , not of whatever man had taken the car , for in such emptiness he could riot envisage a man , but of the silence and the bare mountain . In spite of the blazing . light a darkness seemed to emanate from the rock , as though powers were present which had conspired his predicament . He wanted to get his back against something . Soon , the automatic reactions bred by a life spent in an organized society went to work : keep calm , something can be done , there are people , policemen , telephone operators  --  even in this country there are people  --  who exist to deal with situations Iike this . At least I have eaten and have my dark glasses on , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ihirsty and ! hat the water flask was in the car , with all his cigarettes but three , with all his money except for the equivalent of  --  he checked it  --  about seven shillings , and with his passport . He was not sure that he could pronounce correctly the name of the place on the map for which he had been heading , but it was on the sea , he knew , bigger than a village , and some of ihe smaller steamers called there . It would have telephones and policemen . Many people trudged twenty miles in a clay for pleasure and there was , after all , the chance of a lift . He started to walk . And two hours later he was still walking , a fairly well-built man , healthy , but accustomed to no exercise beyond a little squash and sometimes a weekend 's sailing . Five miles on foot , at any time , would leave him conscious of unusual exertion ; more than that would tire him . But two hours would not have pushed him beyond muscular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable shoes and a hat with a brim . He recalled stories of captives shunting through deserts and over mountains , of shipwrecked men drifting for days without water , of the tortured , the starved , the derelict . Only discomfort , he re pealed to Itimself . This is only discomfort . But shame at his susceptibility to it did not ease him . He could not think away the throbbing in his head , the scorching sun on his under-pigmented skin , those bloody shoes gnawing at his raw heels . Three smooth boulders , a pothole shaped like Australia , some kind of thistle growing out of a crack in the wall of rock to his right , a miniature avalanche of dust at the wall 's foot  --  so many thousand details unblurred by speed  --  each one to be trodden past or over . He was no longer skating the surface of this country . Another five miles and the road curved inland to avoid a humped promontory . It climbed a little , then descended to a shallow valley cupped behind the promontory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , the reliefi  --  that there were trees growing in the olive trees . At first he thought Only of shade , perhaps water , then he realized that it meant cultivation , that some- one must farm this scratching of soil . And sureenough , a little further on he could distinguish houses , six or eight of them : a small hamlet that had not been marked on the map . First there was a house standing separately , plastered and washed a patchy pink . The lower part of it Was a stable . Chickens pecked around it and a thin cat ran across the road , but no people were about . Then houses were grouped more closely and the road spread between them into a rudimentary village square with a small plane tree at its center . An old man was sitting under the tree , a woman came out of a door , carrying a pail , anti three children knelt in the dust , putting pebbles into a squashed tin can . As Donald came nearer , the woman and the children stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man did not appear to notice his approach . D ONALD walked straight into the shade of the tree and sat down on a gnarled root , polished by the seats of many trousers . " Good morning , " he said to the old man ( he still confused " good morning " with " good afternoon " ) , then , when the tortoise head did not turn , he saw the sagging lip and the line of spittle running from its corner and realized that the old man had no mind left . He turned to the woman , who had tanned her head scarf across the lower part of her face . " Please , " he said , " Water . " After a moment she spoke to one of the children , a boy , who ran into a house and came back with a tin mug of water . Donald drank . He drank . Oh the cool , clear , sweet water running down his throat , spreading , he seemed to feel , between his ribs . He leaned back against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though once in the shade and no longer thirsty he could forget the rest . Then he hem down to take off his shoes and inspect his heels , grimacing at the woman as he did so , for her sympathy . She stared back at him out of black eyes with no change of expression . " English , " he said , pointing to his chest . " Tired . Bus to the town ? " She murmured something and shook her head . In the car he had a phrase book from which he had learned , " Is 94 MAN ON A ROAD there anyone here who can speak English/ French/ German ? " but now his head was aching and he could not remember it . His courage shrank as he saw the impossibility of pantomiming his plight . He smiled and shrugged at the woman , trying to express helplessness and appeal , hoping that at least she would look friendly . She did not . If anything , she looked alarmed . The boy who had brought the water stood beside her . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed back down the road toward the pink house and pushed him in that direction . He ran off , the woman signed to Donald to stay where he was , picked up her pail , and went back into her house . The old man seemed to be asleep , his breathing made no noise . There was not even a grasshopper chirping in the heaviness of the afternoon . If the boy had gone to fetch someone , Donald thought , he need not worry until they came back . He leaned back again , with his bare feet resting on his shoes , conscious of little but the ache in his head . He wished he knew for certain that the boy would be away for at least half-an-hour so that it would be worth going to sleep . In about ten minutes he heard voices and footsteps . He opened his eyes and saw two men coming from the direction of the pink house , the boy following them . They surprised him , partly because the emptiness of the village had made him assume that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because these men did not look quite as he expected villagers to look . One of them was wearing a shabby suit , light fawn in color . He was fat and had a thin mustache . The other , a slight boy , fairer than was usual , wore a black-and-white checked shirt , dark trousers , and white ( though dirty ) canvas shoes . They came into the square and stood staring at Donald , the mustached one a Little in front . When he said , " Good afternoon , " getting it right this time , they both nodded . He got up and said : " I am English . Can speak English ? " and the mustached one said , " I speak English . " He said the words smoothly , without hesitation , and Donald 's relief was great . " I am in trouble , " he said . " My car was stolen when I stopped to eat and swim . I have walked a long way . Is there a bus from here to the town ? " Mustaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked : " Where was your car stolen ? Who stole it ? " Donald thought his voice sounded hostile but supposed he must be imagining this . " I do n't know who stole it , " he said . " I did n't see . " " What were you doing on the road ? Why were you not in the car ? " " Swimming , " said Donald . " Swimming , eating , " and he made swimming gestures with his arms . Perhaps the man did not understand English very well , after all . Meanwhile , he noticed , the woman with the pail had come out of her house again , several other women had appeared . and half-a-dozen more children . They were gathering round , not very close , and they were all watching . " I only want to know , " he said , " when there is a bus . My money was in the car . I must get to ihe town . " The fair boy whispered to Mustaches , who moved a step nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is hostile , Donald recognized with astonishment . Then answered , with forced calm : " It was in the car . " " How can we know you had a car ? " " Where would I have come from if I had not had one ? And what is it to do with you ? I am only asking the best way to the town , " " Our people are not thieves . " Oh God , thought Donald . The only one to speak English would be this bastard . His head was throbbing and he suddenly saw that he was standing barefoot . He could not believe that he was facing unfriendliness . So far , in this country , he had always come as the stranger , the news-bearer , the event of the day ( or perhaps of many , many days ) for people with lively minds living in remote places , who had learned to give the fullest importance to any unusual event . Even among the poorest of them hospitality had been astonishing . In every village he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it hunger for new things to discuss which had given an expression almost of love to the faces which had greeted him . Now , he realized suddenly , looking at the two men and at the silent women and children in the background , the medal had flipped over . Here , for some reason , the stranger was the unexplained , the suspect . His appearance ? He must look like a tramp . To be an English tourist and to look like this : perhaps it was incredible to them . Or perhaps it was one of them who had stolen the car ? " My name is Donald Fox , " he said . " I come From London . Please help me . " " You are English , " said Mustaches . He was watching Donald 's face closely and his mouth was smiling slightly . " 1 have told you . " " You English shot my brother and this one 's father , " and he gestured with his elbow toward the fair boy . There was a cold clutch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much at a loss , and now this . . " What do you mean ? The British have shot no one in this country . " " Not here . On the island . There was not even any proof . " He did not translate to his companion , but the boy drew nearer to him , watching with him for the effect of the words , The coldness ran through Donald 's whole body . He understood with a jolt why the men looked strange . They were not natives of this village , they came from the island ; and if they came from the island they were here , almost certainly , because they had to be , because they were in hiding . And if they were men who must hide ... " I have never been on the island , " he said . He almost added , " I have always believed it shouldhe free to choose what government it liked , " but when he saw the little smile under the mustache , the words stuck . Instead , he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What has your car to do with me ? " said Mustaches , then translated for the boy , who laughed briefly . The eyes of both of them were no longer guarded but seemed wider , as though they were waking to a prospect of action . They did not move . Donald felt hollow , struggling to realize that what he might do next , what he might say , was the mouse two cats were crouching for . Partly because his legs grew weak and partly because a show of indifference seemed the only course , he stepped backwards and sat again on the root of the plane tree . They arc just trying to scare me , he thought , nothing will happen . So he said : " I am sorry about your brother and the boy 's father . I see that you will not help me . I have shot no one and I will rest here for a little before I walk on . " As he spoke he felt MARK VAN DOREN SIX POEMS Tern pereince Indomitable Stop short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than enough Love , money , and rain .

And people do not harm strangers for no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as though the earth under his feet were a thin crust over nothing . The man had a low forehead , narrow khaki-colored eyes , and a sullen , pouting mouth . In any circumstances he would have been unprepossessing . But worse was the way in which he was looking out of those eyes . Here was someone functioning on a level wholly unfamiliar . " What were reasons for this man would not be reasons for Donald . The thought was melodramatic , panicky . Donald tried not to acknowledge it , but if he was right about these two they moved in a world in which killing had often been the simplest , the obvious thing to do : it was probably something they themselves had clone . But the villagers . . . He glanced at the old idiot and at the surrounding women , without knowing that he was beginning to look hunted . Black eyes in narrow , dark faces . No expression except . watchfulness . These women , these women 's ancestors , had seen things he had only read about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make do with little . They knew from personal experience that violence happens . Donald put on his shoes slowly , biting his lip . While he was doing it the old man began for the first time to stir and mumble and one of the women came forward to help him up . As she passed Mustaches she murmured to him , looking sideways at Donald , who caught the word " auto-bus . " Mustaches only jerked his head . The woman lowered her eyes and led the old man away . I must not lose my nerve , thought Donald . I must not let fatigue and headache and the unexpectedness of this distort the situation . They are only two louts setting themselves up by showing off to the women . But as he started to rise , Mustaches stepped forward . For a fraction of a second they were face to face , Donald with his knees not yet straightened , the other leaning forward ; then , incredulous , Donald felt hands on his shoulders , the thrust as he was pushed off balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root . He was too shocked to do more than stare . Mustaches , insolent , stared back . " We have not finished to talk , " he said . " You say we steal your car . I say no . " " I did not say ? " began Donald , struggling to his feet , rage taking over . Before he was up , the fair boy had darted forward and had slapped his face . No , he thought . No , this has not happened . His cheek stung sharply and the jerking of his head at the blow had made a lock of his hair fall forward so that he could see its ends out of his right eye . " Look here , " he heard himself saying in a high voice , " look here , this is absurd . " The mustached face was close to him suddenly , pushed forward , talking fast in words he could not understand while a fist vibrated under his nose so that he retreated clumsily and found himself backed against the trunk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them , the heavy silence had exploded into stridency and movement . The sickness of rage mounted in hint : a double sickness . of rage made impotent by fear . His hands clenched . nerves twitched to hit out , to fight them ; twitched and short-circuited at the knowledge of his situation . There were two of them , for all he knew the whole village against him as well : he was thousands of miles from anyone who knew him and five miles of more boulders. more potholes , more dust , from anyone who could help him , with only his sore feet to cover the distance . If he made a rush for it , stones might be flung ; he felt himself stumbling along that nightmare road with a rabble of screaming women and children at his heels . Such a thing could not happen to him , Donald Fox  --  hut to the two men pressing close in front of him he was not Donald Fox , he was what they chose to make him . while to the women behind them he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impossibility of it , the absurdity of his helplessness , the outrage of being stripped and nullified by stupidity and malice . He sank on his haunches , without knowing he had done it , leaned against the tree and buried his face in hands . Behind the darkness of his eyelids he begged : " Let it all be a bad dream . Let them go away . " His collapse seemed to disconcert the men and rouse the women , one of whom began to shout at Mustaches , backing away from him as she did so . She was angry and afraid , both of him and of Donald . From her gestures and the direction in which she jerked her head she might have been shouting : " Leave him alone , let him go , " not out of sympathy so much as to get rid of him . Both Mustaches and the boy began to speak at once , hotly and scornfully . They were justifying their behavior , building up aggression . They took no notice at first when there was a patter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under loads of alfalfa . A man was riding the first load  --  leathery skin , ragged mustache under a straw hat . He belonged here . He slid off and called out . - What 's going on ? ' ' lie may have said . The women turned to him , several speaking at once , but the one he listened to , bending his head , was the boy who had brought the mug of water and had been sent to fetch the islanders . The boy pointed to Donald , pointed to the two men ; in his excitement mimed a blow and pulled his father ( for there Was a marked likeness ) across the square to join the group . The newcomer asked questions , the women babbled , Mustaches intervened while the fair boy stood aside and looked sulky . Donald stood up and began , shakily , to walk away . Someone shouted to him to stop , children ran after him and voices grew louder . Donald could bear Mustaches ' rising high , the other man 's growling . Then the newcomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm , speaking to him ? then breaking off to shout angrily at Mustaches who had come up on his other side . " Let inc go , ' ' said Donald loudly , in English . The man stared earnestly into his face . His eyes , surprisingly , were gray and his mustache was yellow with tobacco . He asked , a question in a gentle voice , frowning with urgency . " I do not understand , " said Donald in English . " I understand nothing . " The man held his arm a moment longer , puzzling his face , then shrugged and let him go . Donald walked on , disappeared limping beyond the houses . The sound of arguing voices , of women calling back children , grew less . U I T E soon afterwards Donald was over-taken by the day 's bus . He looked so desperate , ready to throw himself under its wheels , that the driver pulled up for him even though he was normally a stickler for the scheduled stops in the villages . The bus was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning from leave in his village befriended him and offered to take him to the police station . To everyone in that bus Donald was an object of interest and pity , almost of wonder , for the theft of a car was something that could never happen to any of them . When he reached the town there were hours and hours of talk and interpretation , of misunderstanding , of drinks at first welcome and then confusing , before he slept under what seemed to be a tablecloth on someone 's horsehair couch . His car was found next day , left where it had run out of petrol a little beyond the town , and the only things missing were three pounds of his money and a blue sweater , He did not wait for the inquiries but learned later that a ship 's engineer visiting his family in the mountains had seduced a woman in her husband 's absence .

Later he married one of the girls in the party , which meant that he would never again travel to any place where it was impossible to reserve a room with a private bath . It was curious how , when he lazed on shores and bays and beaches , being comfortably himself , he would so often dream and never speak of the country where the fair boy had slapped his face and the man came riding into the square on a donkey , and then they all began to argue and let the stranger go .
