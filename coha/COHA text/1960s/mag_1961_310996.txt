In the view of some of its despairing critics , New York City is just too large and complex for any one man to govern properly-and Mayor Robert Ferdinand Wagner has certainly done much to confirm that belief during his eight fumbling , scandal-specked years in office . But Wagner is a Democrat , and New York is an overwhelmingly Democratic city . And last week , after one of the dreariest campaigns in its history , New York gave Bob Wagner 1,239,533 votes for a plurality of 402,980 over his Republican opponent , Attorney General Louis Lefkowitz . Running as an independent , City Controller Lawrence Gerosa collected a protest vote of 321,996-drawn mostly from Democrats who shuddered at the thought of four more Wagnerian years . <P> Failure to Impress . Wagner had to work uncommonly hard for his third term . A docile favorite of Tammany Hall during his first seven years , Wagner this year annoyed the bosses by picking his own-and abler-running mates : Civil Servants Abraham Beame for controller , Paul Screvane for council president . For that effrontery , Wagner had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice , in a primary to win the Democratic nomination . But the primary gave Wagner what he badly needed : an issue . Ignoring the past , the mayor promised to put an end to " boss rule " if reelected , vowed to clean up the civic mess that had developed in his own regime , accused Opponent Lefkowitz of being the tool of Republican Governor Nelson Rockefeller and other G.O.P. leaders . A drab , hand-waving campaigner , Lefkowitz hammered hard at the Wagner scandals , but for all his hammering failed to impress the voters as a plausible , forceful alternative to the mayor . <P> The vote was a blow to Governor Rockefeller , who campaigned hard for Lefkowitz , hoped to enhance his own prestige by capturing the state 's biggest Democratic stronghold , or at least to come close . But even in defeat , Republicans , long lacking an effective city organization , had some reason to feel encouraged by the outcome . Lefkowitz , polling 836,553 votes , did better than expected and carried ten of 65 assembly districts , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagner won by 18,600 votes in 1957 . In The Bronx , running with the support of the labor-backed Liberal Party , Republican Joseph F. Periconi won the borough presidency from a hand-picked candidate of Congressman Charles Buckley , most puissant of the Democratic bosses . In the 25-man city council , the G.O.P. doubled its strength-jumping , that is , from one seat to two . <P> Unable to Count . Victory presumably made Bob Wagner undisputed leader of New York State 's Democrats , gives him the chance to heal the canyon-sized breach between the organization regulars and the Herbert Lehman-Eleanor Roosevelt reformers who backed him against the bosses. * Wagner 's probable first move : replacing State Chairman Michael Prendergast , who openly backed Gerosa . Since the voters also approved a drastic reform in the city charter . Wagner will have far more control of city affairs than ever before , might be able to achieve a measure of administrative efficiency . <P> But no one was really counting on that . New York was still the same ungovernable New York-and Bob Wagner was still Bob Wagner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
