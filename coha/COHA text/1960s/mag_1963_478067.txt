The inventor of teaching machines now hopes to found a new kind of community , where everybody will be engineered into perfect , uninterrupted happiness . scholars or scientists engaged in studying the nature of man have provoked more controversy in recent years than a Harvard professor named Burrhus Frederic Skinner . Skinner is an experimental psychologist whose work has had a far-reaching influence in pharmacology , in education ? he is the principal inventor of the teaching machine ? and on the study of animal behavior . It is not the value of his practical contributions in these fields , however , that is mainly in question . The controversy turns on Skinner 's view of what it means ? or more importantly , perhaps , what it does not mean ? to be a human being . Skinner is the world 's leading exponent of pure behaviorism . It is his contention that man has neither a free will nor the capacity for taking spontaneous action ; that there is really no such thing as " consciousness " or " mind " ; and that human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as certainly as the progress of a chemical reaction . Theologians , philosophical idealists , and ordinary humanists are apt understandably to recoil in horror from what one of Skinner 's critics has called the Specter of Predictable Man . Even those psychologists who share in general Skinner 's conviction that human behavior is lawful , and therefore predictable and controllable , are often appalled by the length to which he carries his ideas . Sonic psychologists , however , compare Skinner admiringly to Galileo . They hold that just as Galileo dispelled the illusion that the earth is the center of the universe , Skinner has dispelled the illusion that man is any moreautonomous or free than other animals . They argue that he has thereby cleared the way for the subjection of human behavior to scientific controls that will eventually make all men happy and good . Skinner himself has set forth , in a Utopian novel called Walden Two , published in 1948 , his own ideas about the forms such controls might take . The book , and the imaginary community it described , shocked many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmarish Utopia , " and Life called it " a travesty on the good life " and " a slur upon a name i.e. , Thoreau 's , a corruption of an impulse . " Joseph Wood Krutch. in a book called The Measure of Man , accused Skinner of trying " to perfect mankind by making individual men incapable of anything except habit and prejudice . " Skinner has of course denied this charge . But he does concede that some experiences prized by civilized men would be unknown in a community from which guilt and suffering had been banished by proper behavioral engineering . " If we founded an experimental community and raised children in the way that is described in Walden Two . " he told an undergraduate seminar at Harvard last year , " when they grew up and read Dostoevskv they would n't know what in the devil he was driving at . " " It seems like a very bland life , " a Radcliffe freshman remarked . If Skinner has his wish , it may be possible before long w find out what such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years , he has been trying to stir up interest in the founding of a real-life Walden Two . So far , he has had little encouragement from other psychologists . Even those who are his warm admirers doubt that lie ? or anyone else ? knows enough about human behavior to build a Utopian community any more durable than those that sprang up and died during the last century . But he is confident that there will be no lack of volunteers . Many readers of Walden Two have written to offer their help if Skinner should ever decide to start an experimental community . And during the past two years , he has given a sort of recruiting talk , in the form of a lecture on " The Experimental Design of a Culture , " at a number of colleges and universities , including Brown , Princeton , Stanford , and Pennsylvania . The size of his audiences , and their apparent enthusiasm , have given Skinner a good deal of encouragement . " / think I could get about a thousand people to come along if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I visited him in Cambridge not long ago . Skinner hopes to find other and younger people than himself who will take on the task of actually organizing his projected community . But he expects , naturally enough , that they will lean on him for advice . To guide them , he has been making notes on matters such as what to name the community ? he favors " Lifeguild " ? how people will dress , and whether it would he better to ban drinking altogether , or to let new residents taper off . He has also been sounding out people who might help finance the experiment , which he believes could point the way to a harmonious world in which being good would be as natural and automatic as breathing . In such a world there would be no reason , of course , for anyone ever again to draw up plans for an ideal society , and Skinner would he recorded in history as the last of the Utopians . HAPPY BABY ; Busy BAT N OW fifty-nine years old , Skinner is a slender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanse of forehead . In public , his discourse is marked by a relaxed virtuosity . While I was in Cambridge , I went to a lecture he gave in a course called Natural Sciences 114 . The subject was Pavlov , whose experiments with conditioned reflexes were the starting point for much of Skinner 's own work . Speaking without notes , Skinner dazzled the students with an account of Pavlov 's career into which he managed After graduating from Harvard in 1941 , Spencer Klaw worked as a newspaperman , and staff writer for " The New Yorker " and " Fortune . " Now free-lancing , he has contributed to many magazines on topics ranging from affluent professors to the art market . He met Dr. Skinner while working on an article on teaching machines.to work references to Turgenev , Adam Smith , Shaw , Diderot , Rousseau , Stendhal , Carmen , Aldous Huxley , Miss Rheingold of 1962 , Lope de Vega , and the razing of the Old Howard burlesque theatre in Boston . At one point , Skinner observed that because Brigitte Bardot wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on other young women tended to affect men in somewhat the same way that the ringing of a bell affected Pavlov 's dogs . - Or course . " he added , " once this happens on a broad scale ... " Grinning happily , he waited while the students laughed , groaned , and applauded . In private , I found Skinner somewhat less genial and more prickly . He tends , for example , to dismiss his critics by remarking sarcastically that so-and-so " is a great metaphor man , " or noting parenthetically that " a lot of psychologists just are n't very bright . " His prickliness is evident , too , in the daybooks that he keeps , some of which he let me look through . During the past ten years he has filled nearly a thousand composition books with notes and speculations on an enormous variety of topics , including the failings of people who do n't see things his way . One entry that I came across was headed " The Irrepressible Mind-Body Problem . " It began : " This was the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Wednesday . The problem proved also to be incompressible , and X took all 75 minutes , leaving no time for discussion . I heard nothing new .... " At times , indeed , one gets the impression that Skinner wants to build a Utopia mainly to prove , once and for all , that he is right about human nature , and his critics wrong . But he has other motives too . Like Hamlet , he feels that he must do what he can to set right the times into which he was born . This conviction is movingly expressed in an entry he made last year in one of his daybooks. it is headed " A New Year , " and reads , in part : it is nearly nine o'clock on the first day of the new year . From a deep blue sky sun streams into our living-room My hi-fi is midway through the first act of Tristan and Isolde . A very pleasant environment . A man would be a fool not to enjoy himself in it . In a moment I will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three hours on a manuscript which I think important and which may " help mankind . " So my life is not only pleasant , it is earned or deserved . Yet , yet , I am unhappy . It is not so much that ... I am perhaps one in a thousand to enjoy a life like this ; it has always been thus . . . . It is not wholly a belief that no man is an island . An enclave of misery elsewhere in the world may riot affect me or my children , but I may feel guilty about it as my puritan heritage . It is the fact that so little is being clone about it ! We are trapped in love of a life such as this . in false social science , in statesmanship based on historical induction , in " escalation . " etc . Is it up to me ? ( A Wagnerian theme . if I ever saw one ! ) Doubtless Skinner has also been impelled to design a Utopia by the stimulating challenge it offers to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventor as scientist . In the course of a short drive along the Charles River , he may toss out half-a-do/en notions for improving man 's lot ? highways made of rubber , for example , or sailboats towed by kites . His actual inventions include , in addition to several varieties of teaching machines , a device called the Air-Crib . The Air-Crib is an air-conditioned cubicle , one side of which is made of glass to form an observation window , designed so that a baby can sleep or play in it without blankets or clothing . " Our second daughter , who started out in an Air-Crib , did n't know how to cry , " Skinner told me . " I wo n't say she has n't cried since , but then she has n't ever had such a good environment again . " Perhaps the most important of Skinner 's inventions is a device often referred to simply as a Skinner box . It is widely used by psychologists , including many who are by no means all-out Skinnerians , for observing and measuring changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Skinner box on the wall of Skinner 's office at Harvard , along with pictures of his daughters , and of Pavlov . It shows a cage in which a white rat is pressing down on a lever with his front feet : behind the cage looms a piece of apparatus that looks something like a big switchboard , whose function , at the time the picture was taken , was to reward the rat periodically with food pellets , and to record how often , and at what intervals . the rat responded by pressing down the lever . Skinner built the first such device when he was in his twenties , and underlying all his work in recent years has been the assumption that laws deducible from the behavior of rats and pigeons in a Skinner box also control the behavior of human beings . BEYOND THE KNEE JERK B ESIDES being a prolific inventor , Skinner has a prose style that is lively , muscular , free from jargon , and altogether excellent . He started out , in fact , to be a writer and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last year at Hamilton College , in Clinton , New York . he sent some short stories to Robert Frost , and got back a long letter in which Frost said , among other things , " You 're worth twice anyone else I have seen in prose this year . " With this encouragement , he settled down after graduating from Hamilton in 1926 to write fiction ? first in Scranton , Pennsylvania , where his father practiced law , and then in Greenwich Village . But after a year or so , he decided that he really had nothing to say . This would have been more depressing if he had not simultaneously come to the conclusion that in the twentieth century the best way to come to grips with human nature was through science . not literature . At Hamilton , where he had majored in English and had taken courses in French , Greek , public speaking , and Greek and Roman art , Skinner had also taken several courses in biology . Among the books his biology professor had put into his hands was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long after graduation , lie had come across some articles that Bertrand Russell had written for the old Dial on the theories of John B. ' Watson , the founder of behaviorism . " Many years later , " Skinner has written . " when I told Lord Russell that he was responsible for my interest in behavior , he could only exclaim , ' Good Heavens ! 1 had always supposed that those articles had demolished behaviorism ! ' But at any rate he had taken Watson seriously , and so did I. " In 1928 , Skinner went to Harvard as a graduate student in psychology . Ile got his doctorate in 1931. staved on at Harvard doing research until 1936 , and then went to the University of Minnesota as an instructor . His first book , The Behavior of Organisms , was published two years later . It dealt mainly with what Skinner called " operant behavior " ? that is , behavior which is not simply reflexive , but which may he exemplified by a robin pulling up a worm . However voluntary a ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no less rigidly determined by external events than the jerking of one 's knee when the doctor taps it with a hammer . What shapes and controls operant behavior , he contended , is the " reinforcement " ? roughly , the rewards ? that the organism receives from the environment on which it is acting . In support of this thesis , Skinner described a number of experiments in which he had put rats in Skinner boxes and subjected them to a process he called operant conditioning . This consisted of teaching the rats to perform certain tasks by reinforcing their performance with food pellets . While other psychologists might question whether the behavior of human beings could be shaped in the same way ? " Let him extrapolate who will , " Skinner had written ? there was no doubt that Skinner had hit on a way to shape and control the behavior of infra-human animals with amazing precision and consistency . In one experiment described in The Behavior of Organisms , for instance , a rat was conditioned to pull a string to get a marble from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its forepaws , carry it across the cage to a vertical tube rising two inches above the floor , lift the marble , and drop it into the tube . Skinner and other psychologists have also conditioned pigeons to play a kind of table tennis , to dance together , and to peck out tunes on a toy piano . It occurred to Skinner , just after the outbreak of i he second world war , that pigeons might even be trained as navigator-bombardiers . With financial help from the government , he and some associates rigged up a simulated missile with a translucent screen in its nose . The steering mechanism was arranged so that a pigeon placed in the nose of the missile could guide it toward a specified target by pecking at the image of the target when it appeared on the screen . In 1944 , Skinner and his collaborators put on a demonstration for a group of the government 's chief scientific advisers . Although it went off without a hitch , the scientists decided the project should be dropped ? possibly , Skinner has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigeon carrying out its assignment , no matter how beautifully , simply reminded the committee of how utterly fantastic our proposal was . " The operant conditioning of animals has been put to practical use in other ways , however . The techniques associated with the use of the Skinner box may be compared to a microscope through which behavior can be seen with a clarity never before possible . This is of particular value to pharmaceutical researchers , who can learn a great deal about a new drug by administering it to an animal that has been conditioned to perform a certain task , at a certain rate of speed , and then noting exactly how the animal 's behavior is modified . " In a single experimental session with a single organism , " Skinner has written , " one observes the onset , duration , and decline of the effects of a drug . " The same method has been widely used to study the effects on animals of anesthesia , irradiation , insulin shock , and induced anxiety . It was not until 1945 that Skinner got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Organisms might be applied to the molding of human behavior . He did so by writing Walden Two , which was brought out by Macmillan , after several other publishers had turned it clown on the ground that it was too talky and un-novelistic , It is still selling well in its fifteenth year . Walden Two purports to be an account of a visit paid by a professor named Burris to an experimental community that has been founded by one of his former students . The founder 's name is Frazier , and much of the book 's considerable liveliness is due to the fact that he is a skillfully drawn caricature of Skinner himself . At one point , for example , Frazier refers to some tracts that children at Walden Two are required to read . " I consulted one of them just the other day , myself , " he says . " I 'd just read an article that I 'd always meant to write , and I was quite unhappy . But the tracts on Jealousy cured me immediately . They 're little masterpieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote them . " " SEDUCTION NOT EXPECTED " W ALDEN Two recalls in many ways the austere communism of many of the experimental communities of the nineteenth cenwry . Land and buildings are communally owned , and children , like those of the Oneida Community , are communally raised . Relations between adults are egalitarian , doctors , for example , being addressed simply as " Mister . " Everybody , including the Planners who run the community , must contribute some physical labor ? either by doing housekeeping chores , or by working on the farms that provide Walden Two with its rash income . Except for people who have especially pleasant jobs , such as growing flowers , no one has to work more than four hours a day ; people with nasty jobs like cleaning sewers may put in only two . Residents live in big , no-frills buildings made of rammed earth , eat cafeteria-style , and get along without their own automobiles . No one drinks ; it is not that drinking is forbidden , Frazier explains condescendingly , " but we all give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are responsible for the habit in the world at large . " The most striking aspect of life at Walden Two , however , is that everyone is always happy . When people are not working , they are painting pictures , singing in choral groups , reading good books , playing chamber music , and making love to their husbands or wives . There is no promiscuity , Frazier says , because " we encourage simple friendship between the sexes . . . . We have suecesslully established the principle of ' Seduction not expected . ' " When a visitor asks a teacher if children at Walden Two really have no idea what envy and jealousy are , the teacher looks puzzled ? she herself was only twelve when she came to Walden Two and so has forgotten what such emotions are like . Skinner 's account of the behavioral engineering responsible for this euphoria is less detailed than one might wish . No one is ever punished at Walden Two , and people are friendly and cooperative because there is no pay-off for being aggressive . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personal relations of members . . " ) fostered by the reading of " lessons " at nonreligious Sunday services which serve as " a sort of group therapy . " To obviate the need for such therapy when they grow up , children of three and four arc taught to practice self-control by being made to wear lollipops around their necks for several hours without licking them . Older children , returning cold and hungry from a long walk , are made to stand in front of steaming bowls of soup for five minutes before they are allowed to sit clown and eat . Competitive sports other than chess and tennis are discouraged . These two games are all right , Frazier tells Burris unconvincingly , because " the exercise of skill is as insportant as the outcome of the game . " At the end of his visit , Burris starts hack to his university . But on the way lie decides that Frazier has found the secret of the good life . He composes a telegram that begins , " My dear President Mittelbach stop you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns to Walden Two . A SYSTEM TO RESCUE MINDS A T THE time he wrote Walden Two , Skinner had no intention of quitting academic life himself . He has since said that it was really not until a year or so alter he had finished the hook that he even became an all-out Frazierian . In 1945. he left Minnesota for the University of Indiana , where he was chairman of the psychology department , and three years later he moved on to Harvard . There , he wrote Science and Human Behavior , which has become the most widely read of his scientific works . In it , he argues that reinforcement shapes every aspect of titan 's behavior that is not purely reflexive , including problem-solving and the creation of works of art . ( Skinner 's method of dealing with consciousness , it may be noted in passing , is to brush it aside . He argues , for instance , that when ? " ; ffir --  --  ? ' . a man says that the dinner bell makes him think of food , what he means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little difference between such " conditioned seeing " and the conditioned salivation of Pavlov 's dogs . ) Science and Human Behavior ( 1953 ) was followed , four years later , by Verbal Behavior , a densely written treatise in which Skinner takes up , among other things , puns , automatic writing , metaphors , spoonerisms , alliteration , rhyming , and why people talk to themselves . Lately he has been working on a book to be called The Technology of Teaching . Skinner 's interest in educational technology began about ten years ago . After a disheartening visit to his daughter 's fifth-grade arithmetic class ( " I saw minds being destroyed , " he later told an interviewer ) , he was struck with the notion that schools would he a lot better if children were taught arithmetic , spelling , and many other things in the same way that pigeons are taught to play ping-pong . This could he done , he figured , by presenting the student with a sequence of small , easy steps ; requiring him to answer a question at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right answer . The reinforcement would not consist of giving the student a grain of corn , but simply of telling him that his answer was correct . " Human behavior is remarkably influenced by small results , " Skinner has observed . On the theory that instructional sequences of the kind he had in mind could best he presented mechanically , Skinner began designing what he called teaching machines . By 1958 , his experiments were attracting widespread attention , and during the past five years millions of dollars have been spent to develop and test what is now generally known as programmed instruction . This is a technique making use not only of teaching machines , but , more often , of what are called programmed texts ? books designed so that a student can move from one step to another of an instructional sequence , or " program , " not by turning a knob , but by turning a page . Programmed instruction is being tried in thousands of classrooms , and it has been used to teach , among other things , calculus , geometry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic , statistics , and the understanding of poetry . Not all instructional programs , to be sure , conform precisely to Skinner 's specifications ; there are programmers , for example , who argue that Skinner 's programs tend to bore all but the dullest students . But Skinner stands in about the same relation to programmed instruction as , say , Edison does to electric lighting . The significance of his achievement is hard to gauge at this point . Programmed instruction is obviously not the all-purpose educational remedy that it is proclaimed to be by the firms that have been selling teaching machines in supermarkets , or by the encyclopedia salesmen who have been peddling them from door to door . Nor is it possible to find much support for Skinner 's widely quoted claim that " Exploratory research .. , indicates that what is now taught by teacher , textbook , lecture , or film can be taught in half the time with half the effort by a machine . ... " This assertion is discounted even by some of his most loyal followers , who point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away by his admiration for his own handiwork . ( His attitude is not colored by financial interest , since he has no big stake , through patents or otherwise , in the commercial exploitation of teaching machines . ) The fact is that no one yet knows exactly what programmed instruction can and can not do . It is already clear , however , that in certain areas of education it will prove enormously beneficial . One of its greatest benefits ? and a somewhat surprising one , in view of the fact that the phrase " teaching machine " suggests a kind of educational Procrustes ' bed ? may be to make education more adaptable to individual abilities , since programmed instruction permits each student to learn at his own pace . This may prove a particular boon to slow students , for whom Skinner displays rather more compassion than many educators do these days . " Some of those most active in improving education have been tempted to dismiss slow students impatiently as a waste of time , " he has written , " but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even extraordinary , achievements if permitted to move at their own pace . Many distinguished scientists , for example , have appeared to think slowly . " WRITING BY ONE LIGHT S K INN ER 'S ambition to try his hand at the engineering of a real Utopia began to take shape on his return from a visit to the Soviet Union in the spring of 1961 . It was clear to him , Skinner told me , that the Russians had passed up their opportunity to engineer a new and better kind of man , and had settled instead for the same old European bourgeois who has given himself and the rest of humanity so much trouble . ( " In Russia people spend their Sundays walking around in parks , " he said sadly , without specifying why he found this so gloomy a prospect . ) Back in the 1950s , Skinner said , he had given some encouragement to a small group of graduate students at Harvard who were thinking of establishing a community , or perhaps a school , modeled on Walden Two . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began to talk about helping to start an experimental community himself , and to put down on paper some ideas , beyond those in Walden Two , as to how its life should be organized . Skinner offered to let me look at these notes while I was in Cambridge , and he suggested that I come around to his house early the next morning and go through them there . When I arrived , a little before eight-thirty , Skinner had already been at work for more than an hour . He writes in a large basement room whose walls are hung with paintings by the younger of his two daughters , Deborah ( the one who began life in an Air-Crib ) . Like Trollope , whom he greatly admires , he makes a point of writing every day . He writes in longhand , and when he sits down to his stint soon after seven each morning he turns on a special light that acts , he said , as a conditioned reinforcer . The same switch that turns on the light also starts up a timer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk each day . Skinner cleared a space for me at a round table on which a big , inverted , blue wastebasket was standing . When I looked at it curiously , he lifted it for a moment , revealing a clay head , plainly a portrait of Skinner ; he said he had recently modeled it himself . He handed me a thick folder labeled " Design of a Culture , " and said that while he would have to leave in a few minutes to attend a staff meeting , I was welcome to stay on and read . The notes were written in a legible and beautifully shaded italic script , which Skinner had taught himself several years ago when lie found he was having a lot of trouble reading his own handwriting . Several of the first notes I came upon dealt with nomenclature , one of them reading , in part : A lifeguild " Lifeguild I " or " Lifeguild Vermont East . " The guildsite , guildhall , guildrooms , guild-code ... The basic term is lifeguild . Other notes discussed the selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " ) and the problem of getting them to observe the community code . The importance of group instruction in the code 's principles was stressed in a long memorandum suggesting the use of " monastic reading-at-table " and " good music , in appropriate moods : ' Several notes made clear Skinner 's conviction that a lifeguild should be run by an elite of planners and managers ; there was no indication , however , of how they would be chosen . The folder also contained notes wt plumbing , architecture ? a small sketch showed a group of ten rooms ranged in a semi-circle around a central core labeled " utility " ? and clothing . " Free , easily cleaned work clothes , " Skinner had written . " Can be attractive . Somewhat more formal , standard dress , for occasions . At least one ' traveling outfit ' for trips outside Guildsite . " Skinner had clearly been wrestling , too , with the problem of making life in a lifeguild pleasant as well as simple . One note proposed that watches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( with watches provided for the deaf ) . Another note dwelt on the steed to provide time for the uncompulsivc enjoyment of the light , the trivial , the beautiful . " Still another spoke of " A listening room Japanese style . Pads and mattresses on the floor . Tea things ? Shoes off . " But it was plain that Skinner 's views on where to draw the line between pleasure and indulgence had changed very little since he had written Walden Two . A note headed " Food " read , in part : I ) Nutrition 2 ) Pleasure 2 ) must never conflict with 1 ) . No excessive feasts ( base level not requiring them ) . Schedules are important . No between meals , midnight snacks , etc .... By the time I had finished going through the folder , Skinner had long since switched off his overhead light and his timer and left for the meeting . I tried to puzzle out why his scheme for bringing harmony and order into the messy , intemperate lives of his fellowmen seemed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's idea that man , by facing the tact that he is not godlike , can prepare to play a godlike role in recreating himself . The trouble is with the kind of new society and new man that Skinner wants to create . It is not just that drinking would be frowned on in his Utopia , midnight snacks forbidden , and meals enlivened by readings of the guildcode . Far worse is the fact that the productive , contented people who would make up Skinner 's new society would he about as exciting as so many bowls of junket . It does n't make things any better that if one were a new man oneself , one would n't presumably be bothered by this . WHAT KIND OF NEW MAN ? S KINNER has often said that a bad man can design a good culture . Near the end of Walden Two , he has Frazier , the founder , say to Burris , the professor , " You think I 'm conceited , aggressive , tactless , selfish . " Frazier tacitly concedes that the characterization is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the community he has built " But God damn it , Burris ! Ca n't you see ? " he asks . " **31;1906;TOOLONG ! " It is also possible for a good man to design a bad culture , and Skinner and his fictional surrogate , Frazier , offer a case in point . For all that Frazier would he a most cantankerous and irritating companion , he is the only character in Walden Two one would care to spend any time with . It is likewise clear that it would be a dreary Utopia in which no one would ever grow up to be a cranky , stubborn , inventive iconoclast like Skinner . The point has been well made by Carl Rogers , a former president of the American Psychological Association , and the originator of the technique known as client-centered therapy . In a debate with Skinner several years ago , Rogers argued that the values implicit in Skinner 's determination to make men happy , well-behaved , and productive were stultifying ones . He added : " I can only feel that he was choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hate to see Skinner become ' well-behaved : as that term would be defined for him by behavioral scientists . And the most awful fate I can imagine for him would be to have him constantly ' happy . ' It is the Fact that he is very unhappy about many things which makes me prize him . "
