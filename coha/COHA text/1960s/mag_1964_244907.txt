Major Government and business forecasts of the nation 's year-to-year growth have been wrong by 30% to 40% since 1947 . Reason : shaky projections based on shoddy statistics . This disconcerting report came last week from the privately financed National Bureau of Economic Research , and it further darkened the shadow of doubt that hovers over many of the indicators used by businessmen to reach their decisions to spend , lend or cut back . <P> The Government spends $100 million a year to find and refine the modern statistics that measure where U.S. business stands and is likely to move next , and industry and private economic groups spend millions more . But the U.S. economy has changed so quickly in recent years that many statistical standbys have become insensitive , inaccurate or downright misleading . <P> Some long-revered statistics that U.S. businessmen would do well to treat with caution : <P> <P> - DEPARTMENT STORE SALES : Last week businessmen were cheered by reports of rising department stores sales for June in the telltale New York City area . This statistic , like many commonly used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy , since it fails to measure the growth of discount houses and other fast-expanding stores that have no index of their own . Says Roye L. Lowry , executive secretary of the Federal Statistics Users ' Conference : " Considering that drugstores now sell pots and pans and that supermarkets sell clothes and fertilizer , the figures on department store sales really do n't tell very much . " Much more meaningful as an indicator is the overall figure for retail sales , which has been showing gains that are steady-but less spectacular than those of department store sales . <P> - FREIGHT CARLOADiNGS : Bernard Baruch is reputed to have said long ago that the surest way to gauge the whole economy is to " watch freight carload-ings . " That was long before trucks and planes captured such a large share of the changing cargo market , and also before freight cars were built bigger to carry more cargo . Result : freight loadings often go down-as they have for four of the past ten weeks-at the same time that total cargo tonnage goes up . For such reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week announced that it will no longer issue carloading figures to the public . <P> - UNEMPLOYMENT : The problem is serious-the unemployment rate in June rose from 5.1% to 5.3%-but it is not as bad as the figures indicate . In its overly broad definition of " unemployment , " the Government counts among the jobless such people as fulltime students looking for part-time work , and the job-seeking wives and children of laid-off workers . What if other countries did the same ? Sweden , celebrated land of low unemployment , not long ago adopted the U.S. system ; to their chagrin , the Swedes soon found that their national unemployment rate was four times higher than under their old , looser standards . <P>
