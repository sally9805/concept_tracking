PORTRAIT OF A KLANSMAN Exalted Cyclops of a klavern in North Carolina , Raymond Cranford talked freely to a ' Post ' reporter , revealing a side of the Klan that few outsiders see . BY STEWART ALSOP R aymond Cranford . an Exalted Cyclops of the Ku Klux Klan in North Carolina , is a bullet-headed man with expressionless , black-rimmed eyes , who wears his hair close cropped , military fashion . Cranford fully expects to be framed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation . or killed by Negroes or Communists , and he always has a rifle or pistol within easy reach . He talks a good deal about the last war , in which he was wounded , and about the Communists , who are . he believes , getting ready to assume power , and about guns , which he loves . But wherever a conversation with Cranford starts , it always comes back to the same subject  --  what Cranford calls " niggers . " " The word Negro , " he explained , within five minutes of our meeting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks and there 's niggers , there ai n't no Negroes . " I first met Raymond Cranford at the airport in Raleigh . N.C. , where we had lunch . That lunch Photographs by 0/fie Atkins was my first exposure to his way of talking , which is a kind of brutal monologue . The Raleigh airport restaurant is desegregated , and I pointed to a Negro who was eating next to a white man at one end of the lunch counter . I asked Cranford if the Negro 's presence bothered him . " If that man sitting next him wants to eat like a nigger , " said Cranford . " that 's his business . But if that nigger was to come to this table , I 'd know how to handle him . I 'd say I 'd got some alligators I 'd like to feed . " He looked around the table with a small , closed-mouth grin  --  he does not show his teeth when he smiles , and he hardly ever laughs . Then the monologue started . A few excerpts will suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than a nigger . A white nigger 's a man 's got a white skin , and a heart that 's pumpin ' nigger blood through his veins . If it comes to a fight , the white nigger 's gon na get killed before the nigger , " " You come from Washington ? I call Washington Hersheytown  --  ninety percent chocolate and ten percent nuts . " " We believe a white man 's got his civil rights too . I 'll lay down my life for those rights , if I have to . These nigger civil rights , they 're gon na end in the white man 's bedroom . " " We do n't believe in burning crosses on a man 's lawn . If I 'm gon na burn a cross , I ram it through the man and burn it . " This with a small grin . " When the Communists take over , they 're gon na kill me quick . Well , you only got one time to die . " " I got a daughter , she 's nineteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find her with a nigger , I 'll take my gun and I 'll blow her brains right out of her head . " These observations are not very pretty or enlightening , and in the time I spent with Raymond Cranford , I heard them repeated almost literally PORTRAIT OF A KLANSMAN ad 11 a liSf ( 111i . And yet it is worth trying to understand Raymond Cranford , for he is one of a very large number of Americans who are wholly alienated from the comfortable American society that most of us know . In the Klan oath , the world outside the Klan is called " the alien world , " and in the eyes of a Klansman like Raymond Cranford , that world is heavily populated by " Communists , " " white niggers , " and other enemies . North Carolina has an old and well-earned reputation for moderation in race relations . Nevertheless , as the recent investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee established , North Carolina 's Ku Klux Klan , nonexistent three years ago , is now bigger and better organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been estimated as high as 20.000 . The hard core of the Klan is in the flat , sandy , cotton-andtobacco country in the eastern part of the state , where Negroes make up more than 40 percent of the population . The hard core of this hard core is in Greene County . where Exalted Cyclops Raymond Cranford presides over his klavern . I owe my introduction to Raymond Cranford to a 33-year-old reporter called Pete Young . Young has spent the last two years covering the mushroom growth of North Carolina 's Klan , and he has become a close friend of Exalted Cyclops Cranford , Grand Dragon Robert Jones , and dozens of assorted Klaliffs , Kleagles . Klokkards , Kludds. and just plain Knights . Young had invited me to have a look at the Klan , and offered to act as my guide . 1 had accepted , and asked Ted Ellsworth , an old friend , and Post photographer 011ie Atkins to go with me . Cranford was in the marines in World War II , he told us at lunch , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got backward reflexes , " he said . " I got no sense of fear . Till I was twelve years old , I could n't get to sleep at night without a light in the room . But when I 'm in danger . I 'm cool . " Cranford smokes constantly  --  upwards of four packs a day , he says . His nails are chewed to the quick , and he has bleeding ulcers . He used to drink a lot , but no longer . " When I was in the marines , I used to go out snipin ' Japs with one canteen of water and one of alcohol . In the Klan , you ca n't get drunk , and you ca n't swear . " Cranford is deeply proud of being a Klansman . " My daddy and my granddaddy were in the Klan , " he says . " I was born in the Klan . " He is. he says , " a Klansman full time and a farmer part time . " He owns a 200-acre farm with a 22-acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings him a net profit of around $11,000 . But Raymond Cranford does not think of himself as a prosperous citizen . " They would n't let a pore white like me past the door of the Waldorf-Astoria in New York . " he said , as we walked to the parking lot . " So why should a nigger go anywhere he wants ? " Between the bucket seats of Cranford 's red , late-model car there was a bone-handled pistol and cartridge belt , and a rifle hung in a halter arrangement by the left front door . Cranford demonstrated how he would react if a " nigger or Communist " threatened him in the car . When he opened the door , he could fire his rifle without taking it out of its halter . The hollow-pointed bullets , he explained , would catch a man in the legs or stomach . " Mister , with this little gun , " he said , " you can blow a hole through a man , you could walk right through it . " I can outrun any FBI car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . as we started on the drive to Greene County . " Course , the FBI taps my phone . I got an alibi for every cotton-pickin ' minute , but they 'll find a way to frame me . " To the relief of his passengers , he turned out to be a cautious driver , careful about passing , and stopping at all stop signs . Cranford is very proud of being Exalted Cyclops , or No. 1 man , of his klavern . A klavern is the basic Klan unit , with membership ranging from a dozen or so to a couple of hundred  --  Cranford said he had about 130 men in his klavern . He was also , he said proudly , a major in the " V.I.P. Security Guard " of the Klan . As such , he wears a major 's oak leaves , and a helmet liner , uniform , and regulation paratroop boots at the Klan 's cross-burning rallies . His job is to guard the Grand Dragon , the Imperial Wizard , and other Very Important Persons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pockets at a rally . You lay a hand on the Grand Dragon or the Imperial Wizard , and fren , you 're daid . " As an Exalted Cyclops , Cranford said , he had direct access at any time of the day or night to the Imperial Wizard himself , Robert Shelton of Alabama , to whom he always referred respectfully as " Mr. Shelton . " " I ca n't get to see ' Light Bulb ' Johnson , " Cranford said . " I ca n't get to see the governor . They would n't give me the time of day . But I can call Mr. Shelton any time of the day or night . There 's the number one man in the nation , and he 'll take his time and money to talk to me , or come and see me any time . " A man could identify himself as a Klansman if he wanted to . Cranford said , but no other Klansman would identify him , on pain of death . " In some places , " he explained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people  --  they wo n't say it 's because they 're in the Klan , but they 'll always find some excuse . " Then there are anti-Klan people in Greene County ? " Some , but everybody knows they 're just after the nigger dollar . " By this time we had arrived at the motel where we were to stay . When Grand Dragon Jones was in the neighborhood some months earlier , Cranford said , the manager refused to give him a room . Cranford gleefully explained how he dealt with this insult to the Grand Dragon : " I went to the manager , and I said , ' Now , fren , I 'm not threatenin ' anybody . But I got twenty niggers working at my place , and they 're real dirty niggers , why I bet they have n't washed for weeks , and they sure do stink . Now I want a public apology to the Grand Dragon , and if I do n't get it . I 'm gon na register those twenty niggers right here . If you take them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down . If you do n't take them , I 'm gon na prosecute you under the Civil Rights Act . ' So he apologized . " That evening we drove over to Raymond Cranford 's house for supper and found that quite a little party had been laid on for us . We were introduced to Mrs. Cranford , a strong-faced woman with reddish hair , and to Bob Littleton , the Exalted Cyclops of a klavern in neighboring Pitt County , and his wife . A Kleagle. or recruiter for the Klan , who did n't want to be identified , was there , and so was the Night Hawk of Cranford 's klavem . The Night Hawk , whose job it is to organize the Klan 's cross-burning rallies . is a sad-faced , monosyllabic farmer called Bennie Earle Oates . Also at the party were Cranford 's 19-yearold daughter and nine-year-old son , as well as various in-laws and other children . The Cranfords live in a small brick house , close to a village street . The furniture is the kind that is meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old-fashioned front parlor. a dining room and a " family room " at the back . The party moved into the family room . No liquor was served . Somebody put a record on the phonograph . The song 's endlessly repeated refrain was : Mor , those niggers north , if they do n't like our southern ways . MOH those ? riggers north . Cranford pointed to his young son 's school book  --  there was a big KKK scrawled in ink across its cover . " He 's born into the Klan too , " Cranford said proudly . When the record stopped . the male members of the party moved into the dining room and were served a good meal of barbecued chicken by the Inches , who ate afterward . The conversation was dominated , as always , by Raymond Cranford . There were a couple of units of the Deacons for Defense . the armed Negro organization , in the area , he said , " But we 're not scared of them . You start poppin ' bullets around a nigger , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other Klansmen interrupted to say that the Klan was " against violence , except in self-defense , " which is the official Klan line . " That 's right , " said Cranford . " We believe in ballots , not bullets  --  a Klansman gets out of line , and the Grand Dragon will clobber him . " But the bullets kept creeping into the conversation . " I 'm not here to shoot a nigger , but if trouble starts . the white nigger 's first on my list . " " Sure . the white niggers 'll get it first , Say there 's a bird on the fence and another bird scrunched down behind the fence . Which one 's gon na get shot first ? " How much danger , I asked , was there of some sort of Negro uprising in the area  --  something like Watts ? " Not a chance , " said Cranford , and the others nodded in agreement . " Look . I can have a thousand men in one hour , with air-cooled machine guns and two cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klan than in any other organization except the V.F.W. We did n't fight in World War Two just to let the niggers take over the country . That 's not a threat . That 's a promise . " In the living room , after supper , the guns came out . Everybody seemed to have a gun  --  all the children had toy guns . Cranford showed the shotgun he had won for recruiting members into the Klan , and Littleton passed around his new high-powered rifle . Then Cranford put on his Exalted Cyclops robes , white with a crimson hood . " They call these robes berisheets. " he said indignantly . " Bedsheets ! You just feel that satin . That 's the finest quality there is . " We got up to go , and I thanked Mrs. Cranford for the delicious chicken dinner . " Now , when you come to write that article , " she said , in a sweet-southern voice , " you be fair . You 're not fair , I 'm coming to Washington with a machine gun . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly built klavern  --  permission to show these previously secret Klan meeting halls had apparently come from higher authority . The klavern turned out to be a long , windowless cinderblock but with a cement floor . In the middle of the floor was the " altar " ? a wooden table with a bayonet and a Bible on it , flanked by the U.S. and Confederate flags , backed by a cross lit by bulbs . On the wall behind the " altar " were two signs : FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT . DIE IF WE MUST , BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER , IN GOD WE TRUST , and A MAN NEVER STOOD SO TALL AS WHEN HE STOOPED TO HELP A CHILD . The first is the official Klan motto . Putting up the second , Cranford said proudly . was his own idea . On a mantelpiece were two long strips of rubber tire , attached to wooden handles . These were used , said the Kleagle who did n't want to be identified , to " teach informers a lesson . " The Klan . Cranford explained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gets out of line " ? drinks too much , or " cheats on his wife , " or disgraces the Klan in some way  --  may be tried by a Klan court , and punished appropriately . The Klan is , in fact , a kind of inner government  --  a Klansman swears allegiance to the Klan above any allegiance to the " alien world . " To us outsiders , the visit to Cranford 's klavern was a bit anticlimactic  --  we had expected something more sinister . Perhaps sensing our disappointment . Cranford seized the bayonet and began demonstrating his " karate , " showing how , if a " nigger or a Communist " made a grab for the bayonet , he would plunge it into his adversary 's stomach ? " I 'll just shove it in , by instinct . " We piled into cars again , to have a look at Bob Littleton 's klavern . It is bigger than Cranford 's , with seats for more than 100 people . There is also an open coffin  --  to scare the initiates  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post , including a picture of the murdered civil-rights worker , Mrs. Liuzzo , walking with two Negroes . Littleton and the Kleagle both pointed out the damning fact that she was walking barefoot . There was , we " aliens " agreed at the motel , something very sad about the dreary little klaverns with their kitchen tables masquerading as " altars , " and their coffee cans filled with old cigarette butts and their hand-lettered , misspelled signs ; and something very sad about the Klan . The next day , Cranford showed up bright and early with his Klaliff , or No. 2 man . The Klaliti ( who did n't want to be identified ) turned out to be a pleasant-mannered , freckle-faced young man . He had been in the Korean war , and like most Klansmen we met , he had been a combat soldier . Cranford took us to the " nigger school " which was , he said , bigger , newer , and more expensive than the white school . I asked if integration of the school had started . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We " aliens " got out to talk to the principal of the Negro school while the Klansmen stayed in the car outside . The principal is a soft-voiced , articulate Negro called Raymond Morris . Yes , he said , it was quite true  --  the Negro school was newer and better equipped than the white school . Had integration started ? Yes , it had started  --  three specially chosen Negro children had been sent to the white school , in September . They had got along well for a month . " But then an unfortunate thing happened , " Morris said , in his quiet , singsong voice . " One night , someone shot into the homes of the children who had gone to the white school . No one was hurt , but the parents had a natural reluctance to keep the children in that school . " Later we asked Cranford about the shooting incident . He grunted , but for once he said nothing . That afternoon , we went to the town of Ayden , where , Cranford said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a store , a line of Negro children were carrying signs reading No HIRING No Bu'iING Or WE 'RE TIRED OF BEING BAGBOYS AND MAIDS . This trouble , Cranford said , had been " stirred up " by the local head of the N.A.A.C.P. , an undertaker called Gratz Norcott . " He stirs up the trouble , and him being an undertaker. if the trouble gets bad . he stands to get all the business . I tole him , if one of my guys gets hurt , I 'm not gon na horse around , I 'm comin ' right after you . " Norcott , it turned out . had his office in a small house across the street from the store . Ted Ellsworth suggested that we call on Norcott. and get his side of the story . The idea of a confrontation with Norcott had clearly never occurred to Cranford . But he interpreted the suggestion as a challenge to his courage . So he squared his shoulders and strode into the little house , followed by the Klaliff , the Night Hawk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the time I elbowed my way into it . whatever greetings had been exchanged between Cranford and Norcott had already occurred , and an uncomfortable silence reigned . Norcott , a middle-aged Negro with an expressionless face , was at his desk , with a telephone held against an ear . Occasionally he would mutter something into the telephone , but there were long stretches when he said nothing at all . I shook his hand , and it was wet with sweat , and when he lit a cigarette , the match wavered . But if Norcott was scared by this surprise visit from the Klan , his self-control was remarkable . For a while , as Norcott held the telephone up to his ear , we white men stood around rather sheepishly  --  there were only two chairs in the PORTRAIT OF A KLANSMAN office . Then Norcott held the telephone away from his ear and addressed Cranford in a polite but authoritative tone : " Mr. Cranford , there are some chairs right across the hall there . Will you fetch a few so these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and glared at Norcott , then got the chairs . We all sat down . At last Norcott put the telephone in its cradle . While he was explaining his side of the " trouble " ? the store did most of its business with Negroes , he said , and the Negroes wanted one of the three cashiers ' jobs  --  two young , tough-looking Negroes came into the office , followed by an elderly Negro minister and a Negro doctor . Obviously news of the confrontation had spread rapidly . The two young men were field workers for Martin Luther King 's Southern Christian Leadership Conference . One was a native North Carolinian , the other came from the Bronx . Norcott introduced them , and then introduced Cranford : " Mr. Cranford here is the Cyclops  --  is that right , Mr. Cranford ? Yes , the Exalted Cyclops of the Ku Klux Klan . " There was no hint of a smile , only the faint emphasis on the ridiculous adjective . Cranford , sensing a challenge , glared at the Negro from the Bronx , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not threatenin ' you , I 'm just givin ' you a bit of advice . You and me , we do n't see things the same way , but we 'll get along all right . just so long as you do n't bring in outsiders to make trouble . If you 're gon na bring in outsiders , you could be asking for real bad trouble . Now , is that a gamble you want to take ? " " Well , now , Mr. Cranford , " said Norcott. his tone polite , almost soothing , " when you had your rallies here last summer , I think I 'm right , you brought in Mr. Shelton , the Imperial Wizard . I think you call him , from Alabama . And I heard you hring in some Grand Dragons , or what is it you call them , from as far away as Ohio . Is n't that right ? " " Well , let me tell you something , " said Cranford , " I do n't believe in threatenin ' a man . or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like about you , I just walk right up to you in the street and bust you right in the nose . " " Well , now . Mr. Cranford , " said Norcott , more soothingly than ever , " I would n't walk right up to you and punch you in the nose . I 'd discuss the matter with you . And if we could n't agree , then I 'd put the matter in the hands of the law . because we in the N.A.A.C.P. , we believe in the law , we ' hey the laws of the land . " By this time Cranford was both angry and a little confused , like a bull after the picadors had worked him over . " I 'm against violence . " he said , his voice rising " but I 'm gon na protect my rights , and if anybodywants a fight , he can get what he wants . Why , few weeks ago , three niggers pulled up beside my car , 1 seen they had guns , and I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " " SHUT UP , RAYMOND , " Pete Young said , suddenly and loudly . Cranford subsided . There was some further sparring . Then Cranford said , rather plaintively , " You nigras talk about discrimination . Why , right here , some cops will give a Klansman a ticket just because he 's a Klansman . ' At this point , Dr. Andrew Best , a Negro physician with a round , good-humored face , intervened for the first time . He spoke with quiet passion : " But ca n't you see , that 's just what they 've been doing to us as long as we 've lived , giving us a ticket just because we 're Negroes . " " The word ' Negro ' , " Cranford said , in a Pavlovian reaction . " that 's not in my vocabulary . There 's colored folk and there 's niggers , there ai n't no Negroes . " " Mr. Cranford , " said Dr. Best , in a tone of infinite earnestness , " I want to ask you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to imagine what your life would be like if my color was your color and your color was my color . Can you imagine what that would be like ? " " Listen , fren , " said Cranford , " do you think life 's easy for the pore white man in the South ? " Cranford got up suddenly and strode out to his car . followed by the Klaliff and the Night Hawk , while we outsiders shook hands with the Negroes and muttered good-byes . That evening the Exalted Cyclops , the Klaliff. the Night Hawk , and a couple of local Knights joined us " aliens " in a motel room , and we drank a few bourbons and talked . I asked the Klansmen why they hated Negroes . They seemed genuinely surprised . " We do n't hate the niggers , " the Klaliff said , and the others agreed . Cranford told how he supported a family of " no-count niggers " on his place . " We do n't hate niggers , long 's they behave like colored people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't understand niggers . A nigger 's like a dog , he can smell it when you 're scared of him . " There was a silence . Raymond Cranford looked musingly at his big hands . " These hands of mine , " he said . " They 're my secret weapon . By rights they ought to be locked up as a deadly weapon . My hands are like knives  --  they 'll cut a man right across . I can kill a man with the open hand . The tougher the man is , the better I like it . " Cranford had had nothing to drink . He began talking then about a poor white family we had visited that afternoon . The wife and children had come to the door for groceries supplied by the Klan . The man ha.1 been lurking somewhere in the house . He was a drunk , and lie had left his fields untended , and could not hold a job . " I 'm going out there again , maybe tomorrow . " Cranford said , " and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straighten out , or I 'll bust your tail . ' Then maybe I 'll shove him up against the wall . and slap him up against the side of a truck , and maybe turn him upside down and shake his brains up a bit . Then I 'll tell him , ' Fren , you straighten yourself out , and then we 'll go out and get you a job so you can support your family . ' Course now , I 'm not goin ' to hurt him , not unless he fights back . If man do n't fight back I ca n't stand to whup him . But if he just puts his fists up , man I lore that . I 'll just tear his tail up . " There was another silence , as we contemplated Cranford 's cure for alcoholism . Then the Klansmen began talking about the rallies the Klan had held every night in the summer  --  the burning crosses made of big trees dragged out of the forests , the " nigger speeches . " the crowds of robed Klansmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him a " real religious feeling . " Pete Young described a rally at which Collie Leroy Wilkins and the other Alabama Klansmen accused of killing Mrs. Liuzzo had been introduced to the crowd . They were greeted , Young said . with a wild roar of enthusiasm , and the other Klansmen who had been present at the rally nodded happily at the recollection . It is a reporter 's job to listen , to ask questions , to try to understand , to avoid emotional involvement . But suddenly I felt involved , and angry . " Look , " I said to the freckle-faced " you 're proud of having fought for your country . and you 're right to be proud . But a young man shooting an unarmed woman through the head at a range of ten feet ? I do n't care what she did . that 's a cowardly thing to do , and I just do n't see how a brave man like you can shout and clap for a man who did it . " There was a sudden silence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blushed beet red , as though I had said something obscene . " Well , now . " he said , " I 'm not saying I approve of what was done there , but you 've got ta remember what she was doing .... Anyway , let 's face it  --  this is a war . " There was another silence . Cranford said nothing , but he stared sullenly with his black-rimmed eyes at his big hands . his " secret weapon . " For the lirst and only time . I smelled danger . Then Pete Young changed the subject , and the smell passed . One by one we drifted off to bed . As I was saying good night , the young Klaliff stopped me. and said earnestly . as though trying hard to explain something to me : " Maybe there 's something you do n't understand , coming from the North When it comes to a woman , in the South . why . tiere 's nothing thats respected any more than that . " The next morning Raymond Cranford greeted us bright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Night Hawk . So was a high Klan official , the Grand Klokkard of the Realm , a youngish man with a very thin face . quiet manners . and hard eyes . called Sonny Fischer . The Grand Klokkard insisted on showing us his klavern . Like Littleton 's , Fischer 's klavern boasted an open coffin . There were two hand-lettered signs in the coffin  --  A NIGGER TRIDE A NIGGER DIED , and THIS Box IS RESERVED FOR MR . BIG MOUTH . Hanging from a wall nearby were two of the long five-cell flashlights which Klansmen carry at rallies  --  they make very effective clubs , and to make them more effective . they are sometimes lined with lead . One of these flashlights had a deep dent in it . I asked how the dent was made . " On a burrhead. " someone said , and the Klansmen laughed . Behind the coffin there were two signs which read Out GOVERN r Is DEAD . There was the now familiar picture of Mrs. Liuzzo. walking with two Negroes  --  again , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her hand . And hanging from a knob was a little plastic doll of a Negro child . The doll  --  it was a girl , in a cotton dress  --  had a hangman 's noose tied around its neck . I asked about this , too , and was told it was " just a joke . " I remembered the sign Raymond Cranford had posted in his klavern , and of which he was so proud : A MAN NEVER STOOD SO TALL AS WHEN HE STOOPED TO HELP A CHILD . Later that day , we said good-bye to Raymond Cranford and his fellow Klansmen . Cranford passed around stickers which read : THE KNIGHTS OF THE Ku KLUX KLAN IS WATCHING YOU and BE A MAN JOIN THE KLAN and You HAVE BEEN VISITED BY THE Ku KLUX KLAN . " Now , you just stick those on Light-Bulb Johnson 's desk when you get up there to Hershey-town. " he said , and laughed out loud , for the first time , at his own joke . Have I been fair to Raymond Cranford ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun to Washington ? The Kleagle. the Klokkard. the Night Hawk , Exalted Cyclops Littleton and their wives and children seemed polite , pleasant-mannered people . Raymond Cranford and the other Klansmen were no doubt brave men and patriots by their own lights . And they were all people who wanted very badly . almost desperately . to be understood . Yet , I never did really understand them . " Maybe there 's something you do n't understand . coming from the North , " the young Klaliff said . Maybe there is . But . how do you understand people who seem to be moral people . and who feel quite sincerely that a picture of a woman walking with Negroes. with her shoes off , justifies her murder ? ?
