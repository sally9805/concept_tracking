Can machines become truly intelligent ? Mathematician John D. Williams of the Rand Corp . told a Tempe , Ariz. meeting of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics that they can and probably will become more intelligent than man . <P> Dr. Williams has respect enough for the human brain . It does some things very well , he said , such as recalling almost instantly bits of information that have been in dead storage for years . It is also capable of abstractions as varied as the theory of relativity and the Song of Solomon . It can think about itself , he added , and assign value judgments to what it thinks-such as that its thinking is wonderful . ' Giant electronic computers in existence at present can do none of these things . <P> Item for Survival . Trouble is , the human brain , said Williams , is badly organized , inaccurate and slow . It is so complicated that to copy it artificially would be practically impossible . But , according to Williams , solving the problem of copying the brain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for intelligence . " The brain of man , like that of other vertebrates , is an item of random design to meet one basic purpose : survival . The fact that it has outthought things like saber-toothed tigers is no evidence that it is particularly apt for abstract thinking . " <P> Creators of intelligent artificial brains , said Williams , should strive for machines that are designed and built specially for abstract thinking . The necessary hardware will soon be available : electronic units , analogous to brain cells , that can be produced by the billion , be made too small to see with a microscope , send 100 million signals per second , never make mistakes and last indefinitely . Computers made of these wonderful gadgets and geared for abstract thought should be able to outthink the brightest human brain . <P> Williams did not explain how artificial superbrains will be designed or built . He seems to think that the best policy is to encourage existing electronic computers to design their own successors , developing more intelligence at each step . When computer evolution has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from competition . Humans can do so , said Williams , by defining intelligence so as to exclude the machine achievement . <P> In a future universe dominated intellectually by brainy machines , Williams sees one faint hope for man : " The science of genetics is young and moving swiftly . We may learn how to design our children on the machines . "
