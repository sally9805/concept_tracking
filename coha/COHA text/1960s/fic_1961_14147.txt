The kitchen-garden behind the convent . A number of low benches surround the playing area . The actors ' entrance at the back represents a door into the convent ; it is framed by a trellis covered with vines . Opposite , the aisle through the audience represents a path to the village street . A young girl , Pica , twelve , barefoot and wearing a simple smock , comes running out of the convent ; she stares down the aisle through the audience and must n't come here today . Go home ! Go HOME ! ! We have someone specially important coming and you must n't be here ! Go home ! You 'll spoil everything ! ( Mona Lucrezia , looking much older than her forty years , comes lurching through the audience to the stage . She is crazy . Her black , gray and white hair is uncombed . She carries a large soiled shawl . She mumbles to herself as she advances . ) MONA LUCREZIA Do n't make such a noise , child . I must think what I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away . I must think . PICA No , you go away .  --  Oh , this is terrible ! ( Pica turns and rushes into the convent , calling : ) Mother Clara ! Mother Clara ! MONA LUCREZIA ( Shouting ) It 's I who have someone important coming  --  not you . And ( Worriedly ) I must be ready . It 's so hard to be ready . I must put gold on my hair and perfumes , more perfumes . He 'll have elephants and camels . ( Mother Clara , thirty-one , enters and stands at the convent door looking thoughtfully at Mona Lucrezia . Pica passes her and comes toward the center of the stage. ) p. 3 PICA Mother , she must n't be here today when he comes . Tell Old Thomas to drive her away . She 'll sing and make a noise and spoil everything .  --  Old Crazy , go home ! Mother Clara , we would die of shame , if he heard the things she says . MOTHER CLARA ( Quietly , her gaze on Mona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know me ?  --  What is her name , Pica ? PICA I do n't know . I 've forgotten . MOTHER CLARA Go and ask Old Thomas what her name is . I do n't want you to call her Old Crazy .  --  Has she a home to go to ? PICA Oh , Mother  --  she is very rich . But her family drives her out of the house all day . ( Mona has seated herself on one of the benches , her elbows on her knees . She is staring at the ground . ) MOTHER CLARA Go and find out what her name is . ( Pica runs into the convent . ) Mona , do you know me ? Mona , do you know me ? I am Mother Clara of the Poor Sisters at Saint Damian 's . Do you know me ? What is your name ? MONA LUCREZIA ( Rising ; impressively ) I am who I am.  --  He is coming today . You know I am the Queen of p. 4 MOTHER CLARA What ? Who is coming ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king ? MONA LUCREZIA ( Becoming confused ) The King of Solomon . To see me . I must be ready . He is coming from France . And MOTHER CLARA From France ? ! ! MONA LUCREZIA Of course , from France . I must have presents to give him . And He will have lions . And MOTHER CLARA Yes . You must be ready , Mona . ( In order to induce Mona to leave the garden , Clara crosses the stage and starts walking backward through the audience . ) Come . You must go to your home and make yourself ready . Look ! Just look ! You must comb your hair beautifully . And you must wash your face !  --  Who is it you say is coming ? MONA LUCREZIA ( Following her ; angrily ) I told you  --  the King of Solomon Of France . That is : French France . I did n't love him  --  no ! ; but he loved me . But now he has become a great person and he sends me all these messages . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the floor in a troubled way ; softly ) Did I tell you the truth ? Did I love him ? Did I ?  --  Oh , he wrote such songs for me . Songs and songs . p. 5 MOTHER CLARA Come , Mona . I think you should rest , too . MONA LUCREZIA ( Confidentially ) If I walk slowly he will not see that I am lame . One of the boys in the street kicked me . MOTHER CLARA Kicked ! ! Yes , walk slowly . Like a queen . No , no , stand up straight , Mona  --  like a queen . You can do it . Come . What will you say when you see the king ? MONA LUCREZIA I shall say ( Standing straight ) Oh , King of Solomon , I shall say : Change the world ! MOTHER CLARA ( Astonished ) You will say that ? MONA LUCREZIA They throw stones at me . They kick me . Everywhere people hate people . My daughters  --  with brooms  --  they drive me away . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun goes down . And I shall say : Oh , King , change the hearts of the world . MOTHER CLARA ( Returns to the stage ; as Mona passes her on the way to the village ) That is a very good thing to say . You wo n't forget it ? MONA LUCREZIA ( Loudly ) The world is bad . MOTHER CLARA Yes . p. 6 MONA LUCREZIA Nobody is kind anymore . MOTHER CLARA You tell your daughters that Mother Clara of Saint Damian 's says that they are to let you into the house ; and you will wash your face and your hair , wo n't you ? And God bless you , dear Mona , and make you wise wise and beautiful for your friend . ( Mona has almost disappeared . From the convent sounds of joyous cries and laughter . Pica comes running out like an arrow . ) PICA ( Shrilly ) He has come , Mother Clara . Father Francis is here ! ( She flies back into the convent . ) MONA LUCREZIA ( Returning a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLARA Yes and beautiful . Good-bye , Mona . Remember . Good-bye . MONA LUCREZIA ( Mumbling ) Wise and beautiful ( She goes out ) ( Francis appears at the convent door . He is forty , browned by the weather , almost blind , and with very few teeth . Also he is very happy . Clara , joyously , and as lightly as a young girl , runs to the center of the stage and falls on her knees. ) p. 7 MOTHER CLARA Bless me , Father . FATHER FRANCIS ( Kneels , facing her ) God bless you , dearest Sister , with all His love .  --  And now you bless me , Sister . MOTHER CLARA ( Lowered eyes , laughing protest ) Father ! FATHER FRANCIS Say after me : God bless you , Brother Francis , and God forgive you that load of sins with which you have offended Him . MOTHER CLARA God bless you , Brother Francis , with all His love . FATHER FRANCIS And MOTHER CLARA ( Rippling laughter of protest ) I can not say that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedience . MOTHER CLARA And God forgive you that load of sins  --  Father !  --  with which you have offended Him .  --  There ! FATHER FRANCIS Yes . ( They both stay on their knees a moment , looking at one another , radiantly . Francis rises first and says with a touch of earnest injunction : ) I want you to say that prayer that whole prayer for me , every day . p. 8 MOTHER CLARA I will , Father .  --  Now sit in the sun . The meal will be ready very soon . FATHER FRANCIS ( Sitting ) And how is my little plant ? MOTHER CLARA ( Again soft running laughter ) Your little plant is very well , Father . FATHER FRANCIS Let me see was it ten years ago we cut off your beautiful hair and found you a bridegroom ? MOTHER CLARA Ten years ago next month . FATHER FRANCIS Yes Never , Sister Clara , have I seen a more beautiful wedding MOTHER CLARA ( Blushing with pleasure ) Father ! FATHER FRANCIS ( Softly ) Except , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  yours . We know all about that  --  to the Lady Poverty . FATHER FRANCIS The Lady Poverty . MOTHER CLARA Yes .  --  And how are you , dear Father ? FATHER FRANCIS Well Well MOTHER CLARA And your eyes ? p. 9 FATHER FRANCIS Oh , Sister I can see the path . I can see the brothers and sisters . I can see the Crucified on the wall . MOTHER CLARA Oh , then , I 'm so happy . I 'd heard that you had some difficulty . FATHER FRANCIS ( Emphatically ) Oh , yes , I can see . ( Confidentially ) Maybe I 'm a little bit blind ; but I hear so well . I hear so much better . MOTHER CLARA Do you ? FATHER FRANCIS Everything talks all the time . The trees . And the water . And the stones . MOTHER CLARA ( Holding her breath ) What , Father ? FATHER FRANCIS The stones . The rocks . Now , when I go up there to pray , I must say to them : " Be quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRANCIS " Be quiet for a while . " And they are quiet . MOTHER CLARA Yes , Father . ( There is a moment while she digests this ; then she begins again with animation . ) My sisters are so happy that you have come . Sister Agnes has made something for you . Now promise that you will eat all of it . It will break her heart if you don't. p. 10 FATHER FRANCIS All ? MOTHER CLARA ( Laughing ) Oh , it is very little . We have learned that . FATHER FRANCIS All ? My stomach has grown so small ( Making a ring with his thumb and forefinger ) That is enough . MOTHER CLARA We understand . But this time there is a touch  --  a touch of saffron . FATHER FRANCIS Saffron ! ! MOTHER CLARA The Count sent it to us from the castle , especially for you . He remembered that you liked it before FATHER FRANCIS Before ? Before when ? MOTHER CLARA Well Father before Before you entered the religious life . FATHER FRANCIS ( Agitated ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men ! No , no , Sister Clara ! Go quickly and tell Sister Agnes  --  no saffron ! No saffron . MOTHER CLARA ( Calling sharply and clapping her hands ) Pica ! Pica ! ( Pica enters at once . ) PICA Yes , Mother . p. 11 MOTHER CLARA Tell Sister Agnes no saffron in Father 's dish . And do not stand by the door . PICA Yes , Mother . ( During this interchange , Mona has returned , mumbling , through the audience . ) MONA LUCREZIA They throw stones at me . They kick me . Hmm . But when the king comes they will learn who I am . Hmm . They will sing another song . MOTHER CLARA ( Her eyes again thoughtfully on Mona , who has seated herself on one of the benches ) She has lost her wits She comes of a prosperous family , but they send her out of the house all day . I think the children torment her . She likes to come and sit here , rain or shine .  --  Father  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that King Solomon is coming to visit her ! FATHER FRANCIS ( Delighted ) She thinks she is ! How rich she is . How happy she must be ! MOTHER CLARA ( Pointing to her own forehead ) Yes  --  but she is touched . FATHER FRANCIS Touched ? Oh , touched .  --  Is she able to receive the blessed sacrament ? MOTHER CLARA No . I think not . They tell me that in church she cries out and says unsuitable things . No , she is not allowed in the church . p. 12 FATHER FRANCIS What is her name ? MOTHER CLARA Everyone here seems to have forgotten it . They simply call her Old Crazy . We call her Mona . FATHER FRANCIS ( Taking a few steps toward Mona ) Mona ! Yes , your king is coming . MONA LUCREZIA ( Violently ) Go away from me ! I know all about your nasty filthy wicked ways ! MOTHER CLARA ( Authoritatively ) Now , Mona , you must be quiet or we will send you away  --  with a broom , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make you move . FATHER FRANCIS ( Quiets Clara with a gesture ; his eyes on Mona in reflection ) Who can measure the suffering  --  the waste  --  in the world ? And every being born into the world  --  except One  --  has added to it . You and I have made it more and more . ( He turns to Clara and adds with eager face ) Let us go to the church now and fall on our knees . Let us ask forgiveness . MOTHER CLARA Father , we shall go to the church later . Now you have come here to take the noon meal with my dear sisters . FATHER FRANCIS ( With a sigh , as of a pleasure postponed ) Yes yes . p. 13 MOTHER CLARA ( Resuming the animated tone ) You received my letter ? We ca n't give thanks enough ! More and more are coming all the time . Sometimes I 'm at my wit 's end to find room and food for all these girls and women who are coming to join us . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds and food . We always find a way . FATHER FRANCIS Yes . Yes . No one would believe how we always find more beds and food . MOTHER CLARA And their happiness ! From morning to night .  --  You will hear them sing . They have been learning some new music to sing to you . FATHER FRANCIS ( Rising , stuttering with eagerness ) Sister C-C-Clara , let us go into the chapel and thank God . MOTHER CLARA We will . We will . But now , dear Father , just for a moment , let us sit in the sun and rest ourselves . FATHER FRANCIS ( Again resigned ) Yes Very well . MOTHER CLARA Father , there is something I 've long wanted to ask you . Can we talk for a moment of childish things ?  --  Father , you will eat the noonday meal at our table today ? You will ? FATHER FRANCIS Sister ! Sister ! Ca n't I have it out here ? Where I eat it is of no importance . I shall see the sisters later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , you hurt them . FATHER FRANCIS Hurt them ? ! I hurt them ? MOTHER CLARA They can not understand it . You let Brother Avisio and Brother Juniper eat with us . FATHER FRANCIS Yes yes MOTHER CLARA But you have never sat down with us at our table Why is that ? ( Lowering her voice ) My sisters are beginning to believe that you think that women are of a lower order in God 's love . FATHER FRANCIS Sister Clara ! ! MOTHER CLARA They have heard that you share your meal with wolves and birds , but never with them .  --  Can the Father Francis whom we love  --  this once  --  sit down with us women ? FATHER FRANCIS ( Agitated slightly but compliant ) Yes oh , yes I will . MOTHER CLARA ( Urgently ) It is so important , Father . I work among these good women and girls . They have left everything . They have God in Heaven but they have very little on earth . ( He nods repeatedly . ) Thank you ! Now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother Avisio told me a short time ago that you were christened John . Is that true ? p. 15 FATHER FRANCIS Yes . Yes . John . MOTHER CLARA You chose the name Francis ? FATHER FRANCIS My friends gave it to me . But that 's long ago . MONA LUCREZIA ( From under the hood of her shawl , as though brooding to herself ) Francis the Frenchman They all called him that . That 's what I called him , too . ( After Francis and Clara have looked at Mona a moment : ) FATHER FRANCIS Long ago  --  when I was a young man . Before I found something better , I was never tired of hearing all those songs and stories that came down from France about knights in armor who went about the world killing dragons and tyrants . A growing boy must have something to admire  --  to make his heart swell . I talked about those stories to everyone I knew . I dressed myself in foreign dress . I made songs , too  --  many of them . And but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRANCIS And I heard that each of these knights had a lady . ( He looks at her with pain and appeal ) I looked everywhere . I I looked everywhere . MOTHER CLARA Do not talk of it , if it distresses you . p. 16 FATHER FRANCIS ( Low and urgently ) May God forgive me that load of sin with which I offended him ! MOTHER CLARA Yes . FATHER FRANCIS I went through a troubled time ( Suddenly he looks at her happily ) And then I found my lady . MOTHER CLARA ( Laughing ) Yes , we know , Father . FATHER FRANCIS Poverty ! And I married her ! MOTHER CLARA Yes . FATHER FRANCIS And ever since , I go about the world singing her praises . MOTHER CLARA Yes . FATHER FRANCIS ( Eagerly ) Before I knew her I was a coward . Yes . I was afraid of everything : of going into the forests at night ; I was afraid of hunger and of cold . I was afraid to knock at the doors of nobles and great people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go everywhere . I do not trouble when I go into the Pope 's presence , even . I am not afraid when twenty new brothers arrive at our house : where shall I put them ? How shall I feed them ? She shows me . ( Clara nods in complete agreement ) But how can one say how beautiful she is ! And and ( Lowering his voice ) how severe . Sometimes I almost offend her . And then I know that her eyes are turned away from me ! ( Suddenly raising his hands ) No saffron ! No saffron !  --  But most of the time we live together in great happiness . ( He crosses the stage , groping in his memory for an old song . ) That song that old song I wrote for her : When in the darkness of the night I see no lantern and no star , My lady 's eyes will bring me light.When in pathless woods I strayMy feet have stumbled in despairMy lady 's eyes will show the way . p. 17 MONA LUCREZIA When prison chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recognition ) Mona Lucrezia ! ! MONA LUCREZIA ( Harshly ) Shame on you ! To sing that song in the ears of a holy woman ! That is Mother Clara of Saint Damian 's . Cover your ears , Mother Clara . ( Advancing on Francis ) What do you know of Francis the Frenchman ? I know him . He wrote that song for me . When prison chains do fetter meAnd it is written I must dieMy lady 's eyes will set me free . Yes , we all knew that he searched for his lady . We all knew that  --  the mayor 's wife and Ninina Dono and I FATHER FRANCIS Mona Lucrezia . ( Trembling , to Clara ) Leave me alone with her . MONA LUCREZIA Mother Clara , they say that he goes all over the world now ; that he sees the Pope and says good morning , good morning ; that he 's gone to Palestine to convert the Grand Turk himself  --  MOTHER CLARA Do not be long , Father . The meal is almost ready . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) He said my body was of marble and snow  --  no , he said that my body was of fire and snow . ( She starts leaving the stage through the audience . ) He 'll convert the Grand Turk . The Devil will help him . He converted the mayor 's wife and me  --  the Devil helping him . ( Francis , shaken and speechless , stands looking after her . Pica has entered stealthily from the convent . Francis appears not to hear her. ) p. 18 PICA Father Francis , we did everything we could to prevent that crazy woman from coming here today . Mother Clara says that you are going to sit at table with the sisters  --  for the first time . You must sit quite still during the reading because Sister John of the Nails is going to draw a picture of you that we can have on the wall . When people draw you , you have to sit very still , because when you move , they ca n't see what to draw  --  ( Sounds of shouting from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me ! Peter , put down that stone ! Aiiiiiiee ! PICA Oh , Father Francis ! She 's coming back again . They 've been throwing stones at her . ( She goes down the aisle . ) Do n't come back . We 'll beat you ! FATHER FRANCIS Come here and be quiet ! ( Mona lurches back , shouting toward the street . One side of her face is covered with blood . She is struck again and sinks on one knee at the edge of the stage . ) MONA LUCREZIA Pigs  --  all of you . Lock your mothers up and there 'll be no more of you . FATHER FRANCIS Come and sit down here , Mona Lucrezia . MONA LUCREZIA ( To Francis ) Do n't strike me  --  you ! Go away from me. p. 19 FATHER FRANCIS ( Authoritatively to Pica ) Get a bowl of water and a clean cloth . Put some leaves and stems of the hazel into it . And be quick . ( Pica stands gaping . ) Be quick ! Be quick ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis ) You kicked me ! FATHER FRANCIS No , Mona Lucrezia . MONA LUCREZIA You did . FATHER FRANCIS Come over here and sit down . You are among friends now . MONA LUCREZIA ( Sitting down ) There are no friends . I do n't want any friends . I had some . ( She stares at Francis , somberly ) Who are you ? What 's your name ? FATHER FRANCIS I was christened John . MONA LUCREZIA John !  --  Do you know who John was ? FATHER FRANCIS ( In a small voice ) Yes . MONA LUCREZIA You stand there  --  idle as a log  --  and do nothing . If all the men in the world named John would join themselves together and be worthy of their name , the world would not be like that . p. 20 FATHER FRANCIS Do n't put your hand on your wound , Lucrezia . We 'll wash it in a moment . MONA LUCREZIA ( Harshly ) Do n't talk to me ! ( Silence . ) ( Then broodingly to herself ) The king will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll hide where he ca n't find me.  --  And I had something to tell him . ( Clara enters swiftly with water and a cloth . She kneels before Mona . ) MOTHER CLARA Hold your face up , Mona Lucrezia . MONA LUCREZIA Do n't touch me ! You are a holy woman . I will do it myself . Or let that log do it  --  that worthless John . ( As though overcoming a powerful repulsion , Francis applies the wet cloth to Mona 's forehead . ) MONA LUCREZIA ( Striking him ) That hurts . FATHER FRANCIS Yes , it will hurt for a minute . Sit quiet . Sit quiet . MONA LUCREZIA ( With a sob , but submitting ) That hurts . ( At a signal from Francis , Clara leaves . ) FATHER FRANCIS There , that 's better . Now your hands p. 21 MONA LUCREZIA ( With closed eyes ) They wash the dead . They washed us when we were born . ( Silence . ) FATHER FRANCIS Now your face again . MONA LUCREZIA No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to be touched . ( She takes the cloth ) ( Grumbling as though to herself ) On an important day like this ! And you one of those great good-for-nothing monks , filling your big belly with meals at other people 's tables . ( Directly at him , fiercely ) God must weep ! FATHER FRANCIS Yes . MONA LUCREZIA Francis the Frenchman became a monk . I knew him . I never said to him what I should have said . It was clear in my mind , like writing on the wall ; but I never said it . Whatever Francis the Frenchman wanted to do , oh , he did it . His will was like ! It was that that made us break our vows . I had never deceived my husband . I told him I was afraid of God . What do you suppose he said ? I told him I was afraid of losing God 's love . ( She stares at him . ) He said : all love is one ! FATHER FRANCIS No-o ! MONA LUCREZIA He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he would do anything that I ordered him to do I should have ordered him to do that though that was like writing on the wall . Even then , though I was a girl , I knew that the world was a valley without rain a city without food . I knew I felt he could ( She becomes confused ) p. 22 FATHER FRANCIS ( Low ) What would you have said , Lucrezia ? MONA LUCREZIA ( Rising ) I shall be your lady . And I command you : OWN NOTHING . No one will listen to you , if you have a roof over your head . No one will listen to you if you know where you will eat tomorrow . It is fear that has driven love out of the world and only a man without fear can bring it back . ( She glares at him a moment , then sinks back on the bench . ) But I never said it ! FATHER FRANCIS Lucrezia , do you know me ? I am Francis . MONA LUCREZIA ( Without interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going now . FATHER FRANCIS ( Calling ) Pica ! Pica ! MONA LUCREZIA ( Starting to the town ) I 'm tired but I 'm afraid of the butcher 's dog and the mayor 's  --  FATHER FRANCIS Pica ! ( Pica rushes in . ) I am taking Mona Lucrezia to her home . ( He indicates with his eyes ) I will need you to show me the way . PICA Father Francis , the sisters are ready to sit down at the table . You will break their hearts . p. 23 MONA LUCREZIA ( Starting ) I had a stick . The boys are always taking away my stick . ( Stopping . ) Someone was coming to town today PICA ( Spitefully ) Yes ! Father Francis himself . And you 've spoiled everything ! FATHER FRANCIS ( To Pica ) Hsh !  --  I can not see the path . Give me your hand . MONA LUCREZIA ( Turning ) Those dogs  --  the butcher 's Rufus . Brother John , have n't you got a stick ? PICA ( Giggling ) She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis ! MONA LUCREZIA ( Stopping and peering at Francis ) Have n't you got a stick ? FATHER FRANCIS No , Mona Lucrezia . I have nothing . ( They go out. )
