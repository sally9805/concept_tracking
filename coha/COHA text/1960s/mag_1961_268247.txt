Ring of Fire ( M-G-M ) . " Maybe I can give you a lift , " suggests Iaconic David ( TV 's Richard Diamond ) Janssen , the deputy sheriff of a small Oregon town . <P> " Where ? " flips bosomy Joyce Taylor ( Atlantis , The Lost Continent ) , jeans tight about her hips , man 's shirt open to the navel . " To the nearest motel ? " But Joyce is more than a kidder ; she packs a mean pistol , which she has used to hold up a gas station and steal a car . At the village drugstore , Dave separates her from her banana split , shoves her and two sinister cronies into a squad car and heads toward headquarters . <P> En route , using the ersatz crime lingo favored throughout the movie , Joyce says : " It was a cinch the pump jockey 'd give you fuzz an eyeball description of the wagon , " meaning that the filling-station attendant was certain to give the cops a full description of the stolen car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tantalizingly presses her body against the deputy 's and eases his own gun from its holster . The movement of her shirt rubbing against him opens the front revealingly . " " See ? " she asks tauntingly . " You should 've searched me . You kinda missed something , did n't you , copper ? " The movie thus plants itself squarely in the category of the big leer ( TIME , June 9 ) . <P> But at least the cheapie production team of Andrew and Virginia Stone ( Cry Terror ) keeps a hot tempo . After junking the car , the four sprint through a " dense and umbrageous forest " of Douglas fir , and the sheriff 's gun changes hands at least three more times . One hood tumbles to his death from a scenic precipice ; the steely moll turns to mush under Janssen 's Gableish charms ; the other hood , played by Actor-Comic Frank ( Bells Are Ringing ) Gorshin , gets his in a forest fire . <P> The Stones , who go in for big disasters ( they bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last Voyage ) , also record the panic of an entire town , collapse a real train and a real timber trestle " 420 ft. long and 200 ft. high . " Yet , disappointingly , the actual sounds of collapse were so implausible that the moviemakers had to resort to studio fabrication , recording the noise of a bent spike being pulled out of a thick board with a crowbar and replaying the sound in an echo chamber at one-third its normal speed . Like the movie itself , it was simple , effective and cheap .
