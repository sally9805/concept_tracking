Laotians seemed less interested in politics than in the annual Phi Mai festival , during which for three days everybody doused everybody else with scented water to wash away bad luck and celebrate the arrival of the Year of the Serpent , symbolizing wisdom and chaos . Most celebrants used buckets ; some favored water pistols . Before long , more serious weapons were in evidence , and Laos was in the midst of a military coup seeking to overthrow the shaky coalition government . Wisdom ? That remained to be seen . Chaos ? Plenty . <P> On the Plain . Last week 's chain of events began with a conference , and quite a remarkable conference it was . <P> Last week the government finally brought to trial on charges of murder and extortion Ngo Dinh Can , 53 , brother of the slain President and former boss of Central Viet Nam . Can suffers from diabetes and spent his time in court on a stretcher . <P> While hardly ranking with the parley between Marc Antony , Lepidus and Octavian in a tent near Bologna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of the three little men under a tent on Laos ' Plain of Jars certainly rivaled it in security precautions. * Amid fluttering truce flags , the only outsiders allowed within 100 meters of the tent were one unarmed bodyguard for each principal , and two servants . Between 100 and 300 meters away were stationed ten unarmed guards for each side , and in an outer circle stood 330 more soldiers . <P> The display of distrust was understandable , for the huddle brought together , for the first time in a year , the leaders of the country 's three warring factions : Neutralist Premier Souvanna Phouma , pro-Communist Pathet Lao Chief Prince Souphanouvong , and General Phoumi Nosavan , boss of the right-wing forces . Prompted by Souvanna Phouma , the " summit " was to discuss how the Pathet Lao might be brought back to Souvanna 's coalition government-which the Reds fled when new fighting broke out a year ago . <P> Showing up in Edwardian splendor , the moustached Souvanna Phouma sported a pearl stickpin , Homburg , and carved Laotian walking stick . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself resplendent in a most unproletarian two-button suit with a bigger pearl stickpin . Paunchy Soldier Phoumi thought it more appropriate to wear combat fatigues . The trio conferred for an hour , broke for box lunches and Scotch airlifted in from Vientiane . <P> State of Siege . After another session the following morning , the talks broke down . Next thing anyone knew , gunfire briefly rang through Vientiane and a group of rightist army officers calling itself the Revolutionary Committee of the National Army was on the radio , announcing that it had seized power . Their leader : General Kouprasith Abhay , who has been fighting the neutralists and leftists for years . As commander of the Vientiane military district Kouprasith was the top soldier under Rightist Boss Phoumi , but also acquired a great deal of power on his own .
