 | The Right to Die A Father Speaks MY SON , Philip , was born at 11:20 A.M. on December 2 , 1962 , at Booth Memorial Hospital , Flushing , New York . The pediatrician , Dr. F. , a youngish man given to bow ties , met me in the corridor of the maternity floor . It was a boy , five pounds , thirteen ounces , he said , but added : " I 'm not totally satisfied . " The vital organs were functioning normally , said the doctor , but there was something about the facial features , the extra-wide bridge between the eyes , the poor muscle tone , the weakness of the stomach muscles when the infant cried that showed abnormality . " This is something we 'll have to watch carefully , to see how the baby develops in the next twentyfour hours , or three to four days , " said Dr. F. " But for the moment , the outlook is for an individual without a long life-span and not great mental development in the years ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still under anesthesia . I went out to buy flowers , and was in her room when she awakened . " How is the baby ? " were her first words . I said he was fine . She smiled and went back to sleep . I visited the nursery that afternoon and again that night . My baby was in a warmer . The nurse on duty assured me it was not an incubator , just a temperature-control device . I had been worried because Philip was premature , born four weeks ahead of schedule . But the nurse told me his weight was good . He looked beautiful . His face seemed round and healthy-looking . I detected none of the unusual facial configurations Dr. F. had mentioned . I began to grope for reassurance . I stopped another nurse to ask how my son appeared to her . " Fine , " she said . " Do n't let the warmer worry you . " At three the next day , I sat in Dr. F. 's office , on a residential side street a mile from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly , to recite some of his observations . The ears were set back too far on the head . The hands and feet were stubbier than normal . There was an in-turning of the final joint of the pinky fingers . There was a fold over each eyelid . There was a scruff of fat at the back of the neck . The hands and feet flexed back too far under pressure , but did not reflex . " The child is almost double-jointed . " And the tongue was too large for the mouth . The features and symptoms suggested hypertelorism , a word I immediately recognized as associated with mental retardation . The word for the infant 's overall appearance and condition , said Dr. F. , was mongolism . " All signs point to it . " But still Dr. F. did not want to make his diagnosis 59  | final . He assured me tests could be taken , hip X rays and chromosome counts . And he could consult with the chief of pediatrics at the hospital . " How sure are you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are wrong ? " No , said Dr. F. , the odds were more likely ninety to ten that he was right . Few such children , he continued , live beyond the teens . Those that do survive into adulthood are incapable of reproduction . The outlook for " normal " mental development was about nil , he said , and only fifty-fifty that the child would be able to care for his own bodily functions , and not much more . " Parents make either one of two decisions , " said Dr. F. " Either they take the child home , and give him as much care as possible . Or , where there is another child at home , as in your case , the decision is sometimes made to institutionalize the mongolian child . Some parents take the child home for several months , or years , and then place it in a nursing home or training school . " That night I met Dr. L. , the chief pediatrician at Booth . He emerged from the nursery , where he had just concluded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown . " Wait till I shed this , " he said . " I 'll meet you in the father 's waiting room . " There was no doubt at all about the diagnosis , said Dr : L. No tests were necessary . All the classic symptoms were present . The child , he said , would be vulnerable to heart trouble " of a severe sort , " perhaps at age one or two . He would be peculiarly susceptible to digestive ailments and respiratory toubles . Life would , according to medical experience , be short . Mental development would be ested at the age level of two or three . Dr. L. said many parents institutionalize monan children , " particularly when there is another th d at home , a normal child . " But he declined firmly to offer any advice . Two days after Philip was born , I gave Peggy the entire story . Until then she had only known there were symptoms that troubled the doctors . She tried to nurse , but the baby was too weak . Dr. F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told my wife that I felt it best to have the baby cared for away from home , that this was a decision the doctors had not attempted to influence in any way , but one in which they concurred as the best . Dr. F. said , " He will grow up among children like himself , not aware that he is different . " In point of fact , the physicians I consulted said it was better to experience heartache now than to know a cumulative , greater anguish later on . To take the child home , one doctor said , would trap the family in " an irreversible situation . " Peggy agreed , and said weakly : " Take me home . " Through friends , I learned in the next few days of a private sanitarium in Westchester County , said to be rated one of the best in the state . I called and found my son could be accepted immediately . The institution , I was told , was run " as a hobby " by a pediatrician with a flourishing practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retarded children . The price , to families receiving welfare assistance , was $160 a month . I was one of these . My income , in the middle range , had forced me to apply to the Nassau County Department of Public Welfare for aid in meeting the costs of institutional care . Now , among close friends , I began to tell our story . I learned that there are such tragedies in many families . The sister of a neighbor , I learned , cares at home for a mongolian boy of fifteen . He is virtually helpless , still wears diapers . The mother has suffered three miscarriages because of the strain of lifting him . A friend from my high school days told me of a cousin with mongolism , a woman of thirty-eight with the mind of a four-year-old . " I see her once in a while at a family social function , " he said . " It 's impossible to exchange more than a few words with her . Her mother 's greatest fear is that she will be left alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother dies . " The parents , I was told , were determined to have no more children for fear mongolism might strike again . Another friend told of another mongolian child being raised at home . The mother has said openly : " I want to outlive him by just one day , so that I can know a single day of freedom . " The child is in his teens . He often wanders away and gets lost in the neighborhood , The police bring him home . On the weekend following Philip 's birth , I visited the sanitarium which had been recommended to me . It was a large old mansion , constructed of brown and buff-colored stones . The premises looked solid , formidable , and cold ; the design was turn-of-the-century ; there was a small sign over the front entrance . The neighborhood was neat and partly residential . Mrs. C. , the chief nurse , gave me the admissions forms . I paused , conscious of her watchful eyes , as I answered each question ? father 's name , mother 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My feelings of guilt were overpowering . I felt I was abandoning my child . My mind returned to the hospital nursery . The other infants now there would come into homes made ready to receive them . My child was forsaken . " Would you like to look around ? " asked Mrs. C. We went first to a room containing the newborn . Nine infants were in cribs , some asleep . Most were awake . There was no whimper , no cry . The babies were almost motionless . They lay as if in a  | trance . Their faces showed no expressions . Most showed the telltale facial characteristics of mon , iism ? eyes widely spaced , slight deformities of the ears , round , fat cheeks . We passed down a corridor . Mrs. C. told me to . wait while she closed a door . " The children in there have oversized heads , " she said . " It might disturb you . We keep them together . " On we went , into other rooms containing other children ? mongoloids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retarded . Some of the children seemed too large to be languishing helplessly in a crib ; others seemed pitifully small . In one room was a girl of four , wearing a red playsuit . She lay on her back in the crib , staring blankly into space or at the ceiling . She was the age of my older son , Stephen , but half his size . " Mongolian , " said Mrs. C. She affectionately tickled the child 's stomach to bring on a playful mood . But there was no response , no laughter , no smile . The face was void . For my child , I told myself , there would be a crib here . It was a thought beyond total understanding or complete acceptance . In her office , Mrs. C. listened as I told her of my feelings . It was not for this , I said , that we wanted another baby . We would consider ourselves blessed , I went on , if there had been a miscarriage or a blue baby rather than this . Mrs. C. understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they live , she said , " they have n't a care in the world ? it 's the parents who suffer . " Heart failure kills many the first year , she said , but with new drugs more and more survive that period . If they do , she said , some mongoloid children live for years . On the trip home , I prayed for my child 's death , cursing and damning myself as I did . I WENT back to see Dr. F. , our pediatrician , who was pleased with the sanitarium and the speed with which arrangements were completed . I raised with him the question of euthanasia in those instances where neurological damage is so severe that no matter how long a child may live , he will be little more than a body ? unable to care for the most elemental needs , totally dependent on others for survival . There was no shock on his face . Mongolism , said Dr. F. , was incurable and the cause , usually , of gross retardation . If euthanasia were legal and professionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform it on my child than on children afflicted with other diseases that were on the threshold of new discoveries . But for mongolism , he said , there was no cure and none on the horizon . Research was concentrating , he said , on birth defects so as to eliminate the prenatal causes of mongolism . While medicine could not take Philip 's life , said Dr. F. , nothing would be done to prolong it . No operations would be performed ; no miracle drugs would be administered . " Medical emergencies will be met , such as sudden bleeding or choking , " said Dr. F. , " and the child will be kept warm , fed , and sheltered . Nothing more . " I returned to the sanitarium in a day or two to meet Dr. K. , the director . His offices were separated from the institution he ran by a narrow driveway . On one side of the driveway was the sanitarium , with its population of retarded children . On the other was a pediatrician 's office , with baby carriages parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bright yellow walls of Dr. K. 's waiting room . There was laughter , and an occasional shriek , and mothers chased after children intent on mild havoc . At a small table , a group of children read aloud from a picture book . Dr. K. is a man in his fifties . He has been a specialist in mental retardation among children for thirty years . He has examined every mongoloid child in Westchester County , it is said , either to confirm the diagnosis of other physicians or to contradict them . He spoke of mongolism in scientific terms , the papers he had written on it , the statistics compiled . Nothing , he said , had been discovered concerning precisely what goes wrong during pregnancy to cause the condition , marked by the presence of 47 chromosomes , one more than the normal human complement of 46 . The research , he said , was attempting to find what body processes within the mother produce the extra chromosome . I told Dr. K. that I wanted nothing done to extend my son 's hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitarium , he said , contains no oxygen . The children are given no inoculations against childhood diseases , unless parents insist . " There are churches on all sides of me , " he said . " Every one of these ministers agrees with me that it would not be moral , or serving God 's will , to prolong these lives . " At the suggestion of an official in the welfare department , a social caseworker took Philip to the sanitarium next day . I had brought her diapers , nightgowns , blankets , bunting , and bottles for his formula . A few hours after Philip 's arrival , Dr. K. called to tell me he had died . " Heart failure and jaundice , " he said . " Consider it a blessing . " And I remembered what he had told me our first meeting : " Some parents regularly visit their children here . They waste their lives trying to expunge a feeling of guilt that should not be there , instead  | of devoting themselves to their normal children . It is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know my son . I do not know his thousands of brothers and sisters , of whom it has been written , " Oh , what a mortal pity He was ever born , " and I do not know the parents of these children . I do not speak for them , just for myself and perhaps for Philip . I believe that it is time for a sane and civilized and humane approach to euthanasia . I do not know how it should be practiced , or what committee should have a voice in the decisions , or what pill or injection might best be employed . I do know that there are thousands of children on this earth who should never have been born . Their lives are a blank . They do not play ; they do not read ; they do not grow ; they do not live or love . Their life is without meaning to themselves , and an agony to their families . Why ? A THEOLOGIAN COMMENTS BERNARD BARD is a loving man . He is not a vitalist ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idol of life . To them life is the highest good , regardless of the situation . But he loves people too much to absolutize mere biological process . He cares too much for human happiness and peace and kindness and loving concern to subordinate every other consideration to merely keeping breathing a sadly non- or un- or subhuman creature . I agree with Mr. Bard that we ought to be able to do something about such tragedies , something that he calls " a sane and civilized and humane approach to euthanasia . " There is no good reason why he and Mrs. Bard and Stephen and a host of friends and medical and paramedical helpers should quit in dumb resignation to that mysterious , disastrous forty-seventh chromosome . Out of respect for the Mongols , by the way , and to keep the peace with my own son , who is a specialist historian of Central Asia , I prefer to speak of this pathology as an embryonic anomaly or , specifically , Down 's syndrome . Dr. F. has to act within the law , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what doctors do in practice , sometimes . For example , to stop the pain of terminal patients they sometimes give them rapidly increased doses of morphine in order to reach the fatal , toxic level . And at the other end of the life spiral , at delivery , they often refrain from respirating " monsters . " But our statute and common law ? that is , our official morality ? is thoroughly idolatrous and vitalistic . It prohibits our ever ending a life directly , except when necessary in defense of one 's own life . In short , the official morality and conventional wisdom are not only vitalistic and idolatrous ; they are selfishly so . " All life is sacred , and my life most of all . " It is the sacrosanct notion of life which is challenged by Bernard Bard . He is saying that we are not helpless and hopeless in the face of adversity and suffering . He rejects fatalism . Fatalism attributes cosmic evil ( evil not due to human cause or choice ) to God , perhaps , or nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all three , and then it decides that we ought not to do anything about it even if and when we could ! Look carefully at what Dr. K. told him . The " sanitarium " where Philip was taken immediately from the hospital only cares for a Down 's case physically , and only in a minimum way at that . They keep no oxygen , give no inoculations against disease . Nothing is done to keep death away . On the contrary , it is welcomed as a friend . Kant once said that if we will the end we will the means , and morally surely he was right . The official morality in this matter is plainly of the primitive taboo order . " Life is untouchable ; do n't dare the lightning of the gods . " This is not rational or responsible . : e , This policy we can call indirect euthanasia , achieved by deliberately omitting to do what is possible to preserve life , thus bringing death about left-handedly . It is really dys-thanasia , not euthanasia ; a bad death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merciful and quick . One morality lets death drag out , willy-nilly ; the other shortens it by a morally authentic decision . Dr. F. 's professed policy , in which death is desired but not devised , is public simply because it has general acceptance . To give him the credit due , Dr. F. did say to Mr. Bard that if euthanasia were legal , he would be inclined to end the lives of grossly retarded infants like Philip . But behind the reigning official morality lurks a religious or taboo morality . In formal teaching Roman Catholics , Protestants , and Jews , at least as far as their moral theologians and ethicists can speak for them , are agreed that we are not obliged in conscience to preserve a life , just so long as we do n't do anything directly to end it ) Pope Pius XII , in saying so in 1957 , added that we may never choose to let sufferers " go " except when extraordinary means would be required to keep them alive . Doctors and moralists , however , can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , it would  | become ordinary very quickly because of the rapid advances of medical care . Whether at the start of life , as with fetal and neonatal defects , or later on , in terminal and senile illnesses , the moral problem is essentially the same ; if we can justify wanting death to come , is it ethical to sit by waiting fatalistically for whatever blind , brute nature happens to " do " about it ? There are some who object that " the end does not justify the means . " This is an old bromide , and basically quite an irrational one . Nothing at all can justify what we do , or make good sense of it , except the goal or purpose which gives an act its character as a " means , " or to put it differently , makes it meaningful . Otherwise any act would be random , pointless , non-sense . The only serious ethical question about means and ends is , " Is the flame worth the candle ? " Is the cost of the necessary means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the payoff worth the input ? This is a decision which depends on the facts in each situation ; there are no general formulas , no absolute or universal requirements and prohibitions . In dealing with Down 's cases , it is obvious that the end everybody wants is death . What is at issue is the means . Shall it be indirect , by omission , as in the official policy , just letting it all hang on chance ? Or shall it be direct , by commission , resulting from responsible choice ? What Mr. Bard is pleading for , on behalf of millions of blameless and miserable people , is direct euthanasia . I almost said " honest " or " straightforward " euthanasia . Bard 's belief is that it is dishonest or phony to will the end but not the means . I agree with him . Absolute taboos , with their underlying mystique about life , make a farce of human freedom . All such taboos cut the ground out from under morality because nothing we do lies in the moral order if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1945 ( tragic and debatable as it was ) was morally significant , but the Krakatoa volcanic earthquake off Sumatra in 1883 was n't . If Philip 's life , such as it was , had been brought mercifully to a close , that would have had ethical value ; but with its sudden end by " heart failure and jaundice , " neither his life nor his death had any moral meaning whatsoever . PAUSE for a moment to consider preventive abortion , of the kind that so many women underwent during the thalidomide snafu a few years ago . There is no reason in the world ( other than the vitalist mystique in its extreme form ) why a pregnancy should not be stopped at once if there is a solid ground to believe or even to fear that it will result in a mentally or physically deformed child . This is , in a manner of speaking , fetal euthanasia . Mrs. Finkbine was on a morally sound course when she went to Sweden for an abortion after an Arizona court found that our American laws are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision . Now , then , if through ignorance or neglect or sheer chance ( like the forty-seventh chromosome ) the damage has not been ended prenatally , why should it not be ended neonatally ? To have given birth innocently to a Down 's case , when we would not have done so if we had known the truth , does not of itself justify our extending the tragedy . By stubbornly persisting we only compound the evil ; we make ourselves " accessories " after the fact of a monstrous accident . We can not be blamed for what we did not know , but we can be blamed when we do know . The only difference between the fetus and the infant is that the infant breathes with its lungs . Does this make any significant difference morally or from the point of view of values ? Surely not . Life and human being is a process , not an event ; a continuum , not an episode . It is purely superstitious to assert that life " occurs " at fertilization or nidation or embryonic formation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or voting age . To be a human is to be self-aware , consciously related to others , capable of rationality in a measure at least sufficient to support some initiative . When these things are absent , or can not ever come to be , there is neither a potential nor an actual person . To be a person is a lot more than just to be alive ? as any student of the human struggle for maturity and well-being knows perfectly well . The fact that a biological organism functions biologically does not mean that it is a human being . There is a difference between a man and a brute . Even if it is a difference only of degree , it is still a difference . There are many variants or variables situationally , of course . What has been said here is directed only against absolute prohibitions of euthanasia , maintained legalistically and regardless of relative circumstances . On the other hand , however , there is no logic in slipping into the opposite error and absurdity ? insisting that euthanasia is always the right thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply be a reverse legalism . There is , on the contrary , a strong case to be made for the medical distinctions between idiots , cretins , and morons . The Kennedy Foundation will no doubt help us eventually to correct the condition of some retardates . Whether we ought to do so or not  | should depend on each particular situation . Neonatal intensive-care units in maternity hospitals are having increasing success in overcoming hypoxia ( lack of oxygen ) , hypoglycemia ( lack of sugar ) , bilirubin ( a blood chemical causing jaundice and anemia ) , and infections of the central nervous system . But the core of the moral problem is still the freedom of people to choose , to be responsible , in every situation . How strange and contradictory it is that people should deliberately assume the responsibility to initiate a life , and to control its creation contraceptively , but still fail or refuse to terminate it , no matter what the actual situation is . Some vitalists , the archaically intransigent ones , flatly refuse to terminate reproductive failures either before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of whole-hog opposition makes more sense than a willingness to do it before respiration ( abortion ) but not afterward ( euthanasia ) . The archaists at least have a consistent and radical fatalism . People in the Bards ' situation have no reason to feel guilty about putting a Down 's syndrome baby away , whether it 's " put away " in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium or in a more responsible lethal sense . It is sad , yes . Dreadful . But it carries no guilt . True guilt arises only from an offense against a person , and a Down 's is not a person . There is no cause for remorse , even though , certainly , there is for regret . Guilt over a decision to end an idiocy would be a false guilt , and probably unconsciously a form of psychic masochism . There is far more reason for real guilt in keeping alive a Down 's or other kind of idiot , out of a false idea of obligation or duty , while at the same time feeling no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living , learning child . The learning child might be a retarded one with a viable potential , or just an orphan in need of adoption . To " feel " obligation to prolong " life " in the Down 's case while failing utterly to see or accept any responsibility in the promising child 's case is moral confusion worse confounded . From a human or moral point of view it is irresponsible . Theologically oriented people often get the idea that life is God 's alone , to deal with as He wills or pleases . ( They stick to this idea even if they practice birth control ! The really consistent vitalists are across the board opposed equally to contraception , abortion , sterilization , euthanasia ? that is , to any form of human initiative and responsibility whatsoever . ) One moralist has said that euthanasia is a " destruction of the temple of God and a violation of the property rights of Jesus Christ . " But this divine-monopoly theory logically militates against medicine itself , which is trying to lengthen life and defend it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is at work directly or indirectly in all natural phenomena is a form of animism or simple pantheism . If we took it really seriously , all science , including medicine , would die away because we would be afraid to " dissect God " or tamper with His activity . Such beliefs are a hopelessly primitive kind of God-thought and God-talk , but they hang on long after theologians generally have bid them good-bye . The notion that life is sacrosanct is actually a Hindu idea , although Hindus practice things like suttee . It is not Christian or biblical . If it were , all heroism and martyrdom would be wrong , to say nothing of carnivorous diet , capital punishment . and warfare . The sanctity ( what makes it precious ) is not in life itself , intrinsically ; it is only extrinsic and bonum per accidens , ex casu ? according to the situation . Compared to some things , the taking of life is a small evil , and compared to some things , the loss of life is a small evil . Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend and servant . Life is sometimes good , and death is sometimes good . Life is no more a good in itself than any other value is . It is good , when and if it is good . because of circumstances , because of the context . When it is not good , it deserves neither protection nor preservation . Our present laws about " elective death " are not civilized . It is high time we had some constructive guidance , perhaps from a model code committee of the American Law Institute . Let the law favor living , not mere life .
