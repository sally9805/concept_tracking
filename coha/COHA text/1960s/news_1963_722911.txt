txt Mayor , Daley told a reporter from Brazil a few days ago that he considers himself " the first new leader , " not the last of the old city bosses . Expounding his philosophy of leadership in an interview later , he made the same distinction but left no room for doubt that he is the boss . " Some one has to make the decisions , " he said . " Every large business corporation or bank has a president and a chairman of the board . At THE TRIBUNE you have bosses . They listen to various points of view , hut in the final analysis they must make the decisions . Discuss Some Criticisms " Whether you are talking about executives of corporations , banks , and newspapers , or about public officials and leaders of political parties , someone has to make the decisions . All the various considerations must I be weighed , and decisions are not always popular ; but they have to be made . " Some reporters say the mayor is hypersensitive to criticism and has an explosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter ranged over some of the unkindest allegations made by his political foes about his record as mayor and leader of the Democratic party in Cook county . He was relaxed , calm , and self-assured , and he answered all questions with evident but not immodest pride in his achievements . " The image of the new political leader is entirely different from that of the old boss , " he said . " The old bosses were not interested in what was good for the public welfare ; they were only interested in what was good for themselves . They adhered to the status quo ; they were reluctant to change . " The new objective of leadership is not what you can do for yourself but what you can do for the people . I sincerely and modestly point to my record as evidence that I have tried to fulfill that objective . When I assumed leadership of the Democratic party in Cook county I adopted the motto that good government is good politics and good politics is good government . I have always tried to live up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asked whether he regards Congressman William L. Dawson , the recognized boss of a dozen Negro wards , as " an old boss or a new leader . " Smiling broadly , he said he would not like to categorize Congressman Dawson . Then he added this tribute : " I think he has rendered a great service to the people of the nation and the community . He 's interested in improving opportunities of the American Negro for positions of responsibility . That 's to his credit . He 's a good leader of his people . He has never asked me to do anything that would be detrimental to the people of Chicago or to the cause of good government . " Author Commends Him In his book , " Political Influence , " Dr. Edward C. Banfield , of Harvard university , former professor of political science at the University of Chicago , highly recommends Mayor Daley and his administration . The mayor was shown this passage from Prof. Banfield 's book and asked whether it is accurate : " Chicago is heavily Democratic . The Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; here , in wards which are predominantly Negro , Italian , Polish , Lithuanian , or Irish , and except for the Negroes almost entirely Catholics , the machine gets the hard core of its support . The lower the average income and the less average education , the more reliably Democratic is the ward . " " I do n't think it is accurate , " the mayor said softly . " We are getting rid of . the slums . In the 1950 census there were 64,000 dilapidated and deteriorated housing units in Chicago . In the 1960 census there were only 30,000 . We estimate that the number has been reduced to 25,000 since 1960 , and in the next two or three years we hope to get rid of the 25,000 . We 've taken the profit out . of the slums . We 've demolished more buildings than any administration in the history of Chicago . Cites ' the Difference ' " What Prof. Banfield says about the education and income of these people points up the difference between the old and the new type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people for his own benefit . My objective is just the opposite  --  to improve the living conditions of these people and see that all of them , regardless of race , religion , or national origin , have the same opportunities thaL other Americans have , including the opportunity to hold public office . " Then the mayor explained that the political power ' base of his organization is not confined to the ' " inner city " wards but depends for its success in county-wide elections on heavy support in the outlying wards and even in the predominantly Republican suburbs . He noted that the Democrats carried some of the suburb 's in the 1960 election and ascribed this success to the appeal of " good government . " The same point is made in Prof. Banfield ' s book . He was reminded that Chicago has a bad reputation for vote thievery and asked why he does n't do something to assure honest elections . ' We 're Not Perfect ' " No one is saying we 're perfect , but elections here are just as honest as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States district attorney Robert Tieken said the 1960 election was one of the quietest and cleanest in Chicago 's history . The interviewer recalled that Morris Wexler , a Democratic lawyer who was appointed special state 's attorney to investigate vote fraud charges , brought contempt proceedings against 662 persons , most of them election judges , and told reporters that Benjamin S. Adamowski , defeated Republican candidate for state 's attorney , may have lost 10,000 votes by short-counting and other irregularities . President Kennedy 's majority in Illinois was only 8,858 . " I do n't think Wexler said that , " the mayor responded . " Those cases were all dismissed . Wexler will tell you himself that he was n't making any charges ; he was acting on the complaints of others . There are 5,000 precincts and 25,000 or 30,000 election judges in Cook county . You ca n't take one or two and make general charges . " ( Contempt proceedings against all respondents in the vote fraud cases were dismissed by Judge John M. Karns , of East St. Louis , a Democrat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try the cases . Wexler said Karns " never got to the merits of the cases " but disposed of them on collateral issues . George Mullin , executive director of the nonpartisan Better Government association , said of Judge Karns ' action : " Something smells . " Lists Some Achievements The mayor was asked to enumerate some of his outstanding achievements . He recalled that when he was first elected eight years ago he decided to " let politics wait while we reorganized the city government . " Subsequently , he said , all recommendations of the Home Rule commission were adopted ; a centralized purchasing system was established ; an executive , " performance type " budget , showing " what is done with the people 's money , " was adopted ; author ity to issue driveway permits was transferred from the city council to the administrative traffic department ; the traffic division of the Municipal court was completely reorganized , carrying out 98 per cent of the recommendations of the Northwestern University Institute of Traffic ; and the police department was completely reorganized under Supt. Orlando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue Ballot proposals on judicial reform in the 1962 election as another outstanding achievement . " We have had no court scandals such as there have been in other metropolitan areas , " he said . " The vote last November in the judicial elections is a good indication of the stature of the ten elected . The majority of our judges are just as honest as those in any other section of the state or the country . " Discusses School System The reporter mentioned that Chicago 's public schools are not highly regarded , that some competent educators , in fact , say half the graduates of Chicago high schools are only semi-literate . " One of the first problems I faced was whether I would interfere with the schools , " the mayor said . " I decided to continue the screening system established by Mayor Kelly and continued by Mayor Kennelly . Candidates for the school board are screened by a committee of university presidents and other distinguished citizens and I keep my hands off of it . This system has resulted in the appointment of outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supt. Benjamin Willis to study the school system of Massachusetts was a great compliment to Chicago . Dr. Willis came to Chicago with the recommendation of the National Education association as one of the great school administrators of the nation . " Opinion of Willis The reporter noted that Willis is not a doctor of philosophy but a doctor of education from teachers college , Columbia university , which some critics call a " degree factory . " The mayor was asked whether he considers Willis " an administrator and educationalist , " as contended by his critics , or an educator . " I think he is both an administrator and an educator , " said the mayor . Finally he was asked about population trends , the flight to the suburbs , the decline of the white and the rapid increase of the nonwhite proportions of the population . " The flight to the suburbs is being reversed with the rebuilding of the central section of the city , " he said . " I understand that a large proportion of applications for apartments in the new , Marina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs . "
