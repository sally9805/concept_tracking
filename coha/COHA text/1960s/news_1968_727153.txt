txt Half a dozen tense scenes chase each other across the stage here as Washington acts out a hair-raising thriller called , " Fading Foreign Aid , " and subtitled , " Can It Be Saved ? " But first , some program notes . Like the true drama it is , the play has global , not just local , meaning . Never before in history has the two-thirds of the world that is poor needed so badly the help of the one-third that is rich . But never before has the flow of government aid from the richest of the rich  --  the United States  --  been in such danger . At worst , the 1968 aid program could be canceled altogether . There is talk of this , on and off stage , in Congress and in the foreign aid agency . Domestic problems Congress is angry over Vietnam . It has ordered a whopping $6 billion reduction in federal spending as the price for a 10 percent tax surcharge . It wants to get out of Washington and go home to campaign for November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1969 aid request will be deeply cut , and the interest charged poor countries on loans may be raised  --  again . Last year President Johnson asked for $2.8 billion in economic assistance . The final appropriation was a near-nadir figure of $1.89 billion . This year he is asking for $2.5 billion . He will almost certainly fail to get any more // with permission of the copyright owner . *Is it curtains for U.S. foreian aid ? // than $1.89 billion , and probably he will be handed a lot less . This prospect comes at a time when Britain and France have domestic problems that affect their capacity to give aid . Now , with program notes out of the way , settle back for the scenes themselves : Scene 1 : The office of a senior foreign aid official . The atmosphere is grim . " So far , we are well ahead of schedule in Congress , " he says . " Last year , we did n't get an authorization until December , or an actual appropriation until early January . It was chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committees have finished hearings , and are marking up preparing recommendations . " An inquiring visitor : " That sounds hopeful . " The official : But there could be delays ahead . Congressmen and senators will be weighing how hard the spending reductions hit their own districts and states . And then there 's the little matter of strategy to be adopted on the floor . . . " Strategy discussion Scene 2 : The same office . Later . Visitor : " What is your strategy ? " Official : " We 're telling Congress that whoever is elected president in November will face a lot of grief if he has no aid bill at all to work with in January . We say it is in the interests of both Democrats and Republicans to work for a decent bill , so that a Democratic or a Republican president will be spared anguish abroad . . . . " Scene 3 : The anteroom of the House Education and Labor Committee room . Rep. Charles E. Goodell ( R ) of New York , sprawls his tall frame in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us who intend to vote for the program anyway , " he says slowly . " But it wo n't get to the others ? Otto E. Passman chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee that handles aidl for instance . " What we really need is a revamped program , with more emphasis on agriculture , and programs that reach people , not institutions . " Mr. Goodell is credited by aid officials with helping save the aid bill on the House floor last year , by personally switching at least six crucial votes at the last moment . He thinks he might just keep the six switched this year . But conditions are much worse . Scene four : Back at the aid agency . A strategy session . Official : " Just look at the Passman committee . You know what we hear most when we go up there ? Pressure for cuts " Congressmen say , ' How can I vote for irrigation and power projects for other countries when I ca n't even squeeze them out of the Interior Department for my own district at home ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his full committee chairman , George H. Mahon ( D ) of Texas . But Mr. Mahon is himself under pressure to cut spending now . " Visitor : " How does the Passman committee which makes key recommendations on final appropriations line up ? Official : " Of the 10 members , only four are solidly in favor of aid . One more might be . The others are set against . It does n't look good . " Scene 5 : The offices of various representative and House committee staff members , who have watched the annual fund battle for years . The members must remain anonymous . But their talk goes like this : Mr. A. " Did you see that plan to avoid a floor debate on the aid authorization bill ? Mr. B. " Yes . Rep. Cornelius E. Gallagher ( D ) of New Jersey , wants to authorize a fixed percentage of last year 's appropriation figure , sending to the floor a ' continuing resolution . ' I understand he is thinking of a figure 10 percent less than last year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be brought to the floor under a ' closed ' rule ? no amendments , no changes In figures . " Mr. D. " The appropriations boys are watching that one . They do n't like any meddling in appropriating money by the Foreign Affairs Committee . " Mr. E. " Yes , but it 's only authorization we 're talking about . Anyway , the plan is n't fully formed yet , despite a newspaper article I read that said it was . Gallagher is still drumming up support . It all depends on whether Senator J. W. Fulbright chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee goes for it . If he does , chances are better for Senate cooperation . " Mr. F. " Representative Passman wants the aid program reduced to to well below last year 's figure . Rep. H. R. Gross ( R ) of Iowa , who controlled GOP votes on the floor last year , has restrictive amendments . So does Paul Findley ( R ) of Illinois . " Mr. G. " Whatever happens , we 'll have to get a move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't report out any more rules after July 8 . That 's important . Last year , the authorization was so late that the Passman committee went to Rules and asked for permission to call up the appropriations bill before the authorization was finished . Maybe we 'll have to do this year . But we 'll have to hurry . There 's no decision yet . " Scene 6 : Another office on Capitol Hill . A staff man speaks : Approval refused " On military aid , the administration has submitted a separate bill . But both the House and Senate look like lumping it back with the economic bill . The administration wants to avoid a new fuss about government arms credits to other nations . But if we do n't tack the arms side onto the economic side in the house , we 'll end up with no program at all . Economic aid by itself does n't have much of a chance this year . " Those are the main scenes . There are others : One is the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's aid " window , " the IDA ( International Development Association ) , or $200 million more for the Asian Development Bank . Aid officials think this indicated the committee 's mood . Strongly antiadministration on Vietnam , the committee is ready to take a broad ax to foreign aid in general . Aid officials have heard talk about no bill at all . " The idea is that we should ' live off the pipeline , ' " says one official . " That is , use what we have in train . " But that 's just another way of saying , ' Cut out aid for a year . ' The money in the pipeline is already committed . We have to plan ahead in this business . A moratorium would prohibit us and bring our plans into confusion . " First of two articles : Next  --  some new ideas on aid .
