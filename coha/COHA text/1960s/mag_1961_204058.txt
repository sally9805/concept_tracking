In a tense and packed Philadelphia courtroom last week , a drama took place that U.S. business will long remember-to its shame . The cases before him , said Federal District Judge J. Cullen Ganey , were " a shocking indictment of a vast section of our economy . " They were more than that . They showed clearly that the executives of a mighty industry , publicly devoted to the concept of competition , had privately conspired to rig prices to the detriment of their customers on a scale so vast that it embraced everything from the Tennessee Valley Authority to the private utilities that supply the nation 's light and power . <P> Up for sentencing were 29 electrical-equipment companies , headed by the industry 's two " competitive " giants , General Electric and Westinghouse , and 44 of their executives . Long ago , faced with incontrovertible evidence gathered by the Eisenhower Administration 's relentless trustbusters , the companies and individuals had pleaded guilty or nolo contendere ( no contest ) to charges that they conspired over the past seven years to fix prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of heavy electrical equipment ( TIME , Feb. 29 , 1960 , et seq . ) . Now the moment of reckoning had come . First before the court came the lawyer for John H. Chiles Jr. , 57 , a vice president of Westinghouse , to plead for mercy . His client , said the lawyer , while Chiles bowed his head , was a vestryman of St. John 's Episcopal Church in Sharon , Pa. and a benefactor of charities for crippled children and cancer victims . " These men , " the lawyer pleaded , " are not grasping , greedy , cutthroat competitors . " <P> In antitrust cases , executives may be fined but are rarely jailed . Judge Ganey sentenced Chiles to 30 days in jail . Chiles began automatically to return to his seat , but was startled to be seized by two armed deputy U.S. marshals and hustled off to the marshal 's office to be fingerprinted . <P> Behind the Door . One by one , as the sentencing went on , lawyers rose to describe their clients as pillars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of General Electric , was the director of a boys ' club in Schenectady , N.Y . and the chairman of a campaign to build a new Jesuit seminary in Lenox , Mass . His lawyer pleaded that Ginn not be put " behind bars with common criminals who have been convicted of embezzlement and other serious crimes . " Judge Ganey thought the company appropriate , gave Ginn 30 days in jail . The lawyer for Charles I. Mauntel , Westinghouse division sales manager and a man prominent in charitable and community affairs in Drexel Hill , Pa. , asked : " What difference does it make if the Government recommends 30 days or 60 days or more ? What matters is crossing the prison door at all . " Judge Ganey recommended 30 days behind the door .
