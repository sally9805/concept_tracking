 | Svetlana 's Future There are many questions which Svetlana Alliluyeva can not discuss  - -  either in her forthcoming autobiagraphy or elsewhere ? without violating her status as a " nonpolitical " visitor to the U.S. Such limitations do not apply to Martin Ebon , member of the faculty of New York 's New School for Social Research and ! Yell-known expert on Soviet affairs . The following discussion of Svetlana 's future in the United States might well be read as " The Story Svetlana Can not Tell . " ? ED. @# " If you are not Stalin 's daughter , who are you ? " It is a question that the world must ask Svetlana as she seeks a new identity . If she were not Joseph Stalin 's daughter , she would not be where she is now ; no one would really listen to her ; her life and words would have little meaning outside herself . Her experience is unique only because she is unique . Otherwise , she would merely belong to one of many waves of disillusionment . She-is not " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor plain " Svetlana " ? not really , not in people 's minds nor as a public figure . Behind her looms the shadow of the man in the Kremlin who kept a nation of some two hundred million people in a state of ever-increasing terror . There is no curse that has not been uttered against him , just as there is no word of cloying homage that was not applied to him during the years of his reign . Svetlana Yosifovich Stalina can not walk away from the ghost of her father . Nor does the world expect her to denounce him . There is no need for such an act of desecration . Rather , the world might remember a touching act of filial loyalty . The date was March 5 , 1966 , thirteen years to the day after the death of Stalin . The Soviet press , which had outdone itself with praise of this man for decades on end , printed no word in his memory . No one came to visit his simple grave . Svetlana waited for the 12 o'clock changing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small bouquet of flowers , wrapped in cellophane , on the stone continued on page 80 @#  | that bore her father 's name . She had remembered him . No one else had . Beyond her personal heritage , Svetlana is a human being of this generation , who by accident of birth bears special responsibility . She may have resented , and rightly so , being treated like a piece of state property by the Soviet regime . But she can not escape the role of being a symbol . She may decide to spend years of meditation in a Hindu ashram , teach Russian at a Midwestern college , marry a Texas millionaire , or go back to Russia as head of the Union of Soviet Writers ? but she will , from now on , be a symbol . In a sense this woman had a grossly delayed maturity . The Soviet state , which gave her a pension , an apartment and a job , tried to keep her tied to its apron strings . Acting as a super-parent , it told her , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt you ! " As a result , Svetlana has a good deal of catching up to do , in areas that neither she nor anyone else can possibly imagine ? from the philosophy of religion to the psychology of economics . What matters is that her intellect now has the chance to roam freely . Her point that Stalin was not alone in his guilt is well taken . It underlines the continuing need for revision of Soviet society , still governed by a privileged class of men who owe their positions to the Stalin heritage , and whose status would be endangered by any serious shift in government organization . Fear of losing privilege , of being shifted from the " ins " to the " outs , " prevents an ultimate coming-to-terms with the Soviet past . Not only the Khrushchev generation that rose during Stalin 's rule and helped to keep it going , but hundreds of thousands in public life ? the " cream " of Soviet society ? are fearful of being branded , at some point , as " collaborators " in the crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Precocious Autobiography ( New York , 1963 ) : " Now that ten years have gone by , I realize that Stalin 's greatest crime was not the arrests and the shootings he ordered . His greatest crime was the disintegration of the human spirit caused . " This disintegration brought about by the very which Stalin 's daughter emphasi the total state machinery was an cessory to his crimes . They were guilty , in one degree or another ; now they dare not admit his actio fully , for fear of implicating the selves in retrospect . Although many outward elements of Soviet police have been modified since Stalin ' death , there are still no true safe guards against bureaucratic abuse Svetlana put it well when she sail that the ideology " as a whole " is basically at fault . How can this be changed ? Can Svetlana Alliluyeva , with her newly won freedom of self-expression . help ? She speaks of herself as being nonpolitical , as being , rather humbly , a mere writer . Yet , she can not avoid being political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . As a linguist , she must know that the very word " political " has different meanings in different languages . It need not have the derogatory ring that prompts such humanitarian intellectuals as Svetlana to recoil . Freedom is eminently political . Every prayer that is spoken , every word that is written , every step that is taken in an atmosphere of freedom has political connotations ? in the best sense of the word . It is a clean word , but , like all words , its meaning depends on its use . Svetlana Alliluyeva has much to teach , and even more to learn . She will need time to do both . She can not be spared the gruesome task of reading up on Soviet history . And until she is quite sure of her ground , she may say too much too soon . She is volatile and impetuous , and if she does not watch out , some of her spur-of-the-moment statements will come back to haunt her . After a lifetime of frustrations , or pent-up yearning , patience comes hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Svetlana is eager to make the most , and quickly , of the second half . But this creates two interrelated dangers . First , she will be tempted to overstate her case , speak with too much stridency , too much emotional continued on page 82 @# @#  | involvement ; her French well-wisher , Emmanuel d'Astier , is apprehensive that America will be a " passionate experience " to her . Secondly , Svetlana may expect too immediate a response , too profound an impact . She feels that , since she is who she is , her experience may truly help turn the world into the kind of earthly paradise her loving eyes have seen in India . That is not going to happen . Not even with Stalin 's daughter having her say , not with all the sincerity and passion at her command . One New York acquaintance feels that strength of character will help Svetlana to bridge possible difficulties : " Where does this woman get her energy , her vivacity , her optimism ? Why is n't she a nervous wreck ? Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the tragedy that has been her life . She comes indoors , from a walk in the woods , as if she had just discovered the world . A few leaves are still stuck to her jacket , and in her auburn , wavy hair . Her cheeks are glowing , pink , and her eyes reflect whatever blue is in the sky or on the water . This is a sturdy woman who wears sensible shoes , but she is light on her feet . Her steps are springy , those of a dancer . She was snippy to the reporters who wanted to know her weight . She is a bit self-conscious about that . Sturdily built . One does not fit her easily into the cardboard image of the Russian woman , but her family tree is mixed , and that may account for it . Perhaps her Germanic great-grandmother had those same blue eyes . " But the external sturdiness belies her sensitivity . She is right in wanting to be a writer . She bubbles over with words , particularly when she is writing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to survive the terrors of the past because she reacts so quickly and dramatically to tragedy , straight from the heart , with tears or anger . If she can also develop control , she may be a very good writer . " In addressing her children , whom she left behind in Moscow , Svetlana expressed the hope that , one day , they will be reunited . But she does not look forward to her own re to the Soviet Union . Still , one she may return . She is looking f ward to another four decades - aof active life . History can m swiftly ; and even a natural p. , - cal-cultural evolution within the viet state might make it possible Stalin 's daughter to visit a de linized Russia . The dangers to herself , after spoke so freely during her stay India , were not just that she mi be reprimanded or even imprisoned . upon her return to Russia . More subtle but more devastating possibilities existed . These were indicated by some Soviet-inspired commenst prompted by her defection , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union ha been treated . Pretending to act more in sorrow than in anger , authority ruled that such critics should not imprisoned , but , " for their own p tection and in their own psycho-medical interest , " should be confined to sanatoria . What was more natural , the argument might run , than that a woman as bereaved as Mrs. Alliluyeva , following the tragic death of her husband , should pass through a period of mental anguish bordering on instability ? Rest , confinement , treatment by carefully supervised psychiatric personnel would follow the diagnosis by politically reliable experts . All this might have been done quietly , while the word would be spread : " Have you heard about poor Svetlana ? The death of her husband . She took it terribly hard . I understand she had to be taken to a rest home .... " An old Russian emigre , living in the suburb of a large eastern U.S. city , spoke with warmth of Svetlana . He is one of the great " Kremlinologists " in the world , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events by piecing together apparently unrelated new events . This man , who came to the United States in the early 1940s , looks upon Svetlana 's role in these terms : " I have been awake nights , thinking about her . She personifies hope . I feel desperate when I think that this might continued on page 84  | not work out . Too much has happened to her . I know much more than she does , about what Stalin has done . I do not even want her to know it all . I want her to be happy . I get angry when people wisecrack about her supposed opportunism . ' About the fact that she left her children behind . That only makes her decision more courageous . In Germany , writers would say that those who fled Hitler took the easy way out , that the internal emigrants , ' who stuck it out , were the real heroes . Some were , I suppose . The rest were taking the path of least resistance . " We all go through life trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trivia that holds us back like the barnacles of a ship . But our courage gives out . She has this courage . The odds are so tremendous that they stagger the imagination . The thing she has broken with is gigantic . I literally pray for her that the exposure , the flattery , the intoxicating air of freedom will not do her harm . " You know that I have traced every detail of the crimes that Stalin has committed ; that I have made a special study of the series of mysterious deaths that paved his way to power and maintained him there . I do not think she can understand all of this , and I do not want her to know it , as a human being , because it would make her chances of succeeding in this new life that much smaller . She can be a powerful influence for good , both here and is Russia , and in the relationship of our two countries , and for the peace of the world . That sounds pretty big , does n't it ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it takes a woman to symbolize this human potential . " Yes , to hope is to fear . I hope for so much . I see such tremendous possibilities that I tremble with fear that all the things that are possible may be dissipated . I think the State Department handled this whole business very well . But there are many pitfalls . There is nothing spectacular that Svetlana can do , but she can symbolize a bridge , the common denominator that truly exists . " Well , I am an old man with old hopes . But this woman 's actions have given me a new enthusiasm . She has made me feel Russian again . Is n't that funny ? Here I am , a suburban American , tending my plants . And I look at her and I say , This is Russia ! " " Svetlana 's arrival in New York completed an escape from tragedy and dramatized her spiritual rebirth . Her ultimate danger now lies in a reversal of that experience . If she expects too much , this rebirth may turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ euphoria of freedom . In facing this danger , Svetlana stands utterly alone . @#
