them paternally . " Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , " he said . " I know you 've all shared IBC 's excitement at the appointmentof Mr. Stone to the presidency of News . Some of you have worked with him . Some of you will be meeting him for the first time . Both Mr. Gregory Austin and Mr. Danton Miller are proud to place all future news programming in Mr. Stone 's hands . There will be some changes made  --  in fact , there will be many changes made . But I 'm sure everyone will understand they reflect in no way on anyone 's personal talent or accomplishment . The changes will be to extend our news coverage . To make for higher achieve-ment .

There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin'seyes made it die before it began . Then he grinned and they all felt like ridiculous children who had done something foolish but were forgiven . Robin Stone glanced down the table quickly , his eyes resting on no one . It was as if he was summing up the number of people , the room , the setting . Then he flashed an easy grin . Ethel noticed that everyone 's resistance seemed to liquefy . The charisma of that grin was like a voltage of paralyzing electricity . To Ethel he was suddenly more desirable than any movie star . God , to break through that steel facade . . . to make this man tremble in her arms . . . to control him . . . even for a second ! From her distance at the end of the table she could stare at him without catching his attention . She noticed suddenly that he smiled only with his mouth . His eyes were cold . " I 've studied the news operation , " he said quietly . " Each and every one of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've got to add some juice to the operations . I 'm a newsman  --  remember that . First , last and always . This is my first shot as an executive . But I will also function as a newsman . In the Air40Force , when they finally stuck a couple of bars on my shoulder , I still flew a plane as a fighter pilot . " Ethel watched him intently as he spoke . He was handsome , cold-looking but handsome . He had to be almost six three , and not an inch of flesh to spare . She had to diet . He was grinning again . He could win the war with that smile alone . " I intend to stay with the action here . This summer I want to build a top team to cover the conventions , " Robin continued . " By then Andy Parino , from our Miami station , will be establishedon the network  --  he 'll also be part of our convention team . I want to add to the combination  --  not eliminate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , suppose we go round the table and you introduce everyone to me . " The two men walked around the table and Robin shook hands with each person . His friendly grin was intact , but his eyes were remote and his greeting impersonal . It was almost as if he had never seen any of them before . When Lester 's eyes rested on Ethel , he seemed surprised , hesitateda second , then quickly passed by her . The entire procedure went so quickly that Ethel was unaware of the deliberate slight . She watched them return to the head to the table . But Robin did n't sit down . His eyes scanned the table and rested on Ethel . He pointed to her . " I do n't believe we were introduced . " She stood up . " I 'm Ethel Evans . " " What is your function ? " She felt her face grow warm . " I 'm with the public relations office . . . " " Then what are you doing here ? " He was still smiling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well . . . I thought . . . I mean , someone has to be assigned to News . To publicize any new ventures . I figured you 'd need someone . " She sat down quickly . " When I want someone , I 'll notify the publicity department , " he said with the same half-smile . " Now suppose you return to wherever you came from . " Every eye watched her as she walked out of the room . Outside in the hall , Ethel leaned against the door . She felt physically sick . She wanted to run away from that conference41room  --  she could hear him talking inside  --  but she stood there . She could n't move . . . she was in a state of shock . Then she heard Lester ask Robin whether he wanted Mondays set aside for the weekly meetings . " There will be no weekly meetings , " Robin answered . " I call them as I see them . But I want one thing changed  --  " There was a second of silence . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice : " Get rid of this table , I want a round one . " " A round one ? " This was Lester . " Yep . A great big round one . I do n't like to sit or stand at the head of a table . I do n't want seats assigned . If we work as a team , we sit as a team . Get me a big round table . " There was a moment of silence , then everyone began to talk at once and she knew Robin had left the room . She heard them chattering with nervous relief . They 'd begin to file out in a second ! She dashed down the hall . She could n't wait for the elevator  --  she did n't want to face them . She ran to the stairway and ducked into the Ladies ' Room on another floor . Thank God , it was empty . She gripped the sink until her knuckles were white . Tears of humiliation ran down her face . " You son of a bitch , I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate you ! " She wiped her eyes and stared into the mirror . A fresh flow of tears spilled over . " Oh God , " she begged , " why did n't you make me beautiful ? " 42FIVEFTER HER DISASTROUS EVICTION from Robin 's meeting , Ethelholed away in her office for the rest of the day . She did n't want to run into anyone in the halls  --  she was positive they were joking about her unceremonious departure . She put the time to good use and typed out all the releases that had piled on her desk . At six thirty , the offices on the entire floor were empty . In her concentration on her work most of her humiliation had evaporated . Now she just felt drained  --  wrung out . She took her mirror and tried to fix her makeup . She stared at herself disconsolately . Her face looked lousy . She put the cover on her typewriter and stood up . Her skirt was a mass of rolled wrinkles . It was too tight . Ethel sighed . Everything she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on a strict diet . She took the elevator to the lobby . It was deserted but the coffee shop was still open . It was too late to go to Louis and Armand 's on the pretense of looking for someone and maybe having a few laughs at the bar . Everyone she knew would be gone by now . The dinner crowd would be coming in . She went into the coffee shop and ordered black coffee . Usually she took cream and two sugars . The diet was officially on ! She watched the waitress pour it into a cup . The girl 's hands were red and cracked from washing dishes . She wondered about her . Did n't she have dreams ? Did n't she hope to get somewhere ? She had much more on the ball than Ethel , as far as looks went . She was slim and had a pretty face . Yet that girl was content to stand on her feet , slop up a wet counter , take crap from customers , smile at a dime43tip  --  and Ethel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She got out her compact and retouched her lipstick . She was no beauty , but she got by . More than got by  --  but it would be nice to have a little something going in the looks department . Damn that separation in her teeth . And damn that lousy dentist who wanted three hundred dollars for a cap job . She had offered to sleep with him if he 'd do it for free and he had thought she was joking . When she let him know she was serious , he pretended not to believe her . Then she realized he did n't want her ! Dr. Irving Stein , a lousy little dentist , did n't want her ! Ethel Evans who only fucked the big boys  --  who was known at IBC as the " celebrity-fucker " ! She walked out of the coffee shop and hesitated in the lobby . She did n't want to go home . This was the night her roommate bleached her hair and the whole place would be a mess . But it was a good arrangement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benson-Ryan agency . Their hours were alike and they dug the same scene . They had met at Fire Island . That had been a great summer . Six girls had anted up to share a cottage . They called it the House of the Six Swingers . They had a black- board and kept score . Every time one of them banged a guy , the others had to put a dollar in the kitty . And at the end of the summer the girl who had banged the most men won the pot . Lii- Tian had beaten Ethel out by more than a dozen men . But then Lillian was n't choosy . She was a good girl , a fun girl , but a slob . She 'd even bang an assistant director . In Ethel 's book , an A.D. could n't qualify for anything but a few laughs at Louis and Ar- mand 's bar , if she was desperate . She was suddenly conscious that the doorman was staring at her . She left the building and started to walk . Maybe she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep at the bar and she connected with some agency men . She stood there for over an hour , exchanging dirty jokes , toying with one beer , her eyes watchful for some good pros- pect at the door . Someone who might buy her dinner . . . . At seven thirty she saw Danton Miller walk in alone . She wondered where in hell was Susie . He looked straight through her 44 without even nodding and joined some men at the other end of the bar . Another hour passed and then as if a timer went off , the agency men suddenly gulped down their drinks and raced to catch the last decent commuter train . And not one of the bastards picked up her check . She was hungry now . If she went inside and had a hamburger , Lillian would be through with the peroxide and jazz by the time she got home . She sat alone at a small table and ate the hamburger . She was starving but she left half the roll . Damn , why had she had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , she had a small waistline and her boobs were sensational . Size thirty-eightuprightand firm . Her problem was her ass and thighs . If she did n't get it off now , she 'd never lose it and next month she was going to be thirty . And still not married ! She could have been married , if she had wanted to settle for a civilian  --  the cameraman at CBS or the bartender in the Village . But Ethel would n't settle for anything less than a top celebrity . A one-night stand with a celebrity was preferable to a mediocre existencewith a nobody . After all , when she held a movie star in her arms and he murmured , " Baby . . . baby , " as his climax came , that moment made up for everything in the world . During that one moment she was beautiful  --  she was someone . She could forget who she was . . . . She had always wanted to be beautiful , even as a child . Fat little Ethel Evanski from Hamtramck in Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone on the block talk Polish , playing potsy , double Dutch , double Irish , reading movie magazines , sending for genuine autographed pictures of Hedy Lamarr , Joan Crawford , Clark Gable . Sitting on the front steps and playing " The Game "  --  talking dreams and pretending they were real  --  with Helga Selanski , a stringy-haired little Polish kid the same age . The whole world was Polish on that block in Hamtramck . And the second-generation Poles seemed locked in , destined to marry their own kind . They went to movies and saw that there was another world , but it never occurred to them to try45and enter it . But to Ethel , movies and the places she saw on the screen were n't merely two hours of silver escape . Hollywood was a real place . New York and Broadway actually existed . At night she would stay awake and listen to the radio , and when the voice announced that the music was emanating from the CocoanutGrove in Hollywood , she would hug herself with excitement  --  at that very second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the famous stars who were there . For that one moment , there almost seemed to be physical contact , like she was there . Ethel had always known she would leave Hamtramck . Getting to New York was Phase One in her dreams . One night when she and little Helga were listening to a band coming from the ParadiseRestaurant in New York , Ethel began " The Game . " Planningwhat she would wear when she grew up and went to such a place  --  what movie actor would escort her . Usually Helga played along with The Game . But on this night , Helga suddenly protrudedher bony jaw and stated , " I 'm not playing anymore . I 'm too big . " Ethel had been surprised . Usually she could make Helga do anything , but this time Helga was stubborn . " My mother says we should n't talk and play like this , it 's time for us to be practicaland not play make-believe games . " Ethel had answered , " It 's not make-believe . I 'm going there someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take me out  --  and kiss me . " Helga had laughed . " Like fish ! Kiss you ! Oh Ethel , I dee-double-dare you to say that to anyone else on the block . You 're not going anywhere . You 're going to stay right here like all the rest of us and marry a nice Polish fella and have babies . " Ethel 's eyes had narrowed . " I 'm going to meet stars . . . go out with them . . . maybe even marry one . " Helga laughed . " See , my mother 's right . She says it 's all right to talk about Hollywood if we know we 're just dreaming , but not to believe that it 's true . You 're crazy . And you wo n't go out with movie stars . You 're Ethel Evanski and you 're fat and ugly and live in Hamtramck , and what movie star would want to go out with you ! " Ethel had slapped Helga  --  hard . But she was frightened because she was afraid Helga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay on the block and marry a nice Polish boy , raise kids andmake mashed potatoes and onions ! Why had her mother and father come from Poland if it was to live in a little Poland in Detroit ? The incident that triggered " The Game " into determined action was Peter Cinocek , a boy with protruding ears and large red hands who had " come to call " when she was sixteen . Peter was the son of a friend of Aunt Lotte 's . He was a " real catch , " half Polish , half Czech . Her mother and father had looked idiotic with delight at the prospect . She recalled how diligently her mother had cleaned the house . Everything had to be spotless the night Peter Cinocek came to call . She could still see them . Her mother nervously waiting , in a freshly ironed housedress . Her father skinny and bald , so old . God , he had only been thirty-eight . He had seemed worn and bloodless in her eyes , but her mother had appeared massive and strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First she saw the big ears , then the pimples on his neck surrounding a great red boil that had not quite matured . But he could have been Clark Gable the way her mother had beamed as she placed a pitcher of lemonade on the porch and discreetly disappeared into the kitchen to wait . Everyone on the block waited . Everyone in the small row of houses knew a " suitor " had come to call . She sat on the swing with Peter Cinocek . They sat in silence , listening to the creak of the swing , to the whispers of the neighbors on the porch that adjoined theirs . She could still see that house . A small cubicle , sandwiched in a long block of identical small frame houses . Every house had the same broken-down porch , the same small dinky dining room , the tiny living room , and the kitchen where everyone spent most of their time . And , oh God , the endless garbage pails and the cats that frequented the back alley . Even now she could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a pail of water to shut them up . Either their aim was bad or the cats were extremely passionate , because after a brief lull the mating yowls commenced again . She thought back to that night when she sat on the creaking swing and listened to Peter Cinocek . He told her about his job at the A &P,; then he took her hand in his . It felt moist and limp. 47And he told her how he hoped to have a home just like this and many many children . That 's when she had bolted off the swing and run ! Of course she came back , when she was sure the bigearedPeter had gone . Her folks had laughed . In Polish they kidded , " Little Ethel , she was scared of a boy . Ah , but she was born to have children  --  nice broad hips , she would have an easy time . " Ethel was silent , but she doubled her efforts at school and that summer she got a job in an office in downtown Detroit and becamefairly efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not unhappy . She was waiting . Saving all her money  --  and waiting . When she was twenty she had saved five hundred dollars and she came to New York . Her final job in Detroit had been in the publicity department of a small advertising agency . In New York she landed in the secretarial pool at a large advertising agency . Ethel 's big chance came the day a drunken movie idol who was appearing on one of the agency 's shows wandered into the office . She had been thrilled to follow him back to his hotel . He had sobered instantly when he found he had taken a virgin . But he had been too drunk to remember that the virgin had practicallyraped him . He was frightened there might be repercussions . He offered her money . Ethel haughtily refused . It had been love , she insisted . His panic mounted . He was married and loved his wife . Was there anything he could do for her ? Well , she explained she was n't exactly thrilled being in the secretarial pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finesse and help from his agent he arranged for Ethel 's transfer to the New York publicity office of his movie company . This was smorgasbord for Ethel . She met a lot of drunken actors , even some sober actors . And she did it all for love . The word spread , and Ethel 's career had begun . When an opening came in the publicity department at IBC , Ethel took it . After all , she had practically gone through the movie company 's talent list . IBC offered more money and a whole new arena with its everchangingshows . She was good at her work and superb at her hobby  --  her job was secure at IBC . She was well aware that her reputation had traveled from coast to coast . She enjoyed the notoriety , even her title . One of48the Six Swingers from Fire Island had gone to work in Los Angelesin the publicity department of Century Pictures . She and Ethel exchanged voluminous letters . Ethel described every detail of each current affair , gave the man a rating , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny style and Yvonne , her correspondent , had Ethel 's letters mimeoed and they passed freely around the office . When Ethel learned this , she took even greater pains to be more descriptive . It worked almost like a paid ad for her . Many big names called her when they came to New York . Famous men . . . beautiful men . . . . Often she wished Helga could see her on some of her dates with the handsome stars . Helga must be faded and loaded with kids by now . Helga had married Peter Cinocek ! She looked up suddenly . Danton Miller was standing at her table . He was very drunk . " Hello , baby , " he said with his Cheshire smile . She smiled casually . " Well , well , if it is n't City Lights . " " Meaning what ? " he asked . " Like the picture of the same name . You only recognize me when you 're drunk . " Dan pulled up a chair . He laughed .

In fact , you 're really a beast . But I hear you 're the greatest . Want to come home with me ? " " You make it sound so romantic . " His eyes narrowed . " I hear you also have a big mouth . That you spread the word , give a Nielsen rating on every guy you lay . " She shrugged . " Why not ? My ratings save some of my girl friends from shacking up with a blintz . " Dan 's smile was ugly . " Who the hell are you to give a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent basis for comparison . " 49 " Want a drink ? " he asked , as the waiter placed his Scotch before him . She shook her head and watched him drain the glass . He stared at her . " You 're getting prettier by the minute , Gargantua . And I 'm getting curiouser and curiouser . " " You 're also getting very drunk , " she said . " Yeah , time to go home . Maybe I 'll take you home with me . " " You forget , Mr. President . I make the decision . " He was almost humble as he stared at her . " Well , wan na come ? " She thrilled at the glorious surge of power . He was begging now . " If I do , you have to send me home in a Carey car . " " I 'll send you home in a Rolls-Royce if you 're half as good as they say . " He lumbered to his feet and signaled for his check . She was relieved to see he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sober enough to enjoy it ? " she asked . " You make me enjoy it , " he challenged . " I think it 's about time someone gives a rating on you . " She stood staring at him on the street . " Forget it . I 'm too great to waste on a drunk . " He grabbed her arm . " Scared ? Maybe your reputation is phony . Probably is . How could you be any different from any other dame  --  unless at the finish your cunt plays The Star Span- gled Banner ' ? " " I think I 'll show you , little man . " She hailed a cab and helped him in . He had a nice apartment in the East Seventies . Typically bach- elor and typically executive . He led her directly into the bedroom and fumbled out of his clothes . She saw the surprise on his face as she undressed . Her perfect breasts always caused this reaction . " Hey , baby , you 're stacked . " He held out his arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susie Morgan , huh ? " " Would n't know , " he mumbled . He threw her on the bed . His kiss was sloppy . He tried to mount her but he was limp . She slid out from under him and rolled him over . " Take it easy , sonny , " she said . " You may be president of the network , but you 're just a boy to me . Now lie back . Ethel will show you what love is about . " She started making love to him . And as his excitement mounted , as he responded and whispered , " Baby , baby . . . you 're the greatest , " she forgot that tomorrow he would pass her in the hall without a nod . Right now she was making love to the president of IBC . And right now she felt beautiful . . . . D ANTON MILLER tossed the trade papers aside . He could n't concentrate on a damn thing . He spun his chair around and faced the window . In one hour he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no inkling what it was about . No warning , just the goddam phone call and the impersonal voice of Gregory 's secretary . So far the ratings were about the same . News was still in the cellar , but the new guy , Andy Parino , had just started cutting in from Miami a week ago . He had to admit it gave the show an extra dimension . Well , that was their problem . He had his own . The variety show was canceled . He was positive the Western Gregory had handpicked to replace it would bomb . And he was determined to come in with a mid-season saver . That 's why he had spent every night of the past week with two writers and a half-baked singer named Christie Lane . Last week he had stumbled into the Copa to catch a wellknowncomic  --  Christie was merely the supporting act . At first Dan had paid no attention to this forty-year-old second-rater who looked like an old-time Coney Island singing waiter . Dan had never heard of the bum . But as he watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Sig Hyman and Howie Harris , the two writers who had accompanied him , and said , " He 's just right for what I want ! " He knew they thought it was the whiskey talking . But the next morning he sent for them and told them he wanted to do a pilot with Christie Lane . They had stared at him with disbelief . " Christie Lane ! He 's a stumblebum , he 's over the hill , " Sig Hyman stated . Then Howie jumped in : " He ca n't even get a Saturday night at the Concord or Grossinger 's off-season . Did you read the Copa show notices in Variety ? Christie did n't even get a mention . The Copa girls ' costumes did better than he did . He only plays New York as a filler-in when they 've got a jumbo name . And those Irish ballads  --  " Howie rolled his eyes . And Sig added the clincher : " Besides , he looks like my Uncle Charlie who lives in Astoria . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone has an Uncle Charlie they love . " Sig shook his head . " I hate my Uncle Charlie . " " Save the jokes for the script , " Dan answered . Sig was right about Christie 's looks . He looked like Mr. Average Man . He 'd be perfect for a homey-type variety show . Sig and Howie gradually got the idea . They were top writers who had worked only for established stars . Three months ago Dan had given them each a year 's contract to help him develop new shows . " We make Christie the host , " Dan had explained . " Form a stock company  --  girl singer , announcer , do sketches  --  and we make use of Christie 's singing voice . If you close your eyes the bum sounds like Perry Como . " " I think he sounds more like Kate Smith , " Sig said . Dan smiled . " I tell you the timing is right . Television runs in cycles . With all the violence of The Untouchables and its imitators , the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Christie Lane is a second-rater . But no one in TV knows him , so he 'll be a new face . And we 'll use a big guest star each week to attract ratings . I tell you it can work ! " Like many performers , Christie Lane had started in burlesque . He could dance , sing , tell jokes , do sketches . He worked with Dan and the writers with hysterical eagerness . Dan guessed him to be about forty . He had sparse blond hair , a large homely face , and a medium frame that was beginning to show the hint of a potbelly . His ties were too loud , his lapels were too wide , the diamond ring on his pinky too big , the cuff links were the size of half-dollars , yet Dan sensed he could create a likable characterout of this oddly assorted but talented man . He was an inde- fatigable worker . Whatever town he played , he quickly scurried about and managed to pick up extra club dates on the side . He lived out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , he stayed at the Astor Hotel . By the end of the first week , Dan 's conception of the show had begun to take form . Even the writers got " with it . " They would n't change the awful ties , the wide lapels . Christie actually thought he dressed well . He liked the goddam ties . This was the key to his character , Dan told them . They 'd pick some good songs for him to sing , but at the same time allow him to do something corny of his own choosing . Dan had sent a brief synopsis of the show to Gregory last week . Perhaps the lunch was about the show . But Gregory would n't waste a lunch just to okay a pilot . He 'd send down word to go ahead . . . or to kill it . He hoped Gregory gave him the green light . It would be grim to have put in all this time and work for nothing . He got a headache at just the thought of all those nights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap cigars . And always the ever-present show girl from the Copa or the Latin Quarter sitting patiently and wordlessly ; reading the morning papers ; waiting for Christie to be finished . And the stooges  --  the two alleged " writers " Christie carried with him . Eddie Flynn and Kenny Ditto . They were supposed to supply Christie with jokes . As far as Dan could see they were " gofors . " " Hey , Eddie , go for some coffee . " " Kenny , didya go for my cleaning ? " Christie came from a world where a man proved his importance by the stooges he carried . Sometimes he paid Eddie and Kenny as little as fifty dollars a week . When things went well he paid them more . But they were " with him . " He took them to nightclub openings , the racetrack , on tour , and now , as Christie had stated , " My boys must be put on the show as writers . They should each get two C 's a week . " Dan had hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week tacked on to a budget was minuscule in a major 54 television production . And it would make Christie indebted . Sig and Howie would get the major credit on the screen , and it was always easy to list additional dialogue in small letters in the crawl at the end of the show . Of course they were still far away from the pilot . But if Gregory gave him the Go signal , he could have a pilot on tape by August . He hoped to do the show live  --  tape it at the same time , so they could use it for delayed markets . They could save a lot of money doing it live and Dan would be a hero if he brought it off . For a brief moment he felt good . Then he thought of the lunch and the ulcer pain began . What in hell was the lunch all about ? At twelve twenty-five he entered the elevator . The operator punched the button to Penthouse . Dan had once said P.H. also stood for Power House . The name had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or broken up there . Well , he was prepared for anything . He had taken two tranquilizers right after the phone call . He walked directly to Gregory 's private dining room . He noticedthe table was set for three . He was just taking out a cigarette when Robin Stone entered . Gregory walked into the room and motioned them both to the table . It was a sparse lunch . Gregory was on one of his health kicks . You never knew what to expect . Gregory had a chef who had worked at Maxim 's in Paris . You could come there one day and enjoy a cheese souffle and flaming French pancakes , sauce that stabbed an ulcer and delighted the taste . This usually happened when Gregory read that a contemporary had died in a plane crash , or was stricken with cancer or some similar inexorable disaster . Then Gregory would smoke , eat all the rich food and say , " Hell , a flowerpot could fall on my head tomorrow . " This state of gastronomic luxury would continue until another contemporaryhad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregory had been dedicated to this present health kick ever since his last bout of indigestion . In the beginning the talk was general . They discussed the chances of any team against the Yankees , and the effect of the weather on their golf scores . This was a lousy April . Hot as hell one day , then wham , down in the forties. 55Dan silently made his way through the grapefruit , the two lamb chops , the string beans , the sliced tomato . He passed up the fruit Jello . He wondered what Robin Stone was thinking . But most of all his sympathy went to the chef whose talent was being stifled with Gregory 's present regime . With the coffee , Gregory went into his life story . He told Robin about IBC . How he had created it . His early struggles building a new network . Robin listened attentively , asking an intelligent question now and then . And when Gregory complimented Robin on the Pulitzer Prize and even quoted from some of his past columns , Dan was properly impressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do all this homework . When Gregory put the unlit cigarette between his teeth , Dan sensed the real purpose of the lunch was about to begin . " Robin has some pretty exciting ideas , " Gregory said expansively . " It would come under network programming  --  that 's why 1 invited you here today , Dan . " Then he looked at Robin almost paternally . Robin leaned across the table . His eyes met Dan 's . His voice was direct . " I want to do a show called In Depth . " Dan reached for his cigarette case . The tone of Robin 's voice had held no request . It was an announcement . He tapped the cigarette . So that was it . Gregory had already given Robin the go-ahead . This was just protocol , pretending to allow him to make the decision . He was supposed to nod and say fine ! Well , fuck them  --  he was n't going to make it that easy . He lit his cigarette and took a deep draw . As he exhaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said easily . " What would it be ? A fifteen-minute news show ? " " A half-hour . Slated for Monday night at ten , " Robin answered . ( The sons of bitches even had the time picked out ! ) Dan kept his voice even . " I think we have the new Western scheduled for that spot . " He looked at Gregory . Robin cut in like a knife . " Mr. Austin feels the In Depth show should go in there . It would prove IBC had integrity  --  expanding the news media to prime time , plus doing a new kind of news show . The Western can always go to another slot . " " Do you realize the money we 'd lose ? We have a chance to sell a cheap game show right after the Western . We 'd have to give away the time following your kind of show . " Dan was addressingRobin , but he was talking for Gregory 's benefit . " If the In Depth show comes off , you 'll still get your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your life , " Dan said coldly . " We also wo n't be able to get a sponsor interested in a half-hour news show . " ( He wondered why Gregory was just sitting there , letting him battle out this cockeyed idea with this egghead ! ) Robin looked bored . " I know nothing about network sales . You can take that up with the sales department . My function at IBC is to bring some excitement and expansion into News programming , and I think this will be an exciting show . I intend to travel , to bring In Depth interviews to IBC about current world news . I might do some live shows out of New York or Los Angeles . I promise you this  --  I 'll deliver a damn good news show that will be entertaining as well . " Dan could n't believe what was happening . He looked at Gregoryfor support . Gregory smiled evasively . " When would you put this show on ? " Dan asked . It was too incredible to be true . " October , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on camera before then ? " Dan asked . " No seven o'clock news ? No special coverage ? " " I intend to cover the conventions this summer . " " I assume you 'll take Jim Bolt along . His face is well known , and he did a great job in fifty-six . " " He did a lousy job , " Robin answered , with no change of emotion . " Jim is good with the seven o'clock news . But he shoots no juice or excitement at convention coverage . I 'm forming my own team . " " Any ideas , or is this going to be another surprise ? " Dan asked . " I 've got it fairly well planned in my own mind . " Robin turned to Gregory Austin . " I 'll take a team of four . The team will consistof Scott Henderson , Andy Parino , John Stevens from Washingtonand myself . " This time Gregory spoke up . " Why Andy Parino ? He 's notpolitically oriented . I like him coming in from Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the convention , " Robin answered . " Andy went to college with Bob Kennedy . " " What 's that got to do with it ? " Dan asked . " I think Jack Kennedy will be the Democratic candidate . Andy 's friendship with the Kennedys might enable him to get us some back-door muscle . " Dan laughed . " I do n't think Kennedy has a chance . He made his bid for Vice-President in fifty-six and lost . Stevenson will be the candidate . " Robin stared at him . " Stick to time costs and ratings , Dan . You know that scene . Politics and news are my bag . Stevenson is a good man , but he 's going to be the bridesmaid at this conven- tion . " Gregory cut in . " Dan  --  I 'm for giving him a shot with this In Depth show . Ratings may be the name of the game , but we need some prestige . If Robin makes a name for himself with the con- vention coverage , the In Depth show might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You think you can buck Cronkite , Huntley and Brinkley , men like that , at a convention ? " Dan could n't keep the sneer from his voice . " I 'll do my damnedest . With Andy Parino along , I might get to tape an interview with Jack Kennedy . If he is nominated , it will make an excellent In Depth opening show . Then you can bet that Mr. Nixon will be delighted to give me an interview , for equal time . " " Okay , " Dan growled . " So you land yourself the candidates  --  that 's two shows . What else do you plan to do ? As I see it , so far it 's just a platform for political candidates . " Robin 's smile was easy . " I plan to go to London and do an interview with some of the top British stars  --  like Paul Scofield , Laurence Olivier . Then do one with an American star of equal stature and compare the different attitudes . In May , Princess Margaret will wed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a close friend of Tony 's . I 'll shoot for an interview with him . I 'm planning on leaving next week for San Quentin to try and tape an interview with Caryl Chessman . His latest executiondate is scheduled for May second . " " He 'll be granted another stay , " Dan snapped . " I do n't think so , " Robin answered . " And there 's such a mounting feeling against capital punishment that it 's important to do a show on the subject . " " I think it 's a little too controversial , " Dan argued . " I think all the subjects you 've picked are too far out . The public wo n't go for this egghead crap ! " Robin grinned , but Dan noticed the coldness in his eyes . " I think you underestimate the public . " Dan smothered his anger . He went for the cigarette case again . By the time he lit one he was able to get the right note of condescensionin his voice . " I think these ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're off knocking down windmills , I have to fight sponsors , juggle programs and worry about ratings . Before you take off on this safari , I think we should feel out some sponsors  --  after all , a network is team play . You ca n't grab the ball and run off like a steamroller and expect me to hold the line without knowing the signals . I like your spirit , your enthusiasm , but have you seen the schedule of NBC , CBS and ABC ? We need variety shows to compete with them . " Robin 's voice cut in like an icicle . " I 'm not going to pump sunshine up your ass . I 'm here to create excitement for the News end of IBC . Maybe your job is to sit around and see what hits on other networks  --  then try and come out with carbon copies of their hit shows . Okay , that 's your route . Not mine ! " Gregory Austin 's eyes were shining . He jumped up and clapped Robin on the shoulder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the same enthusiasm when I said I was going to start the fourth network . I broke rules , I hustled , I did n't listen to the doubters . Go ahead , Robin ! I 'll send word to Business Administrationto okay all expenses . You bring back those shows . Dan and I will work things out from this end . " Robin grinned and started for the door . " I 'll start things rollingright away . I 'll be in touch with you , Mr. Austin , from all points . " Then he left the room . Dan was still sitting at the table . He stumbled awkwardly to59his feet . Gregory Austin was staring after the closed door with unmasked admiration . " He 's quite a man , " Gregory said . " If things work out , " Dan answered . " They will ! And even if they do n't , at least he 's in there pitch- ing . Know something , Dan ? I think I 've just bought myself the greatest piece of manpower in the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his desk . The outline for the Chris Lane show was on his desk . Suddenly the whole idea seemed limp . The steely arrogance of Robin Stone deflated him . But he picked it up and put in a call for Sig and Howie . He set a meeting for four o'clock . God damn it  --  he had to make the Christie Lane show work . The In Depth show would fall flat on its ass , he was confident of that . But Gregory liked action . Okay , he 'd give him a show too . Maybe it would n't have Tony Arm strong-Jones or a Kennedy , and maybe the Times would murder it , but he 'd deliver a hot commercial show and a rating . And in the end , when the stockholders met , ratings were all that counted . Prestige did n't pay dividends . Only ratings paid dividends . He kept Sig and Howie in his office until seven o'clock . When he let them go , he demanded that they bring him more than an outline  --  he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . When the writers left , Dan suddenly decided to go out and get drunk . He sure as hell rated it . He walked over to " 21 " and stood against the bar . The regulars were there . He nodded and ordered a double Scotch . Something was bothering him , beyond and above the set-to with Robin . He searched his mind . It was n't Gregory 's admiration for the man , Gregory blew hot and cold with equal force . A few weeks of low ratings and he 'd be very dis- enchanted with Robin Stone . . . no , something that had hap- pened in that dining room had unsettled him . Yet he could n't put his finger on it . He retraced all the conversation , but he could n't 60 find the cause . He ordered another double Scotch . Then he relived the luncheon again  --  every word , even Gregory 's life story . He felt that if he only remembered , he would have the key and know where to fight and what to fight against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Time would prove him the winner and he would emerge stronger than ever . It was as if he had stumbled across a key to a bigger danger and lost it . He thought about Ethel . Maybe he 'd really tie one on and let her come to his apartment and do the cold-cream job . With Ethel , you did n't have to bother about satisfying her  --  in fact he got the feeling that she liked it better when she did n't even have to undress . He almost began to feel good . But the nagging feeling persistedof something wrong in his universe  --  something to do with Robin Stone . Again , he went over the luncheon from the top , all the way to Robin 's exit : " I 'll start things going right away . " Dan slammed the glass down with such force it broke against the bar . A polite waiter immediately wiped it up . The bartender poured another double and handed it to him . Dan took it . Christ , that was it ! Robin 's exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Austin , from all points . " In touch with you , Mr. Austin ! Robin Stone was supposed to report to him , Danton Miller . And Danton Miller should report to Mr. Austin . The son of a bitch was sidestepping him , going over his head  --  right to Gregory himself . And Gregory had allowed it . Well that settled it  --  he 'd have to make The Christie Lane show a smash . Now he had to come up with a winner . He walked outside to the phone booth and called Ethel Evans . " Want to meet me at my apartment ? " he asked . " I 'm no call girl . " " Meaning what ? " " I have n't eaten . " " Okay , meet me at P.J. 's . " " Is that the only restaurant in town ? " " Honey "  --  he softened his voice  --  " it 's eight thirty . I ca n't make it a late night . Next week , I 'll take you anywhere you want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I swear on my Nielsens. " 61Ethel laughed . " Okay , I 'll change to slacks . " " Why change ? " " Because whenever I see a girl walk into P.J. 's at nine , all caked up , it looks like she was disappointed . You know , had her hopes geared for Voisin or the Colony . But when she walks in wearing slacks , it looks like it 's her decision . " " You 've got everything figured out , have n't you ? " " Yes  --  even you , great man . " He laughed . He did n't want to argue with her . " Okay , Ethel , see you in half an hour . " He returned to the bar and finished his drink . He looked at his watch . It was bad enough to be seen with Ethel ; he was not about to be seen waiting for her . He signaled for another double . Someone tapped him on the shoulder . It was Susie Morgan . God , she looked so fresh and pretty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself shaking hands with a sandy-haired giant . The name rang a bell . Yeah , he had just been appointed to the CBS legal department . Or was it NBC ? The giant almost broke his hand pumping it . Jesus , how young and hearty did he have to be ! " Dan , look ! " Susie held out her hand . A microscopic diamond in a Tiffany setting was on the proper finger . " Well , well , when did all this happen ? " " Tonight ! " she said . " That is , I got the ring tonight . We 've dated occasionally for a year and just started going steady the last three weeks . Is n't it wonderful , Dan ! " " Just great . Lemme buy you both a drink . " " No , we 're having dinner upstairs with Tom 's folks . But I heard you were in here and I wanted you to be the first to know . " " When do I lose you ? " Dan asked . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married in June , we 'll have our honeymoon during our vacation . We both have two weeks coming . And , Dan , I 'd love to continue to work for you until the lucky day when baby comes . " She blushed and looked at the giant adoringly . " You bet ! " Dan nodded . " Let me know what you want for a wedding present . " He watched them as they left the room . It was n't proper to be that happy . He had never been that happy in his life . . . . But he had power . That was his kind of happiness . And he 'd come up with a winner with the Christie Lane Show if it was the last thing he did . By then Robin Stone would have fallen on his ass with the In Depth show and there 'd be a new president of News . He looked at his watch . Holy God , ten o'clock . He signed his check and suddenly was aware that he was very drunk . He got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So what ? All he wanted to do was fall into bed . Let her wait . He did n't need to offer that cunt any explanations . She was a bum  --  and he was a big man ! SEVENE THEL WAS WAITING . At ten thirty she called Dan . He answeredafter a few rings . " Who'sh this ? " " It 's me , you drunken son of a bitch ! I 'm sitting at P.J. 's waiting for you ! " The receiver clicked in her ear . She stared at it for a moment , then slammed it down in fury . Christ ! How had she ever allowed herself to get involved with him ? Danton was n't a movie star passing through on a one-night stand . And she did n't take any crap even from a movie star if he got out of line . She walked back to her table , paid her bill , and gave the place a final survey . She noticed everyone staring at a beautiful girl who had just entered the room , followed by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front table near the door . The girl looked familiar . Of course  --  she was on the cover of this month 's Vogue . Ethel looked at the men . She had been so busy staring at the girl that she had n't noticed them . One was Robin Stone , the other was Jerry Moss . She had met Jerry at a few agency parties . She walked over to their table . " Hi , Jerry , " she said with a smile . He looked up and did n't rise . " Oh , hello there ! " he said offhandedly . She smiled at Robin . " I 'm Ethel Evans . . . . We 've met before . I 'm with the publicity department of IBC . " Robin looked at her . He grinned slowly . " Sit down , Ethel , we can use another girl . This is Amanda . " Ethel smiled at her . The girl did n't return the smile . Her face was a mask but Ethel could feel the wave of resentment pour across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought . If I looked like that , I 'd own the world . Ethel took out a cigarette . Robin leaned across and lit it . She stared at him as the smoke curled toward his face . But he had switched his attention to his drink . The silence at the table unnerved her . She felt Amanda 's discontent , Jerry 's uneasiness , and Robin 's absorption with his drink . " I just finished an assignment , " Ethel said . Her voice sounded unnatural . She paused and almost whispered . " And then I stopped by to get a bite . " " No explanations , " Robin said with the same easy grin . " You 're here , relax . " He caught the attention of the waiter . " What do you want , Ethel ? " She looked at his empty glass . She always made it a point to drink what the man drank . It started them off with at least one thing in common . " I 'll have a beer , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And bring me my glass of ice water . " The waiter brought the beer and a large glass of ice water . Robin took a long swallow . Amanda reached over and sipped it . She made a face and put it down vehemently . " Robin  --  " Her eyes were angry . He grinned . " Do n't you like ice water , baby ? " " That 's straight vodka , " she said . Ethel felt a surge of excitement as she watched them curiously . Robin took another long swallow . " So it is . I guess Mike made a mistake . " " You 've got Mike trained , " she said coldly . " Robin "  --  she leaned closer  --  " you said we 'd be together tonight . " He threw his arm around her again . " We are together baby ! " " I mean . . . " Her voice was low and pleading . " Together . Not with Jerry and another girl . I do n't consider that being with you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry . Now we 're a four-some . " Amanda 's face remained impassive . " Robin , I have an early booking for a color layout tomorrow . I should have stayed home and washed my hair and gone to bed early . But I came out to be with you . And now you 're drinking . " " Are n't you having a good time ? " he asked . " I 'd be better off home . You do n't need me just to sit here and watch you drink . " Robin stared at her for a moment . Then the slow grin appeared . He turned to Ethel . " What time do you have to be up in the morn- ing ? " " I do n't need any beauty sleep , " Ethel answered , " it would n't help . " Robin grinned . " Jerry  --  we 've just switched girls . " Amanda grabbed her bag and stood up . " Robin , I want to go home . " " Sure , baby . " " Well ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sit down , " he said gently . " I like it here . I want to stay awhile . " Amanda sat down reluctantly , her eyes challenging , await- ing his next move . Jerry Moss stirred uneasily . " Ethel , maybe you and I should cut out . There 's a swinging party a friend of mine is giving , just a few blocks from here  --  " " I want you both to stay . " Robin spoke quietly but it was a command . Then he drained his glass of vodka and ordered an- other . He turned and looked at Amanda with a tender smile . " She is beautiful , is n't she ? And she should have sleep . I 'm a thought- less son of a bitch . Really want to pack it in , baby ? " She nodded , as if not trusting her voice . He leaned over and kissed her on the head . Then he turned to Jerry . " Put Amanda in a cab , Jerry , then come back . After all , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep while we do some serious drinking . " Amanda got up and walked out of the room . Jerry followed her helplessly . Every man at the bar stared as she walked to the door . When she got outside she crumpled . " Jerry , what did I do wrong ? I love him , I love him so much . What did I do wrong ? " " Nothing , honey . He 's just turned off for this evening . When he turns off no one can get through to him . He 'll forget it by to- morrow . " He whistled and tried to flag a cab . " Make him realize I love him , Jerry . Do n't let that ugly cow move in . She 's trying to  --  is n't she ? " " Honey , Ethel Evans is a one-night stand for everyone . Robin knows the score . Now get a good night 's sleep . " A cab pulled up . He opened the door . " Jerry , I 'm going back there . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Amanda , you 've only known Robin a few months . I 've known him for years . No one ever tells him what he can or ca n't do . You want to know what you did wrong ? And I 'm only guessing , but you made noises like a wife . You told him not to drink . Do n't crowd him , Amanda . This man needs space . He was always that way . Even at college . Now go home , get your sleep , I 'm sure it will be all over by tomorrow . " " Jerry , call me when you leave him . No matter how late it ishowcan I sleep when we 've parted like this ! Please , I 've got to know , even if he tells you he 's had it with me  --  or if he winds up with that girl . . . " " He wo n't tell me anything . You should know that . " Jerry was suddenly aware that the taxi driver was enjoying the scene while his meter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She rolled down the window . " Call me , Jerry "  --  she reached out and grabbed his arm  --  " please . " He promised . Then he watched the cab disappear . He felt for Amanda . Robin had n't been intentionally sadistic tonight . He had just turned off . Jerry had learned to recognize this trait in him . Maybe it was part of his charm . You could always count on Robin to do the unexpected . Like inviting Ethel Evans to join them . " How about some hamburgers ? " Jerry asked , as he returned to the table . " You can afford to skip a meal , " Robin said easily . " You missed gym twice last week . " " I live near here , " Ethel said . " Why not come back to my place ? I scramble crazy eggs . " She looked at Jerry and added , " And I 've got a very nice blond roommate . She might have a towel around her head but if we give her five minutes ' warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up . " I 'm not hungry . Jerry and I will walk you home . Then Jerry can walk me home . " He picked up the bill and handed it to Jerry . " You sign it , junior . It 's a write-off for you : entertaining a client . " Ethel lived at Fifty-seventh and First Avenue . She walked67quickly trying to keep up with Robin 's long strides . " You live near here ? " she asked . " I live on the river , " he answered . " Maybe we 're neighbors  --  " " It 's a long river , " he said . They walked silently the rest of the way . For once Ethel found it hard going . He had a way of answering that seemed to curtail any added conversation . They stopped in front of her building . " Are you sure you do n't want a nightcap ? " she asked . " I have some hundred-proof vodka . " " No . I 'm packing it in for now . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to be very happy at IBC , and if there 's anything I can do  --  " His smile was slow . " I 'm happy everywhere , baby . See you around . " Then he walked off with Jerry stumbling after him . Ethel stared at them as they rounded the corner . She wanted Robin so bad she physically ached . Why could n't she look like Amanda ? Why did she have to always kid and come on strong to get a man ? What did it feel like to have a man actually call you and want you and look at you as if you were the most desirable woman in the world ? She walked down to the river and knew the tears were running down her face . Oh God , it was n't fair ! It was n't fair to put the heart and emotions of a beautiful woman into the body of a peasant . Why had n't her emotions been as common- place as her body ? Then she could have settled for Peter Cinocek , maybe even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she said it aloud  --  " I just want to be someone , to have a man who is someone care about me . Is that too much to ask ? " Suddenly she felt an unbearable loneliness . All the dreams , the one-night stands  --  but she had nothing ! Sure , a nice apartment , beautiful compared to Hamtramck , but just a three-room modern place , shared with another lonely girl who also went after one- night stands . Sure it was great to hold a star in your arms , but the next night he was gone . She walked back to her building . She was positive that Robin Stone was in Amanda 's arms by now . She pushed this thought from her mind . No use making herself more miserable . There would be another night . When Robin and Jerry left Ethel , they walked a few blocks in silence . They passed a bar and Robin said , " Let 's cut in here and grab one for the road . " Jerry followed silently . " Where do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual silent grin , Robin stared at the glass seriously . " Christ , I went so long without drinking , I 've got a lot of making up to do . I came from a health-oriented family . My father never touched it . " Jerry laughed . " And I used to think you were a swinger at col-lege . " Robin stared at him as if seeing him for the first time . " Were you around Harvard at the same time ? " " Class before you , " Jerry said meekly . He was glad no one else was around . Everyone knew he and Robin had gone to school together and thought their friendship dated back to that time . That was one of the disturbing things about Robin . He always seemed attentive , but you never knew whether anything you said registered . Suddenly Jerry was angry at his own submissiveness . He turned to Robin with a rare show of spirit . " Where in hell did you think we met ? " Robin rubbed his chin thoughtfully . " I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Seems I just looked up one day at the Lancer Bar and there you were . " Robin signaled for the check . They walked out in silence . Jerry walked Robin to the large apartmenthouse on the river . It suddenly occurred to him he had never been to Robin 's apartment . Either he walked him home , or they met at a bar . When Robin casually said , " Come on up for a nightcap , " Jerry felt embarrassed . It was as if those clear blue eyes had read his thoughts . " It 's pretty late , " he mumbled . Robin 's smile was almost a sneer . " Wife waiting to give you hell ? " " No . It 's just that I have a long drive ahead , and I have an early appointment in the morning . " " Suit yourself , " Robin said . " All right . One fast beer , " Jerry conceded . He followed Robin69into the elevator . He would put in a good word for Amanda , he told himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well furnished . " A girl I knew  --  before Amanda , " Robin said , as he waved his hand around the room . " Why did you treat Amanda so badly tonight ? She loves you . Do n't you feel anything for her ? " " No . " Jerry stared . " Tell me , Robin  --  do you ever feel anything ? Have any emotions ? " " Maybe I feel a lot of things , but I 'm not able to show it . " Robin smiled . " I guess life would be a lot easier for me if I could . I 'm like an Indian . If I get sick , I just turn and face the wall and stay there until I get better . " Jerry stood up . " Robin , you do n't need anyone . But for what it 's worth , I 'm your friend . I do n't know why , but I am . " " Bullshit  --  you 're with me because you want to be . You just said it yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever feel any obligations toward anyone ? " Jerry knew he was probing , but he was helpless to stop . " Yep . In the war . A guy saved my life and he did n't even know me . He was in another plane . Suddenly he pointed to my right . A Messerschmitt was coming at me . I dived and got away . Two minutes later he got hit . I owe him a hell of an obligation . I owe him my life . I tried to find out who he was , but seven of our planes were knocked out that day . I would have done anything for that guy  --  even marry his widow if she 'd have me . But I never knew who he was . " " Then you 'd feel the same way about a surgeon ? " " Nope . That 's his job to save me . I 'd be paying him . But this guy in the plane , he did n't know me . He did n't have to save my life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you expect from a friend ? " Robin 's smile was tight . " I do n't know . I never had one . " Jerry started for the door . " Robin , I 'm not going to give you my scout knife , or wait until you cross the street against signals and save your life . But I am your friend and I 'll toss you some70free advice . Do n't write Amanda off as just another broad . I do n't know her well , but there 's something about her  --  I ca n't say what it is , but I sense it . She 's quite a girl . " Robin put down his glass and came across the room . " Good God , I forgot about the bird . " He went into the kitchen and switched on the light . Jerry followed him . There was a large ornate birdcage on the floor . And at the bottom a miserable little baby sparrow sat , staring at them . " I forgot to feed Sam , " Robin said , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparrow , is n't it ? " Jerry asked . Robin came over with a piece of bread , a cup of water and an eyedropper . He reached into the cage and gently took out the bird . It nestled in his hand with confidence . " The little jerk tried to fly too soon . It fell out of its nest and landed on my terrace and broke a wing or something . Amanda saw it happen . Naturally she rushed out and bought a cage , and I 'm its new mother . She ca n't take it home : she 's got a Siamese cat . The damn thing can walk up walls . " He held the little bird gently and it opened its beak expectantly . Robin broke off some bread crumbs and fed the bird . Jerry 's amazement increased when Robin took the eyedropper and dropped some water down its little beak . Robin smiled sheepishly . " This is the only way it can drink . " He placed it back in the cage and closed the door . It sat there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastened on the tall man . " O.K. , Sam , it 's nighttime now , " Robin said . He switched off the light and walked back to the bar . " I do n't think it 's in pain , " he said . " It eats like a son of a bitch  --  if something 's in pain it does n't eat , does it ? " " I 'm not familiar with birds , " Jerry answered . " But I do know that a wild bird ca n't live in captivity . " " Listen , as soon as the little jerk mends , I send him on his way . He 's a smart little bird with a mind of his own . Did you notice how he closed his bill after he had some crumbs , and demanded water ? " Jerry was tired . It seemed incongruous that a man like Robin would be so gentle with a sparrow and so callous to a woman . " Why not call Amanda and tell her the bird is okay ? " he suggested. 71 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Robin answered . " Her career comes first . Look  --  do n't worry about Amanda . She 's been around the turf , she knows the score . " Robin was pouring himself another drink when Jerry left . It was late , but he decided to walk to the garage . It would clear his head . On impulse he stopped at a drugstore and called Amanda . " Jerry  --  I 'm so glad you called . Oh , Jerry , he wound up with that cow , did n't he ? " " For your edification , we left that cow at her door maybe twenty minutes after you left . " " But it 's so late  --  what have you been doing ? Why did n't you at least call and tell me ? I would have been able to sleep . " " Well , we walked , then we stopped at a bar , then we walked to his place , then we drank and talked . And then we fed the goddam bird . When I left him he was extolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it wants water . " She laughed in relief . " Oh , Jerry . Shall I call him ? " " No . Amanda , play it cool . Give it time . " " I know . I 'm doing my best . You do all the right things automaticallywhen your heart is n't involved . You play it cool without even trying . It 's different when you care . I 've never cared before . I 'm in love with him , Jerry . " " Do n't let him know . " Her laugh was forced . " It 's crazy , is n't it ? To love someone , and have to hide it . You 're a man , Jerry . Did your wife play it cool ? Is that how she got you ? " He laughed . " Mary was n't a top model and I 'm not Robin Stone . And if I do n't get home , I may not have a wife . Good night , honey . " 72EIGHTT HE FOLLOWING MORNING Robin awoke at seven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed , he had yet to experience his first hangover . He was properly grateful to whatevermysterious force in his metabolism created this phenomenon and decided to enjoy it while it lasted . He realized that one day he would wake up feeling like any other guy who drank too much . He went to the refrigerator and poured himself a large glass of orange juice . Then he got a crust of bread and lifted the cover off the birdcage . The sparrow was lying on its side , its eyes wide open , its body stiff with death . He picked it up and held it in the palm of his hand . Poor little fellow must have been busted up inside . " You never complained either , you little bastard , " he said . " I like your style . " He threw on a pair of slacks and a sport shirt . Then he put the small body into a cellophane bag . He left the apartment and walked to the river . " A burial at sea , Sam . I ca n't offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inching its way along . He tossed the little bag into the black water and watched it spin into the ripples created by the boat . " I 'm sorry you did n't make it , fellow , " he said . " But at least you have one true mourner , which is a lot more than most people can claim . " He waited until the bag disappeared , then he walked back to the apartment . He stood under a cold shower and when he turned off the water the phone was ringing . He quickly tied a towel around his waist and dripping water across the room , he grabbed the receiver . " Did I wake you , Robin ? " It was Amanda . " I have an early booking . I wanted to get you before I left . " 73He fished around for a cigarette . " Robin  --  are you there ? " " Yep . " He was searching the night table for matches . He found them on the floor . " I 'm sorry about last night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking out , but I just hated that girl and I guess I was tired and  --  " " That was last night . Forget it . " " How about tonight ? " she asked . " Fine . Want to cook for me ? " " I 'd love it , " she said . " Then it 's a deal . Make it steak and that crazy salad . " " Robin , how 's the bird ? " " It 's dead . " " But it was alive last night ! " " It was ? " " Well  --  " She thought quickly . " I figure it had to be , or you would have told me . " You 're right . It kicked off sometime between two and five this morning . It was already stiff when I saw it . " " What did you do with it ? " " I tossed it in the river . " " You did n't ! " " What did you expect ? Did you want it laid out at Campbell 's ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Robin , do n't you ever feel anything ? " " Yep . Right now I feel wet . " " You know what you are ? You 're a cold son of a bitch . " She said it as a statement of fact rather than in anger . He laughed . She heard him drag on his cigarette . There was a pause . " Robin  --  what do you want out of life ? " " Well , right now I want some eggs . " " You 're impossible ! " She laughed to break the mood . " Then you 'll be here at seven . Steak and salad . Is there anything else you want ? " " You . " She laughed and some of her confidence returned . " Oh , Robin , 74I forgot to tell you . Next week , I 've been invited to the April in Paris Ball . They sent me two free tickets , and they cost a hundred dollars each . Will you take me ? " " Not on your life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baby , I may not even be in town next week . " " Where are you going ? " " Maybe Miami , I want to start shaping up a team for the conventioncoverage with Andy Parino . He 's with our O &O; station down there . " " What 's O &O?"; " Owned and operated . Each network is allowed to own andoperate five stations . Want to come ? Ever been to Miami ? " " Robin , I do n't have vacations . I work all winter and summer . " " Which reminds me , I 've got to work too . See you at dinner , baby . And for God 's sake , keep that damn cat in the bathroom . He sat on my lap all through dinner last time . " She laughed . " He adores you . And , Robin  --  I love you . " But he had already hung up . Amanda grabbed a cab and headed for the Lancer Bar . That last job had run thirty-five minutes overtime . It meant a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to go home and change . And she had wanted to wear the new pale blue raw silk . Robin was back from Miami and it was their last night together before he left for Los Angeles and the Democratic Convention . Damn Nick Longworth ! She had wanted to take ten days off and go to Los Angeles with Robin . It would have been so marvelous . Of course during the five days of convention she would n't see much of him . But after that he and Andy Parino were taking a few days off to play golf at Palm Springs . Robin 's invitation had been casual , but he had invited her ! Nick had been adamant . She was getting to be one of the hottest models in town . In the fall he was going to raise her fee again . He had too many important bookings for her in July . When she had explained this to Robin , she had longed for him to say , " To hell with the bookings  --  I 'm your future . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep forgetting how much money there is in the rag business . " And he had meant it . But Nick was right . She had worked hard to get into this bracket . She needed the money and if she missed out on a few important jobs , it was more than just losing the money  --  it was giving another girl a chance to hit ! She was on her way to the top . She looked at her watch . She was ten minutes late and the cab was inching along . She sat back and lit a cigarette . No use worry- ing . Andy Parino was probably with Robin anyway . He had been with them every night since he arrived from Miami . She liked Andy . He was very attractive , actually he was probably better- looking than Robin . But she accepted his looks with the same apathy she felt toward the handsome male models she occasion- ally posed with . Beautiful , but so what ? Yet just thinking about Robin made her feel light-headed . She wanted to get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and humid outside and her hair would be ruined . Their last night together . No , she must n't even think that way . He 'd only be gone ten days . But ever since he 'd become presi- dent of News he was always going off somewhere . He had been to Europe twice . She wondered if Andy would stick with them all evening . The last three nights they had met at the Lancer Bar , then gone to the Italian place and she did n't have Robin alone until midnight . And the last three nights he had done an awful lot of drinking . Yet no matter how much he drank , it never seemed to affect his lovemaking . But she liked it better when he was sober  --  then she knew it was the man whispering the endear- ments , not the vodka . The dim light of the bar made her blink . " Over here , baby ! " She heard Robin 's voice and headed toward the booth in the back of the room . Both men stood up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grin and the fleeting second when their eyes met and held obliterated Andy , the bar , the noise  --  even her heartbeat seemed suspended in that one wonderful moment of intimacy no one else could share . Then she was sitting beside 76 him , and he was back to talking politics with Andy . And the room and noise came into focus . She watched him as he talked . She wanted to touch him but she sat back , her face composed in the " Nick Longworth Look " : slight smile  --  no movement of features  --  nolines . The waiter placed a martini in front of her . " I ordered it , " Robin said , " I 'm sure you can use it . It must be hell to stand under lights on a day like this . " She did n't like the taste of alcohol . In the old days ( before Robin ) she would order a Coke and blandly say , " I do n't drink . " But somehow her instincts had warned her that Robin would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time she toyed with a drink . Sometimes she poured half of it into his glass . But today the martini felt cold and smooth . Maybe she was finally developing a taste for them . Robin and Andy went back to the subject of the coming nomination . As the conversation continued , he unconsciously reached out and held her hand , which was his way of including her in a discussion that was over her head . " Eleanor Roosevelt is coming as a last-ditch effort to help Stevenson , but he has n't a chance , " Robin commented . " It 's a shame , he 's a great man . " " Do n't you like Kennedy ? " Amanda asked . Actually she did n't care one way or another , but she felt she had to show some interest . " I 've met him . He has great magnetism . I intend to vote for him . I 'm just saying it 's too bad Stevenson is going to lose . It 's very rare to have two good men on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willkie , but he was running against Roosevelt . Who knows what might have happened if Willkie had been born ten years later ? " Then they fell to discussing the Vice-presidential nominee . She heard the names , Symington , Humphrey , Meyner . . . . She sipped her drink and watched Robin 's profile . They went to the Italian place at nine . And when dinner was over and Andy suggested going to P.J. 's for a nightcap , to Amanda 's delight Robin shook his head : " I 'll have ten days of you , junior . This is my last night with my girl . " 77He was unusually tender that night . He ran his hand through her light hair and looked at her gently . " My lovely Amanda , you 're so clean and sleek and beautiful . " He held her close and stroked her neck . And he made love to her until they both broke away exhausted and fulfilled . Then he leaped up and pulled her out of bed . " Let 's take a shower together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't worry that her hair was soaked , that she had a job at ten in the morning . She hugged his wet body because now , this moment , was all that mattered . And when he reached out and turned on the cold water , she shrieked , but he laughed and held her close . After a moment her body grew used to it and it was wonderful . He kissed her with the water pouring on their faces . Then they got out of the shower and he grabbed a towel and wrapped it around them . She stood and stared into his eyes . " I love you , Robin . " He leaned across and kissed her . Then he kissed her neck , and her small flat breasts . He looked up . " I love your body , Amanda . It 's clean and strong and wonderful . " He carried her back to the bedroom and made love to her again . Then they both fell asleep locked in an embrace . Amanda awoke because Robin was lying on her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She eased it from under him . He moved slightly but did not wake . She saw the bright eyes of the Siamese cat glowing in the dark . Dear Lord , he had managed to push open the door . He inched forward and sprang on the bed . She held him quietly and nuzzled him . He purred in contentment . " I 've got to put you back in the living room , Slugs , " she whispered . " Robin does n't like to wake up and find you around his neck . " She slipped out of bed carrying the cat . Robin stirred and his hand hit her empty pillow . " Do n't leave me ! " he shouted . " Please  --  do n't leave me ! " She dropped the startled cat and rushed to his side . " I 'm here , Robin . " She held him in her arms . He was shaking , staring into the darkness . " Robin "  --  her fingers touched the cold dampness of his brow  --  " I 'm here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man coming out of water . Then he78looked at her and blinked as if he had just awakened . He grinned and pulled her to him . " What happened ? " She stared at him . " I mean what in the hell are we doing sitting up like this in the middle of the night ? " " I was just putting the cat out and I was thirsty and then you yelled . " " I yelled ? " " You said , Do n't leave me ! ' " For a brief moment there was something close to fear in his eyes . Suddenly he smiled . " Well , do n't go sneaking off again . " She clung to him . It was the first time she had ever seen him vulnerable . " I 'll never leave you , Robin , never . I love you . " He held her away and laughed . He was in complete command again . " Leave me any time you want , baby . But not in the middle of the night . " She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared into the darkness . " I do n't know . I really do n't know . " Then he flashed his easy grin . " But you put an idea into my head . I 'm thirsty too . " He slapped her on the buttocks . " Come on , let 's go into the kitchen and have a beer . " They drank the beer and he made love to her again . The seasons melted into one another for Amanda . The early spring had brought Robin into her life . By summer their relationshiphad turned into a permanent blaze of excitement . He had been to Los Angeles and Chicago for the conventions . And each time he returned , she seemed to want him more than ever . Her love for Robin refused to find a level . It soared on and on to a peak of feverish infinity . And she was frightened of it because she knew Robin could not even begin to feel this kind of emotion . And the acclaim he received for his convention coverage did not add to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat  --  anything that took him away from her was a threat . If she ever lost him , she would n't want to go on . She fervently wished he was back doing local news . In October they sat in his apartment and watched his first In7gDepth show together . Gregory Austin called to congratulate him . Andy Parino called from Miami to congratulate him . Andy had just met a young divorcee and was in love ! Robin laughed . " Sure , it figures . With all the girls in Miami , a nice Catholic boy like you has to fall for a divorcee . " " Maggie Stewart is different ! " Andy had insisted . Of course , he admitted , his religion did create a few barriers , but it seemed that the main obstacle was the lady herself . She did n't want to get mar- ried . Andy had hired her to do a five-minute spot on their local news , and as he put it , at least they worked together . Amanda listened quietly . Perhaps it was then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It crystallized into action a few nights later when she giggled at the deadpan delivery of a girl doing a commercial on The Late Show . " Do n't knock it , " Robin said . " It 's not easy to be natural when the red eye of the camera is on you . " " What do you think I do ? " she asked . He pulled her to him and said , " You , my lovely one , pose for one shot fifty times until they finally catch you looking like the angel that you are . And if that does n't work , there 's always the airbrush and retouching . " Amanda thought about it . If she did a good commercial on television , perhaps Robin would really respect her . She talked to Nick Longworth about it . He laughed . " Dear girl , it 's a brilliant idea . Except : one , you ca n't talk . That 's a talent in itself . Two , you ca n't be one of many girls in a party scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have three booked for a beer commercial . The only thing you could do would be a big glamour product , and those kinds of commercials do n't just drop in your lap . Usually they go after a Hollywood-type spokeswoman  --  one who can be glamorous and also sell the product . " On Christmas Eve they trimmed a tree in her apartment . Robin gave her a wristwatch . It was very tiny and very beautiful but without a hint of a diamond on it . She masked her disappointment . She had given him a cigarette case , a slim gold envelope with a facsimile of his handwriting . Jerry dropped by for a pre-Christmas drink before he hurried home to Greenwich . He brought cham- pagne and a rubber squeak toy for Slugger. 80 That night as they were going to bed , Slugger leaped on the bed with his new toy . Amanda moved to collect the cat and put him in the living room . " Let him stay , it 's Christmas Eve , " Robin said . Then he added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jacket which was sprawled on a chair and took out a flat box . " Merry Christmas , Slugger . " He tossed the box on the bed . Amanda opened it . Tears came to her eyes as she looked at the soft black leather collar . It had silver bells and a little silver tag with his name engraved on it . She threw her arms around Robin and hugged him . " You do like Slugger  --  " He laughed . " Sure I do . I just do n't like him sneaking up on me . This way those goddam bells will warn me of his approach . " Then he took her in his arms and kissed her and they did n't even hear the silver bells as Slugger disdainfully leaped off the bed and left the room . NINEI N JANUARY , the February replacements were announced in the television column of The New York Times . Dan smiled corn- placently when he saw that The Christie Lane Show was the lead story . He had sweated out the summer and literally wrung a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and gave him the green light , Dan threw away the tranquilizers . Tonight he would really celebrate . Unconsciously his thoughts went to Ethel . Maybe it had been a mistake assigning her to The Christie Lane Show . But hell , he had to pay her off some way . There was no one , but no one , who could compete with that dame in the feathers . She had flipped at the assignment . He knew it was n't just the extra twenty-five bucks , the big attraction was the Hollywood guest star she would meet each week . Well , she was a good-natured nympho  --  and he sure as hell could n't hump her more than twice a week . So if she wanted to slip in a Hollywood name on her free time , well , that was the least he could do for the bitch . And this way , maybe she 'd lay off the " Take me to 21 ' " bit . Oddly enough , Ethel had no amorous inclinations toward Christie Lane . She said he gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reminds me of a chicken 's belly . " From then on she referred to Christie behind his back as C.B. Dan leaned back in his chair and his smile radiated content- ment . All he had to do was wait until February . Then he 'd bring in a big winner . He already had Alwayso as a sponsor . To go along with Christie as " Mr. Average Man , " Dan had lined up a plain-looking girl singer , a homespun announcer , and each week a big-name guest star would add some glamour . He had hired Artie Rylander , a top producer who had made his name in the fifties , doing live variety shows . Alwayso was going along , and doing their commercials " live . " Once again , Dan reveled in his luck . A beautiful girl doing the commercials was the perfect contrast to the homey family format of The Christie Lane Show . Right now Jerry 's office was probably loaded with every beautifulmodel in town . Jerry intended to use a male " voice over , " and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , they had to settle on one girl and stick with her . It was quite a problem . Dan smiled . For months he had been closeted with Christie Lane , the " gofors , " Sig and Howie , and Artie Rylander . And Jerry had an office stacked with beautiful models . He shook his head . He should have such problems . But Jerry did have a problem . Amanda . Amanda with her cool Nordic features , her high cheekbones , the heavy blond hair , was perfect for the product ; she had also done the Alwayso magazine layouts last year . Jerry wanted her for the show  --  but how would Robin take it if he hired her ? Would he say , " What the hell are you doing ? Trying to suck up to me ? " or , " That was damn nice of you Jerry . I sure appreciateit . " Suddenly he hated himself . Dammit , the issue should be who was best for the job and not how Robin would feel ! He sat and stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . Was he abnormal in his feelings about Robin ? That was ridiculous ! He had no sexualdesire for Robin Stone ! He just liked him , liked to be with him . But why did he like to be with him ? Sometimes Robin treated him with the same offhand conviviality he tossed at Carmen , the bartenderat the Lancer Bar . Then there were days when Robin hardly spoke to Jerry at all . Or then again , Robin could be gregarious , almost glad to see him : " Your drink is waiting , Jerr . " Yet secretly , he had the suspicion that if he suddenly stopped calling Robin , stopped dropping in at the Lancer Bar at five , he would never be missed . He pressed the buzzer and told his secretary to send Amanda83in . A few seconds later she strolled through the door . God , she even walked like her damn cat . She was wearing a leopard coat , her blond hair streaming to her shoulders . Leopard ! She also had a mink . All his wife had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across from him , undaunted by the daylight that shot at her face . He had noticed that some of the older models always cautiously turned away from it . But Amanda 's face was flawless and she knew it . " You really want the job ? " Jerry asked . " Very much . " He stared at her . Jesus , she was even getting to talk like Robin . Short and to the point . He saw her steal a glance at her watch . Sure , her time was valuable . Then he noticed the watch . Holy Christ  --  it was the Vacheron job , the tiniest watch he had ever seen . Mary had ad- mired it in the window at Cartier 's . But it cost over two thousand with the tax . " That 's a beautiful watch , " he said . She smiled . " Thank you . . . . Robin gave it to me for Christ- mas . " He was silent . He had sent Robin a case of a hundred-proof vodka . Robin had n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk . Her eyes were urgent . " I want this job , Jerry . I want Robin to be proud of me . " She gave him an imploring look . " Oh , Jerry , I love him . I ca n't live without him . You 're his best friend . What do you think my chances are with Robin ? It 's been almost a year that we 've been going to- gether . And sometimes I think I 'm no closer to him now than the first day we met . He 's so unpredictable  --  what do you think , Jerry ? Men confide in one another . " His entire mood changed . Suddenly he felt an odd sense of empathy with her . God , it must be hell for a girl to be in love with a man like Robin . He was glad he was a man . Glad he was just a friend to Robin . " Jerry , I want to marry him , " she said . " I want to have his children . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with my evenings during the weeks he 's away ? I 've taken a reading course at the New School . I 've finished Pickwick Papers , and I 've started on Chaucer . And when I tried to discuss them with Robin , he laughed and said he had no desire to be Professor Higgins . But I 'll keep at it . Oh , Jerry  --  sometimes I wish I did n't love him this much . Even after he 's spent the night with me , when he leaves the following morning , I snuggle against the towel he 's used . SometimesI fold it up and put it in my tote bag and carry it with me all day . And I reach for that towel and touch it . And it almost smells of him . . . and I get weak . I know it sounds silly , but I do this even when I know I 'm going to meet him at the Lancer Bar that very day . And each time I walk in there I die because I think maybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And sometimes when I sit with him and he grins at me , I think , Oh God , can I just hold this moment , make it last forever . And that scares me because it means maybe I expect to lose him someday . " She put her hands over her eyes as if to block out the thought . Jerry felt his own eyes become moist in sympathy . " You wo n't lose him , Amanda , you 're doing fine . You 've held him almost a year . That 's a record in itself . " Then he handed her a contract . " I think you 'll be just wonderful for our product . And it 's our pleasure to have you on the show . " Tears threatened to spill down her face . She reached for the pen and quickly scratched her name on the contract . When she held out her hand she was once more in complete control . He watched her as she left the office . Who would ever dream that this supergirl , this perfect creature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture , loving Robin Stone . Becauseany woman would know she never really had him and sense that one day she must lose him . He knew the Amandas would come and go , while he would always be able to join Robin Stone at the Lancer Bar . Two weeks later Jerry paid his first visit to a psychiatrist . He had been making love to Mary with startling infrequency . When she first brought it up , she had tried to make light of it : " Hey , you with your work and your golf on weekends  --  have you forgotten the woman you love ? " He had looked properly startled . As if it had been an oversight . " Not once all summer , " she said good-naturedly . " And now it 's the middle of September . Do I have to wait until it 's too cold for golf ? " He had made excuses , mumbling about how hectic the start of a new season always was . September was pressure time . In November he blamed it on commuting . The weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the train each morning , rushing for the train home . No , it was n't because he was at the Lancer Bar with Robin Stone . He worked late ! During the Christmas season he had more excuses . Everything was hectic . In January he had Alwayso to contend with . The commercialshad to be written , the product selected for the first commercial  --  hairspray , or the new iridescent nail polish ? If these excuses appeased Mary , they did not satisfy the nagging doubt that was beginning to form in his own mind . Well , he was tired , the weather was lousy , and he had a cold that hung on . There were even times he blamed Mary 's fat pink hair rollers . How was a guy supposed to be filled with desire when his wife slid into bed with fat pink rollers and a face loaded with night cream ! To avoid arguments he kept silent . The atmosphere began to feel like a pressure cooker . And one night it exploded . It happened on a Tuesday , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day checking the commercial copy . Everything went according to schedule . He had felt good . It had been one of those rare days , a day that had passed without any crisis . Even the weather was clear . He had taken the five-ten train and when he walked up the path to his house he suddenly felt a sense of well-being . It had snowed the day before . In New York it was already mashed into small banks of dull gray slush . But in Greenwichit looked like a Christmas card , clean and untouched . The lights that glowed in the windows beckoned warmth and hospitality . He entered and felt enveloped with contentment . The kids had yelled " Daddy ! Daddy ! " with pealing enthusiasm . He had played with them , enjoyed them , and felt relief when the maid took them off to bed . He had mixed martinis and had Mary 's waiting when she came into the living room . He complimentedher on her hair . She accepted the drink without smiling . " It 's the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He refused toallow her lack of enthusiasm to penetrate his sense of tranquillity . " Well , it looks particularly good tonight , " he said , as he raised his glass . She stared at him suspiciously . " You 're home on time . What happened ? Did Robin Stone stand you up today ? " He was so angry he choked on his martini . Mary accused him of being flustered and he stormed out of the room . A tight knot of guilt began to form in his throat . Robin had stood him up . Well , not exactly , but when Amanda was in his office , she had begged off at four thirty , claiming she had a five o'clock modeling session . Secretly he had been pleased : Robin would be alone at the Lancer Bar . He called Robin the moment she left the office . " Lancer Bar at five ? " he had asked . Robin had laughed . " For Christ 's sake , Jerry , it 's my first day back in town . Amanda is cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you tomorrow . " His face had burned with anger . But after a few minutes he cooled off . Big deal ! So he 'd see Robin tomorrow . And it was high time he surprised Mary for once and got home early . Of course he had made up with Mary . She had come up to the bedroom waving a fresh martini as an overture of truce . That night Mary did n't cream her face or use the fat pink rollers , but when they went to bed together he could n't get it up . This had never happened before ! Sporadic as their sex life had been during the past year , the few times they had been together , it had always been fully consummated . She had turned away from him and he knew she was crying . He buried his own fears and apologized to Mary  --  blamed it on himself , on the martinis , on the pressures of the new Christie Lane Show . Then he even went for a checkup and asked for a B-12 shot . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally stammered his real problem , Dr. Anderson recommendedDr . Archie Gold . He stormed out of the office . He did n't need a psychiatrist ! God  --  if Robin ever dreamed he even considered such a thing he 'd  --  well , he sure as hell would n't waste time on him . Robin would look at him in disgust , he 'd be a weakling . He did n't care what Dr. Anderson said . He did n't care how many healthy normal men went to psychiatrists when they stum-87 bled on some kind of " block . " He would never go to a shrink ! But it was Mary who broke down his resistance . She greeted him with a smile each night . She never wore the pink rollers any- more . He noticed she had new eye makeup . She took to snuggling against him in bed , and twice he had tried  --  but it had n't worked . Now he was afraid to try . Each night he pretended to be ex- hausted . The moment he hit the bed he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep . Then he would lie awake and stare into the darkness as Mary crept into the bathroom and re- moved her diaphragm . He could hear her muffled sobs . Dr. Archie Gold was surprisingly young . Subconsciously he had expected a guy with thick glasses , a beard , and a German accent . But Dr. Gold was clean-shaven and nice-looking in a subdued way . He accomplished very little in the first session . Jerry had come right to the point : " I ca n't make it with my wife in bed , yet I love her and there is no other girl . Now , where do we go from there ? " Before he knew it the fifty minutes were over . He was stunned when Dr. Gold suggested three visits a week . Jerry had been positive that whatever was bugging him could be straightened out in an hour . It was ridiculous ! But he thought of Mary  --  the muffled sobs in the bathroom . . . . O.K. Mondays , Wednesdays , Fridays . On his third visit , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sessions . At the end of two weeks he felt better . After some intensive Freudian soul-searching and probing back to his childhood , he had come to some disturbing revelations . He had personality problems but he was not a fag ! At least that subconscious gnaw- ing doubt had been removed . They discussed his father , an enor- mous virile-looking man who had ignored him during his child- hood . Then he suddenly began going with him to the football games , and his father had cheered for Robin Stone until he was hoarse . " Now , that boy 's magnificent ! " his father would shout . " That 's what I call a man ! " He recalled one specific incident when Robin had whipped through an impossible wall of players to score a touchdown . His father had leaped to his feet . " What a boy  --  that 's it , son ! " Through Dr. Gold 's gentle probings he recalled other fragments 88 of ego-damaging evidence . When it was finally conceded that Jerry was not going to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snorted , " How could I have spawned such a shrimp ? I 'm six foot one . Christ , you take after your mother 's family . The Baldwins are all puny . " O.K. At least he understood some things now . In trying to gain Robin 's friendship , he was still seeking his father 's approval . He was jubilant with this discovery . " I 'm right in my diagnosis , are n't I ? " he asked Dr. Gold . The cool gray eyes merely smiled . " You must answer your own questions " was the reply . " What the hell do I pay you for if you do n't give me the answers ? " Jerry demanded . " I 'm not supposed to give answers , " Dr. Gold said quietly . " I 'm here to prod you into working things out and coming up with your own answers . " The week before the show opened he stepped up his visits to daily sessions . He gave up his lunch hour . Dr. Gold preferred to see him between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lancer Bar . He insisted it was his only way of escaping tensionsittingwith Robin , having a few drinks . But when he missed the train , he was torn with guilt for Mary and the dinner that was ruined . On such occasions Jerry would be abrasive with Dr. Gold , demandingto know why he suffered such guilt . Why did he have to go to the Lancer Bar each day and sit with Robin , knowing he would suffer guilt toward Mary ? " I ca n't go on like this  --  wanting to please Mary , wanting to please myself . Why ca n't I be like Robin ? Have no conscience , be free . " " From what you say about Robin Stone , I 'd hardly say he was free . " " At least he 's his own man . Even Amanda feels she has no real hold on him . " Then Jerry told Dr. Gold Amanda 's searing confession about carrying Robin 's towel ; Dr. Gold lost his usually bland expression and shook his head . " She really needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a highly sentimental girl in love ! " Dr. Gold frowned . " That 's not love , that 's an addiction. 89 If a girl seemingly has all the attributes you give her , her relation- ship with Robin Stone should give her a sense of fulfillment . Not this kind of fantasizing . If he ever turned her against him . . . " Dr. Gold shook his head . " You ca n't just sum up people this way . You do n't know them ! " " When will Robin Stone be back ? " Dr. Gold asked . " Tomorrow . Why ? " " Suppose I meet you at your Lancer Bar . Then you can intro- duce me to Robin and Amanda . " Jerry stared at the ceiling . " But how would I explain you ? I ca n't very well say , Hey , Robin , my shrink wants to case you . ' " Dr. Gold laughed . " It 's conceivable we could be friends . We are about the same age . " " Could I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Some of my best friends are people , " Dr. Gold answered . " Could n't you have one friend who is a psychiatrist ? " Jerry was nervous when he saw Dr. Gold walk into the Lancer Bar . Robin was on his third martini and today of all days Amanda was working and meeting Robin later at the Italian place for dinner . " Oh , I forgot to tell you , " Jerry said as Dr. Gold approached . " An old school buddy of mine is dropping by . " Jerry threw his arm around the doctor . " Archie "  --  the un- familiar name almost stuck in his throat  --  " this is Robin Stone . Robin , Dr. Archie Gold . " Robin looked at the man with little interest . Robin was in one of his silent moods . He concentrated on his drink . Dr. Gold was n't exactly loquacious either . His cool gray eyes calmly appraised Robin . Jerry began to babble nervously . Someone had to talk ! At one point Robin leaned across and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In a way , " Dr. Gold answered . " He cuts out ids . " Jerry tried to make his voice light . " Would you believe it , Robin  --  Archie 's a shrink . We ran into one another at a party and renewed old acquaintance and he told me  --  " 90 " Freudian ? " Robin cut in , ignoring Jerry . Dr. Gold nodded . " Are you a psychiatrist or a psychoanalyst ? " " Both . " " You went through a hell of a long training  --  then you had to go through two years of personal analysis yourself , did n't you ? " Dr. Gold nodded . " You 're a good man , " Robin said . " It must have taken a lot of guts to go through school with a moniker like Archibald . You must be very secure . " Dr. Gold laughed . " Insecure enough to shorten it to Archie . " " Were you always interested in this gaff ? " Robin asked . " Originally I wanted to be a neurosurgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incurable illnesses . He can only prescribe medicine to ease the symptoms . But with analysis "  --  Dr. Gold 's eyes suddenly became expressive  --  " he can cure the ill . The most gratifying thing in the world is to see a patient recover and begin to function , take his place in society and use his full potential . In analysis , there is always hope for a better tomorrow . " Robin grinned . " I know your bag , Doctor . " " My bag ? " Robin nodded . " You like people . " He slapped a bill on the bar . " Hey , Carmen . " The bartender came to him immediately . " This takes care of my tab . Give my friends another round and keep the rest for yourself . " Then he held out his hand to Dr. Gold . " Sorry I have to shove off , but I have a date with my girl . " He walked out of the bar . Jerry stared after him . The bartender placed fresh drinks before them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't he ! " Jerry turned to Dr. Gold . " Well ? " Dr. Gold smiled . " Like the bartender said , he 's quite a guy . " Jerry could n't conceal his pride . " What did I tell you ? He got to you too , huh ? " " Of course . I wanted him to . I was more than receptive . " " You think he has any hangups  --  or bags ? " " I ca n't tell . On the surface , he 's in complete control , and he seems to genuinely care for Amanda . " " How did you get that ? He never even talked about her . " 91 " When he left he said , I have a date with my girl '  --  possessive . He did n't say , I have a date with a girl , ' which would be negating her importance , making her one of many . " " Do you think he likes me ? " Jerry asked . " No . " " No ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislikes me ? " Dr. Gold shook his head . " He does n't know you exist . " The control room was crowded . Jerry found a seat in the cor- ner . In fifteen minutes The Christie Lane Show would go on the air  --  live ! The entire day had been bedlam . Even Amanda had caught some of the tension . At the last rehearsal she had held the hairspray in the wrong hand and hidden the Alwayso label . Christie Lane and his " gofors " seemed to be the only people unaffected with pre-show hysteria . They joked together , Christie mugged for the crew , the " gofors " went for sandwiches . They actually seemed to be enjoying the frenetic rehearsals . The audience had already filed in . Amanda had said Robin was going to watch the show at home . Funny , Robin had never said a word , one way or another , about Amanda doing the commercial . Several times he had been tempted to ask her about Robin 's re- action , but he could n't without losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black suit . Harvey Phillips , the agency director , rushed in . " Everything is shipshape , Mr. Moss . Amanda is upstairs having her makeup retouched . I told her to stick with the blue dress for the hair spray , and change to the green for the lipstick . " Jerry nodded . There was nothing to do but wait . Dan told the director to click on the audio switch . The an- nouncer had come onstage to do the usual corny warm-up . " Any- one here from New Jersey ? " he asked . Several hands went up . " Well , the bus is waiting outside . " The audience laughed good- naturedly . Jerry looked at his watch . Five minutes to air time . Jerry suddenly began to wonder if the show would make it . It would be hard to tell even with the audience reaction . A studio audience loved every show . Why not  --  it was free . Tomorrow the reviews would come out , but reviews did n't matter in television . Nothing mattered but those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two weeks . Of course he would get an overnight rating , but it was the second week that counted . Three minutes to air time . The door opened and Ethel Evans slipped in . Dan nodded coolly . Sig was the only one who stood up and offered her his seat , but Ethel waved it off . " I 've got a photographerwith me . Right now he 's taking some candids of Christie so I can service them to the papers . " She turned to Jerry . " After the show I 'll have him take some shots with Amanda and Christie . " She flounced out of the booth and headed backstage . One minute to air time . Suddenly there was complete silence in the control room . Artie Rylander was standing , holding a stopwatch . He threw his hand down , the orchestra went into a theme , the announcer shouted , " The Christie Lane Show ! " The show was on . Jerry decided to go backstage . There was nothing he could do by remaining in the booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed any last-minute jitters . She was sitting in a small dressing room fidgeting with her hair . Her cool smile gave him renewed confidence . " Do n't worry , Jerry , I 'll hold the hairspray so you can see the label . Sit down and relax , you look like a nervous mother . " " I 'm not worried about you , honey . It 's the whole show . Do n't forget  --  I 'm the one who made the recommendation to the sponsor . Did you watch any of the rehearsals ? " She wrinkled her nose . " For about ten minutes  --  until Christie Lane started making idiotic mating calls . " She shuddered . Then seeing his face , she added , " But do n't go by me . As a man he 's repulsive , but the audience will probably love him . " The door opened and Ethel barged in . Amanda looked at her . It was obvious she did n't place her . Ethel 's glance covered the room . She seemed surprised at finding just Amanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . " Good luck , Amanda . " Amanda 's expression was polite but curious . She knew she had seen the girl somewhere . " I 'm Ethel Evans  --  we met at P.J. 's last year . I met you with Jerry and Robin Stone . " 93 " Oh yes . " Amanda turned away and began spraying her hair . Ethel sat on the edge of the dressing table , her large hips crowdingAmanda . " It seems we 're destined to be thrown together . " Amanda backed away , and Jerry tapped Ethel 's shoulder . " Off , Ethel  --  you 're blocking Amanda 's light . Besides , this is not exactly the moment to renew old friendships . " Ethel 's smile was friendly as she got off the makeup table . " You 'll be great , Amanda . They 'll go hoarse whistling when you come on . " She took off her coat and , without asking , hung it on the wall . " I 've got to park this somewhere . Listen , I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck ; two , I 'd like you to take some pictures with Christie Lane after the show . " Amanda looked at Jerry who nodded slightly . Then she said , " All right , but it wo n't take long , will it ? " " Just three or four pops of the bulbs . " Ethel started for the door . " I 'll sit out front and watch the show . And look , Amanda , you 've got to be a sensation . God , if I had your looks I 'd own the world ! " Amanda felt herself thawing . There was an urgent honesty in Ethel 's voice and she saw envy in her eyes . She said , " My aunt always taught me it takes more than looks to bring happiness . " " So did my mother , " Ethel answered . " But that 's a lot of shit . I 've got an IQ of one thirty-six , and I 'd trade it in for half a brain and a pretty face . And I 'll bet anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the way , is he coming to catch the show ? " " Robin , come here ? " The idea of Robin sitting in a studio audience was so preposterous that Amanda laughed . " No , he 's watching at home . " Amanda 's cool detachment vanished the moment Ethel left the room . She reached out and grabbed Jerry 's hand . " Oh , I hope he 'll be proud of me . Has he said anything ? " " What has he said to you ? " Jerry asked . " He just laughed and said if I wanted to get into this rat race , it was my headache . " Her eyes went to the large clock on the wall . " I 'd better go down , the show 's been on for ten minutes . " " You 've got five minutes , maybe more . " " I know , but I want to phone Robin and remind him to watch. 94You know him  --  he might have made himself a few martinis , stretched out and fallen asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage door . Jerry fidgeted as she stood and dialed in the drafty hall . The music was blasting , the applause was strong , the show seemed to be going well . Amanda hung up as the dime fell into the coin-return box . " It 's busy , Jerry . And I go on in a few minutes . " " Get going now , you 've got to cross behind the curtain to your set . " " Wait  --  I ' 11 try him once again . " " Beat it , " he said almost gruffly . " You 've got to be in place when the camera swings to you . Go check your props . I 'll call him for you . " He waited until she disappeared behind the backdrop and appeared on the small set designed for Alwayso . Then he dialed Robin 's number . The droning busy signal continued . He kept dialing until the actual moment of the commercial . " Damn Robin , " he swore to himself . " He knows the girl is going on , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wings in time to give Amanda a smile of assurance . Her face lit up and he knew she interpreted it as a signal that he had reached Robin . She was poised and at ease when the camera came to her . He watched her on the monitor . She photographed like an angel . No wonder she made so much money . She was breathless from nerves when it was over . " Was I all right ? " " Better than all right . Just great . Now you can relax for five minutes  --  then change , do the lipstick spot , and you 're home . " " What did Robin say ? " " I did n't get him . The line was still busy . " Her eyes brightened ominously . He grabbed her by the shoulder and steered her to the staircase . " Go up and change . And do n't you dare cry and ruin your makeup . " " But , Jerry  --  " " But what ? He 's home , at least you know that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddam phone . It might have been an emergency , even an overseas call . War could be95declared for all we know . Maybe an atom bomb dropped somewhere . Believe it or not , The Christie Lane Show is not the biggest happening in the universe . We only act as if we 're discovering a cure for cancer in here . " Christie Lane ambled over . Bob Dixon was on stage doing his medley . " Didja hear that applause ! And all for me ! I 'm the greatest ! " He put his hand on Amanda 's arm . " And you 're the beautifulest . If you play your cards right , Uncle Christie just might take you out for a sandwich after the show . " " Take it easy , " Jerry said , easing Christie 's hand off Amanda 's arm . " You have n't put Berle or Gleason out of business yet . And what 's with the uncle bit ? " " Have n't you heard what Dan-the-man has been saying all these months ? I 'm the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He turned his watery blue eyes on Amanda . " Doll , do I remind you of any relative ? I hope not , because it would be incest with the thoughts I 'm thinking . " Before Amanda could answer , he said , " Well , the movie star has finished his off key number . Now watch the real pro go out and kill them . " Then he dashed onstage . Amanda stood very still , as if she could n't believe what had occurred . Then she turned and started for the phone . Jerry stopped her . " Oh no , you do n't . You 've got exactly six minutes to change your dress and touch up your makeup . After the show , you can call him . And I 'll bet you a late supper at 21 ' that he 's watched you . As a matter of fact , I 'll take you both there to celebrate . " " No , Jerry  --  I want to be alone with him tonight . I 'll bring him some hamburgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shrugged . " Maybe I 'm crazy , but they do seem to like him . " Then she ran up the stairs to her dressing room . Amanda did the second commercial with equal ease . When the show ended , the small backstage area turned into a mob scene . Everyone was shoulder-punching one another . The sponsors , Danton Miller and the writers were clustered around Christie , shaking his hand . The cameraman was flashing pictures . Ethel came over and grabbed Amanda . " I want to get a picture of you with Christie . " 96Amanda broke away and raced to the telephone . Ethel followed her . " Ca n't it wait ? This is important . " Amanda ignored her as she dialed . She was conscious of Ethel standing and glowering . Jerry came and stood close at hand , protectively . This time there was no busy signal . It rang once , twice , three times . After the tenth ring , she hung up . Her dime returned . She dialed again . The same monotonous ring , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of a smirk come to Ethel 's lips . She straightened up . She was Robin Stone 's girl ! She was n't going to let them see Robin Stone 's girl crumple . He would n't like that . When he held her in his arms last night , their bodies close , he had stroked her head and said , " You 're just like me , baby  --  resilient . No matter what anyone does to either of us , if we hurt , we hurt inside and no one will know . We do n't cry on anyone 's shoulders , or even to ourselves . That 's why we belong together . " She forced herself to think of this now , as the phone kept ringing to emptiness . She hung up and casually took the dime from the coin box . She faced Ethel and Jerry with a smile . " You know I 'm an idiot , I guess I was so nervous about the show that I completely forgot  --  " She stopped , groping for some alibi . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes ! And you know why ? He told me he was going to take the receiver off the hook so that no one would disturb him . And I forgot ! " She turned to Ethel . " So let 's take the pictures , then I 'll dash to his place as we planned . And Jerry , would you be an angel and call Cadi-Cars ? Tell them to send a limo for me . " Then she walked toward Christie Lane and stood between him and Bob Dixon , flashed her brightest smile and quickly squirmed out of Christie 's arms as soon as the picture was taken . Fortunatelyhe was so mobbed with the agency men he did n't see her slip away . Jerry called for the car . He wondered about the phone story and thought it odd that she would forget . But her smile was too genuine . She was absolutely sparkling . Ethel had also noticed Amanda 's assurance . God , to be going home to Robin Stone  --  ! But once Amanda was in the protective darkness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver her home address . Well  --  eight dollars shot down the drain for the limo . And there were plenty of cabs around . But this had been the only thing to do . She had gone off with her head held high  --  she was Robin 's girl , and this was the way he would want it . Robin phoned bright and early the following morning . " Hello , star , " he said lightly . She had been awake half the night , vacillating between hating him , renouncing him , alibiing for him , and , through it all , wanting him . And she had promised herself to play it cool when and if he did call . But the early morning call caught her off guard . " Where were you last night ? " she demanded . ( Oh Lord , this was n't the way she had intended to act . ) " Watching you , " he said , in his same bantering tone . " You were not ! " She was breaking every resolve , yet was powerless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the commer- cial and the line was busy . I called you after the show and there was no answer . " " You 're absolutely right . The damn phone started to ring just as the show went on the air . Not that I minded  --  it was Andy Parino , and I 'd rather talk to him than listen to Christie Lane . But after I got off with Andy , someone else called . And I wanted to catch your great performance without any distractions , so the moment you came on , I turned off my phone . " " But you knew I 'd call right after the show . " " As a matter of fact , I forgot I had turned the damned thing off . " " Well , " she spluttered , " then why did n't you try me ? I mean , even if you forgot you turned it off you could have called me . Did n't you figure I 'd want to be with you after the show ? " " I know what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity backstage . I was positive that you 'd be the center of attention with your sponsors . I thought you 'd probably go off and celebrate with them . " " Robin ! " she moaned in absolute helplessness . " I wanted to be with you . You 're my guy , are n't you ? " " You bet I am . " His voice was still light . " But that does n't mean total commitment on either side . I do n't own you , or your time . " 98 " Do n't you want to ? " she asked . It was a wrong move , but she had to make a stab . " No . Because I could never fulfill my end of the deal . " " Robin , I want to belong to you  --  totally . I want to give you all my time . You 're all that matters to me . I love you . I know you do n't want to get married , " she rushed on , " but that does n't mean I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word ! " " I want you to be my girl , but I do n't want to own you . " " But if I 'm your girl , then you must know I want you to share everything with me . I want to be with you through everythingandwhen you ca n't be with me , I want to be home waiting until you come to me . I want to belong to you . " " I do n't want you to get hurt . " His voice was tight . " I wo n't get hurt . And I wo n't nag  --  I swear . " " Then let 's put it this way : I do n't want to be hurt . " After a pause she said , " Who has hurt you , Robin ? " " What do you mean ? " " You ca n't be afraid of being hurt unless you 've been hurt . That 's why you 've erected a steel door to put between us every now and then . " " I 've never been hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to be able to tell you that some siren broke my heart when I was a boy in the war . But nothing like that ever happened . I 've had girls  --  lots of them . I love girls , and I think I care for you more than I 've cared for anyone . " " Then why do you hold back a part of yourself  --  and force me to do the same ? " " I do n't know , I really do n't know . Maybe I 've got some crazy sense of self-preservation . Some instinct that tells me that if I did n't have that door , as you call it , I might get my head blown off . " Then he laughed . " Oh hell , it 's too early in the morning for soul-probing . Or maybe I have n't got a soul . Maybe if I opened that steel door , I 'd find there was no one home . " " Robin , I 'll never hurt you . I 'll love you forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean you 'll leave me ? " " I could go in a plane crash , a sniper 's bullet could hit me  --  " She laughed . " A bullet would bend if it hit you . " " Amanda . " His voice was light , but she knew he was serious. 99 " Love me , baby , but do n't make me your life . You ca n't hold on to people . Even if they love you , they have to leave you . " " What are you trying to tell me ? " She was dangerously close to tears . " I 'm just trying to explain how I feel . There are certain facts we all know : one , you ca n't hold on to people ; two , one day you have to die . We all have to die  --  we know it , but we ignore it . Maybe we feel that if we do n't think about it , it may not happen . But deep down we know it will . I feel much the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to clang shut , I ca n't get hurt . " " Have you ever tried to open it ? " " I 'm trying right now , with you . " His voice was quiet . " I 've unhingedit because I care enough about you to want you to understand . But I 'm slamming it shut right now . " " Robin , please do n't ! Love me all the way . I know what the door is  --  it slams on feeling . You 've closed that part of your brain . You feel love . . . but you refuse to think about it . " " Perhaps . Just as I refuse to think about death . No matter when I go , even if I 'm ninety , it will be a hell of a disappointment to have to check out . But maybe if I do n't care about anything too much , I wo n't be too sorry to leave . " She was quiet . He had never opened up this much to her . She knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do care about you . And I admire you , because I think you also have your own steel door . You 're beautiful , you 're ambitious , and you 're independent . I could n't love or respect a girl if I was her sole reason for existing . I think in a curious way , the rocks in your head fit the holes in mine . Now : are we squared away ? " She forced herself to laugh lightly . " Everything 's fine . Unless you stand me up for dinner tonight . Then I 'll bash those rocks in your head into little pebbles . " His laugh matched her own . " Well , 1 ca n't risk that . I hear you Southern belles swing a mean right . " " Southern ? I never said I was from the South . " " You never tell me anything , my beautiful Amanda . Maybe that 's part of your charm . But when you talk , every once in a while some Georgia or Alabama comes through . " 100 " Wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I never told you anything about myself , because you never asked . But I want you to know about me , I want you to know everything . " " Baby , nothing is as dull as a woman without a past . And once you know all the details there is no past . Just a long dreary con-fessional . " " But actually you do n't know anything about me  --  are n't you curious ? " " Well , I knew you had been around the turf when we met  --  " " Robin ! " " I mean it in the nicest way . I 'm too old to start up with a virgin . " " There have n't been so many men , Robin . " " Careful . Do n't disillusion me . I 've always been hung up on broads like Marie Antoinette , Madame Pompadour  --  even LucreziaBorgia . Now if you tell me there was just that nice boy you met at college , you 'll ruin the whole thing . " " All right , then I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill himself over me , or the king who offered to give up his throne for me . Meanwhile , shall I do the steak and salad bit for tonight ? " He laughed . The mood was broken and she knew she had put him at ease . " Okay , baby . Steak and salad , and I 'll bring some wine . See you at seven . " She fell back into bed and cradled the phone . Oh God , she just could n't go on playing games like this . But she knew she would , she had to , until she had gained his complete trust . Then his guard would relax , and . . . . She jumped out of bed and turned on her bath . She felt wonderful . Even though she had two rough sittings , this was a marvelous day . The greatest day in her life . Because she knew she had the key to Robin Stone . Play it cool , demand nothing . The less she demanded the more he would give . And soon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would happen so graduallyhe would n't even be aware of it . For the first time , she felt confident . She knew everything was going to be just fine. 101TENMANDA 'S NEW BURST OF HAPPY CONFIDENCE remained withher throughout the day . When a pose grew tiring , she relivedher telephone conversation with Robin and forgot the lights , the kink in her neck and the pain in her back . Dimly she could hear the photographer say , " Yeah , baby , oh yeah , hold that look ! " Her final session ended at four . She checked with Nick Longworth'soffice . " You 'll like tomorrow 's bookings , " Nick sang out . " Eleven tomorrowat Vogue  --  and your old buddy Ivan Greenberg is doing the layout . " She was delighted . The first job was n't until eleven . That meant she could sleep until nine . She could make Robin breakfast . . . . It was an unnaturally warm day for February . A haze hung in the sky and the air seemed thick enough to cut . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees and she could walk without freezing and she was happy , and to her it was the most beautiful day in the world . She went home , fed Slugger , set the table , made the salad and got the steaks ready . She was never able to eat when she was with him , she just picked at everything . She had lost ten pounds during this year with Robin . Five foot seven and only weighed one hundred and eight . But it was great for photography and so far it had n't affected her face . She turned on the television set to IBC . Robin liked to watch Andy on the seven o'clock news . She usually sat snuggled in his arms while he watched , or sometimes she sat across the room andstudied his profile . But tonight she 'd watch it  --  she wanted to be interested in everything that concerned him . Gregory Austin was also waiting for the seven o'clock news . Once again he had to hand it to Robin Stone . He had been right about using Andy Parino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do news , and he was turning out to be one hell of an executive . Robin was a good man but he was a phantom  --  he rarely saw him . You 'd think someone who traveled so much on IBC 's money would at least check in and say hello when he returned . In Depth received excellent notices  --  the ratings were rising all the timeyou'dthink he 'd want to take his bows . Danton Miller always came fawning for his praise . The son of a bitch was on the phone the moment The Christie Lane Show went off the air . Well , it just proved you could n't overrate the intelligenceof the television audience . They were a bunch of slobs . The Christie Lane Show was a piece of tripe  --  Judith had n't even been able to watch it ! And the reviews in the morning papers were brutal . But the overnight Nielsen rating was sensational . Of course the two-week national Nielsen would tell the story . He thought about this as he sat in the paneled den of his town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the best thing on television was the old technicolor movies on The Late Show . They did n't make girls like Rita , Alice Faye and Betty Grable anymore . Sometimes when he could n't sleep , he 'd raid the refrigerator and sit and watch the movie glamour girls he had been secretly in love with . He had Judith to thank for the color set . In fact , the entire den had been a surprise . She had it done last year while they were at Palm Beach . He had wondered about all those surreptitious calls  --  those quick trips she had to take to New York to see her dentist . And when they had returned from Palm Beach she had presented him with the den . Even had a big ribbon tacked on the door . He had been touched . Judith had great taste . The room was completely masculine . He knew that each piece of furniture had been carefully selected and had a history . The big world globe was supposed to have belonged to President Wilson . The desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did n't care about those things . He could tell you the exact date102 103Amos and Andy went on radio , and proudly show you the set of earphones he had built as a kid . But antiques , Oriental rugs , Ming vases  --  that was Judith 's world and she understood his taste and did n't foist her own on him . She got him antiques , but by God , they were strong ones , none of those faggy thin-legged French jobs . " Your domain , " Judith had said . " I 'll only come when I 'm invited . " A frown crossed his forehead . He felt a vague feeling of disharmony . He could n't put his finger on it but he had felt the same way when they had moved here from the Park Avenue penthouse seven years ago . When Judith had pointed out the two master bedrooms separated by a small wall of closets : " Is n't this divine , Greg ? Now you 'll have your own bedroom and I 'll have mine . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of " his " and " her " bathrooms , but had suggested turning one of the bedrooms into a sitting room . " I like sleeping in the same room with you , Judith . " She had laughed . " Do n't worry , my love  --  I 'll snuggle with you each night as you read the Wall Street Journal . But when I go to sleep , at least I 'll sleep . I wo n't have to poke you eight times duringthe night to tell you to stop snoring . " She was right and it was practical . In the beginning he had n't really believed he snored  --  until the night he had purposely set the tape recorder by his bed . The following morning he was in a state of shock  --  he could n't believe those unearthly snorts had come from him . He had even gone for medical advice . The doctor had laughed . " Nothing wrong , Greg  --  everyone snores after they hit forty . You 're lucky you can afford two bedrooms . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-aged marriage . " After she had given him his den , she had gradually taken over the large library . Fancied it up , changed the color scheme , the drapes and some of the furniture . He hated the room now . It looked like one of those VIP suites at the Waldorf Towers . His autographed pictures of Eisenhower and Bernard Baruch had been transferred to his den . Silver-framed pictures of her relatives had replaced them on the fancy desk of the library . Oh what the hell , why should n't she have her relatives on display ? She had the classy ones . Why should n't her twin sister who was a bona fide princess have her mug in a silver frame ? And the two little prin-104cesses she had begot . And it was right to have that oil painting of Judith 's father over the fireplace . God , the old man looked like an ad for some vintage wine . Gregory had no pictures of his father . They did n't take pictures to put in silver frames in the North of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her social secretary worked there every morning . He smiled at the thought of the word " work " applied to Judith . But then , maybe it was work planning all the parties , heading the charities , staying on the best-dressed list . He had to hand it to Judith  --  her personal publicity had been so great that people actually believed she had a personal fortune of her own when she married the two-fisted self-made Irishman named Gregory Austin . He smiled . Sure , she was social , went to all the right schools and studied abroad , but the family did n't have a dime . The rush of publicity when her sister married that prince had elevated the two girls to sudden fame . And now he felt Judith actually believed she had been wealthy in her own right before her marriage . So what  --  it must have been tough for her , watching her friends make their debuts and scrounging to keep up with them . She had been dropped from the Social Register when she married him , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that broke through every social barrier . Celebrity society . Talent was the greatest equalizer in the world . A Danny Kaye could be presented at court . A top politiciancould dine with a king . And the chairman of the board of IBC was welcome everywhere . Judith was a great girl and he was damn glad he had been able to supply the one missing ingredient in her perfect life . Judith Austin was society today . She was more than society  --  she created society . She made fashions , she was on the front page of that newspaper all the dames liked  --  Women 's Wear . Whatever she wore became a trend . He still could n't believeshe belonged to him . She still seemed unattainable . He had felt that way the first moment they met , and he still felt the same way . It was two minutes to seven . He went to the bar and mixed a light Scotch-and-soda for himself , a vermouth on the rocks for Judith . He wondered how she could drink the stuff . It tasted like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe105only drank wine or vermouth . Of course , Judith meant the great beauties over forty . Funny how a beautiful woman like Judith could have an age complex . She entered the den after knocking lightly . This tapping was a joke  --  asking permission to come into " his " den . But he went along with it . He realized in some way it nullified any guilt she felt for taking over the library . She took her place on the twin leather chair across from him . And he thought as he did every night when he saw her sitting there , " God , she 's a beautiful woman . " She was forty-six and looked barely thirty-five . He felt a sudden swell of pride and sense of well-being . He loved the goddam den  --  it had become a part of their lives . Even if they were going to the theater or giving a dinnerparty , they had their drink together in his den while they watched the seven o'clock news . To Gregory Austin , nothing got going until after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social life around this order . The news began : " Good evening and welcome to News at Seven . We are saving the last five minutes of our program for an unscheduled appearance of the president of IBC News , the star of In Depth , Mr. Robin Stone . " " What the hell ! " Gregory sat on the edge of his chair . " Since when has Robin Stone appeared on the seven o'clock news ? " Judith asked . " Since one second ago when I heard the announcement . " " He 's a very handsome man , " Judith commented . " But when I watch him on In Depth I get the feeling that he takes extreme care to let nothing of himself ever leak out before the camera . How do you find him ? " " Exactly like he is on television . You hit it right on the head . He 's an enigma . Great surface charm , but everything else locked in . Judith 's eyes glinted with a touch of interest . " Let 's invite him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Gregory laughed . " You ca n't be serious . " " Why not ? Several of my girl friends are dying to meet him . He 's never seen in public . And he 's really catching on . " " Judith , you know my rule . I do n't mix with hired help . " " When we go to the Coast we attend their parties . " " I do that because I figure you get a bang out of it . Besides , 106that 's different . They 're throwing the parties for us . We 're not inviting them to our home . The New Year 's Day bash we give takes care of them . And it 's great that way . Makes them feel they 're being presented at court . " She reached over and patted his hand . " For a man who was raised on Tenth Avenue , you 're the biggest snob in the world . " " No , it 's just business sense . Hell  --  I could n't care less about dinner parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get is sought after . " She laughed . " Gregory , you 're a wheeling-dealing bastard . " " I sure am . Even our New Year 's Day party is no open house . Very few people from IBC make it . " She smiled . " The eggnog party is so square that it 's in . And it was my idea . Do you know Women 's Wear Daily said it was becomingan annual event ? It even made Ernestine Carter 's column in the London Times . " " I think we had too many show-business names this year . " " We need them , darling . A few of them add dash to the party . And it is n't easy , Greg , getting the right people together at that time of the year . " He waved his hand , and listened to a news item that interested him . She was silent until the commercial came on . " Greg , when can we leave for Palm Beach ? We 're usually there by the end of January . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful Christie Lane Show . " " I want to stay here for a few more weeks . I think we can build that show into a real winner . But you can go . I 'll get there by the beginning of March at the latest . " " Then I 'll leave Thursday  --  I ' 11 have the house all set when you get there . " He nodded absently . The news had returned to the air . Judith stared at the screen without really watching . " Well , I guess Robin Stone will have to keep until next New Year 's Day ... " " Not even then . " Gregory handed her his glass for a refill . " Why not ? " " Because I 'd have to invite all the presidents of the other departments . Christ , Danton Miller only made it for the first time this year . " He leaned over and turned up the volume. 107She handed him his drink . Then she hung over his shoulders . " Greg darling , my girl friends do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet Robin Stone . " He patted her hand . " We 'll see , that 's a year away . Anything can happen by then . " Suddenly he sat forward . The camera came in for a tight closeupof Robin . Gregory could see why Judith 's friends were interested . He was a hell of a good-looking guy . " Good evening "  --  The clipped voice filled the room . " We 've all been fascinated by the news story of a genuine adventure of modern-day piracy . I 'm speaking of the Portuguese cruise ship Santa Maria that was seized at gunpoint in the Caribbean by twenty-four Portuguese and Spanish political exiles and six crew members . This raid was led by Henrique Galvao , a former Portuguesearmy captain . Three days ago , January thirty-first , Admiral Smith went aboard the Santa Maria thirty miles off Recife , Brazil , and held a mid-ocean conference with Galvao . Word has just reached me that Galvao has agreed to allow the passengers to leave the ship today . Galvao has been promised , along with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were also American tourists on board . But most of all , this reporter is interested in obtaining a filmed interview with Henrique Galvao . I am leaving tonight . I hope to bring back an In Depth interview with Galvao and perhaps some of the Americanpassengers who were on the pirated ship . Good night , and thank you . " Gregory Austin clicked off the set in rage . " How dare he just take off like that without reporting to anyone ! Why was n't I told ? He just returned from London a few weeks ago . I want live shows , not tape  --  that 's our main selling point against the compe-tition . " " Robin ca n't do all his In Depth shows live , Greg . It 's the world-famous people who give it stature . I , for one , would be fascinated to see an In Depth on this Galvao . I 'd like to see the man who at sixty-five has the courage to pirate a luxury liner with six hundred passengers . " But Gregory was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller . Five minutes later the call came through . " Dan ! " Gregory 's face was red with anger . " I 'm sure you have no idea what 's going on . You 're sitting at 21 ' relaxing  --  " Danton 's voice was cool . " Yes , I was relaxing on a nice sofa in the lobby , watching our IBC seven o'clock news . " " Well , did you know about Robin 's trip to Brazil ? " " Why should I ? He does n't have to report to anyone but you . " Gregory 's face went a shade darker . " Well , damn it , then why did n't he tell me ? " " Perhaps he tried . You were n't in the office today . I tried to reach you several times during the afternoon with some further reports on The Christie Lane Show . The out-of-town notices were great . I had them put on your desk . " Gregory 's face went rigid with anger . " Yes , I was out this afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be out one afternoon in a month ! " ( He had purchased two new horses and had driven to Westbury to see them . ) " Goddammit , " he went on , " you mean , if I 'm not there one day the whole network falls apart ? " " I do n't think the network is going to fall apart because one guy takes off for Brazil . Still I do n't like the idea of Robin Stone using the seven o'clock news as a publicity bulletin for himself . Gregory , I do n't like the president of any department having this kind of authority . But , unfortunately , Robin does not have to check with me . Since you were unavailable , the announcement might have been his way of telling you . It 's faster than Western Union . " Gregory slammed down the receiver . Danton Miller 's obvious pleasure over the situation spiked his anger into a helpless rage . He stood staring into space , his fists clenched . Judith walked over and handed him a fresh drink . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childish ? The man has pulled a big coup , for your network . Everyone who heard the seven o'clock news will be looking forward to the interview . Now relax and have your drink . We 're due at the Colony at eight fifteen for dinner . " " I 'm dressed . " She patted his face gently . " I think you might have one tiny run-over with the electric razor . We 're having dinner with AmbassadorRagil tonight . And he 's got three Arabian horses you 're keen on . So come on . Smile ! Let me see the Austin charm . " 108 109His frown disappeared . " I guess I like to be Big Daddy all the way , " he said grudgingly . " And you 're right . Making that an- nouncement was a superb piece of showmanship . It 's just that it 's my network  --  I created it , built it . I do n't like anyone making de- cisions without my approval . " " You also do n't like your trainer to buy horses unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be everywhere . " He grinned . " You 're always right , Judith . " She smiled . " And I think by next New Year 's Day Robin Stone will be big enough to rate an invitation . . . . " When Amanda heard the news , she stood staring at the set . It could n't be true . Any second the buzzer would ring and Robin would be standing at the door . He was probably on his way now , and she 'd drive to the airport with him . She waited ten minutes . By eight fifteen she had smoked six cigarettes . She called his apartment . It rang monotonously . She dialed IBC . They had no idea of what flight Mr. Stone was using , but suggested she try Pan Am . At eight thirty the phone rang . She banged her ankle against the table , rushing to it . " This is Ivan the Terrible . " Her face fell . She loved Ivan Greenberg , but tears ran down her face from disappointment . " You there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low . " Oh  --  did I interrupt anything ? " " No , I was just watching television . " He laughed . " That 's right , now that you 're a big TV star you 've got to keep up with the competition . " " Ivan , I adore you , but I want to keep my line open . I 'm ex- pecting an important call . " " Okay , pussycat , I know  --  I heard the seven o'clock news  --  the Great Stone Man is off , so I thought you might grab a hamburger with me . " " I 've got to get off the phone , Ivan . " " All right , get a good night 's sleep  --  we have an eleven o'clock sitting tomorrow . " She sat and stared at the phone . At nine fifteen she checked with Pan Am . Yes , there was a Mr. Robin Stone booked on the nine o'clock flight . The flight had gone on schedule  --  it had been airborne for fifteen minutes . She flopped into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivulets . Her mascara was all but gone and her false lashes were coming loose . She pulled them off and put them on the coffee table . She got up slowly and walked into the living room . She had to talk to someone . Ivan had always been her confidant . She dialed nervously and gasped in relief when he picked it up on the second ring . " Ivan , I want that hamburger . " " Great , I was just leaving . Meet me at the Tiger Inn : it 's a new joint on First Avenue , at Fifty-third . Right near you . " " No , you get the hamburgers and bring them here . " " Oh , I dig . Torture time . " " Please , Ivan , I 've got steaks if you like , and a salad  --  " " No , baby , if you stay home it 'll be like real hysterics  --  and that means swollen eyelids tomorrow . Not when you 're sitting for me , pussycat . I had to work an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London a few weeks back . You want a hamburger , meet me at the Tiger Inn . At least there you 'll have to keep your composure . " " I look awful . It would take me an hour to redo my eyes . " " Since when have you run out of dark glasses ? " " Okay . " She felt too weary to resist . " I 'll be there in fifteen minutes . " The Tiger Inn was enjoying a flash of popularity . It was almost filled . Amanda recognized some models and some advertising men . She toyed with a hamburger and stared at Ivan , mutely demandingan answer . He scratched his beard . " There 's no answer . He loves you this morning  --  and disappears this evening . With all the great cats in this town , you have to pick a character like Robin Stone . I mean , it 's not even your scene . After all , who is he , what is he ? Just a newscaster . " " He 's not just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 111He shrugged . " Big deal ! I bet if I mentioned both your names at every table here , they 'd all know you and say Robin who ? ' When you walk into a restaurant , everyone knows you . But Robin Stone ? " Her smile was weak . " Robin does n't care about things like that . We do n't even go to the right restaurants ! He has an Italian place he adores and the Lancer Bar . Sometimes I cook . " " God , what a thrilling life you have . " " I love it , Ivan ! Look , I 've been in this town five years . I 've seen every place and nothing matters but being with the man you care about . I love him . " " Why ? " he better than anyone else in the feathers ? Like , does he have a new scene ? " She turned her head away and the tears slid down under the rims of her dark glasses . " Cool it , Mandy , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't care . I do n't know them . " " But they know you ! Christ , baby , you 're on two covers this month . You 're really hot . Enjoy it  --  make it pay ! " " Who cares ? " " You 'd better care . It 's a cinch that Robin Stone is n't about to pay your rent or buy you any fur coats . Maybe making money does n't mean anything to you ? Or maybe you have rich relatives or something like that going for you . " " No , I have to work . My mother 's dead . I was raised by an aunt . I have to support her now . " " Then you 'd better get with it ! Make this year pay off . Because next year there could be a new girl . If you make it to the very top  --  play it smart and establish a top salary  --  you 'll be a top model for maybe ten years . " The tears slipped down her cheeks again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin . " He stared at her . " What 's your scene , baby ? Self-destruction ? You enjoy sitting around and crying for him ? Is that going to turn him on ? " 112 " You do n't think I 've already lost him ? " " I only wish you had . Because he 's bad news . A guy who walks through life without getting turned on destroys everything he touches . " " No , I ruined it . I know I did , this morning on the phone . I smothered him . " " Mandy , you 're sick . Look , nothing is ruined . Maybe he 's not so bad . Maybe you 're just some kind of nut . " " Why ? Because I 'm hurt ? I have a right to be . Look what he did to me ! " " Okay , what did he do ? He left on a job without calling to say goodbye . Big deal ! How many times have I done the same thing ? And you 've understood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than love , " she argued . " You mean love fucks up everything . " She managed a weak laugh . " Look , maybe Robin is a nice cat . I 'm only reading him from you . But you should work your pretty little ass off to be a big smash . Make him proud of you  --  that 's the way to hold a guy ! " " Oh , Ivan , you make it sound so simple . In a few minutes you 'll have me waiting for his cable to arrive . " " Could happen . But you 'll be a loser if you just sit around crying . Let word get to him that you 're having a ball . " " Then he 'd have a real excuse for dropping me . " " The way it sounds , this cat does n't need an excuse for anything . He does what he wants to do . Try playing it cool . Go out with other guys while he 's away . " " With whom ? " she demanded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must know plenty of guys . " She shook her head . " I 've been seeing no one but Robin for a year . " " You mean no one else has ever made a pass ? " She smiled slightly . " No one that I 've paid any attention to , including that horrible Christie Lane . But that was n't a real pass . He just asked me out . " " You could do worse . " She looked at him to see if he meant it . When she realized he was serious , she made a wry face. 113 " What 's so bad about Christie Lane ? " " You saw the show . He has n't an ounce of sex appeal . He 's a slob . " " Well , I would n't exactly rush and ask him to pose for Esquire . He 's a nice average guy who happens to be a big star . " " He 's not a star . I mean he 's star of The Christie Lane Show . But did you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceled after thirteen weeks . " " In thirteen weeks you could get a hell of a lot of publicity going out with him . " " But I ca n't stand him . " " I 'm not telling you to go to bed with him . Just let some of his publicity wash off on you . " " But it would n't be right to go out with him just for publicity . " He took her chin in his hand . " You 're a nice girl . A nice , stupid girl with an unlined face . A nice , stupid girl who thinks that face will stay intact forever . Honey , I 'm thirty-eight and I can still get all the eighteen-year-old chicks I want . And when I 'm forty-eight or fifty-eight with gray in my beard , I 'll still get them . But when you 're thirty-eight , you 'll only get high-fashion jobs  --  full length , that is . If you 've taken care of yourself ! But no more face ads , or hands  --  the ugly brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Christie Lane wo n't look at you . But right now , and maybe for the next ten years , you can have anything and anyone . " " Except the only man I want . " He sighed . " Look , I know you 're a sweet , regular girl or I would n't be sitting here wasting all this time when I 've got a lot of work piled up and three chicks I could score with at the drop of a dime . Face it  --  Robin does n't function like other people . He 's like a great big beautiful machine . Fight back , baby , it 's your only chance . " She nodded absently and scribbled the initials R.S. on the table with the swizzle stick. j ERRY Moss ALSO WAS OUTRAGED at Robin 's departure . He had checked with Robin at lunch and Robin had said , " Lancer 's at five . " Jerry had waited until seven and only found out what had happenedfrom Mary , who had accidentally heard Robin on the seven o'clock news . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , Dr. Gold did not think Robin was intentionally sadistic  --  he felt most of Robin 's actions were based on an unconscious effort to avoid close ties with anyone . He demanded nothing of his friends and in turn wanted no demands made on him . Amanda 's talk with Ivan had helped her . When she arrived to do the second Christie Lane Show she had worked herself from deep depression into a state of self-righteous anger . The rehearsals had the same frantic excitement but the tension was gone . There was a sense of fun and goodwill , a certain confidence that permeatesthe atmosphere when there is the smell of a hit . This time , when Christie Lane asked her to go out after the show , she accepted . They went to Danny 's Hideaway with his " gofors " and Agnes , a show girl from the Latin Quarter who obviouslybelonged to one of them . Amanda sat beside Christie , but aside from asking her , " What do you want to eat , doll ? " no other conversation passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several other comedians came by to congratulate Christie . He was thrilled with the attention and tried to trade jokes with them. 115Then , as he watched Milton Berle walk down the room to the front table , he said to Eddie Flynn , " I think we 're sitting in left field . " The show girl said in a tinny voice , " No , Chris , honest . As long as you make this room , you 're in good shape . It 's known as the Cub Room . The squares with the brown-and-white shoes sit in the other rooms . This is the in room . " " How would you know ? " Christie snarled . " I know , " she said calmly , loading butter on a breadstick . " I once came here with a square  --  oh , long before I met you , lover , " she said as she gave Eddie 's arm a reassuring pat . " And we were led right into another room . I dug right away where all the action went on when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square , he was from Minnesota , he had no idea . He collected matches to take home and was happy as a clam . " " Yeah , but Berle has the front table . And look , the McGuire sisters are at the other . " " Marty Allen is sitting along the side . " This was Kenny Ditto . " Yeah  --  but up front on the side . Someday I 'm gon na sit at the front table . And someday I 'll go to the 21 ' Club . " Amanda was surprised . " Have n't you ever been there ? " " Once , " Christie said . " I had a date and all she wanted was dinner at the 21 ' Club . I called and made a reservation . Then , wham  --  upstairs left field , in a corner . And like Agnes said , the girl I was with did n't know the difference . She collected matches , too . But I knew . " He seemed thoughtful . " I got to get my name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good  --  Eddie , tomorrowwe start with our own press agent . Smell around , find out who 'll work for a C-note a week . All he has to do is get me three column mentions a week . Nothing else . " It continued on throughout dinner . Christie Lane and his " gofors " plotting his career . The show girl ate everything in sight . Amanda learned that Kenny Ditto 's name was really Kenneth Kenneth  --  Christie had tacked the Ditto on , and Kenny was thinking of legalizing it . Kenny Ditto was a better name for a writer , it stood out on the crawl on the show . Amanda sat with them feeling strangely isolated , yet relieved at being left to herself . When they drove up to her apartment building , 116Christie remained in the cab and let Eddie take her to the door . He shouted out , " How about tomorrow night , doll ? There 's an opening at the Copa . " " Call me , " and she dashed into the building . He called the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than sitting home moping about Robin . That night Christie exuded confidence . The Copa was his " home ground . " They had a ringside table . She was crammed in among Christie , the " gofors , " and the new press agent  --  a skinny boy who worked for one of the major publicity firms . He explained that no decent press agent would take on an account for that money , but if Christie paid in cash he would " moonlight " and deliver the three column mentions a week . After the Copa , Christie wanted to go to the Brasserie , but Amanda begged off , pleading an early call . The following morning , Ivan called to congratulate her on an item in Ronnie Wolfe 's column which stated she and Christie were the new big romance in town . " Now you 're making sense , " he said . She was frightened at first , but when three more days passed with no word from Robin , she decided to see Christie again . It was another nightclub opening , another table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a second-rate dance team who had latched on , hoping for a guest shot on Christie 's show . The night of the third Christie Lane telecast was charged with excitement . The two-week Nielsens had come out  --  Christie Lane was in the top twenty ! The sponsors appeared , Danton Miller was shaking everyone 's hand , everyone was congratulating everyone . Alwayso gave Dan an immediate renewal for the following season . Thirty-nine weeks firm . That night Danton Miller threw a little victory party at " 21 " after the show . Christie unloaded his " gofors " and took Amanda . Jerry Moss came with his wife . They had a table downstairs in the middle section and although none of the captains knew Christie Lane , everyone knew Danton Miller and some of them even knew Jerry Moss . At one point in the evening , Danton Miller tried to make the proper small talk with Amanda . He complimented her and said she was excellent on the commercials . " I 'm used to a camera , " she said modestly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand shake . " " Have you ever acted ? Pictures ? The stage ? " " No , just modeled . " He looked thoughtful . " But it seems to me I 've heard of you  --  " " Perhaps in magazines , " she said . Suddenly he snapped his fingers . " Robin Stone ! Did n't I see your name coupled with his ? " " I 've gone out with him , " she said carefully . " Where the hell is he ? And when is he coming back ? " Dan asked . " He went to Brazil . " She was conscious that Jerry had stopped talking and had turned his attention to them . Dan waved his hand . " That tape from Brazil came in over a week ago . Then he sent us one from France . He actually saw de Gaulle . " He shook his head in amazement . " But now I hear he 's in London . " She sipped her Coke and kept her expression bland . " I imagine he 's getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ratings are pretty good , and for a news show it 's solid . But your new boyfriend is our jumbo ! " Dan looked at Christie and smiled . Her new boyfriend ! She suddenly felt she was going to be sick  --  physically sick . She was grateful that it was an early evening . Dan had a limousine and they dropped her off first . But Ivan was right . Two days later one of the afternoon papers carried a feature story on Christie Lane . The caption was THE MAN WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR . Amanda 's picture was featured in a three-column cut : " The man who lives next door does n't date the girl next door  --  he dates the top cover girl ! " Christie was quoted as saying , " We 've just been dating a few weeks , but man , I 'm really hung on her . " She threw the papers down in disgust . And she slammed down the phone on Ivan when he said , " Now you 're getting smart , baby . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stared at the open , vacant face of Christie Lane and felt nausea . So far they had been surrounded with stooges and comics and backslappers . But what would happen if there ever came a time when they were alone ? 118A few minutes later the phone rang and a jubilant Christie bellowed , " Doll  --  did you see the jazz in the papers ? Well , this is only the beginning . Christie is going up , up , and up . And tonight we celebrate . Alone . I got Danton to get us a good table at 21 ' for cocktails and then we 're going to dinner at El Morocco . Dantonis fixing it  --  so we sit in the right place and not in Squares-ville . " " I 'm sorry , Christie , " she answered . " I have a late booking , and a very early appointment tomorrow morning . " " Break it . You 're going out with the new King  --  " " I ca n't cancel my bookings . I earn too much money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! What 's the total ? " She thought quickly . She had no early bookings and her lastappointment was at five . " Well , three hours tonight , and two tomorrowmorning . " " Okay  --  what 's the tab ? " She could hear him chewing on one of those foul cigars . She started calculating . " Between three hundred and seventy-five and four hundred dollars . " He whistled . " You make that kind of loot ? " " I get seventy-five dollars an hour . " " You 're fulla shit ! " She clicked the receiver in his ear . Two minutes later he rang back . " Doll , forgive me . It 's just an expression . I mean , you knocked me on my ass . Eddie 's girl , Aggie , well , she models for those confession magazines  --  and she gets ten bucks an hour . Fifteen if she wears a bathing suit , and twenty if she shows her tits . " " I do n't do that kind of modeling . " " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of cash in modeling , what the hell is she doing posing for that crummy kind of dough ? " " Christie , I have to leave , I 'm late as it is  --  " " You 're right . Listen , doll , for that kind of money , you need your sleep . We 'll make the big leagues another night . But I have to keep the 21 ' bit  --  a lady from Life magazine is coming to have a drink with me . It 's a shame you ca n't make it , you could cash in on the publicity if Life decides to do me. " 119 " I 'm sorry , Christie . " She hung up and resolved never to go out with him again . Never ! Then Ivan called . " I guess by now you 've read all the papers , " he said . " Well , at least the Christie Lane story saves your face , pussycat . " " What do you mean ? " " I thought America 's top model would automatically go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen them ? " " No . " She began rustling through the papers . " Page twenty-seven . I 'll hang on while you cut your wrists . " Robin 's familiar grin hit her immediately . He had his arm around someone called Baroness Ericka von Gratz . " Are you still there , pussycat ? " " Do you enjoy being sadistic , Ivan ? " " No , Amanda . " His voice was low and serious . " I just want you to face facts . I 'll be home if you need me . " She hung up slowly and stared at the paper . Baroness Ericka von Gratz was attractive . Robin was relaxed , from the look of it . She read the story : Baroness Ericka von Gratz has not been around London since the death of her husband , Baron Kurt von Gratz . Those of us who have missed the fashionable pair are delighted to know she has come out of her mourning since the arrival of Robin Stone , American tele- vision journalist . The baron was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was feared the lovely baroness would not recover from her mental depression . But for the past ten days she has gone to the theater and several intimate dinner parties with Mr. Stone . And now the pair have gone off to Switzerland to stay with the Ramey Blacktons in their Swiss chalet . Skiing or romancing  --  it 's hard to tell  --  but everyone is delighted that our lovely Ericka is smiling again . She thumbed through the other paper . There was another pic- ture of Robin and the baroness . She threw herself on the bed and sobbed . She pounded the pillow as if she were slashing at Robin 's smiling face . Then , with a sudden change of mood , she sat up . Good Lord , she had a three o'clock sitting for Halston and his new summer hats ! She rushed and got ice cubes , wrapped them in a towel and put them on her eyes . Then she ran the hot water for compresses : if she alternated with the hot and cold on her eyes 120 for half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to keep the appointment  --  she was n't going to lose a job because of Robin . He certainly was n't pining away for her ! Then , with another swift change of mood , she dialed Christie Lane . He answered immediately . " Doll , I was just half out of the door on my way to the Friars . You just caught me . " " I 've canceled my late bookings , " she said . " Look , I was only kidding when I said I 'd make it up  --  I ca n't afford that kind of scratch . " He sounded frightened . " I 'm not asking you to pay me . I just suddenly decided I was working too hard . " His voice changed immediately . " Oh , great ! So everything 's still on . Meet me at 21 ' at six-thirty . That 's when the broad from Life will be there . " The evening went off easier than she had expected . The waiters had obviously been primed by Danton Miller . The table at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She forced herself to drink a Scotch  --  it might make the evening more palatable . The girl from Life was extremely nice . She explained that she had been sent over to " talk " to Christie about an interview . Then she was to write her impressions and the senior editors would decide whether they wanted to follow it up and assign someone to do a story . Christie managed a weak laugh . " This is a new slant  --  being interviewed for an interview ! How classy can a magazine be ! " The unexpected humiliation deflated his ego . Amanda suddenly realized that most of his bravado was merely a pretense to cover his terrible insecurity . He- heart went out to him . She reached over and took his hand . The girl from Life was also sensitive to his mood . She forced an easy laugh . " They do this with everyone , Mr. Lane . Why , just last week I did research on an important senator and the editors turned the story down . " Some of Christie 's self-assurance returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amanda realized that he was desperate for the story . He told the reporter about his humble beginnings , the early poverty , the honky-tonk nightclubs he had played . To Amanda 's surprise , the girl was actually interested . As she began to take notes , Christie 's enthusiasm soared . He threw121his arm around Amanda and winked at the reporter : " Imagine a bum like me winding up with a fancy society-type cover girl ! " At the end of the evening , Amanda asked to be dropped off first . She closed the door wearily as she entered her apartment . She was bone-tired . It was an effort to take off her clothes . She wanted to flop on the bed and go right to sleep . She took off her makeup and automatically began the hundred strokes on her heavy blond hair . She stared at the brush . Good Lord , it was filled with hair . She 'd have to stop using the Alwayso spray . No matter how much Jerry praised it , the stuff was murdering her hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell into bed and was gratified that she was so tired  --  at least she would n't lie awake and think of Robin and the baroness . She spent the next four evenings with Christie , followed by a reporter from Life and his photographer . But she could n't forget Robin Stone . At the end of the week , the Life story was finished . It looked fairly certain that they would use it . But as the reporter had said , you could n't be positive until it was " locked in . " The final shots were taken while she was doing her commercial on the show . Christie stood backstage with her and watched them leave . " It 's in the bag ! " he said , throwing his arm around her . " Tonight we 're really going to celebrate . And we 've got something even more important to celebrate  --  the new ratings just came out . Now I 'm in the top ten ! Do you hear that , doll ? Two weeks ago I was num- ber nineteen . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat ! We got ta celebrate . And there 's something else : we never really been alone . Tonight , you and me , we 're gon na go to Danny 's Hideaway together  --  alone . " When they were ushered to the front table , Christie was like a child in his happiness . To Amanda it seemed as if the ratings had been posted on the front page of The New York Times . The en- tire restaurant seemed to know . Everyone , including Cliff , the public relations man , stopped by to congratulate him . Christie basked in his new glory . He called out to other performers , left her alone several times while he " table-hopped . " Then he ordered steaks for both of them . She sat stiffly and picked at her food , while he ate with enthusiasm , his elbow on the table , his head 122 lowered to the food . When he had finished , he used two fingers to dig for a fragment of food lodged between his back teeth . He stared at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , I 've had enough . I 'll get a doggy bag . " " You got a dog ? " " A cat . " " I hate cats . " Then he smiled . " Does it jump on your bed at night ? " " Yes , it snuggles with me . " " Then tonight we go to my place . " He looked at her dress . It was a beaded sheath she had worn on the show . " We 'll stop at your place and you can feed the cat and change your dress . " " Why do I change my dress ? " He grinned awkwardly . " Well , look , doll , tomorrow morning how 's it gon na look , you traipsing through the Astor lobby in that getup ? " " I have no intention of traipsing through the Astor lobby . Tomorrowmorning I will be in my own bed . " " Oh , you mean you want to do it  --  and go home ? " " I want to go home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She colored visibly . " Chris , I do n't want to get up and walk out on you . But if you ever use that language again , that is exactly what I will do . " " Come on , doll , you know it do n't mean anything when I say things like that . But I 'll be careful . Shit , I was raised backstage , I learned those words when most kids were reciting nursery rhymes . Tell you what  --  every time I say one of them words , I 'll give you a buck . No , better make it a quarter . With a buck a throw and my vocabulary  --  you could retire . " She managed a smile . He was trying to be nice . It was n't his fault that she felt such physical revulsion for him , but she longed to get away from him . " Chris , I want to go home , alone . I have a headache , it 's been a long day . " " Oh sure , you stood around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance and do sketches . " " But you 're talented . You 've been doing it all your life . I panic123every time I see those three cameras coming at me . And facing that audience  --  it takes a lot out of me . You 're born to it . " " Maybe . All right , we 'll let the fuck  --  the lovemaking  --  go till tomorrow night . No , I got a benefit tomorrow , maybe the following night . Is that a date ? " " I do n't know  --  " " Whadya mean ? " " I just do n't leap into things like this . " " We been going together a long time  --  " " Three weeks and four days . " ( It had been four weeks and four days since Robin left . ) " Hey , you must care to number the days like that . Well then , when ? Or are you still carrying a torch for Robin Stone ? " She knew she had reacted visibly . The question had caught her off guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing my own investigating . " " It 's no secret that I 've gone out with Robin Stone . He 's a verygood friend . An old friend . I 've known him over a year . " " Then you 're not carrying the torch ? " " Who ever told you that ? " " Ethel Evans . " She was silent . She had no idea that Ethel was so perceptive . Only this evening , while Ethel was backstage , she had acted as if she had n't a thought in the world for anyone but Christie Lane . Christie mistook her silence for bewilderment . " You remember Ethel Evans  --  the big-assed publicity dame with the loud mouth . She 's laid every guy from coast to coast and brags about it . God , did you see her tonight ? Falling all over the guest star . She 's livingup to her title : the Celebrity Fucker . " " Maybe it 's men like you who make her bad news , " she answered . " Meaning what ? " " Hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , have you ever had an affair with her ? " " No , but everyone I know has had her  --  every big shot , I mean . " " Then you 're giving lip service to something you 've only heard . " 124 " Why the big defense for that big-assed dame ? You should hear her knock you . " " Take me home , " she said tightly . " Oh , Jesus . Doll , I 'm sorry . " He took her hand and looked at her intently . He placed her hand on his chest . " I go for you , Mandy  --  this is the first time I 've ever said it and meant it . I really go for you . And it could be for keeps . " She saw the large blue eyes pleading . The open , homely face was vulnerable and she knew he was telling the truth . Tonight on the air he had intentionally sung " Mandy "  --  the song Al Jolson made famous . When he got to the line " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned and looked right at her in the wings . The camera crew had gone crazy trying to change shots . She did n't want to hurt him , she knew what hurt was  --  she had been living with it for so long . She patted his hand . " Look , Chris , you 're going to be a big star , you 've got everything good ahead for you . You 'll have millions of girls , nice girls , beautiful girls  --  " " I do n't want them . I want you . " " Chris , we 've only been out together a few times . You could n't love me , you do n't know me . " " Doll , I 've knocked around plenty . I 've seen the dregs  --  lowdownnightclubs , low-down girls . All my life I wanted something better . That 's why I stayed single-o this long . I 'd grab off a hooker when I needed it , but I never made no emotional attachment . See what I mean ? Then , wham ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one package . For the first time I 'm in the big leagues , with a hit show and a lady at my side . Oh , I 've seen ladies before  --  classy broads at benefits I 've played  --  so I can tell the real McCoy . Only all the ones I 've seen have been buck-toothed and flatchested . But you 're the whole package  --  and I want you . " She blanched , thinking of her small breasts . But what differencedid it make ? He 'd never know . She looked at him with candor . " I like you , Chris . But I 'm not in love with you . " " That 's enough for me , " he said . " I 'm willing to wait . But just promise me one thing : give me a chance . Go out with me , date me , and eventually you 'll want to go to bed with me . And if it works out  --  it 'll be for keeps . Maybe it 'll even be marriage . " He stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all I ask . " 125 She knew what he was feeling . And if letting him hope made him happy , what harm would it do ? At least tonight he would go to bed with a dream . Eventually he would be a big star  --  and the bigger he got , the less she would matter . She kissed him good night outside her apartment . When she let herself in , she found a telegram had been slipped under the door . She picked it up and opened it lethargically  --  probably an invitation to a new discotheque : ARRIVING AT IDLEWILD AT 2 A.M. YOUR TIME , TWA FLIGHT 3 . NOW IF YOU ARE REALLY MY GIRL , YOU 'LL HIRE A CAR AND BE IN IT . ROBIN . She looked at her watch . Eleven forty-five . Oh , thank God , she could make it ! She rushed to the phone and ordered a car . She 'd never be able to figure Robin . He would n't waste a dime to call and say goodbye , yet he 'd send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to change her makeup , her dress  --  she had to look her best when she met him . She was singing as she rubbed the cream on her face . And for the first time in four weeks and four days she was n't the least bit tired . She stood at Gate 7 . The plane had just arrived . Passengers be- gan to disembark . She saw Robin immediately . He was different from other men . Other men walked . Robin sort of sailed through people . He dropped his attache case and threw his arms around her . " How 's the new television star ? " he asked . " Thrilled to see the world 's greatest newsman . " She matched his tone and vowed not to mention the baroness . He put his arm around her and walked to the car . " I do n't understand , " she said . " I thought you were in London . But your wire came from Los Angeles . " " I took the polar route and stopped off in Los Angeles for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handed her a small package . " A gift for you  --  I forgot to declare it . I 'm a smuggler . " In the car , she snuggled against him and opened the package . It was a beautiful antique Wedgwood cigarette box . She knew it 126 was expensive , but she would have preferred something half the price and more personal . " I hope you still smoke . " He laughed , reached for a crumpled pack of English cigarettes and offered her one . She inhaled and almost choked on the strong tobacco . He took it away from her and kissed her lips lightly . " Miss me ? " " Well  --  you took off leaving me with two steaks . I did n't know whether to miss you or kill you . " He stared at her absently , as if trying to recall . " I mean , you could have called me and said , Hey , baby , take the steaks out of the oven , I ca n't make it . ' " " Did n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cat had a marvelous meal . " " But you knew I had gone . " He seemed vaguely troubled . " Well , I heard you announce it on the air . But , Robin , you were gone for so long . " He put his arm around her and drew her closer . " Well , now I 'm back . Tired ? " She clung to him . " Never for you . " His kiss was long and deep . His eyes were gentle and he touched her face with his hands almost like a blind man trying to see . " My lovely Amanda . You are beautiful . " " Robin , while you were away I went out with Christie Lane . " He appeared to be trying to place the name . She added , " The star of the show . " " Oh . Yes , I hear he 's catching on big . I 've kept up with the ratings . " " My name was coupled with his in the columns . " " Did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She shrugged . " It 's quite high . " " Good . " She looked at him . " People  --  well , some people  --  think I 'm his girl . I wanted you to know it 's just talk . I did n't want it to bother you . " " Why should it bother me ? " " I thought it might . . . . He lit another cigarette . " I guess I was foolish to worry , " she said. 127He laughed . " You 're a celebrity . Celebrities get their names in columns . " " And you do n't mind that I went out with Chris ? " " Why should I ? I was n't exactly a hermit in London . " She pulled away from him and turned toward the window . She stared at the darkness of the night and the cars flashing by in the opposite lane . He reached out and took her hand . She pulled it away . " Robin , are you trying to hurt me ? " " No . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you trying to hurt me . " " But I 'm your girl  --  are n't I ? " " You bet you are . " ( That damned grin of his . ) " But , Amanda , I never said I wanted you on a leash . " " You mean you do n't mind that I went out with him , or you would n't mind if I continued to see him ? " " Of course I would n't mind . " " What if I slept with him ? " " That 's up to you . " " Would you care ? " " If you told me  --  yes , I would care . " " You mean you 'd want me to hide it . " " All right , Amanda : are you sleeping with him ? " " No . But he wants me to . He even talks about marriage . " " Suit yourself . . . " Robin , tell the driver to stop at my place first . " " Why ? " " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his arms . " Baby  --  you came all the way out to Idlewild to meet me . Why the switch ? " " Robin , do n't you see that  --  " Suddenly he kissed her and she stopped trying to explain . They spent the night together , locked in one another 's arms . There was no more talk about Christie Lane . It was as if Robin had never been away  --  it was like it had been in the beginning . 128 Like it was every time they were alone , in bed . Urgent , excitir and tender . Later as they lay together smoking and relaxed in a peacefi closeness , she said , " Who is the baroness ? " It had just slippe out . She regretted it instantly . His expression did n't change . " A broad . " " Now , Robin , I read about her , she 's a baroness . " " Oh , the title is real , but she 's a broad . One of those kic spawned during the war . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she married the baron  --  he was a fag , also voyeur . Ericka knew all the tricks . She 's not a bad girl , she 's gl a bona fide title , money for the first time and she likes to swin I met her at an orgy . " She sat up in the darkness . " An orgy ! " " They 're very large in London . I hear they 're catching on Los Angeles , too . " " And you like that sort of thing ? " He grinned . " What 's not to like about it ? It 's better the television over there . They only have two channels , you know . " " Robin , be serious . " " I am . Did you ever meet Ike Ryan ? " The name was familiar . Suddenly she recalled . He was American film producer who was based in Italy and France , ar was making quite a name for himself . " You 'll like him . We met in London . I was feeling rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to one of 1-parties . There were three Italian movie actresses , the barone Ike and me . It was ladies ' night in a Turkish bath . " " And you participated ? " " Sure , why not ? First I watched the girls with each other , thi Ike and I lay back and the harem took care of us . Ericka w the best  --  trust the Germans to perfect any art  --  so I carted h off for myself . But Ike 's a real good guy . He 's going to L.A. set up his own company . He 'll give that town a shot in the arm " With orgies ? " " No , with pictures . He 's a gambler , and he has great sty ! He 's also good-looking . Women like him . " " I think he 's disgusting . " 129 " Why ? " " Because , I mean , to do things like that ! " He laughed . " Am I disgusting ? " " No . I think you 're like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this Ike Ryan , he originated it  --  " " Baby , it started way back with the Greeks . " " And you 'd want me to meet a man like that ? Be seen out in public with him ? If I were seen with him and you , everyone would think I was that kind of a girl . Would you want that ? " He turned and looked at her very seriously . " No , Amanda , I promise you : I 'll never take you out with Ike Ryan . " Then he had gotten up and taken a sleeping pill along with a beer . " I 'm still on European time . I 'm overtired . Want one ? " " No , I have to be up at ten . " He got back into bed and took her in his arms . " My beautiful Amanda , it 's good to be with you . Do n't wake me when you leave in the morning . I have a busy afternoon ahead  --  mail piled up , appointments  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed and left his apartment quickly . She was tired that day and not very good in her work . And her hair was coming out again . She called Nick and asked him for a dermatologist . He laughed . " You 're molting , darling . It 's just nerves . " " It probably is , " she said . " Robin 's back . " " Call your doctor and get a B-12 shot or something  --  and for God 's sake , do n't spend every night making love . " " I do n't have a doctor . " She laughed . " I 've never needed one . Do you know someone good ? " " Amanda my love , you are so young and healthy it 's disgusting . I have six doctors . One for throat and ears , one for my prostate , one for my slipped disc . Want my advice , stay away from them all . Get a good night 's sleep , and once that Life story comes out all your worries will be over . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work by three . She went home to take a nap . Slugger jumped into bed and curled up in her arms . She kissed his tawny head . " It 's not night , darling . We 're just resting . " He purred gravelly in contentment . " You 're the only male who 's reliable , darling , but Robin 's back130and when he comes tonight , do n't hate me for exiling you into the living room . " She knew she had slept . She sat up with a jolt . It was darkshetried to orient herself . What day was it ? Suddenly she remembered . She turned on the light . Nine o'clock . Slugger jumped off of the bed and growled , demanding dinner . Nine o'clock ! And Robin had n't called ! She checked with her service . No calls . She dialed Robin . After ten empty rings she clicked the receiver . She did n't sleep the rest of the night . Slugger , sensing something was wrong , nestled close to her . The following day she waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he might be ill . He answered , and he was fine . It was just all the desk work that had piled up . He said he would call tomorrow . The following morning she caught his name as she scanned one of the columns : Ike Ryan and Robin Stone were at El Morocco with two beautiful Italian actresses . Their names were too long for this reporter to remember , but he 'll never forget their faces and their  --  wow ! She threw the paper on the floor . He had been feeling her out , knowing Ike Ryan was coming to town . Oh Lord , why had she said she would n't be seen with him ? That night she went out with Christie . They went to Danny 's . She was very quiet and Christie was disgruntled : they had been seated at a small table along the wall . One of the front tables was occupied by a group of Hollywood celebrities . The other was empty , with a RESERVED sign prominently displayed . " Probably some other Hollywood joker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why is everyone so impressed with movie people ? I bet more people know me than most of the stars in Holly-wood . " She tried to cheer him ; no use both of them being miserable . " Christie , this is a marvelous table . I like being in the center of the room , you can see everyone . " " I belong at the best table everywhere ! " " Wherever you sit is automatically the best table , " she said . He stared at her . " You believe that ? " " It 's more important if you do . " 131He grinned and ordered their dinner . After a short time his good humor returned . " The Life story is locked in , " he said . He looked at her longingly . " Mandy , right now there 's something I want more than Life . How do I have to prove myself ? I love you . I feel like a jerky high-school boy , sitting just holding your hand . I been doing a lot of thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sleep with me ? I know there 's no one else . Eddie was trying to tell me that the word around was that you were deadstuckon Robin Stone . But I read the column today . . . . " " Chris , since you brought it up , I think I ought to tell you  --  " She stopped , her attention suddenly riveted to the four people who were being shown to the front table . Danny himself was usheringthem in . Two beautiful girls , two men . And one of the men was Robin ! She felt that strange light-headedness that often comes with shock . Robin was lighting the girl 's cigarette and giving her that very private grin . The other man was probably Ike Ryan . " Tell me what , doll ? " Chris was staring at her . She knew she had to say something , but she was powerless to remove her eyes from Robin . She saw him lean over and kiss the girl on the tip of her nose . Then he laughed . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I watched him one night  --  wanted to take a gander at my competition . I tell you , I could n't watch more than ten minutes . He was yelling about Cuba and all that kind of shit , and some jerk was agreeing with him . Big deal . Did you get a load of his ratings against mine ? " " He 's in the top twenty-five , that 's excellent for a news show . " She wondered why she was defending him . " I 'm gon na be number one , you watch . And everyone treats me like I 'm number one  --  except you . " " I  --  I like you very much . " " Then put up or shut up . " " I want to go home . " She really felt ill . Robin was listening to the girl with his head bent close . " Oh , doll , let 's not fight . I love you , but we 've got to make it together . " " Take me home . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get pregnant , great  --  we 'll get married even sooner . " " No , I do n't want to have a baby until after we 're married . I would n't want people to think that was the reason . " " Listen , doll , I 'm forty-seven . I 'm leveling with you . Everyone thinks I 'm forty . Even Eddie and Kenny do n't know . But since you 're gon na be my wife , I want you to know the real scene . 1 been careful with money all my life . I always made my forty or fifty thousand for the last fifteen years . And no matter what I made , I put half of it away . By the time I 'm sixty , I 'll have a millionin annuities . Twenty years ago I met this guy in Chicago , he 's a big tax expert . I got his kid out of some trouble , nothing serious , a slight car accident . But I had connections and I squared the rap and the kid 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became my father , mother , lawyer , tax man , everything . He said to me right then that I was a second-class talent , but if I listened to him , I 'd wind up a first-class citizen . And he started taking half my money  --  I was maybe only earning a couple Cnotesa week then  --  but Lou invested it . By now I got quite a portfolio  --  stufflike IBM that does nothing but double . Now that I 've made it big , Lou still takes half . And if this keeps up  --  my new success , I mean  --  well , in a few years I 'll have not one but two million . And the way he 's investing it , I 'll have over six thousand a month tax-free , without even touching the principal . We can leave that to our kid . Now that I 've got you , everything will be perfect . And I want us to start having a kid right away , so when I 'm sixty , at least I 'll still be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to college like I never did . Do n't ever tell anyone , but I never got past sixth grade  --  I was hawking candy in burlesquewhen I was twelve . But our kid will have everything ! " She lay very still . What had she done ! This poor idiot . . . . She suddenly got out of bed and went into the bathroom and dressed . Chris was dressing when she came out . " Do n't bother , " she begged . " I can get a cab . " She was anxious to get away . She could n't bear his lovesick eyes . " Nah , it 's still early . I 'll take you home and then drop by the Stage Deli . Eddie and Kenny will probably be there . I 'll have a135Pages 133 , 134 torn out of book132cup of coffee with them and kibitz . I 'm so happy I ca n't sleep  --  I want to tell it to the world . " She let him hold her hand on the ride home . He kissed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her apartment  --  ran to the bathroom and threw up . Robin called the following day . He never mentioned the Italian girls . He was leaving that afternoon for Los Angeles with Ike Ryan . He wanted to do an In Depth on Ike . He felt it would be more exciting if it were filmed on location . In Ike 's office , on the set . From there he was flying back to London on the polar route , and he had no idea when he 'd return . She never mentioned the baroness or the Italian starlet , and he never mentioned ChristieLane. 136TWELVEO N MAY FIRST , Amanda awoke fifteen minutes before her " wake-up " call . Tomorrow Life magazine would be on every newsstand , but the Plaza Hotel always got Time and Life a day earlier . She dressed quickly . For the past six weeks she had vacillated between eagerness and apprehension . Everyone was waiting for the Life story . Christie felt it would make him an internationalcelebrity . Nick Longworth was all set to raise her fee to a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dashed into the lobby . The bright red cover caught her eye as she approached the newsstand . She dropped the money on the counter and walked quickly to a large easy chair in the lobby near the Palm Court . It was a ten-page spread with a big headline : THE CHRISTIE LANE PHENOMENON . She was featured with Christie in four picturesand there was one of her alone , posing for Ivan in a chiffon dress in Central Park . And it was no wind machine swirling that dress  --  she would never forget how cold it had been that day . As she read , she was pleased that the reporter had been unusually perceptive . There was a graphic description of the way she had stood facing the March wind without flinching . It took a peculiar kind of strength to be a model , he noted . It was all very complimentaryto her . And although it painted Christie as a man of the people , it slyly revealed his bad grammar , his flamboyancy , his total absorption with his new fame . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She read on : To go along with his new prominence , Christie Lane has taken himself a girl fit to be the consort of the new top minstrel man of television . A beautiful cover girl  --  Amanda . She is not just the girl he loves . She is a symbol . Proof that137the world of second-rate nightclubs is a thing of the past . Because Amanda is definitely first-rate . And after seeing them together , they are not the incongruous pair one might think . Christie Lane worships the elegance of this beautiful girl . And perhaps the lovely Amanda finds reality with Christie Lane . When a girl stands outdoors in thirty-degree temperatures , wearing a chiffon dress and a Palm Beach smile , she probably welcomes the honesty of a man like Christie Lane . Perhaps she is anxious to toss away the Junein-Januaryworld of a fashion model to find a real world with this very real man . She shut the magazine . That last line ! How would Robin take it ? She walked out into the bright sunlight . Although she dated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt she barely knew him . They were never alone , except for the torturous few hours together at the Astor . Christie spent at least two nights a week with his writers ; there were benefits , interviews  --  all timeconsuming , all part of being a star . Yet he was planning to marry her in Vegas ! She had let him talk  --  the summer had seemed so far away . But now it was May ! She had to break with Christie Lane ! She had only continued seeing him because of her loneliness and longing for Robin . She could never really care about anyone else . But at least she was making Christie happy . . . . The story in Life caused a great deal of excitement . She actuallyfelt famous , especially on the nights after the show , when she came out of the stage door and all the autograph kids called her by name . But she did n't hear a word from Robin , until the Sunday before Decoration Day . She had just hung up on Christie . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee . He had wanted her to go along with him  --  but she refused . " Ah , come on , " he pleaded . " We 'll have a ball . Even Aggie is taking off from the Latin Quarter  --  " " I ca n't afford to lose the money . Besides , I 'm not Aggie  --  I 'm not a camp follower . " " What 's with the camp-follower crap ? We 're getting married this summer . " 138 " If and when we 're married , I 'll go to places where you play . Right now I 'm staying in New York and keeping my modeling appointments . I 'm not going anywhere as part of the Christie Lane caravan . " " Ah , shit , you and your highfalutin ideas . I hadda go fall in love with a lady ! " He hung up , disgruntled but not angry . After she had hung up , she thought about it . Why had n't she just said , " I 'm never going to marry you " ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen if Robin ever disappeared for good . She would go to pieces . She had tried breakingwith Christie once , told him she was never going to see him again . The break lasted only five days . . . . At least with Christieshe was able to keep her sanity . There was always a nightclubopening or a benefit , and being with Christie was better than being alone . The phone rang . She picked it up lethargically , thinking it was Christie calling back to make one last plea . The crisp voice caught her off balance : " Hello , Celebrity . " " Robin ! Oh , Robin ! Where are you ? " " I just came in . I 've been away , covering the Eichmann trial . I just read all about you on the plane  --  caught up with all the back issues of Life  --  and , by God , there you were ! " " What did you think of it ? " She forced herself to sound casual . " Just great , " he said with enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really are . " Her throat was tight  --  but she kept her voice light . " You almost sound like you missed me . " " I did . " She barely listened . She was planning their evening . It was five o'clock  --  too late to wash her hair , but she could put on a fall . She hoped they would stay in . Thank God it was Sunday  --  Jerry was in the country and could n't tag along . She had steaks in the freezer , but she was out of vodka . " Are you still as beautiful as ever ? " he was asking . " Come see for yourself . " " Fine . Meet me at the Lancer Bar tomorrow at seven . " She was so disappointed she could n't speak . He took her silence for indecision . His voice was light . " Or has139Christie Lane cut me out of the picture ? " " No  --  but he 's asked me to marry him . " " He might be a good bet at that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you care , Robin , if I married Christie Lane ? " " Sure I 'd care . I 'd hate like hell to lose you . But I ca n't competeagainst marriage . " " Why not ? " " Look , baby , there 's only one reason for marriage , and that'sto have kids . I do n't want any kids . " " Why ? " " They 're one hell of a responsibility . " " In what way ? " " Look , Amanda  --  I have to be loose , be able to pick up and go . You can do that with a girl , even a wife . But you ca n't do it to a kid . What kind of a father would I make ? " She was trembling . Marriage had always been a subject he had refused to discuss . But now they were actually discussing it . " Oh , Robin , I think you 'd make a marvelous father . " " A father should be with his kid . " " Did your father leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Kitty was a good mother : we had nurses and cooks , but she was always there . And that 's the way it should be . " " Then I do n't understand  --  what makes you feel you would run out ? " " My work , baby , " he said tightly . " And although it 's never happened to me , I know that if I was a kid and my father was n't there it would kill me  --  I know it . Do n't ask me why , I just feel it . " Robin , we do n't have to have children now . . " Then why get married ? " he asked . " To be together . " " We 're together , except when I need to be alone . Like tonight  --  I 've got a desk piled with mail . I feel like tossing it all in the basket . I may do just that . " There was a pause . " I just did . The bills will arrive again , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm one month late . " 140 " All right , the mail is gone . Now we can be together tonight , " she said . " Amanda , that 's why I 'm against marriage . 1 want to be alone tonight . " His voice suddenly became gentle . " Do you understandnow , Amanda ? I 'm not geared for marriage . I like things the way they are . " " And the little setups Ike Ryan arranges ! " " Ike Ryan  --  now where did you drag that name from ? I have n't seen or thought of him in ages . " " And what about the baroness ? Or is that a name you have n't thought of in months ? " She knew she was destroying herself , but she could n't help it . " Amanda darling , another awful thing about marriage is explanations . I do n't owe you any , nor do you owe me any . Now , how about tomorrow ? Are you free ? " " I 'll make myself free . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you here for some time ? Or are you flying off some-where ? " " Baby , I 'm so tired of traveling , I never want to leave again . I 'm going to stay put until fall . " " That 's good . " Her gloom evaporated . " We go off the air in two weeks . " " Oh , that reminds me , Jerry Moss invited me up to Greenwich for the July Fourth weekend . They have a great house and a pool . Would you like to come ? " " I 'd love it , Robin . " " Great ! See you tomorrow night . " She sat very quietly for a long time . She lay awake half the night . The following morning , she called Jerry Moss at nine o'clock . " Jerry , I 've got to see you . It 's urgent . " " I 'll probably see you at the Lancer Bar . I 'm meeting Robin there at five . " " I 'm not getting there until seven . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important ! " " Lunch ? " 141 " No , I have a twelve o'clock session . Can I come to your of- fice ? Say , ten o'clock ? " " It 's a date . I 'll even have coffee waiting for you . " She sat across the desk from Jerry and sipped the coffee . She told him about Chris , implying that there had been no intimacy between them . In a way it was n't a lie  --  there was no intimacy . She merely lay back , gritted her teeth and submitted to him . Then she said , " That 's why I had to come to you , Jerry . You 're the only one who can help me . " He looked startled . " Me ? " " If I go to Vegas with Chris , I 'll have to marry him . If I do n't go to Vegas , I 'll lose him . " Jerry nodded . " It 's a simple decision . A sure bet against a long shot . " " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Robin will be in town all summer . He 's invited me to your place for July Fourth . " Jerry was silent . Then he said , " Go to Vegas , honey  --  marry Chris . Do n't waste any more time on Robin . " " Why ? Has he told you something I do n't know ? " " No , but look  --  did you ever hear of Ike Ryan ? " " I know all about Ike Ryan . But he does n't see him  --  or do those things anymore . " Jerry smiled . " I have a friend who 's a psychiatrist . When Robin told me about the action he got with Ike , I happened to bring it up with him and he said that Robin probably hates women . " " That 's ridiculous ! " she snapped . " This friend of yours does n't even know Robin . How can he come up with a statement like that ! " " He 's met Robin  --  " " Are you trying to hint that Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No . I 'm saying that as people  --  as friends  --  he likes men . He digs women , but only for sex  --  he does n't really like them . He 's actually hostile to them . " " And you think that 's true ? " 142 " Yes . But I think Robin likes you  --  as much as he can like a woman . He 'll force your hand eventually ; you 'll be the one to break this up . " " Jerry . . . . " Her eyes were soft . " Help me . . . . " " How can I help you ? " " Keep me from going to Vegas with Christie . You can tell Christie I 've signed a contract for the commercials on the summerreplacement show and I have to stay here and do them live . " He looked at her . " Go to Vegas , Amanda . Christie Lane is offering you a future , a real life , kids  --  the works . " " Jerry , " she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I thought you had more class , Amanda . Where 's your gamblingspirit ? If I cared that much for someone , I 'd toss the dice and go for broke . Give up Christie Lane . Shoot for Robin ! So you lose a chance for a good marriage and security . If you were thirty-five , I 'd say you could n't risk it . But you 're young , and you must have plenty of money saved . " " I do n't save any . I ca n't . " Jerry shrugged . " Then stop buying all those name ' clothes . God , Mary buys things in Greenwich for forty-five dollars . " " Mary does n't make a hundred dollars an hour . And do n't forget , I use my clothes on the show . Being well dressed is part of my business . And I 'm scared of not having money , Jerry , scared of being without it . " " In my book , a girl with two men in love with her should n't worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollarsan hour should n't worry about not having money . " She clenched her hands . " Jerry , have you ever been poor ? I mean dirt-poor . I was . I was white trash . It kills me when Chris talks about Miami , and how he played small clubs , and how he vowed to play the big time in the big hotels . I was born in Miami  --  in a charity ward . My mother was a Finnish chambermaid in one of those fancy hotels . I suppose she must have been pretty . I only remember her as being skinny and tired . But one of those rich men who stayed at that hotel must have thought she was pretty . I do n't even know who my father was . I just know he was some143rich man who could afford to spend the winter in Miami and knock up some little chambermaid . After I was born we lived in what they called Niggertown , because the only woman who was decent to my mother was a colored girl who worked in the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pass them when you drive to the airport . This woman  --  her name was Rose  --  she got my mother to the charity hospital when I was born . And then we lived with her . I called her Aunt Rose , she 's the finest woman I 've ever known . Later on , when my mother worked at night , Aunt Rose would come home and make supper and see that I studied and hear my prayers . My mother died when I was six . Aunt Rose paid for the funeral and kept me with her just like I was her child . She made me finish high school  --  she worked for me , she clothed me  --  then she sent me to New York on a bus with fifty dollars she had saved . " Amanda stopped and the tears overflowed . " I 'm sure you 've repaid the fifty , " he said . " I sent her fifty dollars a week in the beginning . But it would take me a lifetime to repay her for her love . A year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I rushed down to Florida  --  it was right before I met Robin  --  and I got her into a hospital . It was n't easy , they were n't exactly thrilled about having a sick old coloredwoman . But I met a sympathetic doctor , and he helped me get her in a private room . Naturally she had no hospital insurance , nothing . She was there for six weeks  --  that cost four thousand dollarswith nurses and therapy . You try explaining that to the Bureau of Internal Revenue . Is she a relation , a dependent ? ' they ask . No : just someone I love . ' But they figure she has Social Security , like one hundred and fifteen a month or something , and she can go in a charity ward . But according to law she 's not my kin  --  I was n't adopted . And those heartless guys down there , they see someone like me come in and they think , A model , one hundred an hour  --  she makes more in a day than I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " Jerry asked . " That 's just it . I could n't leave her alone , even when she was discharged from the hospital . I tried to get someone to care for her , but it did n't work . So I brought her up here to a nursing home on Long Island . That cost a hundred a week . Okay , it was fine , and I visited her every week . Then about eight months ago144she had a massive stroke . I had to move her to another nursing home where she gets round-the-clock care . And now I 'm paying two hundred and fifty dollars a week . " " Do you still visit her every week ? " She shook her head . " It hurts me too much , and she does n't even know I 'm there . I go about once a month and on New Year 's Day . I always used to call her on New Year 's Eve when I first came to New York  --  and once I could n't get through because the circuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , Child , you call me on New Year 's Day from now on . I do n't want to ruin your night having you worry about getting to a phone . ' " Amanda sat up straight . " I grew up knowing the power of money , Jerry . Money enabled my unknown father to get out of town and go through life without even knowing me . Lack of money made my mother afraid to fight . And the only thing that is giving Aunt Rose some comfort now is money . So you see , Jerry , I ca n't gamble . I have to go for the sure thing . But I 've earned the right to have a chance at the one man in the world I love ! I ca n't settle for Christie without trying for Robin first . " He went over to the small bar he kept in the office and poured two shots of Scotch . He handed her one . " Amanda , I think Al- wayso should do their commercials live this summer . I order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glass against hers . " 1 ' 11 do my part , honey , " he said . " Here 's to the Fourth of July and a long , wonderful summer . We 'll have a ball . " She managed a faint smile . " I hope so  --  because in the fall I 'll have to make a decision . " The summer was over . She had been with Robin every night . Sometimes they went to the Hamptons for weekends . On Labor Day weekend they remained in New York . They went to Green- wich Village , walked down the narrow streets , sat for hours in a coffee bar on Cornelia Street . Now it was October  --  the new season had begun . The Christie Lane Show was back on the air . In Depth had started its second season . Christie was demanding that she set a date for the marriage and Robin was off again on his sporadic trips . It was as if the145summer had never happened . In spite of her vow , she knew she would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin . She lost the few pounds she had gained during the summer  --  yet whenever Robin returned she felt fine . She could n't make a decision  --  shewaited . Oddly enough , it was the sponsor who forced her to decide : On the fifteenth of January Alwayso was moving the show to California for the rest of the season . " We go out as man and wife ! " Christie insisted . " We stop off in Chicago and get married ! " " I wo n't get married on the way to anywhere . If I go to California , we 'll get married out there , " she replied . The decision to move the show had been made the week before Christmas . And Robin was in London . On Christmas Eve she met Jerry at the Lancer Bar for a drink . Jerry was n't happy about California either . It meant spending a great deal of time out there . . . . They both stared morosely at the bar with its cheerful little Christmas tree , and the false snow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes met . She raised her glass . " Merry Christmas , Jerry . " " You look drawn , Amanda . " " I feel drawn and quartered , " she said . He reached out and took her hand . " Look , honey , you ca n't play a waiting game any longer . Put it to Robin on New Year 's Day . " " Why then ? How do I know I 'll see him ? " " Has n't Chris been invited to Mrs. Austin 's New Year 's Day party ? " She managed a smile . " Has he ever ! That 's all he talks about . He acts as if it 's a command performance at Buckingham Pal-ace . " " In a way , it is . Judith Austin rarely extends invitations to people at IBC . This year seems to be an exception . Danton Miller was kind of surprised that Robin was also invited . And I happen to know Robin is flying back New Year 's Eve . He kidded me146about celebrating it twice due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wo n't dare turn it down . " " And what do I do ? " she asked . " Walk up to him and say , It 's now or never , Robin ' ? " " Something like that . " " I ca n't  --  I 'm not going to that party . " " Why , has n't Chris asked you ? " " Of course he has . But I always spend New Year 's Day with Aunt Rose . Of course I have n't told that to Chris . He knows nothing about it . I just plan to have a headache that day . " " But you said she does n't recognize you , Amanda . " " I know , but I sit with her , and feed her  --  and New Year 's Day , well , that 's our day together . " " Will she know whether it 's January first or January second ? " Jerry asked . " I 'll know , Jerry . " " Look : go to the party , Amanda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear-cut yes or no out of him . If it 's no , then write him off . Two years is long enough to wait for anyone , even Robin . And you can visit your aunt the following day . " She seemed thoughtful . Then she nodded . " Okay , this is it ! " She crossed her fingers . " Here 's to nineteen sixty-two  --  either I make it , or I 'm through ! God , I 'm a poet . Let 's have a vodka martini , Jerry , the kind Robin drinks  --  and let 's wish that bastard a Merry Christmas wherever he is ! " THIRTEENTHE INVITATION to the Austin New Year 's Day party read " Eggnog , Four to Seven . " Chris wanted to pick Amanda up at three thirty . She insisted on making it four thirty . " But , doll , we 're supposed to be there at four . " " Which means no one comes until five . And anyone who is really anyone arrives at six . " He grudgingly agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess I really need a wife like you . " By three o'clock she had tried on six different outfits . The black dress was flattering  --  she could wear it with a string of pearls and Robin 's gold watch . Funny about the watch  --  everyone seemed to admire it , maybe because it was so tiny . Nick Longworth said it was very expensive . Chris had given her a gold charm bracelet for Christmas . She hated it , but she knew she had to wear it . She stared at the disc that said Mandy and Chris  --  it was so heavy and it clanked on everything . It definitely would n't go with the black dress . She took out the Chanel suit . It was one of Ohrbach 's line-forlinecopies . Even the real Chanel cloth . But Judith Austin would be able to tell the difference . She probably had the original . Well , she was n't out to impress Mrs. Austin . And Jerry had been right . She had watched IBC 's News at Noon . They had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had it all planned . It would be easy to slip away from Christie at a cocktail party . She 'd go directly to Robin and say , " I want to talk to you tonight . It 's urgent . " She 'd arrange to meet him later , after she unloaded Chris . And tonight it would be settied  --  oneway or another . Chris thought she was all set for the Coast , but Jerry had given her a contract that she did not have to sign until the end of the week . Oh God , it had to work ! In the last few weeks she had reversed many of her ideas about Christie . He was not just a simple good-natured slob . In some ways , especiallyconcerning money , he could be absolutely cold-blooded . The other night , his fishy eyes had gone to a steely gray when he said , " You 're playing it real cute , doll . Lou Goldberg tipped me off about you . Lou says you 've been stalling our marriage date waiting for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " You want to marry me in California  --  they got community property out there . If we divorce you 'd get half of everything . " Since the thought had never occurred to her , the amazement on her face was real . " If I marry you , it 's for keeps , " she said . " You bet it 's for keeps . " He had grinned . " And what 's mine is yours  --  as soon as we have our kid . " Lou Goldberg had come to New York over Christmas . He was a nice man in his early sixties . She had tried to be pleasant , but she was n't a very good actress and Lou 's sharp eyes had taken in everything  --  the way she " allowed " Chris to hold her hand , her lack of spontaneous affection . Today she should be with Aunt Rose  --  New Year 's Day was a big visiting day at the nursing home . Maybe they would n't feed Aunt Rose her dinner , thinking she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd call from the party just to make sure . About twenty people had arrived when they entered the Austin town house . Its dark quiet luxury was impressive . The butler took their coats and directed them to the large living room . Amanda recognized a senator , several socialites , several movie stars , and a top comedy star from CBS ( she had read that IBC was after him ) . She also saw Danton Miller , and in the corner , chatting earnestly with Mrs. Austin , was Ike Ryan . Amanda recognized him immediately . In the past few months Ike Ryan had exploded on the Hollywood scene . His flamboyant style made good copy . His first major picture was in the final stages of editing . The pub-148 I 149licity began when he signed one of Hollywood 's top glamour girls to star in it . She had immediately left her husband and embarked on a wild romance with Ike Ryan . The moment the picture was finished , he had dumped her , and taken up with a new little starletwhom he promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried sleeping pills but was saved when she phoned her estrangedhusband . A few weeks later the young starlet also tried sleeping pills and was saved by Ike whom she called at the zero hour . Ike had made the front pages  --  swearing he had come to Hollywood to be a producer , not a lover . He had tried all that once before , he stated . He had married the girl he went to school with in Newark . They had been divorced five years ago . Now he was immersed only in his work . Sure he fell in love  --  every day . But not for keeps . He was good-looking in a rugged way . His mother had been Jewish , his father a second-rate Irish prizefighter . Ike talked about this in his interviews , claiming he had the best from both sides . Amanda guessed him to be forty . He was tanned , with some gray beginning to show at the temples in his black hair . His nose was short and puggish , giving a boyish quality to his square-jawed face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amanda . Judith Austin was everything that Amanda wanted to be . She was slim and elegant , her ash-blond hair twisted into a French knot , and she wore a velvet " at home " gown . Amanda had seen it in Vogue and knew it cost twelve hundreddollars . She noticed that Mrs. Austin wore very little jewelry  --  smallpearl earrings , nothing else . Then her eye was caught by the enormous pear-shaped diamond that hung loosely on her finger . It had to be at least thirty carats . She and Christie stood alone , oddly isolated in the crowded room . Danton Miller saw them and came over and graciously made some small talk . Chris clung eagerly to Danton and the two men launched into a discussion of ratings . Amanda looked around the room . It was a wonderful house . Aunt Rose would be thrilled if she could see her here now ! She suddenly thought of the nursing home . She excused herself and asked the butler for a telephone . He led her to the library and closed the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful room . She went to the desk and ran her fingers over it gently . It looked French . She saw all the buttons on the phone and the blank cardboard where the number should be . Unlisted  --  naturally . She stared at the picture of Judith in the silver frame , then leaned closer . It was signed " Consuelo , " in that funny backhandstyle all society women had . Of course , this was her twin sister  --  the princess ! She dialed the nursing home . It was busy . She sat down and opened the silver box on the table and lit a cigarette . She studied the other silver frame that showed the two little princessestaken when they were about ten and twelve . Maybe they were debutantes by now , beautiful debutantes in Europe without a care in the world . She tried the nursing home again . It was still busy . The door opened . It was Ike Ryan . He grinned . " I saw you slip out . As soon as I could break away I came looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Danny 's Hideaway last year . " She hoped her blank stare told him she had no recollection of the incident . Then in a detached voice she said , " I came in here to make a phone call , but the number I 'm trying to get is busy . " He waved his hand . " That 's what I 'm after too . Mind if I use it ? " Before she could answer , he reached over and took the phone and began to dial . He stopped midway and turned to her . " Hey , are you free after this party ? " She shook her head . He went back to his dialing . " Then I 'll put through this call . I guess you 're serious about that joker you came with . You were with him at Danny 's when we met . " " I do the commercials on The Christie Lane Show . " She wondered if Robin had ever mentioned her to Ike Ryan . His number answered . " Joy , hi , sweetheart , want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send my car for you . We got three parties we can go to , or we might wind up at the Sixth Avenue Delicatessen . Depends how I feel . What ? Sure I do  --  would I stop in the middle of a business deal to call if I did n't ? Okay , toots . " He clicked the phone and turned to Amanda . " See what you 've missed ? " She smiled wryly . He stared at her . " I like you . Most broads fall all over me . " " I 'm not a broad . I have a contract to go to California for some TV commercials , and the joker ' who brought me here hap- pens to be very much in love with me . " He smiled . " Where you staying on the Coast ? " " At the Beverly Hills , if I go  --  " " If you go ? I thought you had a contract . " " I do . I have n't signed it yet . " " What 's the efsher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a Yid word . My old lady used to use it . It loses in the translation but I 'll try and give you an example of efsher . Let 's see . Oh yes ! My sister was a beast before I sprung for the nose job which finally landed her a husband . But before that she never got dates . And so one weekend she was going to Grossinger 's with several girls she knew , all pigs like herself  --  you know the type . No , you would n't . Virgin Jewish girls past twenty-five . Hysterical ! Real losers . The kind that 's stopped hop- ing . My sister was one of them . So this weekend I remember my sister was packing slacks , a tennis racket , a bathing suit , and my mom said , What , no pretty dresses ? ' My sister said , Look , Mom , I 've been to these places . There are never any unattached men . So this time I 'm going to relax . I 'll play tennis . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Then my mom walked over with my sister 's best dress , plunked it in the suitcase and said , Take it , efsher . ' " Amanda laughed . She found herself warming up to Ike Ryan . " Get it ? " he asked . " Efsher means maybe '  --  a possibility , a dim hope . What 's your efsher , toots ? " Then , as if sensing her change of attitude , he said , " Listen , want to change your mind about tonight ? I can always cancel that date I just made . " " I do n't break dates , " she said . " Neither do I when I care about them . " He stared at her in- tently . Then he smiled . " Come to the Coast , toots . I think we got a future together . " The room suddenly seemed so empty after he left . She realized it was after six . Robin might have arrived . She quickly dialed the nursing home . Still busy ! She checked her makeup and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The large room had filled and spilled over to the drawing room 152 and the dining room . She wandered into each room , scanning every face , but Robin was n't there . She found Chris , rooted to the same spot , still talking to Danton Miller . Danton seemed relieved to see her and immediately broke away . " Where the hell you been ? " Chris asked , as soon as they were alone . " Combing my hair , " she said coldly . " You been gone twenty minutes . Dan Miller was stuck standing with me . " " Well , if you 're such a big star , where are all your fans ? " Chris stared at all the famous people in the room . " It 's funny , " he sighed . " I know everyone I see , but I see no one I know . Doll , let 's go . I do n't belong here . " " Oh , Chris , at least try and look like you 're enjoying yourself . " " Why ? Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? So we were invited  --  Eddie Flynn also invited us to a party . He 's giving it in his suite at the Edison . Some of the kids from the Copa are coming  --  it 's for Aggie because she quit the line at the Latin Quarterto go to the Coast with Eddie . Now , that 's a party that 'll have some laughs . " She looked toward the door . Her heart quickened . But no , it was just another tall man . . . . At eight fifteen Amanda finally gave in and allowed Chris to drag her to Eddie 's party at the Edison . The Copa girls and the Latin Quarter girls had gone to do their dinner shows . Amanda sat on the couch and started to drink Scotch . Chris was relaxed  --  this was his kind of party . He brought over some pastrami sandwiches . " Here , doll , this is better than that fancy food at the Austins ' . " She refused and poured another Scotch . " Better eat , " Chris warned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had three of these , so I do n't feel like dinner . " " I 'm not hungry , " Amanda said . Agnes joined her on the couch . " Is that how you models keep your figures ? " she asked . " You 're making a big mistake . The corned beef is to die over . " " I 'm just not hungry , " Amanda said . The Scotch suddenly made her feel drowsy and she yawned. 153Agnes looked at her sympathetically . " Too much New Year 's Eve , last night ? " " No , not really . Chris played a club date . It was very quiet really  --  that is , if you can call the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf quiet . " " Last year me and Eddie were with Chris at the Fontainebleau . Oh , none of us lived there . Chris was playing a club date . That was before the show started on the air . You know something ? Me and Eddie , we had more fun before we made it big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the way it should be on holidays . " " I do n't like New Year 's Eve or any holiday , " Amanda said . By eleven o'clock she was quite drunk . Chris wanted to go someplace for coffee but he finally agreed to take her home . He held the cab while he walked her to the door . This was a courtesy she had finally drummed into him but he still thought it was ridiculous . " Maybe you get your kicks hearing that meter running , " he said . " Ike Ryan has a car and chauffeur , " she said . " Just a rented job , " he snapped . " But he does n't use cabs  --  " " That 'll be the day , when I pay eight bucks an hour while a chauffeur sits around and listens to the radio . " He kissed her quickly , conscious that the taxi meter was clicking . " Remember , doll  --  when I 'm sixty , we 'll have it made . A guy like Ike Ryan might go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself into the apartment . She felt a queasy feeling in her stomach and the beginning of a monumentalheadache . She checked with her answering service . One message , from the nursing home . Sure you can bet they had called  --  those nurses were waiting for the twenty-dollar bills she passed around on New Year 's Day . But no call from Robin ! Well , this was it . No more  --  what was that word ?  --  efsher . Yes , no more efsher . She 'd go to California ! She 'd marry Chris ! Suddenly she went rigid as a new thought came into focus . Then she went limp with shock . California ! Who would visit Aunt Rose ? She always went once a month  --  always on a differentday , at a different hour , to check on her . If she went away , they 'd leave her neglected . Why had n't she thought of this untilnow ? Because until this minute she had never actually believed she would go . She had n't even bothered to sublet her apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , then on impulse she dialed Jerry at home . His wife answered . Amanda apologized for the late call but explained it was urgent . " Jerry  --  I ca n't go to California . " He sounded elated . " It worked , huh ? I told you to put it on the line with him ! " " He never showed , " she said slowly . " Then why do n't you go to California ? " " It has nothing to do with Robin , " she said wearily . " Jerry  --  it just hit me . I 've been so busy thinking of myself , of Robin , of Chris . I forgot about Aunt Rose . I ca n't just take off . Who will visit her ? " " I 'm sure there must be good nursing homes on the Coast . " " But , Jerry  --  how could I move her ? " " Get Chris to charter a private plane . Get a nurse to go along with you . " " He does n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd take it . " " Listen , Amanda  --  Chris has come up the hard way . If anything he 'll respect you twice as much . And it will make him happy to be able to help you . " " Oh , Jerry , if Chris does that , I 'll try to love him . And I 'll be good to him . I really will . I 'll make him happy . I 'm going to call him right now . " Christie 's phone did n't answer . That meant he was at the Copa bar , the Stage , Lindy 's or Toots Shor . She tried them all and finallylocated him at Toots Shor . " Chris , can you come here ? I want to talk to you . " " Doll , I 'm sitting with Toots , and Ronnie Wolfe just joined us . I want to get a plug in his column . " " I have to talk to you . " " Jesus , everyone is here . It 's jumping . Come on , doll , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk with all those people . This is important . It 's about us , our future . " " Jesus  --  all night we were together . At the Austins ' you just154 7 155stood there like a lump . Why did n't you talk to me then ? We had plenty of privacy . People stayed away from us in droves . " " Are you coming , Chris ? " " Doll , I 'll be there in , say , half an hour . " " No . " The Scotch was hitting her . She felt groggy . " Now , while I 'm still awake . This is important . Come right away . " " Okay , I 'll be there . " " Hurry . " " Is it all right with you if I stop and take a leak first ? " She clicked the phone . Then she undressed . He probably would want to go to bed with her . Well , if he would arrange to bring Aunt Rose to Los Angeles , to a good nursing home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd even try and respond . She put on a robe , combed her hair , fixed her makeup and put in her diaphragm . Chris finally arrived . He took off his coat and took her in his arms and began to kiss her . " Chris , later . I want to talk to you . " " We 'll talk , but after  --  " He pulled the string of her robe and it fell open . He stopped suddenly . " Okay , you win . I do n't want to make love to a statue . For all the action I 'm getting , I could look at Playboy and jerk off . " She closed her robe and crossed the room . " Sit down , Chris , I 've got quite a bit to say . " He sat very still while she spoke . She told him everything , omit- ting nothing . His eyes widened as he listened , then he shook his head in sympathy . " You poor kid , you had it as rough as me . " Tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Chris ? " " Doll , how can I help ? " " Move Aunt Rose to the Coast ! " " You must ie kidding ! " he said . " You know what that will cost ? We ca n't take a sick dinge on the plane ! " " Do n't you dare call Aunt Rose that . " " All right ! Even if she was snow-white , you still ca n't take a person with a stroke on a plane . " " You can charter a plane . " " Sure , for thousands of bucks ! " 156 " Well . . . you certainly have enough money . " He stared at her . Then he stood up and paced the room . He whirled around , his finger shooting out at her . " Are you crazy ! I got a cousin , a first cousin , a flesh-and-blood cousin , and he wanted to borrow two thousand to buy into a business and I turned him down . Know why ? Because I 'm like you . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor too . My old man was in burlesque . He cheated on my old lady . She cheated on him , they both split , remarried  --  neither of them wanted me . I made it on my own from the time I was twelve . I got a half brother . I do n't give him a dime ! Because if it was all reversed , I know damn well he would n't give me the right time . " " Then you wo n't do it ? " she asked . " Kee-rist ! Next thing I know , you 'll want Aunt Rose to move in after we 're married , stretcher and all . " " If she got better , why not ? " " Because I wo n't let my family poach on me  --  and I 'm not about to lay out my money for an old  --  lady I never met . This could cost maybe ten thousand ! " " It might , " she said coldly . " Do you know how hard I work to make ten thou ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise . " His eyes narrowed . " You been doing a Dun and Bradstreet on me ? " " Everyone knows the sponsor gave you a ten-thousand-dollar raise . You made sure that it got into every column . " " Well , the government gets seventy percent . See , that 's what I mean . For me to lay out ten thou , I have to make a fortune . " " All right , Chris , please go . " He crossed the room and grabbed her . " Amanda , doll , I love you . I 'm not cheap . Look , let 's say we have a kid and it was n't feeling right , I 'd toss out ten thou in a second to the right specialist . Everything I got will be for you and the kid . But no relatives . Especially someone who 's not even a blood relative , " he added . " She 's like my mother ! " " Holy shit ! " he exploded . " Only to me could this happen ! I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And suddenly as a little dividend you spring a black relative on me  --  not157even a healthy one we could pass off as the maid ! Doll , when you say you want to talk , you sure do n't fuck around ! " " Get out , Chris . " " I 'll go , but you sleep on it . And do n't get sullen and think I do n't love you . I love you plenty  --  and I 'm a liberal too ! I figured maybe you came from some fancy family . Here I was , always apologizing about my background  --  and you coolly tell me you 're illegitimate , you were raised by a black chambermaid , and does it matter to me . Not a bit ! I still love you and I want to marry you . But I ai n't forcing my crummy family down your throat , and you ca n't force yours on me . When we 're married , the money we spend will be on our kid . But one thing , Mandy  --  " He stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next thing I know you 'll want to name our kid Rastus . From now on no one calls you Mandy . It 's Amanda . Did your aunt tag that on you ? " " No , " she said quietly . " My real name is Rose . Nick Longworthchanged it when I started to model . Rose Jones was n't glamorous . He thought Amanda sounded English  --  Noel Coward and all that . " " Well , it did until I learned about dear old Aunt Rose . Look , doll , I shared dressing rooms with colored acts . They 're my friends . Eventually things will change . I hope they do . But I 'm not big enough to go on a one-man crusade . Let someone else do it , and I 'll join . But all my life I 've been an almost-was . I played every crummy joint in the world . Loads of guys have done the same and never risen above it . But I 've made it . And I 'm offeringit to you ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my halfbrother  --  it'sus all the way . " He grabbed his coat and started for the door . " We forget tonight , understand ? It never happened . I do n't know no Aunt Rose . You 're Amanda , the top model  --  we 've got it made together . " He slammed the door . She sat very still for a few minutes . Then she got up and poured herself a drink . Oddly enough she understood how Chris felt . Well , it proved one thing  --  she could n't afford the luxury of love . Because no one really cared . Everyone was out for number one ! She 'd never see Christie Lane again or Robin Stone ! She 'd quit the show , tell Nick to concentrate on getting her bookings , even if she had to cut her price . She felt no guilt about Christie now . She 'd work , take care of Aunt Rose , and marry the first decent man who came along so that she could have a child and give it a decent start in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm and turned off her phone . The alarm went off at nine . Her head ached . She reached for the phone to check with her service , then changed her mind . If there were any calls , they would only be trouble . She took a cab to Queens . The small lobby of the nursing home was half empty . A few old women sat and watched televisionin wheelchairs . One woman was doing a child 's jigsaw puzzle . Another just sat and stared into space . An attendant was taking down a moth-eaten Christmas tree . She went to the elevator and pushed the button to the third floor . She never announced herself . It was best not to give them any warning . She opened the door of the room . The bed was stripped . Miss Stevenson , the supervisor , came rushing in . She looked upset . " We called you last night , " Miss Stevenson said . " I tried to call in , " Amanda said . " The line was busy . Why have you moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she worse ? " " She 's dead , " Miss Stevenson said . Amanda screamed . Then she flew at the woman and grabbed her . " What happened ? How ? " Amanda shouted . " At six o'clock when we brought her dinner , she suddenly sat up . Her eyes were bright . She said , Where 's little Rosie ? ' We told her you were coming . She lay back and smiled . She said , ' I 'll eat with little Rosie . I do n't like to eat alone . When she gets home from school we 'll eat  --  ' " Amanda began to sob . " She thought she was in the past . But she might have recognized me . " Miss Stevenson shrugged . " When it seemed you were n't coming , we tried to get her to eat . But she kept saying , I 'm waiting for my child .

I never ask . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burstein saw a pygmy rattler in the artichokegarden this morning and has been intractable since : I never ask about snakes . Why should Shalimar attract kraits . Why should a coral snake need two glands of neurotoxic poison to survive while a king snake , so similarly marked , needs none . Where is the I ) arwinian logic there . You might ask that . I never would , not any more . I recall an incident reported not long ago in the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner : two honeymooners , natives of Detroit , found dead in their Scout camper near Boca Raton , a coral snake still coiled in the thermal blanket . Why ? Unless you are prepared to take the long view , there is no satisfactory " answer " to such questions . Just so . I am what I am . To look for " reasons " is beside the point . But because the pursuit of reasons isp4their business here , they ask me questions . Maria , yes or no : I see a cock in this inkblot . Maria , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bad sexual conduct , I believe my sins are unpardonable , I have been disappointed in love . How could I answer ? How could it apply ? NOTHING APPLIES , I print with the magnetizedIBM pencil . What does apply , they ask later , as if the word " nothing " were ambiguous , open to interpretation , a questionable fragment of an Icelandic rune . There are only certain facts , I say , trying again to be an agreeable player of the game . Certain facts , certain things that happened . ( Why bother , you might ask . I bother for Kate . What I play for here is Kate . Carter put Kate in there and I am going to get her out . ) They will misread the facts , invent connections , will extrapolatereasons where none exist , but I told you , that is their business here . So they suggested that I set down the facts , and the facts are these : My name is Maria Wyeth . That is pronounced Mar-eye-ah , to get it straight at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lang , " but I never did . Age , thirty-one . Married . Divorced . One daughter , age four . ( I talk about Kate to no one here . In the place where Kate is they put electrodes on her head and needles in her spine and try to figure what went wrong . It is one more version of why does a coralp5snake have two glands of neurotoxic poison . Kate has soft down on her spine and an aberrant chemical in her brain . Kate is Kate . Carter could not remember the soft down on her spine or he would not let them put needles there . ) From my mother I inherited my looks and a tendency to migraine . From my father I inherited an optimism which did not leave me until r ecently . Details : I was born in Reno , Nev. , and moved nine years later to Silver Wells , Nev. , pop . then 28 , now O. We moved down to Silver Wells because my father lost the Reno house in a private game and happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1lc had bought it or won it or maybe his father left it to him , I 'm not sure which and it does n't matter to you . We had a lot of things and places that came and went , a cattle ranch with no cattle and a ski resort picked up on somebody 's second mortgage and a motel that would have been advantageously situated at a leeway exit had the freeway been built ; I was raised to believe that what came in on the next roll would ; always be better than what went out on the last . I no longer believe that , but I am telling you how it was . What we had in Silver Wells was three hundred acres of mesquite and some houses and a Flying A and a zinc mine and a Tonopah &; Tidewater RR siding and a trinket shop and later , after my father and hisp6partner Benny Austin hit on the idea that Silver Wells was a natural tourist attraction , a midget golf course and a reptile museum and a restaurant with some slots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the only person who played them was Paulette , with nickels from the cashbox . Paulette ran the restaurant and ( I see now ) balled my father and sometimes let me pretend to cashier after school . I say " pretend " because there were no customers . As it happened the highway my father counted on came nowhere near and the money ran out and my mother got sick and Benny Austin went back to Vegas , I ran into him in the Flamingo a few years ago . " Your father 's only Waterloo was he was a man always twenty years before his time , " Benny advised me that night in the Flamingo . " The ghost-town scheme , the midget golf , the automatic blackjack concept , what do you see today ? Harry Wyeth could be a Rockefeller in Silver Wells today . " " There is n't any Silver Wells today , " I said . " It 's in the middle of a missile range . " " I 'm speaking about then , Maria . As it was . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink I have never known anyone but my mother and father and Benny Austin to order , and I gave him some chips to play for me and went to the ladies ' room and never came back . I told myself it was because I did n't wantp7Benny to see the kind of man I was with , I was with a man who was playing baccarat with hundred-dollar hills behind the rope , but that was n't all of it . I might as well lay it on the line , I have trouble with as it was . I mean it leads nowhere . Benny Austin , my mother sitting in Paulette 's empty restaurant when it was I20  --  outside looking through her magazines for contestswe could enter ( Waikiki , Paris France , Roman Holiday , my mother 's yearnings suffused our life like nerve gas , cross the ocean in a silver plane , she would croon to herself and mean it , see the jungle when it 's wet with rain ) , the three of us driving down to Vegas in the pickup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred miles down and a hundred back and nobody on the highway either way , just the snakes stretched on the warm asphalt and my mother with a wilted gardenia in her dark hair and my father keeping a fifth of Jim Beam on the floorboard and talking about his plans , he always had a lot of plans , I never in my life had any plans , none of it makes any sense , none of it adds up . New York : what sense did that make ? An eighteenyear-oldgirl from Silver Wells , Nevada , graduates from the Consolidated Union High School in Tonopah and goes to New York to take acting lessons , how dop8you figure it ? My mother thought being an actress was a nice idea , she used to cut my hair in bangs to look like Margaret Sullavan , and my father said not to be afraid to go because if certain deals worked out as anticipated he and my mother would be regular airline passengers between Las Vegas and New York City , so I went . As it turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was sitting in the Vegas airport drinking a Cuba Libre , but there you are . Everything goes . I am working very hard at not thinking about how everything goes . I watch a hummingbird , throw the I Ching but never read the coins , keep my mind in the now . New York . Let me stick to certain facts . What happened was this : I looked all right ( I 'm not telling you I was blessed or cursed , I 'm telling a fact , I know it from all the pictures ) and somebody photographed me and before long I was getting $ioo an hour from the agencies and $50 from the magazines which in those days was not bad and I knew a lot of Southernersand faggots and rich boys and that was how I spent my days and nights . The night my mother ran the car off the highway outside Tonopah I was with a drunk rich boy at the old Morocco , as close as I could figure later : I did n't know about it for a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and my father could n't tell me . ( " Jesus but we had a good thing going in Silver Wells , " Bennyp9Austin said that night in the Flamingo , and maybe they did , maybe I did , maybe I never should have left , but that line of thinking leads nowhere because as I told Benny there is no Silver Wells . The last I heard of Paulette she was living in a Sun City . Think that one over . ) My father 's letter was mailed to an old address and forwarded , I read it in a taxi one morning when I was late for a sitting and when I hit the fact in the middle of the second paragraph I began to scream and did not work for a month after . The letter is still in my makeup box but I am careful not to read it unless I am drunk , which in my current situation is never . " This is a bad hand but God if there is one , and Honey I sincerelybelieve there must be Something ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plans , " is how it ends . " Do n't let them bluff you back there because you 're holding all the aces . " Easy aces . I am not sure what year it was because I have this problem with as it was , but after a while I had , a bad time . ( There , you will say now , she believed her sins were unpardonable , but I told you , nothing applies . ) The tulips on Park Avenue looked dirty and I was sent twice to Montego Bay to get some color back in my face but I could not sleep alone and stayed up late and it was falling apart with Ivan Costello and everything showed in the camera by then . Of course Ip10did not get back to Nevada that year because that was the year I screamed at Ivan and married Carter , and the next was the year we came here and Carter put me in a couple of little pictures ( one you may have seen , a doctor here claims to have seen it but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never distributed ) and I do n't know what happened the year after that and then I started getting to Nevada quite a bit , but by then my father was dead and I was not married any more . Those are the facts . Now I lie in the sun and play solitaire and listen to the sea ( the sea is down the cliff ' but I am not allowed to swim , only on Sundays when we are accompanied ) and watch a hummingbird . I try not to think of dead things and plumbing . I try not to hear the air conditioner in that bedroom in Encino . I try not to live in Silver Wells or in New York or with Carter . I try to live in the now and keep my eye on the hummingbird . I see no one I used to know , but then I 'm not just crazy about a lot of people . I mean maybe I was holding all the aces , but what was the game ?  |p11HELENEI  SAW MARIA TODAY . Or at least I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't make it for Maria I do n't mind saying , I made it for Carter , or for BZ , or for old times or for something , not for Maria . " I do n't much want to talk to you , Helene , " was what she said the last time . " It 's not personal , Helene , I just do n't t.ilk any more . " Not for Maria . Anyway I did n't . See her . I drove all the way out there , took the entire morning and packed a box for her , all the new books and a chiffon scarf she left at the beach once ( she was careless , it must have cost thirty dollars , she was always careless ) and a pound of caviar , maybe not Beluga but Maria should n't bitch iiow , plus a letter from Ivan Costello and a long profile somebody did in The New York Times about Carter , you 'd think that would at least interest her except Maria has never been able to bear Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me . " Mrs. Lang is resting , " the nurse said . I could see her resting , I could seep12her down by the pool in the same bikini she was wearing the summer she killed BZ , lying by that swimming pool with a shade over her eyes as if she had n't a care or a responsibility in the world . She never puts on any weight , you 'll notice that 's often true of selfish women . Not that I blame Maria for anything that happened to me , although I 'm the one who suffered , I 'm the one who should be " resting , " I 'm the one who lost BZ through her carelessness , her selfishness , but I blame her only on Carter 's behalf . Half a chance and she would have killed Carter too . She was always a very selfish girl , it was first last and always Maria.  |p13CARTERHERE  ARE SOME SCENES I have very clear in my mind . " I always get breakfast out , " I say to someone . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria would say that they were not her friends , but Maria has never understood friendship , conversation , the normal amenities of social exchange . Maria has difficulty talking to people with whom she is not sleeping . " I go to the Wilshire or the Beverly Hills , " I say . " I read the trades , I like to be alone at breakfast . " " In fact he does n't always get breakfast out , " Maria says , very low , to no one in particular . " In fact the last time he got breakfast out was on April 17 . " The others at the table look first at her and then away , astonished , uneasy : something in the way her hands are tensed on the edge of the table prevents passing this off . Only BZ continues to look directly at her . " Oh fuck it , " she says then , and tears run down herp14cheeks . She still looks very straight ahead at no one in particular . Another scene : she is playing on the lawn with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear plastic hose . " Watch out she does n't get chilled , " I say from the terrace ; Maria looks up , drops the hose , and walks away from the baby toward the poolhouse . She turns , and looks back at the baby . " Your father wants to talk to you , " she says . Her voice is neutral . After BZ 's death there was a time when I played and replayed these scenes and others like them , composedthem as if for the camera , trying to find some order , a pattern . I found none . All I can say is this : it was after a succession of such small scenes that I began to see the improbability of a rapprochement with Maria.  |p15I  N THE FIRST HOT MONTH of the fall after the summer she left Carter ( the summer Carter left her , the summer Carter stopped living in the house in Beverly Hills ) , Maria drove the freeway . She dressed every morning with a greater sense of purpose than she had felt in some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could kick off when she wanted the touch of the accelerator , and she dressed very fast , running a brush through her hair once or twice and tying it back with a ribbon , for it was essential ( to pause was to throw herself into unspeakable peril ) that she be on the freeway by ten o'clock . Not somewhere on Hollywood Boulevard , not on her way to the freeway , btt actually on the freeway . If she was not she lost the day 's rhythm , its precariously imposed momentum . Once she was on the freeway and had maneuveredher way to a fast lane she turned on the radio at high volume and she drove . She drove the San Diego to the Harbor , the Harbor up to the Hollywood ,  |p16the  Hollywood to the Golden State , the Santa Monica , the Santa Ana , the Pasadena , the Ventura . She drove it as a riverman runs a river , every day more attuned to its currents , its deceptions , and just as a riverman feels the pull of the rapids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay at night in the still of Beverly Hills and saw the great signs soar overhead at seventy miles an hour , Normandie 1/4 Vermont 3/4 Harbor Fwy I. Again and again she returned to an intricate stretch just south of the interchange where successful passage from the Hollywood onto the Harborrequired a diagonal move across four lanes of traffic . On the afternoon she finally did it without once braking or once losing the beat on the radio she was exhilarated , and that night slept dreamlessly . By then she was sleeping not in the house but out by the pool , on a faded rattan chaise left by a former tenant . There was a jack for a telephone there , and she used beach towels for blankets . The beach towels had a special point . Because she had an uneasy sense that sleeping outside on a rattan chaise could be construed as the first step toward something unnameable ( she did not know what it was she feared , but it had to do with empty sardine cans in the sink , vermouth bottles in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told herself that she was sleeping outside just until it was too cold to sleep beneath beachp17towels , just until the heat broke , just until the fires stopped burning in the mountains , sleeping outside only because the bedrooms in the house were hot , airless , only because the palms scraped against the screens and there was no one to wake her in the mornings . The beach towels signified how temporarythe arrangement was . Outside she did not have to be afraid that she would not wake up , outside she could sleep . Sleep was essential if she was to be on the freeway by ten o'clock . Sometimes the freeway ran out , in a scrap metal yard in San Pedro or on the main street of Palmdale or out somewhere no place at all where the flawless burning concrete just stopped , turned into common road , abandoned construction sheds rusting beside it . When that happened she would keep in careful control , portage skillfully back , feel for the first time the heavy weight of the becalmed car beneath her and try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Cyclone fencing , the deadly oleander , the luminous signs , the organism which absorbed all her reflexes , all her attention. aSo that she would not have to stop for food she kept a hard-boiled egg on the passenger seat of the Corvette . She could shell and eat a hard-boiled egg at seventy miles an hour ( crack it on the steering wheel , never mind salt , salt bloats , no matter what happened she remembered her body ) and she drank Coca-Colap18in Union 76 stations , Standard stations , Flying A 's . She would stand on the hot pavement and drink the Coke from the bottle and put the bottle back in the rack ( she tried always to let the attendant notice her putting the bottle in the rack , a show of thoughtful responsibility , no sardine cans in her sink ) and then she would walk to the edge of the concrete and stand , letting the sun dry her damp back . To hear her own voice she would sometimes talk to the attendant , ask advice on oil filters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most efficient route to Foothill Boulevard in West Covina . Then she would retie the ribbon in her hair and rinse her dark glasses in the drinking fountainand be ready to drive again . In the first hot month of the fall after the summer she left Carter , the summer Carter left her , the summer Carter stopped living in the house in Beverly Hills , a bad season in the city , Maria put seven thousand miles on the Corvette . Sometimes at night the dread would overtake her , bathe her in sweat , flood her mind with sharp flash images of Les Goodwin in New York and Carter out there on the desert with BZ and Helene and the irrevocability of what seemed already to have happened , but she never thought about that on the freeway.  |p19THE  SECOND PICTURE she had made with Carter was called Angel Beach , and in it she played a girl who was raped by the members of a motorcycle gang . Carter had brought the picture in for $340,000 and the studio had saturation-booked it and by the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under eight million dollars . Maria had seen it twice , once at a studio preview and a second time by herself , at a drive-in in Culver City , and neither time did she have any sense that the girl on the screen was herself . " I look at you and I know that . . . what happened just did n't mean anything , " the girl on the screen would say , and " There 's a lot more to living than just kicks , I see that now , kicks are nowhere . " Carter 's original cut ended with a shot of the motorcycle gang , as if they represented some reality not fully apprehended by the girl Maria played , but the cut released by the studio ended with a long dolly shot of Maria strolling across a campus . Mariap20preferred the studio 's cut . In fact , she liked watching the picture : the girl on the screen seemed to have a definite knack for controlling her own destiny . The other picture , the first picture , the picture never distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around New York and shot film . It was not until they moved to California and Carter began cutting the film together that she entirely realized what he was doing . The picture showed Maria doing a fashion sitting , Maria asleep on a couch at a party , Maria on the telephone arguing with the billing departmentat Bloomingdale 's , Maria cleaning some marijuana with a kitchen strainer , Maria crying on the IRT . At the end she was thrown into negative and looked dead . The picture lasted seventy-four minutes and had won a prize at a festival in Eastern Europe and Maria did not like to look at it . She had once heard that students at UCLA and USC talked about using her the way commercial directors talked about using actresses who got a million dollars a picture , but she had never talked to any of them ( sometimes they walked up to Carter in front of a theater or a bookstoreand introduced themselves , and Carter would introduce Maria , and they would look sidelong at Maria while they talked to Carter about coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say to them , avoided their eyes ) and she disliked their hav/ing seen her in that first picture . She never thought of it as Maria . She thought of it always as that first picture . Carter took her to BZ and Helene 's one night . when BZ was running the picture and she had to leave the house after the titles , had to sit outside on the beach smoking cigarettes and fighting nausea for seventy-two of the seventy-four minutes . " Why does he run it so often , " she had said to Carter later . " Why do you let him keep a print out there , he keeps a print in the house . " " He owns it , Maria . He owns all the prints . " " That 's not what I mean . I said why does he run it so often . " " He wants Helene to see it . " " Helene 's seen it a dozen times . Helene does n't even like it , she told me so . " " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had gone to bed that night without speaking . Maria did not want to understand why BZ ran that first picture so often or what it had to do with Helene . The girl on the screen in that first picture had no knack for anything.  | " MARIA WYETH , " she repeated to Freddy Chaikin 's receptionist . The reception room was full of glossy plants in chinoiserie pots and Maria had an abrupt conviction that the plants were consuming the oxygen she needed to breathe . She should not have come here without calling . Only people in trouble came unannounced to see their agents . If Freddy Chaikin thought she carried trouble with her he would avoid her , because trouble was something no one in the city liked to be near . Failure , illness , fear , they were seen as infectious , contagious blights on glossy plants . It seemed to Maria that even the receptionist was avoiding her eyes , fearing contamination . " He 's kind of expecting me , " Maria added in a near whisper . " Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the projection room , do you want to wait ? Or could he call you . " " No . I mean yes . But tell him it has to be today or  --  "  |p23The  receptionist waited . " Or I 'll talk to him tomorrow , " Maria said finally . I n the elevator was an actor she recognized but had never met , the star of a canceled television Western . He was with a short agent in a narrow dark suit , and the agent smiled at Maria as the elevator door closed . " The word on Carter 's dailies is sensational , " the agent said . Maria smiled and nodded . It did not require an answer : it was a cue for the actor , who waited a suitableinstant and then picked it up . " Your pocketbook 's open , " he drawled , and the look he gave Maria was dutifully charged with sexual appreciation , meant not for Maria herself but for Carter Lang 's wife . She leaned against the padded elevator wall and closed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor in the elevator he would laugh . When she got home she thought about calling him , but instead she went upstairs and lay face down on Kate 's empty bed , cradled Kate 's blanket , clutched Kate 's baby pillow to her stomach and fought off a wave of the dread . The time seemed to have passed for telling Les Goodwin funny stories.  |p24SHE  SAT ON THE RATTAN CHAISE in thehot October twilight and watched BZ throw the ice cubes from his drink one by one into the swimming pool . They had already talked about Helene 's week at La Costa and they had already talked about an actress who had been admitted to UCLA Neuropsychiatric with her wrists cut ( the papers said exhaustion , but BZ knew things like that , knew about people , that was why she had called him ) and now it was the hour when in all the houses all around the pretty women were putting on perfume and enameled bracelets and kissing the pretty children goodnight , the hour of apparent grace and promised music , and even here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the water in the pool was 85  --  . The water in the pool was always 85  --  and it was always clean . It came with the rent . Whether or not Carter could afford the rent , whether it was a month like this one when he was making a lot of money or a month when the lawyersp25were talking about bankruptcy , the boy came twice a week to vacuum the pool and the man came four days a week to work on the roses and the water in the pool was 85  --  . Sometimes it occurred to Maria that maybe the pretty children and the enameled bracelets came the same way , but she did not like to think about that . " Tell me who you 've seen , " she said . She did not much want to hear who BZ had seen but neither did she want BZ to leave . BZ had not yet mentioned Carter . BZ was the producer on the picture , BZ had come in from the location two days before and he was going back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tell me about the Willards ' dance . " " Strobe lights in Pasadena . " BZ stood up . " On nights like that you could kill yourself for being a Gentile . " " Do n't leave . " " I 'm late now . I 'm supposed to be somewhere . " " Who is it , " she said , not looking at him . " Nobody special , I 'm meeting Tommy Loew , you know Tommy , he 's in from New York . " " I do n't mean you . " She wondered without interest if Tommy Loew was a faggot . " You know I do n't mean you . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " BZ put his glass on a table , and looked at Maria for a long while . " Just let him finish . "  | " Who is it . " She did not know why she persisted . " Listen , Maria . I do n't know if you know this , but he wanted you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready to scrap the deal , jeopardize the entire project , just because he wanted to use you . " " I know that . " " Then why not stop thinking Carter designs his every move expressly to thwart you . Why not stop thinking like Carlotta . " " You do n't have any idea in your mind how I think . " Carlotta was BZ 's mother . Carlotta had $35 million and was engaged in constant litigation with her estranged second husband . Maria sat down on the edge of the pool and splashed the clear water over her bare feet . " Listen to the music from the Kuliks ' . They 're having a party . " " You going ? " " Of course I 'm not going . He 's a gangster . " " I just asked if you were going to a party , Maria , I did n't ask for a grand-jury indictment . " BZ paused . " In the second place he 's not a gangster . He 's a lawyer . " " For gangsters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a philosopher king . He told me once he understood the whole meaning of life , it came to him in a blinding flash one time when he almost died on the table at Cedars . " " Larry Kulik 's not going to die at Cedars . Larry Kulik 's going to die in a barber chair . "  | " It 's uphill work making you laugh , Maria . Anyway , Larry Kulik 's a great admirer of yours . You know what he said to Carter ? He said , What I like about your wife , Carter , is she 's not a cunt . ' " Maria said nothing . " That 's very funny , Maria , Kulik saying that to ( ' a rter , you lost your sense of humor ? " " I 've already heard it . Give me your glass . " " I told you , Tommy Loew . I 'm already late . " " Who is it , " she repeated . " Ile 's two weeks behind schedule now , Maria . Just let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran the tips of his fingers very lightly across Maria 's bare back . " Seen anything of Les Goodwin ? " he said finally . Maria watched a leaf in the water and tried not to recoil from BZ 's fingers . " Les and Felicia are in New York , " she said carefully , and then reached for a towel . " You 're already late for Tommy Loew , I mean are n't you ? " Later in the week she saw in one of the columns that 13Z had been at the Kuliks ' party with Tommy l.cim and a starlet whose name she did not recognize . She did not know why it annoyed her but it did . She wondered if Tommy Loew and the starlet had gone buck to BZ 's later , and who had watched whom , and if Ilrlene had been back from La Costa.  | " JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW I'mthinking of you , " Freddy Chaikin said on the telephone . " I 'll be frank , I was surprised to hear you wanted to work again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally thought  --  " " I 've always wanted to work . " Maria tried to keep her voice even . Freddy would be sitting in his office with the Barcelona chairs and the Giacometti sculptureand anything he wanted to say Maria would have to hear. "  --  an actress walks off a set , people tend to think she does n't want to work . " " That was almost a year ago . I was sick . I was upset about Kate . I have n't walked off any more sets , you know that , Freddy . " " You have n't had any sets to walk off . " Maria closed her eyes . " What are you doing right now , Freddy , " she said finally . " You sitting there playing with a Faberge Easter egg ? Or what ? "  | " Calm down . Actually I talked to Morty Landau about you today at lunch . I said , Morty , you know Maria Wyeth , and he did  --  " " I should think so . I had the lead in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did . You know that . I know that . And they were very interesting little pictures . Carter parlayed those two little pictures , one of them never distributed , into a very nice thing . Carter 's iii the enviable position now where he wants to do something , it 's just a question of working out the numbers . I 'm proud to represent him . I 'm proud to represent both of you , Maria . Maybe I could arrange I'cr Morty Landau to see some film , you give me your word that you really want to work . " " See some film . " " Where 's the problem , Maria ? There 's something so unusual about wanting to see some film ? I show film on talent getting two , two-fifty a picture . " " Morty Landau makes television . " " Let 's get to the bottom line , Maria , if Carter were around he 'd say the same thing . You want to work , I 'll arrange for Morty Landau to see film . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when Freddy Chaikin spoke again his voice was gentle . " All I meant , Maria , was that Carter 's on location . All I meant . "  |p30ON  THE TENTH DAY OF OCTOBER atquarter past four in the afternoon with a dry hot wind blowing through the passes Maria found herself in Baker . She had never meant to go as far as Baker , had started out that day as every day , her only destinationthe freeway . But she had driven out the San Bernardino and up the Barstow and instead of turning back at Barstow ( she had been out that far before but never that late in the day , it was past time to navigate back , she was out too far too late , the rhythm was lost ) she kept driving . When she turned off at Baker it was 115  --  and she was picking up Vegas on the radio and she was within sixty miles of where Carter was making the picture . He could be in the motel right now . They could be through shooting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Helene , thinking about going into Vegas for dinner or just resting , resting on the unmade bed with his shirt off . The woman who ran the motel only made the bedsp31once a week , Carter had made a joke about it in an Interview , Maria had read it in the trades . She could call . " Listen , " she could say . " I 'm in Baker . I just happen to be in Baker . " " So you just happen to be in Baker , " he could say . " Get on up here . " Or he could even say : " Listen . Get up here quick . " ' Those were things he could say but because she did not know if he would say them or even if she wanted to hear them she just sat in the car behind the 76 ' station in Baker and studied the pay phone by the Coke machine . Whatever he began by saying he would ttrcl Iry saying nothing . He would say something and sb would say something and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a dialogue so familiar that it drained the imagination , blocked the will , allowed them to drop words and whole sentences and still arrive at the cold conclusion . " Oh Christ , " he would say . " I felt good today , really good for a change , you fixed that , you really pricked the balloon . " " ' low did I fix that . " " You know how . " " I do n't know how . " She would wait for him to answer but he would say Clothing then , would just sit with his head in his hands . She would feel first guilty , resigned to misery , then furious , trapped , white with anger . " Listen top34me , " she would say then , almost shouting , trying to take him by the shoulders and shake him out of whatshe could not see as other than an elaborate pose ; hewould knock her away , and the look on his face , contorted , teeth bared , would render her paralyzed . " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say then , leaning close , his face still contorted . " Why don'tyou just go in that bathroom and take every pill in it . Why do n't you die . " After that he would leave for a while , breaking things as he went , slamming doors to kick them open , picking up decanters to hurl at mirrors , detouring by way of chairs to smash them against the floor . Alwayswhen he came back he would sleep in their room , shutting the door against her . Rigid with self-pity shewould lie in another room , wishing for the will to leave . Each believed the other a murderer of time , a destroyer of life itself . She did not know what she wasdoing in Baker . However it began and ended like that . " Listen , " she would say . " Do n't touch me , " he would say . Maria looked at the pay phone for a long while , and then she got out of the car and drank a warm Coke . With the last of the COke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun andwaited for the Fiorinal to clear her head of Carter andwhat Carter would say . On the way back into the cityp33the traffic was heavy and the hot wind blewthrough the windows and teh radio got on her nervesand after that Maria did not go back to the freewayexcept as a way of getting somewhere . Play It As It Lays " C'EST MOI , MARIA , " the voice said on the telephone . " BZ . " Maria tried to untangle the cord from the receiver and fight her way out of sleep . Sleeping in the after-noon was a bad sign . She had been trying not to notice the signs but she could not avoid this one , and a sharp fear contracted her stomach muscles . " Where are you , " she said finally . " At the beach . " Maria groped on the edge of the pool for her dark glasses . " Did I catch you in the middle of an overdose , Maria ? Or what ? " " I thought you were on the desert . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read the trades ? Because of the fire . " " What fire . " " On top of the news as ever , " BZ said . " The fire , wep35had a fire , we have to rebuild the set . Carter 's coming in tomorrow . I 'll take you to Anita Garson 's tonight if you 're not doing anything , all right ? " " Where 's Helene ? " " Helene 's in bed , Helene 's depressed . Helene has these very copious menstruations . " There was a pause . " Seven-thirty all right ? " " I do n't know about Anita Garson 's , I do n't  --  " " I meant of course unless you 've got plans . " His voice rose almost imperceptibly . " Unless you 've got an a deux going at the Marmont . Or wherever it is he stays . " Maria said nothing . " You 're a lot of laughs this afternoon , Maria , I 'm glad I called . I just meant that you and Les Goodwin were friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He paused . " You still sulking in there ? " " I 'll see you at seven-thirty , " she said finally . Later she could not think how she had been coerced by BZ into going to Anita Garson 's party , which was large and noisy and crowded with people she did not much like . There was a rock group and a pink tent and everywhere Maria looked she saw someone who registered on her only as a foreigner or a faggot or ap36gangster . She tried to keep her eyes bright and her lips slightly parted and she stayed close to BZ . " How 's Carter , " someone said behind her , and when she turned she saw that it was Larry Kulik . " Carter 's on location , " she said , but Larry Kulik was not listening . He was watching a very young girl in a white halter dress dancing on the terrace . " I 'd like to get into that , " he said contemplatively to BZ . " I would n't call it the impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her glass . She had already smiled too long and she did not want to look any more at Larry Kulik 's careful manicure and ex-pensively tailored suit and she did not want to consider why Larry Kulik was talking to BZ about the girl in the white dress . " Not that many guys , " Larry Kulik was saying . " Not just anybody . " " Shit no . You have to be able to get her into the Whisky . " Larry Kulik was still watching the girl . " Only six guys . " " How do you know , six ? " Larry Kulik shrugged . " I had her researched . Six . " He patted Maria 's arm absently . " How 's it going , baby ? How 's Carter ? "  |p37At  the table on the terrace where Maria and BZ sat for dinner there were a French director , his cinematographer , and two English Lesbians who lived in Santa Monica Canyon . Maria sat next to the cinematographer , who spoke no English , and during dinner BZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could smell marijuana , but it was not mentioned on the terrace . The cinematographer and the two Lesbians discussed the dehumanizing aspect of American technology , in French . " You have to come over sometime and use the sauna , " Larry Kulik said when he brushed by the table on his way inside . " Stereo piped in , beaucoup fantastic . " At midnight one of the amplifiers broke down , and the band packed up to leave . BZ was getting together a group to go back to his house : the French director , Larry Kulik , the girl in the white halter dress . " Simplicity itself , " he said to Maria . " The chickie wants the frog . " " I have to go home . " " You 're not exactly a shot of meth tonight anyway . " " I feel beaucoup fantastic , " Maria said , and turned her face away so that he would not see her tears . When Les Goodwin called from New York the next morning at seven o'clock she began to cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because he made her so happy , she said , and for that moment believed it.  | " YOU HAVE N'T ASKED ME how it wentafter we left Anita 's , " BZ said . " How did it go , " Maria said without interest . " Everybody got what he came for . " " Do n't you ever get tired of doing favors for people ? " There was a long silence . " You do n't know how tired , " BZ said.  |p40SHE  LOOKED AT CARTER sitting in theliving room and all she could think was that he had put on weight . The blue work shirt he was wearing pulled at the buttons . She supposed that he had weighed that much when he left , she noticed it now only because she had not seen him . " You going to stay here ? " she said . He rubbed his knuckles across the stubble on his chin . " All my things are here , are n't they ? " Maria sat down across from him . She wished she had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed frivolous to go get one . Carter 's saying that all his things were in the house did not seem entirely conclusive , did not address itself to the question . Quite often with Carter she felt like Ingrid Bergman in Gas-light , another frivolous thought . " I mean I thought we were kind of separated . " That did not sound exactly right either . " If that 's the way you want it . "  | " It was n't me . I mean was it me ? " " Never , Maria . Never you . " There was a silence . Something real was happening : this was , as it were , her life . If she could keep that in mind she would be able to play it through , do the right thing , whatever that meant . " I guess we could try , " she said uncertainly . " Only if you want to . " " Of course I do . " She did not know what else to say . " Of course I want to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carter , I do . " She paused , abruptly exhausted . " Maybe it 's not such a good idea . " " Do what you want , " he said , and went upstairs . Maria sat with her eyes closed until the vein in her temple stopped pulsing , then followed him upstairs . He lay on the bed in their room , staring at the ceiling . Only by an increased immobility did he acknowledge her presence . " I was going out to see Kate , " she said finally . " How many times you been out there lately ? " He still did not look at her . " Hardly at all , " she said , and then : " In the past few weeks , maybe a couple of times . " " You 've been there four times since Sunday . " Resolutely Maria walked into the dressing room and began pinning her hair back.  | " They called me , " Carter said from the bedroom , speaking as if by rote . " They called me to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's adjustment . " " Adjustment to what . " Maria jabbed a pin into her hair . " We 've been through this , Maria . We 've done this number about fifty times . " Maria put her head in her arms on the dressing table . When she looked into the mirror again she saw Carter 's reflection . There had come a time when she felt anesthetized in the presence of Ivan Costello and now that time had come with Carter . " Do n't cry , " Carter said . " I know it upsets you , we 're doing all we can , I said do n't cry . " " I 'm not crying , " she said , and she was not.  | " I 'M ADAMANT about the mixes , I 'm sorry , I just wo n't use them , " the masseur who wanted to be a writer called from the kitchen . Maria lay face down on the sand beyond the sun deck and tried to neutralize , by concentrating on images of Kate ( Kate 's hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital Kate 's hair was tangled and she had sat on the lawn and brushed it , worked out the tangles into fine golden strands , they told her not to come so often but how could she help it , they never brushed Kate 's hair ) , the particular rise and inflection of the masseur 's voice . There was always someone Maria tried not to hear at BZ and Helene 's . Either there were the sulky young men BZ met in places like Acapulco and Kitzbiihel and Tangier or there were Helene 's friends , the women with whom she shopped and planned restorative weeks at Palm Springs and La Costa , the women with the silk Pucci shirts and the periodically tightened eye lines and the husbands onp44perpetual location . They were always in their middle forties , those friends of Helene 's , always about ten years older than Helene herself . " Heaven pajamas , " Helene 's friends would say to one another , and they would exchange the addresses of new astrologers andthe tag lines of old jokes . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria and Carter arrived . " I 'll tell you one thing , he 's a great phone , " she said several times , and she and Helene would laugh . It seemed to be a joke but Maria had failed to hear the beginning of it . Usually Maria could avoid hearing Helene 's friends but BZ 's friends were more difficult , and this one was particularly difficult . Part of it was his voice and part of it was that Maria had met him before , she was certain she had . He did not seem to recognize her but she was sure that she had met him three years before , at someone 's house in Santa Barbara . He had come in after a polo game with some people who spoke only to the host and to one another , never to Carter and Maria  --  there had been an actor whose last several pictures had failed , the actor 's mother , and a nervous steel heiress with whom the others seemed to have spent a week in Palm Beach  --  and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even lying in the noon sun on this blazing dry October day Maria felt a physical chill when she thought about that afternoon in Santa Barbara . The way he looked wasp45the problem . He looked exactly the same . He looked untouched , and she did not . " BZ , you 've planned this to torment me , " he was saying now . He stood on the deck , holding a plastic lemon at elaborate arm's-length . " You could n't possibly buy artificial lemon juice , someone left it here , it 's a bad joke . " " All BZ 's friends are purists , " Helene murmured without opening her eyes . " You 're a nasty , " BZ said , and laughed . He twisted a silver medallion on his chest so that it flashed in the sun . BZ was perpetually tanned , oiled , gleaming , not the negotiable health-club tan of people like Freddy Chaikin but tanned as evidence of a lifetime spent in season . " Is n't Helene a nasty , Carter ? Have n't I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who amI impersonating ? " " Yourself , " Helene suggested . " Carter 's not listening , " the masseur said . " Do n't be draggy , Helene , run down the beach and ask Audrey Wise for a couple of lemons . Ask Audrey and Jerry for Bloodys even . I mean we could definitely stand a few giggles . " Helene opened her eyes . " You know what Jerry gave Audrey for her birthday ? " " Let me guess . " BZ touched a finger to his tongue and held it to the wind . " One perfect white rose . "  | " One perfect thousand-dollar bill , " Helene said . " Smartass . " " Maybe she can buy herself a good fuck , " BZ said . Helene giggled . " Jerry 's a good phone . " " The lemons , " the masseur said . Carter threw down the script he was reading and stood up . " I 'll get the goddamn lemons , " he said . Maria lay perfectly still until she knew that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything swimming in her vision . Beneath the faded American flag hanging over the sun deck they were arranged in tableau : BZ and the masseur , their bodies gleaming , unlined , as if they had an arrangement with mortality . Helene stood on the edge of the deck , looking down the beach toward Audrey and Jerry Wise 's house . Helene was not quite so immune to time , there was a certain texture to Helene 's thighs , a certain lack of resilience where fabric cut into Helene 's flesh . It occurred to Maria that whatever arrangements were made , they worked less well for women . That nervous steel heiress with whom Maria had last met the masseur , some-thing bad had happened to her . She had been shot in the face by her fourteen-year-old son . It had been in the newspapers a few years ago .. After the boy killed his mother he shot himself , and was later described by his father as a victim of divorce and drugs . Maria imagined that she had sunstroke . She closed her eyesp47and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's one less for lunch , " Helene said . " I seem to have come in after the main titles , " the masseur said petulantly . " Is he going to get the lemons or is n't he ? " " Faggots make Carter nervous , " Helene said pleasantly . BZ laughed and blew Helene a kiss off his finger-tips . " Actually , Nelson , " he said then , " that lemon is not artificial . That lemon is reconstituted . " Maria stood up and grabbed a beach towel from the deck and ran into the house with the towel clutched to her mouth and a few minutes later when , pale under her sunburn and covered with cold sweat , she stopped the dry heaves and pulled off her bathing suit she sawthat for the fifty-first day she was not bleeding .  | " I WAS N'T JUST CRAZY about your asking Helene how much money BZ 's mother gives them to stay married , " Carter said on the way back in from the beach . The top was down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet Freddy Chaikin and a writer from New York at Chasen 's at seven o'clock . " I was n't just crazy about that at all . " " Well , she does . " " Does what . " " Carlotta gives them money to stay married . " " So what . " " I 'm sick of everybody 's sick arrangements . " " You 've got a fantastic vocabulary . " She looked at him and she spoke very fast and low . " I 've got a fantastic vocabulary and I 'm having a baby . " Carter slowed the car down . " I missed a transition , " he said finally.  |p49Maria  did not look at him . " It 's not mine , " he said , his voice raised . " I suppose you 're going to tell me it 's not mine . " " I do n't know . " She did not know why she had said it but she had to . She had to get it straight . For a moment Carter said nothing . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She put her bare feet on the dashboard and pressed her face against her knees . Now it was a fact . He could stay or he could leave , she had set forth the fact . " Who was it , " he said . " You know . " He kept his eyes on the highway and his foot hard on the accelerator . She wanted to tell him she was sorry , but saying she was sorry did not seem entirely adequate , and in any case what she was sorry about seemed at once too deep and too evanescent for any words she knew , seemed so vastly more complicated than the immediate fact that it was perhaps better left unraveled . The late sun glazed the Pacific . The wind burned on her face . Once they were off the Coast Highway he pulled over to the curb and stopped the car . " I know , " he said . " But Felicia does n't . " She said nothing . It was going to be bad.  | " What makes you so sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sure . " The air seemed suddenly still and close and she pulled off her scarf . " I said I did n't know . " " I mean what makes you so sure it 's happening . " " Because I went to this doctor . " She spoke very fast and kept her mind on something else . It seemed to her that they had once been to dinner at somebody 's house who lived off San Vicente around here , she could not remember whose house it had been but there had been Japanese food and women with long handcrafted ear-rings and it had been summer . " Because I went to this doctor and the test he did in his office was positive but that 's not an absolutely certain test so he had me bring in some urine for a rabbit test . And he gave me this shot . And if I really was n't the shot would make me bleed in three to five days . " She paused . It came to her that in the scenario of her life this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wondered with distant interest just how long the scene would play . " And it was six days ago I had the shot . " " What about the test . " " What test ? " " The test you were talking about . The second test . " " The rabbit test . " She was suddenly almost too exhausted to speak . " I just never called back about it . "  | " You were afraid to call back about it . " He was speaking in a careful monotone , a prosecutor with an open-and-shut case . " You thought if you did n't call back it would just go away . " She closed her eyes . " I guess so . I guess that 's right . " " But now it 's certain anyway . Otherwise the shot would have made you bleed . " She nodded mutely . " What doctor . Who was the doctor . " " Just a doctor . On Wilshire . " " A doctor you did n't know . You thought that was smart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanics of this , Maria . I 'm interested in how your mind works . How exactly you picked this doctor out , why this particular doctor . " Maria folded her scarf and smoothed it carefully over her bare knees . " He was near Saks , " she whispered finally . " I was having my hair done at Saks. "  |p52LATE  THAT NIGHT sitting alone in the dark by the pool she remembered whose house it had been out off San Vicente with the Japanese food , it had been the house of a couple named Sidney and Ruth Loomis . Sidney Loomis was a television writer and Ruth Loomis was very active in the civil-rights movement and group therapy . Maria had never been able to think of anything to say to Ruth Loomis , but in retrospect that was not why Carter had stopped seeing Sidney and Ruth Loomis . He had stopped seeing them because the show Sidney Loomis was writing had been canceled in midseason and he did not pick up another . Maria tried very hard to keep thinking of Carter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names and obligations , because if she thought of Carter as he was tonight she would begin to cry again . He had left the house . He had neither met Freddy Chaikin at Chasen 's nor called to say that he was not coming . She knew that because Freddy Chaikin hadp53called for him . She had at last done something that reached him , but now it was too late . " What am I supposed to do , " he had said before he left the house . " What in fuck am I supposed to do ? "  |p54WHEN  CARTER CALLED the next morning it was from the motel on the desert . His voice was measured , uninflected , as if he had been saying the words to himself all night . " I love you , " she whispered , but it was more a plea than a declaration and in any case he made no response . " Get a pencil , " he ordered . He was going to give her a telephone number . He was going to give her the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did clean work . " Then we 'll see . " " I 'm not sure I want to do that , " she said carefully . " All right , do n't do it . Go ahead and have this kid . " He paused , confident in his hand . She waited for him to play it through . " And I 'll take Kate . " After he hung up she sat very still . She had a remote sense that everything was happening exactly the way it was supposed to happen . By the time she called him back she was calm , neutral , an intermediary calling to clarify the terms . " Listen , " she said . " If Ip55do this , then you promise I can have Kate ? You promise there wo n't be trouble later ? " " I 'm not promising anything , " he said . " I said we 'll see . "  |p56AT  FOUR THAT AFTERNOON , after a day spent looking at the telephone and lighting cigarettes and putting the cigarettes out and getting glasses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number . A man answered , and said that he would call back . When he did he asked who had referred her . " You want an appointment with the doctor , " he said . " When could he see me . " " The doctor will want to know how many weeks . " " How many weeks what ? " There was a silence . " How advanced is the problem , Maria , " the voice said finally.  | " THE FOOD WAS UNSPEAKABLE , myclothes mildewed in the closet , you can have Cozumel , " BZ 's mother said . She was playing solitaire and Maria sat transfixed by the light striking off the diamond bracelets on her thin tanned wrists . " Also Machu Picchu , " she added , slapping down another card . " I ca n't even dream why you stopped at Cozumel , " Helene said . " I mean since you ca n't bear Mexicans . " " BZ said it was marvelous , that 's why . " " BZ likes Mexicans . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffled the cards once and pointed at Maria . " Did you ask this child for dinner ? " she demanded . " Or did n't you ? " " It 's just seven , Carlotta . I thought we 'd have an-other drink " " I always serve at seven . "  | " The last time I was in Pebble Beach , " Helene said , " you served at quarter to eleven . " Helene and her mother-in-law looked at each other for an instant and then Carlotta began to laugh . " This girl is my own natural child , " she said finally to Maria , gasping through her laughter . " The daughter I did n't have . " " Speaking of the one you did have , " Helene said , " does Nikki know you 're back in the country ? " " Nikki . Nikki 's like this child , I bore her . " She looked at Maria . " Do n't I bore you . Admit it . " Maria looked up uncertainly . The voice on the telephone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The voice on the telephone had said that this would be expensive . The voice on the telephone had told her that on the day set she was to bring a pad and a belt and $i , 000 in cash . In confusion Maria looked away from Carlotta 's bright blue eyes , glittering like her bracelets . " Is n't it kind of . . . " Maria trailed off . " Is n't what ? " " I mean Cozumel , " Maria said finally . " Is n't it the off season . " " Of course the off season , " Carlotta said triumphantly . The voice had called her Maria.  |p59The  voice had said that he would be in touch . " Carlotta 's a demon for thrift , " Helene said . " Now what about my boring you , " Carlotta said.  |p60THE  NEXT MORNING in the dry still heat she woke crying for her mother . She had not cried for her mother since the bad season in New York , the season when she had done nothing but walk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to book her . She had not been able to eat that year because every time she looked at food the food would seem to arrange itself into ominous coils . She had known that there was no rattlesnake on her plate but once the image had seized her there was no eating the food . She was consumed that year by questions . Exactly what time had it happened , precisely what had she been doing in New York at the instant her mother lost control of the car outside Tonopah . What was her mother wearing , thinking . What was she doing in Tonopah anyway . She imagined her mother having a doctor 's appointment in Tonopah , and the doctor saying cancer , and her mother cracking up thep61car on purpose . She imagined her mother trying to call her from a pay phone in Tonopah , standing in a booth with all her quarters and dimes and nickels spread on the shelf and getting the operator and getting New York and then the answering service picking up the call . Maria did not know whether any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , used to think it particularly around the time the sun set in New York , think about the mother dying in the desert light , the daughter unavailable in the Eastern dark . She would imagine the quarters and dimes and nickels spread out on the shelf and the light in the cotton-woods and she would wonder what she was doing in the dark . What time is it there , her mother would have asked had she gotten Maria . What 's the weather . She might never have said what was on her mind but she would have left a coded message , said goodbye . One time Maria had saved enough money to give her mother a trip around the world , but instead she had lent the money to Ivan Costello , and then her mother was dead . " I 'm not crying , " Maria said when Carter called from the desert at 8 a.m . " I 'm perfectly all right . " " You do n't sound perfectly all right . " " I had a bad dream . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . I called the doctor . " She spoke very rapidlyp62and distantly . " Everything 's arranged . Everything 's perfectly taken care of . " " What did  --  " " I have to go now . I have to hang up . I have to see somebody about a job . " " Just hold on a minute , Maria , I want to know what the doctor said . " She was staring into a hand mirror , picking out her mother 's features . Sometime in the night she had moved into a realm of miseries peculiar to women , and she had nothing to say to Carter . " I said what did they say , Maria . " " They said they 'd call me up some day and on the day they called me up I 'd meet them some place with a pad and a belt and $i , 000 in cash . All right , Carter ? All right ? "  |p63ALTHOUGH  THE HEAT had not yet broken she began that week to sleep inside , between white sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm , that she would wake in the morning and find them stained with blood . She did this in the same spirit that she had , a month before , thrown a full box of Tampax into the garbage : to be without Tampax was to insure bleeding , to sleep naked between white sheets was to guarantee staining . To give the charm every opportunity she changed the immaculate sheets every morning . She wore white crepe pajamas and no underwear to a party . She pretended to herself that she was keeping the baby , the better to invite disappointment , court miscarriage . " I 'm having a baby , " she heard herself telling the parking-lot attendant at Saks as they tried vainly to get a wicker bassinette into the Corvette . When it became clear that she would have to leave the bassinette for delivery she sat in the driver 's seat of thep64Corvette and cried . She was crying too much . All the time now , when she was driving and when she was trying to clean a bathroom and when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was wondering where and when it was going to happen . " Any calls , " she asked the service . " Mr. Goodwin , New York , three times , you 're to call immediately . " She looked again into the hand mirror and again saw her mother . " Tell him I have n't picked up my messages . " She had nothing to say to any of them.  | " MONDAY , " the voice on the telephone said . " Monday at five o'clock . We 'll be in touch again on Monday . " " Where , " she said . " Where do I go . " " I said we 'll be in touch , Maria . We will . " She drove to the beach , but there was oil scum on the sand and a red tide in the flaccid surf and mounds of kelp at the waterline . The kelp hummed with flies . The water lapped warm , forceless . When she got back into town she drove aimlessly down Sunset , pulled into a drive-in at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposefulness by a Coca-Cola , walked barefoot across the hot asphalt to a telephone booth . " This is Maria , " she said helplessly when Felicia Goodwin picked up the telephone in New York . She did not know why but she had not counted on talking to Felicia . " I just wondered when you were coming back . "  | " We 've been trying to get you for days . " Felicia always spoke on the telephone as if a spurious urgency could mask her radical lack of interest in talking to anyone . Sometimes Maria was depressed by how much she and Felicia had in common . " Les was worried something had happened to you , I said no , she 's on the desert with Carter  --  did n't you call the service ? " " Not exactly . " " Anyway we 'll be out in a few days , this time to stay , we 're going to buy a house  --  " Felicia 's voice faded , as if she had stretched her capacity for communication to its limit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Felicia said with relief . " Never mind , " Maria said , but it was too late . " Where 've you been , " he said . " Nowhere . " When she heard his voice she felt a rush of well-being . " I did n't want to call because  --  " " I ca n't hear you , Maria , where are you ? " " In a phone booth . I just wanted  --  " " You all right ? " " No . I mean yes . " A bus was shifting gears on Sunset and she raised her voice . " Listen . Call me . " She walked back to the car and sat for a long while in the parking lot , idling the engine and watching a woman in a muumuu walk out of the Carolina Pinesp67Motel and cross the street to a supermarket . The woman walked in small mincing steps and kept raising her hand to shield her eyes from the vacant sunlight . As if in trance Maria watched the woman , for it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the world , the quintessential inter-section of nothing . She did not know why she had told Les Goodwin to call her.  | " YOU WANT IT IN CASH , " the teller said doubtfully . " I 'm taking a trip . " She did not know why she was saying this but she kept on . " Mexico City , Guadalajara . " " You do n't want traveler 's checks ? " " Cash , " she said , and when the teller handed her the bills she ran from the bank with them still in her hand . In the car she counted the stiff bills . They stuck together and she missed one and she counted them four more times before she was certain she had them all . Since early morning she had been trying to re-member something Les Goodwin had said to her , anything Les Goodwin had said to her . When she was not actually talking to him now she found it hard to keep him distinct from everyone else , everyone with whom she had ever slept or almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had seemed this pastp69month as if they were all one , that her life had been a single sexual encounter , one dreamed fuck , no beginnings or endings , no point beyond itself . She tried to remember how it had been to drag Fremont Street in Vegas with Earl Lee Atkins when she was sixteen years old , how it had been to go out on the desert between Vegas and Boulder and drink beer from half-quart cans and feel her sunburn when he touched her and smell the chlorine from her own hair and the Lava soap from his and the sweet sharp smell of starched cotton soaked with sweat . How High the Moon , the radio would play , Les Paul and Mary Ford . She tried to remember Ivan Costello , tried to fix in her mind the exact way the light came through the shutters in his bedroom in New York , the exact colors of the striped sheets she had put on his bed and the way those sheets looked in the morning and the look of a motel room in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to remember Carter . She tried to remember Les Goodwin . She could remember it all but none of it seemed to come to anything . She had a sense the dream had ended and she had slept on.  | " NOTHING 'S WRONG , " she repeated to Les Goodwin on the telephone . " I know something 's wrong . " " Nothing . " " O.K. , " he said finally . " All right . I 'm coming out alone on Monday , meet my plane at four . " " I ca n't . " " I want to talk to you , Maria . I want to see you . " " Monday night , " she said . " Listen . You make me happy . " She hung up very fast then because she did not want to find herself telling him why she could not meet his flight.  |p71IN  THE DREAM from which she woke when the telephone rang again that night she had the baby , and she and the baby and Kate were living on , f P &A-f; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not yet know Carter , but somehow had Carter 's daughter and Carter 's blessing . In the dream it was all right . She supposed that she had dreamed of Ivan Costello because the telephone was ringing , and he used to call her in the middle of the night . " How much do you want it , " he used to say . " Tell me what you 'd do to get it from me . " The telephone was still ringing and she pulled the cord loose from the jack . She could not remember what she would have done to get it from any of them.  | " YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CALL before youcome , " the nurse in charge of Kate 's cottage said on Sunday . The nurse had short hair and a faint moustache and Kate clung to her knees and Maria did not like her . " The new medication , new treatment , naturally she 's not  --  " " What new medication , " Maria heard herself saying . " You keep talking about the new medication , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nurse looked reproachfully at Maria . " Methylphenidate hydrochloride . " Maria closed her eyes . " All right . Your point . " " We definitely would have suggested you wait until next week . " " I wo n't be here next week . " " You 're going away ? " " Cozumel , " Maria said . " Mexico . " On the way to the parking lot she twice invented pretexts to run back , kiss Kate 's small fat hands , tellp73her to be good . The third time she ran back it was to find the nurse . " One thing . You know when she wakes up at night and says oise , oise , ' it means she 's . . . " Maria faltered . She realized that she expected to die . All along she had expected to die , as surely as she expected that planes would crash if she boarded them in bad spirit , as unquestionably as she believed that loveless marriage ended in cancer of the cervix and equivocal adultery in fatal accidents to children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in punishments , swift and personal . " It means she 's having a night-mare , " she said finally . The nurse looked at her impassively . " I mean I do n't know if I ever told you that . " " I 'm sure you did , " the nurse said . That night the house crackled with malign electricity . A hot wind came up at midnight and the leaves scraped the screens , a loose storm drain slapped against the roof . Sometime in the night Maria wrote three letters which , before dawn , she tore up and flushed down the toilet . The bits of paper kept floating back into the toilet bowl and by the time she finally got rid of them it was light , and all the daisies in the garden had been snapped by the wind , and the concrete around the swimming pool was littered with fallen palm fronds . At six-thirty that morning shep74placed a call to Carter at the motel on the desert but Carter had already left for the location . She interpreted that as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would do what he wanted . She would do this one last thing and then they would never be able to touch her again.  |p75SHE  TRIED TO STRAIGHTEN a drawer , and abandoned it . She heard fire reports on the radio , and turned the sprinklers on the ivy . For almost two hours she studied an old issue of Vogue she picked up in the poolhouse , her attention fixed particularly on the details of the life led in New York and Rome by the wife of an Italian industrialist . The Italian seemed to find a great deal of purpose in her life , seemed to make decisions and stick by them , and Maria studied the photographs as if a key might be found among them . When she had exhausted the copy of Vogue she got out her checkbook and a stack of bills and spread them on the kitchen table . Paying bills sometimes lent her the illusion of order but now each bill she opened seemed fresh testimony to her life 's disorder , its waste and diffusion : flowers sent to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought for beds in which no one now slept , an old bill from F.A.O . Schwarz for a tricycle Kate had never ridden . Whenp76she wrote out the check to Schwarz her hand trembled so hard that she had to void the first check , and smoke a cigarette before she could write another . " Get it right , Maria , " the voice on the telephone said . " You got a pencil there ? You writing this down ? " " Yes , " Maria said . " Ventura Freeway north , you got that all right ? You know what exit ? " " I wrote it down . " " All set , then . I 'll meet you in the parking lot of the Thriftimart . " " What Thriftimart , " Maria whispered . " Maria , I told you , you ca n't miss it . Under.the big red T. " In the aftermath of the wind the air was dry , burning , so clear that she could see the ploughed furrows of firebreaks on distant mountains . Not even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air seemed to rob everything of its perspective , seemed to alter all perception of depth , and Maria drove as care-fully as if she were reconnoitering an atmosphere without gravity . Taco Bells jumped out at her . Oil rockers creaked ominously . For miles before she reached the Thriftimart she could see the big red T , ap77forty-foot cutout letter which seemed peculiarly illuminated against the harsh unclouded light of the afternoon sky.  | " YOU DRIVE , " the man had said . " We 'll pick up my car after . " He was wearing white duck pants and a white sport shirt and he had a moon face and a eunuch 's soft body . The hand resting on his knee was pale and freckled and boneless and ever since he got in the car he had been humming I Get a Kick Out of You . " You familiar with this area , Maria ? " The question seemed obscurely freighted . " No , " Maria said finally . " Nice homes here . Nice for kids . " The voice was bland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ask you one question , all right ? " Maria nodded , and tightened her grip on the steering wheel . " Get pretty good mileage on this ? Or no ? " " Pretty good , " she heard herself saying after only the slightest pause . " Not too bad . "  | " You may have noticed , I drive a Cadillac . Eldorado . Eats gas but I like it , like the feel of it . " Maria said nothing . That , then , had actually been the question . She had not misunderstood . " If I decided to get rid of the Cad , " he said , " I might pick myself up a little Camaro . Maybe that sounds like a step down , a Cad to a Camaro , but I 've got my eye on this particular Camaro , exact model of the pace car in the Indianapolis 500 . " " You think you 'll buy a Camaro , " Maria said in the neutral tone of a therapist . " Get the right price , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write me a sweet deal if it 's on the floor much longer . They almost had a buyer last week but lucky for me  --  here , Maria , right here , pull into this drive-way . " Maria turned off the ignition and looked at the man in the white duck pants with an intense and grateful interest . In the past few minutes he had significantly altered her perception of reality : she saw now that she was not a woman on her way to have an abortion . She was a woman parking a Corvette outside a tract house while a man in white pants talked about buying a Camaro . There was no more to it than that . " Lucky for you what ? " " Lucky for me , the guy 's credit did n't hold up . "  |p80THE  FLOOR OF THE BEDROOM where ithappened was covered with newspapers . She remembered reading somewhere that newspapers were anti-septic , it had to do with the chemicals in the ink , to deliver a baby in a farmhouse you covered the floor with newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something unexpected , some emergency trick : quilts could be made with news-papers . In time of disaster you could baste newspapers to both sides of a cotton blanket and end up with a warm quilt . She knew a lot of things about disaster . She could manage . Carter could never manage but she could . She could not think where she had learned all these tricks . Probably in her mother 's American Red Cross Handbook , gray with a red cross on the cover . There , that was a good thing to think about , at any rate not a bad thing if she kept her father out of it . If she could concentrate for even one minute on a picture of herself as a ten-year-old sitting on the frontp81steps of the house in Silver Wells reading the gray book with the red cross on the cover ( splints , shock , rattlesnake bite , rattlesnake bite was why her mother made her read it ) with the heat shimmering off the corrugated tin roof of the shed across the road ( her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , say he had gone into Vegas with Benny Austin ) , if she could concentrate for one more minute on that shed , on whether this minute twenty years later the heat still shimmered off its roof , those were two minutes during which she was not entirely party to what was happening in this bedroom in Encino . Two minutes in Silver Wells , two minutes here , two minutes there , it was going to be over in this bedroom in Encino , it could not last forever . The walls of the bedroom were cream-colored , yellow , a wallpaper with a modest pattern . Whoever had chosen that wallpaper would have liked maple furniture , a maple bedroom set , a white chenille bedspread and a white Princess telephone , all gone now but she could see it as it must have been , could see even the woman who had picked the wallpaper , she would be a purchaser of Audubon prints and scented douches , a hoarder of secret sexual grievances , a wife . Two minutes in Silver Wells , two minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The table was a doctor 's table but not fitted with stirrups : instead there were two hardbacked chairs withp82pillows tied over the backs . " Tell me if it 's too cold , " the doctor said . The doctor was tall and haggard and wore a rubber apron . " Tell me now because I wo n't be able to touch the air conditioner once I start . " She said that it was not too cold . " No , it 's too cold . You do n't weigh enough , it 's too cold . " He adjusted the dial but the sound remained level . She closed her eyes and tried to concentrate on the sound . Carter did not like air conditioners but there had been one somewhere . She had slept in a room with an air conditioner , the question was where , never mind the question , that question led nowhere . " This is just induced menstruation , " she could hear the doctor saying . " Nothing to have any emotional difficulties about , better not to think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think about it , do n't like anesthetics , anesthetics are where we run into trouble , just a little local on the cervix , there , relax , Maria , I said relax . " No moment more or less important than any other moment , all the same : the pain as the doctor scraped signified nothing beyond itself , no more constituted the pattern of her life than did the movie on television in the living room of this house in Encino . The man in the white duck pants was sitting out there watching the movie and she was lying in here not watching thep83movie , and that was all there was to that . Why the volume on the set was turned up so high seemed another question better left unasked . " Hear that scraping , Maria ? " the doctor said . " That should be the sound of music to you . . . do n't scream , Maria , there are people next door , almost done , almost over , better to get it all now than do it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make any noise , Maria , now I 'll tell you what 's going to happen , you 'll bleed a day or so , not heavily , just spotting , and then a month , six weeks from now you 'll have a normal period , not this month , this month you just had it , it 's in that pail . " He went into the bathroom then ( later she would try to fix in her mind the exact circumstances of his leaving the bedroom , would try to remember if he took the pail with him , later that would seem important to her ) and by the time he came back the contractions had stopped . He gave her one envelope of tetracycline capsules and another of ergot tablets and by six o'clock of that hot October afternoon she was out of the bedroom in Encino and back in the car with the man in the white duck pants . The late sun seemed warm and benevolent on her skin and everything she saw looked beautiful , the summer pulse of life itself made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled radiantly at her companion . " You missed a pretty fair movie , " he said . " Paulap84Raymond . " He reached into his pocket for what seemed to be a cigarette holder . " Ever since I gave up smoking I carry these by the dozen , they look like regular holders but all you get is air . " Maria stared at his outstretched hand . " Take it . I noticed you 're still smoking . You 'll thank me some day . " " Thank you . " " I 'm a regular missionary . " The man in the white duck pants resettled his soft bulk and gazed out the car window . " Gee , Paula Raymond was a pretty girl , " he said then . " Funny she never became a star . "  | " I WANT A VERY LARGE STEAK , " shesaid to Les Goodwin in a restaurant on Melrose at eight o'clock that night . " And before the very large steak I want three drinks . And after the steak I want to go somewhere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know where . You ought to know where . You know a lot of places with loud music . " " What 's the matter with you . " " I am just very very very tired of listening to you all . "  |p86SILVER  WELLS was with her again . She wanted to see her mother . She wanted to go back to the last day she had spent with her mother : a Sunday . She had flown out from New York on Friday and then it was Sunday and Benny Austin was there for Sunday dinner and after dinner they would all drive down to Vegas to put Maria back on the airplane . " Your mom 's O.K. , do n't worry about your mom , " Benny muttered when he and Maria were alone for a moment at the table . " Believe me it 's nothing . " " What 's nothing ? What 's the matter with her ? " " Nothing on God 's earth , Maria , that 's what I 'm telling you . You might say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to talk about it . " " Depressed , " Maria repeated . " Nothing , Maria , believe me . Here they come , we 're talking about the zinc boom . " Benny cleared his throat . " I 've been telling Maria about the zinc boom , Harry . "  | " You into zinc ? " Maria said finally . She was watching her mother but her mother looked just as she always had . " We 've been buying a few rights . " Harry Wyeth began whistling through his teeth . " Meal fit for the Queen of Spain , " Benny said . " Francine , you could make a fortune in the take-out spare-rib business . " Francine Wyeth laughed . " Maria and I can always open a hash house . When we get sick of you all . " " Hash house on 95 , " Harry Wyeth said . " Pretty picture . " " Not on 95 , " Francine Wyeth said . " Somewhere else . " Maria closed her eyes . " I 'm talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name and your receipt . " Benny Austin talked as if nothing had happened at the table . " Franchised services , that 's where the future lies . " " I do n't want to go back , " Maria said . " That 's natural . " Harry Wyeth did not look at his wife or daughter . " That 's only natural . Do n't think about it , you 'll be out again in a month or two , plan on it now . " " She 's too thin , " Francine Wyeth said . " Look at her , see for yourself . "  | " She ca n't win if she 's not at the table , Francine . " Harry Wyeth threw down his napkin and stood up . " You would n't understand that . " That night as the plane taxied out onto the runway at McCarran Maria had kept her face pressed against the window for as long as she could see them , her mother and father and Benny Austin , waving at the wrong window.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with BZ 's mother , " Carter said when he called from the desert . " Why do n't you fly up and meet her there . " " I ca n't . " " Too busy , I suppose . " Maria said nothing . " Or maybe you 're afraid you might have a good time . " " I said I ca n't . " " Why ca n't you , just for the record . " " She 's not my mother , " Maria said.  |p90THE  BLEEDING BEGAN a few weekslater . " It 's nothing , " the doctor on Wilshire said when she finally went . " Whoever did it did all right . It 's clean , no infection , count your blessings . " " The pain . " " You 're just menstruating early , I 'll give you some Edrisal .

Morty Landau , I predicted it , he 's in love with you . You 've got a guest-star on a two-part Interstate 80 . " " That 's fine , Freddy . " She tried for more conviction . " That 's really fine . " He watched her drain her glass . " It 'll get you seen . " " Actually I 'm not feeling too well . " " You mean you do n't want to work . " " I did n't say that . I just said I was n't feeling too well . " " Maria , I empathize . What you and Carter are going through , it tears my heart out . Believe me , I 've been through it . Which is why I know that work is the best medicine for things wrong in the private-life department . And I do n't want to sound like an agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar bill . " He laughed , and then looked at her . " A joke , Maria . Just a joke . "  |p92THE  BLEEDING CAME AND WENT andcame again . By late afternoon of her third day 's work on Interstate 8o there were involuntary pain lines on her forehead and she could not stand entirely upright for more than a few seconds . She sat back in the shadows on the edge of the set and prayed that the cameramen would be so slow with the set-ups that the day 's last shot would be delayed until morning . At five-thirty they got the shot in three takes and later in the parking lot she could not remember doing it . By midnight the blood was coming so fast that she soaked three pads in fifteen minutes . There was blood on the bed , blood on the floor , blood on the bathroom tiles . She thought about calling Les Goodwin  --  it would be all right to call him , she knew that Felicia was in San Francisco  --  but she did not . She called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " I do n't exactly want to do that . " " For Christ 's sake then get to an emergency hospital . " " I ca n't , " she said finally . " The thing is , I 'm working tomorrow . " " What do you mean , working . What in fuck does working mean . You just told me you were dying . " " I never said that . " " You said you were afraid . " Maria said nothing . " Jesus Christ , Maria , I 'm out here on the desert , I ca n't do anything , will you please get to a hospital or do you want me to call the police to come get you . " " You just want me in a hospital so that nothing 'll happen to make you feel guilty , " she said then , said it before she meant to speak , and when she heard the words she broke out in a sweat . " Listen , " she said . " I did n't mean that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor right now . " " You have to swear to me . " Carter 's voice was drained , exhausted . " You have to swear you 'll call the doctor . And call me back if something 's wrong . " " I promise . " Instead she took a Dexedrine to stay awake . Awake she could always call an ambulance . Awake she could save herself if it came to that . In the morning , from the studio , she called the doctor.  | " I 'll meet you at St. John 's , " he said . " I ca n't go to the hospital . I told you before , I 'm working . " " You 're hemorrhaging , you ca n't work . " " Oh yes I can work , " she said , and hung up . She had wanted to ask him for more Dexedrine , but in-stead she got some from a hairdresser on the set . While she was changing she found a large piece of bloodied tissue on the pad she had been wearing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor 's office on her way home from the studio . When she called the next day the doctor said that the tissue was part of the placenta , and that was the end of that . For the first time in two weeks she slept through the night , and was an hour late for her morning call.  | " You WERE GOING to come over and use the sauna , " Larry Kulik said . " I 've been " So I hear . " " Hear what . " " Hear you 're ready for a nuthouse , you want to know . " " You think I need a sauna . " " I think you need something . " Maria said nothing . " I 'm a good friend to people I like , " Larry Kulik said . " Think it over . "  |p96A  FEW DAYS LATER the dreams began . She was in touch with a member of a shadowy Syndicate . Sometimes the contact was Freddy Chaikin , sometimes an F.B.I . man she had met once in New York and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always he explained that he was " part of that operation . " Always he wanted to discuss " a business proposition . " Always he mentioned a plan to use the house in Beverly Hills for " purposes which would in no way concern " her . She need only supply certain information : the condition of the plumbing , the precise width of the pipes , the location and size of all the clean-outs . Workmen appeared , rooms were prepared . The man in the white duck pants materialized and then the doctor , in his rubber apron . At that point she would fight for consciousness but she was never able to wake herself before the dream revealed its inexorable intention , before the plumbing stopped up , before they all fled and left her there , grayp97water bubbling up in every sink . Of course she could not call a plumber , because she had known all along what would be found in the pipes , what hacked pieces of ' human flesh.  |p98IN  NOVEMBER THE HEAT BROKE , andCarter went to New York to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the morning a sink backed up in the house in Beverly Hills she looked in the classified for another place to sleep . " You 'd be surprised the history this place has , " the man said as he showed her the apartment . He was wearing a pumpkin velour beach robe and wrap-around glasses and she had found him not in the apartment marked " Mgr. " but out on Fountain Avenue , hosing down the sidewalk . " As a writer , it might interest you to know that Philip Dunne once had 2-D . " " I 'm not a writer , " Maria said . " Excuse me , it was Sidney Howard . " He took off his glasses and wiped them on a sleeve of the beach robe . " Or so the legend goes . " In December the Christmas tree on top of the Capitol Records Tower came and went , and Maria hadp99Kate for three days . They drove up and down La Brea looking for a Christmas tree and had Christmas dinner at Les and Felicia Goodwin 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her against a large mirror . " She misses Carter , " Felicia murmured , distraught beyond the immediate breakage . " You do n't know what the fuck you 're talking about , " Les Goodwin said . Kate 's eyes darted from Maria to Les to Felicia and back to Maria and then , preternaturally attuned to the threat of voices not even raised , she began to scream . The mother apologizing , the child screaming , the polished floor covered with shards of broken mirror and flesh-colored ceramic , they left the Christmas dinner . All that night the two of them held each other with a dumb protective ferocity but the next day at the hospital , parting , only Maria cried . In January there were poinsettias in front of all the bungalows between Melrose and Sunset , and the rain set in , and Maria wore not sandals but real shoes and a Shetland sweater she had bought in New York the year she was nineteen . For days during the rain she did not speak out loud or read a newspaper . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the page : the four-year-olds in the aban/doned refrigerator , the tea party with Purex , the infant in the driveway , rattlesnake in the playpen , the peril , unspeakable peril , in the everyday . She grew faint as the processions swept before her , the children alive when last scolded , dead when next seen , the children in the locked car burning , the little faces , helpless screams . The mothers were always reported to be under sedation . In the whole world there was not as much sedation as there was instantaneous peril . Maria ate frozen enchiladas , looked at television for word of the world , thought of herself as under sedation and did not leave the apartment on Fountain Avenue.  | " I DO N'T KNOW if you noticed , I 'm mentallyill , " the woman said . The woman was sitting next to Maria at the snack counter in Ralph 's Market . " I 'm talking to you . " Maria turned around . " I 'm sorry . " " I 've been mentally ill for seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to get through a day like this . " " This is a bad day for you , " Maria said in a neutral voice . " What 's so different about this day . " Maria looked covertly at the pay phones but there was still a line . The telephone in the apartment was out of order and she had to report it . The line at the pay phones in Ralph 's Market suddenly suggested to Maria a disorganization so general that the norm was to have either a disconnected telephone or some clan-destine business to conduct , some extramarital error . She had to have a telephone . There was no one top102whom she wanted to talk but she had to have a telephone . If she could not be reached it would happen , the peril would find Kate . Beside her the woman 's voice rose and fell monotonously . " I mean you ca n't fathom the despair . Believe me I 've thought of ending it . Kaput . Over . Head in the oven . " " A doctor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors . " " You 'll feel better . Try to feel better . " The girl now using the nearest telephone seemed to be calling a taxi to take her home from Ralph 's . The girl had rollers in her hair and a small child in her basket and Maria wondered whether her car had been repossessed or her husband had left her or just what had happened , why was she calling a taxi from Ralph 's . " I mean you have to try , you ca n't feel this way forever . " " I 'll say I ca n't . " Tears began to roll down the woman 's face . " You do n't even want to talk to me . " " But I do . " Maria touched her arm . " I do . " " Get your whore 's hands off me , " the woman screamed.  | " THERE 'S SOME PRINCIPLE I 'm notgrasping , Maria , " Carter said on the telephone from New York . " You 've got a $I , 5oo-a-month house sitting n-I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a furnished apartment on Fountain Avenue . You want to he closer to Schwab 's ? Is that it ? " Maria lay on the bed watching a television news lilm of a house about to slide into the Tujunga Wash . " I 'm not living here , I 'm just staying here . " " I still do n't get the joke . " She kept her eyes on the screen . " Then do n't get it , " she said at the exact instant the house splintered and fell . After Carter had hung up Maria wrapped her robe close and smoked part of a joint and watched an inter-view with the woman whose house it had been . " You I ) oys did a really outstanding camera job , " the woman said . Maria finished the cigarette and repeated the compliment out loud . The day 's slide and flood newsp104was followed by a report of a small earth tremor centered near Joshua Tree , 4.2 on the Richter Scale , and , of corollary interest , an interview with a Pentecostal minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by earthquake on a Friday afternoon in March . The notion of general devastation had for Maria a certain sedative effect ( the rattle-snake in the playpen , that was different , that was particular , that was punitive ) , suggested an instant in which all anxieties would be abruptly gratified , and between the earthquake prophecy and the marijuana and the cheerful detachment of the woman whose house was in the Tujunga Wash , she felt a kind of re-signed tranquillity . Within these four rented walls she was safe . She was more than safe , she was all right : she had seen herself on Interstate 8o just before the news and she looked all right . Warm , content , suffused with tentative small resolves , Maria fell asleep before the news was over . But the next morning when the shower seemed slow to drain she threw up in the toilet , and after she had stopped trembling packed the few things she had brought to Fountain Avenue and , in the driving rain , drove back to the house in Beverly Hills . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOING TO DO IT , " she would say onthe telephone . " Then do it , " Carter would say . " It 's better . " " You think it 's better . " " If it 's what you want . " " What do you want . " " It 's never been right , " he would say . " It 's been shit . " " I 'm sorry . " " I know you 're sorry . I 'm sorry . " " We could try , " one or the other would say after a while . " We 've already tried , " the other would say . By the time Carter came back to town in February the dialogue was drained of energy , the marriage lanced . " I 've got a new lawyer , " she told him . " You can use Steiner . " " I 'll call him today . " " I 'll need a witness . "  | " Helene , " he said . " Helene can do it . " He seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details , satisfied that he could offer Helene . He would be staying in BZ and Helene 's guest house while they were looping and scoring the picture . He would speak to Helene immediately . Maria felt herself a sleepwalker to the courthouse . " Let 's see . . . an afternoon hearing . " Helene spaced the words as if she were consulting an engagement book . " That means lunch before instead of after . " " We do n't have to have lunch . " " Day of days , Maria . Of course lunch . " On the day of the hearing Maria overslept , thick with Seconal . When she walked into the Bistro half an hour late for lunch she could only think dimly how healthy Helene looked , how suntanned and somehow invincible with her silk shirt and tinted glasses and long streaked hair and a new square emerald that covered one of her fingers to the knuckle . " Straighten your shoulders , " Helene said , lifting her drink slightly as Maria sat down . " You look spectral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes were not on Maria but on two women who sat across the room . " Allene Walsh has a new friend , " she mur/mured to Maria as she smiled at the older of the two women . " They 've been spooning food into each other 's mouths for the past half hour . " " She 's an actress named Sharon Carroll , I worked with her once . " Maria tried to summon up some other detail to assuage Helene 's avid interest in other people . " She kept a dildo in her dressing room . " " Allene Walsh has more dildoes around her house than anybody I ever knew . Look at my new ring . " " I saw it . " " From Carlotta . " Helene studied the emerald . " For staying on the desert . Speaking of new friends . I mean he was shuttling them in and out of that motel like the dailies , I could n't even get up for a Nembutal without knocking over somebody 's bottle of Monsieur Y. " For an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she spoke again her voice was flat and pre-occupied . " You look like hell , Maria , this is n't any excuse for you to fall apart , I mean a divorce . I 've done it twice . " " I thought only once . " " Twice , " Helene said without interest . " BZ says once because that 's what he told his mother . " She was intent upon her reflection in the mirror behind the table , tracing a line with one finger from her chin to her temple . " You can really tell , " she said finally . " Tell what ? "  | " Tell I have n't done my Laszlo in three days . " Helene 's voice was still flat but her interest seemed revived . At two o'clock they met Carter and the lawyers out-side the courtroom in Santa Monica , and at two-thirty Maria swore and Helene confirmed that the defendant , Carter Lang , had repeatedly struck and in other ways humiliated the plaintiff , Mrs. Maria Lang . The charge was mental cruelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers referred seemed to Maria someone other than herself , an aggrieved wife she might see interviewed on television . As they waited for the details to be cleared up , the papers to be signed , Maria sat very still with her hands in her lap . Helene stirred restlessly beside her , her eyes across the aisle , on Carter and his lawyer . " Carter , " Helene whispered finally , leaning across Maria to attract his attention . " Puzzle of the week . Guess which two dykes were seen feeding each other cheese souffle in the Bistro today . "  | " WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING , " Cartersaid the next time she saw him . " Working . I 'm going to be working very soon . " " I mean who 've you been seeing . " " Nobody . Helene . BZ . BZ comes by sometimes . " " Do n't get into that , " Carter said . " He 's your friend , " Maria said.  |p110THE  FIRST TIME Maria ever met BZ it had been at the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon and it was the summer Carter was cutting Angel Beach . " I 've got a meeting at the beach with this guy from San Francisco I told you about , " Carter had said . " You come along and swim . " " I do n't feel like swimming . " " Maria , " Carter had said finally , " he 's going to maybe put up some money . Maybe . All right ? " When they walked into the beach house she thought there must have been some misunderstanding , some mixup of time or day , because the man to whom Carter spoke was sitting alone with a projector in the darkened living room running a blue movie of extraordinary technical quality . " Stroke of two , very prompt , " the man had said , and looked at Maria for a long while before he turned off the projector.  | " Did you get by the studio yesterday ? " Carter seemed oblivious to the meeting 's peculiar circumstance . " They show you the rough cut ? " " Fantastic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where 's Helene ? " " On the beach . " " I 'll get my suit on , " Maria said , uneasy in the darkened room , and BZ had looked at her again , then flicked the projector back on . " It 's too cold to swim , " he said , and then to Carter : " The rough cut looked fantastic , except you 're missing the story . " " Meaning what . " " Meaning , " BZ said , " how did Maria feel about the gangbang , the twelve cocks , did she get the sense they 're doing it not to her but to each other , does that interest her , you do n't get that , you 're missing the story . " The reel had run out and the only sound was the film slapping against the projector . " It 's a commercial piece , BZ , " Carter said finally . BZ only shrugged , and changed the reel . Again the figures flooded the screen . Wordlessly , BZ sat on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passed it to her , and when she passed it on to Carter he took it without looking away from thep112screen . Between the marijuana and the figures on the screen Maria felt flushed and not entirely in control . " Look at the film , BZ , " Carter had said suddenly . " Incredible , they 've got opticals . " " I 've seen the film , Carter , " BZ had said , and never took his eyes from Maria.  | " LET 'S GO TO MEXICO CITY tonight , " BZsaid . " Who ? " " You , me , Helene , I do n't know , maybe Larry Kulik , just fly down for a couple of days , Susannah Wood 's there now doing some interiors at Churubusco . " " I do n't want to do that , " Maria said . " Yes you do , " BZ said.  |p114EVERY  NIGHT she named to herself what she must do : she must ask Les Goodwin to come keep her from peril . Calmed , she would fall asleep pretending that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . The house was like none she had ever seen but she thought of it so often that she knew even where the linens were kept , the plates , knew how the wild grass ran down to the beach and where the rocks made tidal pools . Every morning in that house she would make the bed with fresh sheets . Every day in that house she would cook while Kate did her lessons . Kate would sit in a shaft of sunlight , her head bent over a pine table , and later when the tide ran out they would gather mussels together , Kate and Maria , and still later all three of them would sit down together at the big pine table and Maria would light a kerosene lamp and they would eat the mussels and drink a bottle of cold white wine and after a while it would be time to lie down again , on the clean white sheets . Inp115the story Maria told herself at three or four in the morning there were only three people and none of them had histories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in the lamplight , the opalescent mussel shells . But by dawn she was always back in the house in Beverly Hills , uneasy in the queer early light , plagued by her own and his own and Kate 's own manifold histories , certain that BZ and Larry Kulik and all their kind recognized her in a way that Les Goodwin might not want to , recognized her , knew her , had her number , understood as she did that the still center of the daylight world was never a house by the sea but the corner of Sunset and La Brea . In that empty sun-light Kate could do no lessons , and the mussels on any shore Maria knew were toxic . Instead of calling Les Goodwin she bought a silver vinyl dress , and tried to stop thinking about what had he done with the baby . The tissue . The living dead thing , whatever you called it.  | " I 'M GOING TO NEW YORK for a fewdays , " she said to Carter . Going to New York had not before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running into Carter on the street in Beverly Hills the idea simultaneously materialized and assumed a real plausibility . It was something people did when they did not know what else to do , they went to New York for a few days . " Tomorrow morning , " she added . " What are you going to do in New York ? " " What do people usually do in New York . " He looked at her for a long time . She was aware that her hair was unkempt , her face puffy . She did not meet his eyes . " They see a few plays , " he said finally . " Maybe you can see a few plays . " " Maybe I can , " she said , and walked away . All that day Maria thought of fetuses in the East River , translucent as jellyfish , floating past the big sewage outfalls with the orange peels . She did not go to New York.  |p117ONCE  A LONG TIME BEFORE Maria hadworked a week in Ocho Rios with a girl who had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her about it while they sat huddled next to a waterfall waiting for the photographer to decide the sun was high enough to shoot . It seemed that it was a hard time for abortions in New York , there had been arrests , no one wanted to do it . Finally the girl , her name was Ceci Delano , had asked a friend in the District Attorney 's office if he knew of anyone . " Quid pro quo , " he had said , and , late the same day that Ceci Delano testified to a blue-ribbon jury that she had been approached by a party-girl operation , she was admitted to Doctors ' Hospital for a legal D &; C , arranged and paid for by the District Attorney 's office . It had seemed a funny story as she told it , both that morning by the waterfall and later at dinner , when she repeated it to the photographer and the agency man and the fashion coordinator for the client . Mariap118tried now to put what had happened in Encino into the same spirited perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the end it was just a New York story.  |p119THE  LETTER from the hypnotist was mimeographed , and came to Maria in care of the studio that had released Angel Beach . " YOUR WORRIES MAY DATE FROM WHEN YOU WERE A BABY , " the letter began , and then , after a space , were the words " IN YOUR MOTHER 'S WOMB . " Maria read the letter very carefully . The hypnotist had found that many people could be regressed not only to infancy but to the very instant of their conception . The hypnotist would receive a few interested clients in the privacy of his Silverlake home . With a sense that she was about to confirm a nightmare , Maria telephoned the number he gave.  | " YOU 'VE BEEN BRUSHING IT wet , " thehairdresser said , lifting a strand of Maria 's hair and letting it drop with distaste . " I guess so . " Maria could never keep up her end of the dialogue with hairdressers . " I told you before , you split the ends , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attention to a thin girl who had just come up and kissed the back of his neck . " How are you , babe . " " I had an operation . " " No kidding . " " Pelvic abscess . " The girl loosened her wrapper and absently stroked her collarbone . " All through my tubes . " " Listen , I hear his new act is just lying there , " the hairdresser said . " Bibi Markel was just over there and she heard they were trying to transfer his contract to the lounge . " " Macht nicht to me , " the girl said . " Except maybep121I 'll have to go to court for the separate maintenance . " She slipped one big roller away from her scalp and touched the hair to see if it was dry . " Listen , " she said suddenly . " Finish her and then comb me out and come up for a drink on your way home . " " Where you living now . " " Off Coldwater , same place . O.K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Please . Promise . " He ignored her , and handed Maria a mirror . " You want to use a drier , Maria honey ? " But Maria only shook her head and took the fifteen dollars from her bag and walked very fast toward the dressing room . " Maybe I can get Sandy to come up . " Even from the dressing room Maria could hear the girl wheedling , the thin beautiful girl with the pelvic abscess and the separate maintenance and her hair all done and no-body to drink with . She fixed her attention on the mounds of used wrappers and damp towels and tried not to hear whatever it was the girl would say next . The girl was a presentiment of something . " Listen , " the girl said then . " Maybe I can get Bibi Markel. "  |p122SHE  HAD WATCHED THEM in supermarketsand she knew the signs . At seven o'clock on a Saturday evening they would be standing in the checkout line reading the horoscope in Harper 's Bazaar and in their carts would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Sunday morning paper , the early edition with the comics wrapped outside . They would be very pretty some of the time , their skirts the right length and their sunglasses the right tint and maybe only a little vulnerable tightness around the mouth , but there they were , one lamb chop and some cat food and the morning paper . To avoid giving off the signs , Maria shopped always for a household , gallons of grapefruit juice , quarts of green chile salsa , dried lentils and alphabet noodles , rigatoni and canned yams , twenty-pound boxes of laundry detergent . She knew all the indices to the idle lonely , never bought a small tube of toothpaste , never dropped a magazine in her shopping cart . The housep123in Beverly Hills overflowed with sugar , corn-muffin mix , frozen roasts and Spanish onions . Maria ate cottage cheese.  | " You 're lying in the water , " the hypno-tist said . " You 're lying in water and it 's warm and you hear your mother 's voice . " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypnotist stood up . He always seemed cold and he was always sipping Pernod and water and his house was dusty and cluttered with torn newspaper clippings and stained file folders . " What do you hear , " he said finally . " What do you hear and see in your mind right now . What are you doing . " " I 'm driving over here , " Maria said . " I 'm driving Sunset and I 'm staying in the left lande because I can see new Havana Ballroom and I 'm going to turn left at the New Havana Ballroom . That 's what I 'm doing.  |p125THERE  WAS AT FIRST that spring anoccasional faggot who would take her to parties . Never a famous faggot , never one of those committed months in advance to escorting the estranged wives of important directors , but a third-string faggot . At first she was even considered a modest asset by several of them : they liked her not only because she would listen to late-night monologues about how suicidal they felt but because the years she spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-occupied them . She understood , for example , about shoes , and could always distinguish among the right bracelet and the amusing impersonation of the right bracelet and the bracelet that was merely a witless copy . Still , there remained some fatal lack of conviction in her performance , some instant of flushed inattention that would provoke them finally to a defensive condescension . Eventually they would raise their eye-brows helplessly at one another when they were withp126her , and be oversolicitous . " Darling , " they would say , " have another drink . " And she would . She was drinking a good deal in the evenings now because when she drank she did not dream . " This way to the gas , ladies and gentlemen , " a loudspeaker kept repeating in her dreams now , and she would be checking off names as the children filed past her , the little children in the green antechamber , she would be collecting their lockets and baby rings in a fine mesh basket . Her instructions were to whisper a few comforting words to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humane operation .   " LEONARD 'S IN NEW YORK for tendays , " Helene said as soon as Maria had hung up the telephone . " Did I tell you ? " " Three times , " Maria said . Leonard was Helene 's hairdresser . " I do n't mind if I 'm out of town , but if I 'm in town and Leonard 's not  --  who was that on the telephone ? " " Somebody 's leg man . " " What do you mean , somebody 's ? Whose ? " " Some columnist in the trades . I do n't know . " " What did he want ? " " He wanted to know if I was dating anyone in particular . He also wanted to know what I thought of Carter 's dating Susannah Wood . " Helene shrugged . " You knew that . " " I mean the word dating ? Does n't it strike you funny ? " " Not particularly . " Helene was studying her hairp128line in a small mirror . " If I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . frightened . " Maria said nothing . " I do n't suppose you understand that . " Maria watched the tears welling in Helene 's eyes . " Do n't , Helene , " she said finally . " Do n't be depressed . " " It 's shit , " Helene said . " It 's all shit . "  |p129EVERYTHING  MARIA could think to do in the town she had already done . She had checked into the motel , she had eaten a crab at the marina . At three in the afternoon she had been the only customer in the marina restaurant and it had been a dispiriting thirty or forty minutes , sliced beets staining the crab legs and a couple of waitresses arguing listlessly and a piped medley from Showboat . After that she had walked on the gravelly sand and she had driven aimlessly to Port Hueneme and back to Oxnard and now she sat on a bench in the downtown plaza , watching some boys in ragged Levi jackets and dark goggles who sat on the grass near her car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seemed to be passing a joint with furtive daring and every now and then they would look over at her and laugh . Because there was an oil fire somewhere to the north a yellow haze hung over the town , a stillness over the plaza . On the next bench an old man coughed soundlessly , spit phlegmp130that seemed to hang in the heavy air . A woman in a nurse 's uniform wheeled a bundled neuter figure silently past the hedges of dead camellias . Maria closed her eyes and imagined the woman coming toward her with a hypodermic needle . When she opened her eyes again the boys in the Levi jackets seemed to be rifling the glove compartments of parked cars . To hear the sound of her own footsteps Maria stood up and walked to the pay phone by the public toilet and asked the operator to try the number in Los Angeles again . She would tell him she could not wait . She would tell him she was sitting in a park watching some hoods rifling cars and she could not wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , maybe he would make her laugh . Maybe she would hear his voice and the silence would break , the woman in the nurse 's uniform would speak to her charge and the boys would get on their Harleys and roar off . But when the operator got the studio a voice said only that Mr. Goodwin could not be reached . When she hung up the phone the silence was absolute . The boys in the Levi jackets were all watching her now , because they were standing around her car , they knew it was her car , they had watched her lock it . They were trying various keys . They were watching to see what she would do . As if in slowed motion shep131began walking across the grass toward the car , and as she got closer they melted back , formed a semicircle . Abstractly she admired the way that she and they together were evolving a choreography , hearing the same silent beat . She kept her eyes steady , her pace even , and when she found herself unlocking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As she slid into the driver 's seat she stared directly at each of them , one by one , and in that instant of total complicity one of them leaned across the hood and raised a hand in recognition of what had passed between them , his palm out , inscribing an arc in the still air . Later those few minutes in the plaza in Oxnard would come back to Maria and she would replay them , change the scenario . It ended that way badly , or well , depending on what you wanted.  |p132SHE  SAT IN THE MOTEL ROOM near the Southern Pacific tracks in Oxnard and waited for Les Goodwin to call . He had said nine-thirty or ten but she had driven past the theater in the afternoon , the marquee read MAJOR STUDIO PREVIEW 8 p.m . An eight o'clock sneak meant eleven , by the time they counted the cards . When the telephone rang , it was quarter to eleven and he said it would be another half hour . Maria took two Librium , washed her face al-though she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to erase any sign of herself . When there was nothing left to straighten she walked across the parking lot to the ice machine by the swimming pool and filled a paper bucket with ice . After she had arranged the bucket on a tray with two water glasses and a bottle of whisky she sat on the bed and turned the pages of the Oxnard  --  Port Hueneme telephone book . There were fourteen Wyeths listed , twenty-three Langs and twenty Goodwins.  |p133When  she finally opened the door for him she avoided his eyes , buried her face against his shirt . They were both shaking . He poured Scotch into the two glasses without ice and they sat down on the bed and still they had not looked at each other . " I almost did n't come , " he said then . " I called the house this afternoon , I was going to tell you I was n't coming up , they 'd canceled the preview . " " I know . " " You know . " " I was going to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You came up this afternoon ? " " I did n't have anything in particular to do in town , " she said , and then she looked at him . " I came up this afternoon because I was afraid you 'd call me up and tell me they 'd canceled the preview . " " This is a lousy place , " he said finally . " Let 's get out of here . " They drove up the coast until they were exhausted enough to sleep , and then they did sleep , wrapped together like children in a room by the sea in Morro Bay . " I 've got until tomorrow , we can go on up the coast , " he said the next morning . " We could go up to Big Sur . "  | " We could have a picnic , we could stay at the Lodge . " " We could buy a sleeping bag and sleep on the beach . " " I 've got to call Felicia , " he said then . " Wait until I 'm dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then left the motel room and walked down to the water . A culvert had washed out and the equipment brought in to lift it was mired in the sandy mud . Bare-legged and bare-armed , shivering in her cotton jersey dress , she stood for a long while watching them try to free the equipment . When she got back to the motel he was dressed , sitting on the unmade bed . " Do n't cry , " he said . " There 's no point . " " No point in what . " " No point in our doing any of those things . " He looked at her for a long while . " Later , " he said then . " I 'm sorry . " " It 's all right . " On the drive back they told each other that it had been the wrong time , the wrong place , that it was bad because he had lied to arrange it , that it would be all right another time , idyllic later . He mentioned the strain he had been under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She mentioned that she was getting the curse . They mentioned Kate , Carter , Felicia , the weather , Oxnard , his dislike of motel rooms , her fear of subterfuge . They mentioned everything but one thing : that she had left the point in a bedroom in Encino.  |p136MARIA  MADE A LIST of things she would never do . She would never : walk through the Sands or Caesar 's alone after midnight . She would never : ball at a party , do S-M unless she wanted to , borrow furs from Abe Lipsey , deal . She would never : carry a Yorkshire in Beverly Hills.  | " I 'LL BE AWAY a few weeks , " Carter said . " I came by because I 'll be away , I wanted to tell you  --  you know the picture 's entered at Cannes . " " I read that . " " You seen it yet ? " " How would I have seen it , it 's not in release , I mean is it ? " " Maria , for Christ 's fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month , you know that  --  oh shit . " " I did n't mean to be that way , " she said after a while . " You never mean to be any way . " It was always that way when he came by but some-times later , after he had left , the spectre of his joyless face would reach her , talk about heart 's needle , would flash across her hapless consciousness all the images of the family they might have been : Carter throwing a clear plastic ball filled with confetti , Kate missing thep138ball . Kate crying . Carter swinging Kate by her wrists . The spray from the sprinklers and the clear plastic ball with the confetti falling inside and Kate 's fat arms stretched up again for the catch she would always miss . Freeze frame . Kate fevered , Carter sponging her back while Maria called the pediatrician . Kate 's birth-day , Kate laughing , Carter blowing out the candle . The images would flash at Maria like slides in a dark room . On film they might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Carter the night before he left for Cannes . She had put off calling until almost midnight but had finally made herself do it . " The picture 's fine . I went to a screening , it 's a beautiful picture . " There was a silence . " If you need to reach me call BZ , " he said then . " He 'll know where I am . " " The picture . I really liked it . " " Fine . Thanks . " " What 's the matter . " " Just forget it , Maria . " His voice was tired . " There has n't been a print in Los Angeles all week . " During the next few weeks Maria bought Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter and studied them dutifully for small mentions of Carter . After Cannes he seemed to be in London , and after that in Paris again , where he appeared on television discussing the auteur principle.  | " Carter 's staying another week in Paris , I guess you know , " Helene said on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Helene paused only slightly . " BZ called them last night , apparently she has to stay over to talk about a picture . " " I suppose he was pleased about Cannes . " " He did n't talk about it much but she said  --  " " You think you 're telling me something , Helene , you 're missing the point . " Helene giggled . " Whose point . " That afternoon Maria had a small accident with the Corvette , received a call from the bank about her over-drawn account , and learned from the drugstore that the doctor would no longer renew her barbiturate prescriptions . In a way she was relieved.  |p140MARIA  STOOD IN THE SUN on the Westernstreet and waited for the young agent from Freddy Chaikin 's office to back his Volkswagen past the Writers ' Building to where she was . It was hot and no one had left her name at the gate and there was a spot on her skirt and she was annoyed because of the trouble at the gate and because Freddy Chaikin had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a director who wanted her for a bike picture and the least he could have done was show up himself . She did not even want to do another bike picture . " Looks like we missed him , " the young agent said . He did not turn the motor off . " How do you mean , we missed him . " " I mean I guess he 's already left for lunch . " The agent looked uncomfortably past Maria . " Actually it was n't two hundred percent confirmed , he told Freddy he might be tied up with the girl they 're looking at for the lead . "  |p141Maria  pushed her hair back and watched the agent avoid her eyes . " What exactly did they want me for , " she said finally . " The high-school teacher , Freddy must 've told you that . You read the script , that 's the part , the lead 's just any teeny fluff . I mean the teacher , she . . . she carries the picture . " " The teacher , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " His girlfriend . " " I have to go now , " Maria said , and without waiting for him to speak she turned and began walking toward the gate . Once in her car she drove as far as Romaine and then pulled over , put her head on the steering wheel and cried as she had not cried since she was a child , cried out loud . She cried because she was humiliated and she cried for her mother and she cried for Kate and she cried because something had just come through to her , there in the sun on the Western street : she had deliberately not counted the months but she must have been counting them unawares , must have been keeping a relentless count some-where , because this was the day , the day the baby would have been born.  | " I WANT TO TELL YOU right now I 'm never going to do anything again , " Ivan Costello had said in the beginning . " If you want to live that way , O.K. There 's not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any eating breakfast together and there 's not going to be any getting married and there 's not going to be any baby makes three . And if you make any money , I 'll spend it . " She had said she wanted to live that way . " What if I did , " she had said a long time later . " Did what . " " Got pregnant . Then at least I 'd have a baby . " " No you would n't , " he had said.  | " MAYBE NEXT TIME , " the hypnotist said . " Next week . " " I 'm not coming next week . " Maria did not look at him . " I ca n't come any more . " The hypnotist watched her as she opened her bag , found her car keys , dropped them beneath a sofa cushion and groped for them . The room was over-heated but he was wearing two faded cardigan sweaters and standing over a furnace vent . " It does n't prove anything , you know , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could n't open enough doors to get back . Your failure . It does n't prove anything at all . " " I have to leave . " He shrugged . As she stood up he was pouring water into a cheese glass coated with Pernod , swirling the mixture into a milky fluid . " Some people resist , " he said . " Some people do n't want to know . "  |p144Maria  drove down to the New Havana Ballroom on Sunset and , trembling , made a telephone call . " I need help , " she said . " Ivan , I need help bad . "  | " WHO 'S YOUR FRIEND , " Ivan Costello said . " Who loves you . " It was five o'clock in Los Angeles and eight in New York and he was drunk . She should have known better than to call him . She did not even like him . She could not bring herself to give the answer he expected , could not pick up the old litany , could not say you do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the matter with you . " " I just wanted to talk to you . " " You just wanted . . . " He paused , and she knew that he was turning on her . " To talk to me . " She said nothing . The bar in the New Havana was empty and smelled of disinfectant and the bartender was watching her distrustfully . " You mean you want to talk to me direct , you do n't want me to make an appointment ? Go through your agent ? " " All right . I get it . "  | " You 're feeling good enough to talk to me ? You are n't sick ? You are n't asleep ? You are n't out of town ? You are n't just fucking unavailable ? " " Ivan  --  " " Ivan ' shit . " " All right , " she said . " O.K. " " You want to know what I think of your life ? " " No , " she said , but he was already spitting into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service and Maria returned none of them . She did call Larry Kulik.  |p147MARIA  SAT ON A COUCH in the ladies ' room of the Flamingo with the attendant and a Cuban who was killing the hour between her ten o'clock and midnight dates and she knew that she could not go back out to the crap tables . " Like a cemetery , " the Cuban said . The attendant shrugged . " Every place the same . " " Not the Sands , I could hardly get through the Sands tonight . " " So do business at the Sands . " " Fucking negrita , " the Cuban said without rancor , and looked at Maria appraisingly . " You sick ? You need something ? " " I 'm all right , " Maria said . " Thank you . " She could not go back to the tables because Benny Austin was out there . Somehow she had never expected to see Benny Austin again : in her mind he was always in her father 's pickup , or standing with her mother and father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was something wrong with running into Benny Austin in the Flamingo . " Maria ? " he had called when he saw her . " Maria ? That you ? " He was shorter than she remembered him , shorter and more frail , almost bald , a failed man wearing a lariat tie clasp . " Jesus if you are n't the picture of Francine , " he kept saying . " Jesus but you 're her daughter . " He had asked her if she was married . He had shrugged and said that the course of true love never was a straight flush . He had ordered Cuba Libres for the two of them and he had talked about as it was and finally she had run . He would be waiting there still , trying to run up a stake for her with the chips she had left , that was like Benny , he would play her chips until they were gone and then he would play his own for her , waiting , holding the Cuba Libre until the ice was gone . Benny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Flamingo five-to-one that Harry and Francine Wyeth 's daughter would not run out on him , and five-to-one were the best odds Benny would lay on the sun rising . When Maria heard herself being paged she asked the Cuban for a match and gave no sign that she was Maria Wyeth . Maybe it was Benny paging her but having people paged was not much Benny 's style , more likely it was Larry Kulik . She smoked a cigarette and tried not to think about Benny hearing her namep149and looking around , adjusting his tie clasp and holding his bets , wondering who was calling Harry and Francine 's girl , waiting for her to reappear and intro-duce her friend , make it an evening . After Maria had finished the cigarette she took a back elevator up to Larry Kulik 's suite.  | " TELL HIM TO COME UP , " Larry Kuliksaid , handing her a drink while she waited for the operator to page Benny Austin . In the other room there were some of Larry Kulik 's well-manicured friends and a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ladies ' room . The Cuban had given her no sign of recognition . " Guys like that interest me , you 'd be surprised . " " I would n't be surprised at all . Tell that spic to turn the music down . " She waited . " Benny ? " She raised her voice over the clatter of the slot machines downstairs . " Benny , I got sick , I  --  " " Christ , Maria , why did n't you say something , I got a good friend , house doctor at the Mint . " " I just need some rest . Benny ? Can you hear , me ? You come see me the next time you 're in Los Angeles , all right ? Promise ? " " Sure , honey , swell . I 'd like that . "  |p151Maria  felt a rush of shame . Benny Austin never came to Los Angeles . " Listen , " she said suddenly . " You remember the last time you saw me ? Remember ? You and Mother and Daddy put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ate spare ribs at the house ? Remember ? " " Sure , honey , you bet . Next time I 'm over we 'll paint the town . " For a long while Maria lay on the bed and stared at a large oil painting of a harlequin . In a sense the day they ate spare ribs and drove to McCarran had ceased to exist , had never happened at all : she was the only one left who remembered it . Maria followed this thought for as far as it would go , which was not very far , and then she got up and opened the door . A second-string comedian had come in with some of his entourage , and a girl Maria had seen drinking in the lounge . " New talent , " the comedian said , looking at Maria . " She 's not talent , " Larry Kulik said . At dawn she woke Larry Kulik and told him she was taking the seven o'clock flight out . " Stick around , " he said . " What is it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something ? So I crapped out on you last night . So what . " " That 's not it . " " Suit yourself , " Larry Kulik said.  |p152AT  A PARTY IN MAY he left not with the choreographer who had brought her but with an actor she had never before met . They had danced together and shared a joint in the garden and he told her that they would leave and go up to his house . He had some friends there . Maria was wearing the silver vinyl dress she had bought to make her feel better and her hair was loose and her feet were bare and driving up through the canyon in the actor ' ' Ferrari she felt good for the first time in a long while The actor had a tape in the car that played Midnight Hour over and over again and when they got to his house he introduced her to the eight or ten people in the living room as Myra . " This is Myra , " he said . " I just found her some place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room and she smoked one and then went to find a Coca-Cola . In the kitchen she danced by herself and felt a little dizzy but still good . She liked his not knowing her . She did not much like him but she liked his not knowing her.  | " Let 's fuck , " the actor said from the doorway . " You mean right here . " " Not here , in the bed . " He seemed annoyed . She shook her head . " Then do it bare , " he said . " Do it with the Coke bottle . " When they finally did it they were on the bed and at the moment bar re he came he reached under the pillow and pulled out an amyl nitrite popper and broke it under his nose , breathed in rapidly , and closed his eyes . " Do n't move , " he said . " I said do n't move . " Maria did not move . " Terrific , " he said then . His eyes were still closed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , " he said . " With your tongue . " After he had gone to sleep she got dressed very quietly and walked out of the house . She was in the driveway before she remembered that she had no car . The keys were in his Ferrari and she took it , hesitating when she came out to the main canyon road , turning then not toward Beverly Hills but toward the Valley , and the freeway . It was dawn before she reached Vegas and , because she stopped in Vegas to buy cigarettes , eight o'clock before she reached Tonopah . She was not sure what she had meant to do in Tonopah . There was something about seeing her mother 's andp154father 's graves , but her mother and father were not buried in Tonopah . They were buried in Silver Wells , or what had been Silver Wells . In any case she was stopped for speeding outside Tonopah and when the highway patrolman saw the silver dress and the bare feet and the Ferrari registered to someone else , he checked California to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had.  |p155THEY  LET HER make one call , and she called Freddy Chaikin . It was not as easy for Freddy to fix as it might have been , because when they vacuumed the car they picked up marijuana , but still , by sundown , she was flying back across the desert with Freddy in a Lear he had borrowed from a client . Freddy had done everything . Freddy had driven out to the Malibu ranch where the actor was shooting a Western and had told the actor whom to call to retract the complaint . Freddy had waited there while the actor did it . Freddy had gotten in touch with one of the big savings-and-loan Democrats , who got in touch with someone in Nevada and the marijuana came off the report . And now as the jet gained altitude Freddy was handing Maria a drink . She was still wearing the silver dress and she was still barefoot and her face was streaked with dust and when she tasted the drink it all came up , all the pills and the not eating and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about thep156actor and the way she had felt when the matron had her finger up her looking for drugs , all that came up in a trail of mucous on the floor of the Lear that Freddy had borrowed in his day-long effort to protect Carter . Freddy watched her clean it up . " I do n't understand girls like you , " he said finally . She clutched a towel to her mouth but the convulsion passed . " I mean there 's something in your behavior , Maria , I would almost go so far as to call it . . . " Freddy paused , and lit a cigarillo with his gold Cartier lighter . When he spoke again he measured each word . " Al-most go so far as to call it a very self-destructive personality structure . " Maria closed her eyes . " You know what , Freddy ? " " What . " " I 'd almost go so far as to call you  --  " Freddy Chaikin flicked the gold lighter closed and smiled at her . Maria took his hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rather from his business manager . Maria knew that the business manager had sent them be-cause his name was on the delivery slip . " Hey , babe , " the actor said when he called . " You did n't have to call out the tactical nukes . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " I 'm talking about Freddy Chaikin , he shows up at ten o'clock in the morning and tries to lay it on me I 'll never be in a package with any of his clients again . I mean I was shooting . " " I was in jail . " " Just hold on , cunt , " the actor said , his voice rising . " You never told me who you were . " " I hear you had a rather baroque morning-after , " Helene said . Helene came to the house all the time now . Some-times Maria would pretend no one was home butp158today Helene had walked in without ringing and come directly upstairs . She sat on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How exactly did you hear that , " Maria said finally . She had taken so many showers during the past several hours that her skin felt damp between the sheets , but the smell of Helene 's cigarette and perfume was making her feel dirty again . " I mean what exactly did you hear . " " Just that . Carter called from New York and told BZ . " " I have n't even talked to Carter . " " Freddy did , naturally . " Helene picked up Maria 's lipstick and studied the effect of the color on the back of her wrist . " I mean Freddy is seriously worried about you , Carter is seriously worried about you , 13Z and I are  --  " " I 'm all right . " " Of course . You 're really on top of it . I mean for example there 's nothing at all peculiar about hiding here under the covers shaking at three o'clock in the afternoon . Nothing at all off about leaving a party with Johnny Waters and ending up in jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong there . " " I 've got a headache . I 'm in bed because my head aches. "  | " I 'll get a Darvon . " Maria pulled the sheet up to her chin . " I 'm just trying to help you , Maria . " " I 'll be all right . " Maria sat up and touched Helene 's arm . " Really , Helene . I promise . " " All right , never mind , I 'm leaving . " Helene stood up and smoothed the bed where she had been sitting and then stared at herself for a long while in the mirror on the dressing-room door . " What kind of fuck is Johnny Waters ? " she asked finally . During the next week Freddy Chaikin made a number of telephone calls to various television producers asking , " as a personal favor to Carter , " that Maria be considered for parts , even day work . " Anything to take her mind off herself , " Freddy said to each of them . " What we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about these calls because Helene told her about them . " I saw a picture of you today , " Helene said . " Where . " Every time she went downstairs Helene seemed to be there . " You know that employment agency on Beverly ? The one where you got the Guatemalan who stole your diaphragm ? " " I do n't know . " Maria did not want to think aboutp160the Guatemalan who had taken her diaphragm . " You do too know . They 've got all those studio stills on the wall ? Satisfied customers ? Anyway , now they 've got a picture of you , signed Good luck , Maria Wyeth . ' " " Well , fine , " Maria said . " I did n't think you 'd be in town again today . " Helene looked at her and giggled . " BZ sent me , " she said finally . " BZ wants me to get you to spend a few weeks at the beach . " Maria said nothing . " You looked years younger in this picture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good luck , Maria Wyeth . ' " " Dear Maria , " the note read . ' Well do n't know when I 'll get over to LA but wanted to give you a telephone where you can call if you are in Nevada again or need help . Have some things of your Dad 's I want to give you , also because you are like my own daughter there will be a little windfall from this quarter some day , not too soon let 's hope . Have all your Dad 's papers plus mineral certificates , no action now ' but quien sabe , once knew a man who thought his rights were worthless and he was sitting on pitchblende so loaded with U. the counters went haywire . Call me at number below and ask for Benny , phone belongs to lady nextp161door , also she cooks for me sometimes . Not like your Mom . Ha ha . Your Friend Benny C. Austin . " Maria was listening to someone talk and every now and then she would hear herself making what she thought was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the music and wondering where her drink was when suddenly Felicia Good-win took her arm . " We 're leaving now , Maria . We 'll drop you . " " I have my car , thanks , I 'm fine . " " Les ? " Felicia was talking over her shoulder . " I need you . " Maria picked up someone else 's drink and smiled past Felicia at Les . " Crowd scene , " she said . " Principals emerge . " " You come with Felicia and me , Maria . I 'll get your car tomorrow . " Maria put the glass down and looked at him for a long while . " I did n't come with you , " she said very clearly then . " Thank Christ . " After that she was crying , and Helene was holding her arm while BZ got her coat . " I thought it merited a mention , " Felicia Goodwin whispered . " Let it go , " Helene said . Grateful , Maria put herp162head on Helene 's shoulder and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick on Helene 's lap , and told BZ he was a degenerate . When she woke before dawn in Helene 's bedroom she saw that someone had undressed and bathed and creamed her body . At first she thought she was alone in the room but then she saw BZ and Helene , sprawled together on a chaise . She had only the faintest ugly memory of what had brought BZ and Helene together , and to erase it from her mind she fixed her imagination on a needle dripping sodium pentathol into her arm and began counting backward from one hundred . When that failed she imagined herself driving , conceived audacious lane changes , strategic shifts of gear , the Hollywood to the San Bernardino and straight on out , past Barstow , past Baker , driving straight on into the hard white empty core of the world . She slept and did not dream.  | " I GUESS I DRANK too much last night , " Maria said carefully . " Do n't talk about it . " Helene was staring out the kitchen window , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for warmth . Her eyes were puffy and there was a bruise on her left cheekbone and her voice was soft and vague . " I do n't want to talk about it . The wind makes me feel bad . " " I just do n't remember getting here . " Maria had a flash image of BZ holding a belt and Helene laughing and she tried not to look at the bruise on Helene 's face . " That 's all I was saying . " Tears began falling down Helene 's face . " Do n't talk about it . And do n't say you do n't remember , either . " " I did n't  --  " Maria broke off . BZ was standing in the doorway . " I picked up your car . " BZ dropped the keys on the table and looked from Maria to Helene . " What havep164we here , " he said softly . " A little hangover terror ? A few second thoughts ? Is that about the size of it ? " Helene said nothing . " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinted glasses and for the first time Maria noticed a sag beneath his eyes . " If you ca n't deal with the morning , get out of the game . You 've been around a long time , you know what it is , it 's play-or-pay . " " Why do n't you go tell that to Carlotta , " Helene whispered . Maria closed her eyes at the instant BZ 's hand hit Helene 's face . " Stop it , " she screamed . BZ looked at Maria and laughed . " You were n't talking that way last night , " he said.  |p165FROM  A PAY PHONE On the highwayoutside Las Vegas she called the number Benny Austin had given her . The number was no longer in service . " You here all alone ? " the bellboy in the Sands asked , lingering after she had tipped him . " My husband 's meeting me here . " " Is that right ? Today ? Tomorrow ? " She looked at him . " Go away , " she said . The room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bedspread . Because her mother had once told her that purple rooms could send people into irreversible insanity she thought about asking for a different room , but the boy had unnerved her . She did not want to court further appraisal by asking anyone for anything . To hear some-one 's voice she looked in the telephone book and dialed a few prayers , then took three aspirin and tried not to think about BZ and Helene.  |p166In  the morning she went to the post office . Because it was Saturday the long corridors were deserted , and all but one of the grilled windows shuttered . Her sandals clattered against the marble and echoed as she walked . " Could you put this in Box 6i4 , " she said to the clerk at the one open window . 674 was the number on the envelope of Benny Austin 's letter . " Ca n't . " " Why not . " " It 's got to have postage . It 's got to go through the United States mail . " Sullenly he studied the nickel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grill and watched her stamp the note . " Now could you put it in 674 ? " " No , " he said , and threw the letter into a canvas bin . She found a bench near Box 674 and sat down . At noon the last window slammed shut . Maria drank from the water cooler , smoked cigarettes , read the F.B.I . posters . Wandering the country somewhere were Negro Females Armed with Lye , Caucasian Males posing as Baby Furniture Representatives , Radio Station Employees traveling out of Texas with wives and children and embezzled cash and Schemesp167for Getting Money and Never Delivering on Piece-work , an inchoate army on the move . Maria crossed the street to a diner with a view of the post office and tried to eat a grilled-cheese sandwich . On the third day a woman unlocked Box 674 . She was wearing a soiled white uniform and she had a hard sad face and Maria did not want to speak to her . " Excuse me , " she said finally . " I 'm trying to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman was holding Maria 's letter and her eyes darted from the letter to Maria . " Actually I sent that letter  --  " " And now you want it back . " " No . Not at all . I want you to give it to Benny Austin and tell  --  " " I do n't know any Benny person . And I think it 's pretty funny this letter addressed to some Benny per-son in my box and then right off you sashay up and start dropping the same name , either you 've been tampering in my box , a federal offense , or you 're trying some other mickey mouse and believe me you 've got the wrong party . " Maria backed away . The woman 's face was white and twisted and she was following Maria , her voice rising . " You 're Luanne 's foster mother , is exactly whop168you are , and you 're nosing around Vegas because you heard about the injury settlement , well just you forget it . I said forget it . "  | " WHAT DO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying . She was trying to eat an egg roll in the Sands and the two men and the girl had been watching her ever since she sat down . " About what , " the girl said . " That . " The girl shrugged . " Maybe . " The other man said something that Maria did not hear and when she looked up again the girl was still watching her . " Thirty-six , " the girl said . " But a good thirty-six . " For the rest of the time Maria was in Las Vegas she wore dark glasses . She did not decide to stay in Vegas : she only failed to leave . She spoke to no one . She did not gamble . She neither swam nor lay in the sun . She was there on some business but she could not seem to put her finger on what that business was . All day , most of every night , she walked and she drove . Two orp170three times a day she walked in and out of all the hotels on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical flash of walking in and out of places , the temperature shock , the hot wind blowing outside , the heavy frigid air inside . She thought about nothing . Her mind was a blank tape , imprinted daily with snatches of things overheard , fragments of dealers ' patter , the beginnings of jokes and odd lines of song lyrics . When she finally lay down nights in the purple room she would play back the day 's tape , a girl singing into a microphone and a fat man dropping a glass , cards fanned on a table and a dealer 's rake in closeup and a woman in slacks crying and the opaque blue eyes of the guard at some baccarat table . A child in the harsh light of a crosswalk on the Strip . A sign on Fremont Street . A light blinking . In her half sleep the point was ten , the jackpot was on eighteen , the only man that could ever reach her was the son of a preacher man , someone was down sixty , someone was up , Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spinning wheel spin . By the end of a week she was thinking constantly about where her body stopped and the air began , about the exact point in space and time that was the difference between Maria and other . She had the sense that if she could get that in her mind and hold it forp171even one micro-second she would have what she had come to get . As if she had fever , her skin burned and crackled with a pinpoint sensitivity . She could feel smoke against her skin . She could feel voice waves . She was beginning to feel color , light intensities , and she imagined that she could be put blindfolded in front of the signs at the Thunderbird and the Flamingo and know which was which . " Maria , " she felt someone whisper one night , but when she turned there was nobody . She began to feel the pressure of Hoover Dam , there on the desert , began to feel the pressure and pull of the water . When the pressure got great enough she drove out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through her own body . All day she was faint with vertigo , sunk in a world where great power grids converged , throbbing lines plunged finally into the shallow canyon below the dam 's face , elevators like coffins dropped into the bowels of the earth itself . With a guide and a handful of children Maria walked through the chambers , stared at the turbines in the vast glittering gallery , at the deep still water with the hidden intakes sucking all the while , even as she watched ; clung to the railings , leaned out , stood finally on a platform over the pipe that carried the river beneath the dam . The platform quivered . Herp172ears roared . She wanted to stay in the dam , lie on the great pipe itself , but reticence saved her from asking . " Just how long have you been here now , " Freddy Chaikin asked when she ran into him in Caesar 's . " You planning on making a year of it ? Or what ? " " Two weeks , Freddy . I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two weeks in Vegas . " " I like the good talk . " " I 'm over for Lenny 's opening , you coming ? " She tried to think who Lenny was . " I 'm not seeing too many people , actually . " " That 's not healthy , you 're morbid enough . Do me a favor , come on over after . Lenny 's suite . A lot of people you know . " " I 'll see . " " Maria . A personal favor . You owe me one , O.K. ? 1202 , that 's in the new building . " " Could you tell me how to find 1202 , " she asked the man at the desk in the hotel . When she had called up from the lobby there was too much noise to under-stand Freddy 's directions . She waited . The desk clerk did not look up . " I 'm looking for 1202. "  |p173He  lifted his eyes only slightly . " No , " he said . " You do n't understand . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do understand , honey . I understand very well . No dice . If they want you up there they 'd tell you how to get there . Freelance some place else . " When she got back to the Sands she looked at her-self in the mirror for a long while , then called room service and asked for a double bourbon . When the boy came he looked at her . " Pretty early still , " he said . She poured a few drops of bourbon over the ice and watched it coat the glass . It seemed to her now that she had been driving all week toward precisely this instant . " I do n't know anyone , " she heard herself saying . " Lots of guys around . " " I do n't know any . " " I could make an introduction . " She looked at him . " All right , " she said . " In an hour . " After he left she waited five minutes and then walked into the corridor and out onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deep into the desert , driving west at eighty miles an hour.  |p174Early  in the morning she called Freddy Chaikin from Los Angeles and asked him to pay her bill and bring back her clothes . " What happened . " Maria did not answer . " I do n't even want to know , " Freddy Chaikin said . " Do n't forget my dark glasses , " Maria said.  | " WHAT DO YOU WEIGH NOW ? Abouteighty-two ? " Maria opened her eyes . The voice was Carter 's but for an instant in the bright afternoon light on the sun deck she could not make out his features . " I did n't know you 'd be here today , " she said finally . " Helene told me you were coming out . " " Helene is a veritable Celebrity Register . " " Just calm down . I want to talk about something . " He looked back toward the house . BZ was on the telephone in the living room . " Let 's walk down the beach . " " We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can talk here . " He kicked aside her sandals and sat down . " I 've been trying to get hold of you for two weeks . " " I know it . " " No games , Maria , O.K. ? I came all the way outp176here , I walked out of a meeting , a meeting with Carl Kastner , just to  --  " She reached for his hand and put it over his mouth . She was absurdly touched by the detail about Carl Kastner : Carter was still Carter . " I have n't wanted to see you because I did n't feel good . That 's all . Talk to me . " Carter took out a cigarette , crumpled the package , then smoothed out the package and replaced the cigarette . " You know I 'm starting the new picture on the desert in ten days , " he said finally . " You knew about that . " He was not looking at her . " Which means this : it means  --  " " It means , " she prompted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you out there . " Maria said nothing . " We could do it . " " Why should we . " Carter looked uncomfortable . " It just might be better . " " You mean you do n't think I can take care of myself . " " No . " Carter stood up . " I do not . I do not think you can take care of yourself . Things I 've been hearing , things I  --  " " What things . "  | " You know goddamn fucking well what things . " He stood over Maria with his hand frozen in air . He had been about to hit her . " Go ahead , " she said . " You ca n't hurt me . " " Fantastic day , " a clear voice said , and Carter dropped his arm . A girl with long tangled hair and a short chemise nightgown stood in the doorway , yawning and shaking out her hair . " You suppose there 's any coffee ? " The girl examined what seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . " I mean I could die for some . " " I do n't know , " Maria said . " BZ honey ? " the girl called . " Is there coffee made ? " " No , " BZ said from the house . " There is no coffee . There is not any coffee . " " Honey , there must be instant , " the girl drawled . From the doorway she smiled back at Carter . " I 'm Jeanelle , " she said . " Who the fuck was that , " Carter said after a moment . Maria sat huddled in a towel . " I guess that 's Jeanelle . " " Who 's she for ? " " How should I know . " Carter looked at her . " Stop it , " he said finally . " Stop crying . Baby , listen . Stop . " " I do n't know what to do . "  | " You 're going to come to the desert with me . " " Just as a point of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Carter pulled her to her feet and kissed her . She stood without moving and after a while he let his arms drop . " What 's the matter now , " he said . " Nothing . " " It 's all gone with you , " he said . " It used to be there but it 's gone . " " Listen , " she said as if by rote . " I love you . " " You know what I wish it was tonight ? " the girl in the nightgown was saying when Maria came inside at four o'clock . " I wish it was New Year 's Eve . Most people think New Year 's Eve is a bore but I love it . " Helene lay on a couch staring at the ceiling . " You do , " she said . " Helene , " BZ said . " Maria 's going to the desert with us , is n't that interesting ? " BZ smiled at Maria . " I said Maria 's going to the desert , Helene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also love Christmas , " the girl said . " Jeanelle , " BZ said , " there 's some coke in the bed-room if you want to go get it . Some Merck . " " You 've been holding out , " Jeanelle said.  |p179BZ  watched the girl leave and then turned to Helene . " Get her out of here , " he said . Helene stared at him . " You started it , " she whispered.  | " YOU TOLD ME YOU 'D COME , " Cartersaid . " What for . " " I want you out there . " " It 's all gone , you said so yourself . " " All right , " Carter said . " Stay here and kill yourself . Something interesting like that . " Carter and BZ and Helene left for the desert . Maria found a doctor who would give her barbiturates again , and in the evenings she drove . " Who is it , " she whispered when she saw the lighted cigar in the dark living room . She had just let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now she leaned against it . " I said who is it . " The cigar moved . She closed her eyes . " Who do you think it is , " Ivan Costello said . " Maybe if you 'd call your answering service once in a while you 'd know when I was in town . " " What are you doing in my house . " " Come here . "  |p181She  turned on a light . " I said come here . " " No . " She could see that he was drunk . " I 'm going out . " " You are n't going anywhere . Do n't tell me no . " " No . " " All right , " he said . " Fight me . You 'll like it better that way anyway . " " What did you come here for , " she said at three or four in the morning . " What I got . " " What did you come here for , " she repeated . " I did n't come here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She said nothing . " Oh Christ , " he said . " Baby . I just came to make you remember . " " I ca n't remember . " " You remembered all right the last three hours . " She wrapped her arms around her bare shoulders . " That has n't got anything to do with me . " " Baby , it used to . " " Get out of here , " she said , and this time he did . In the morning he came again . She answered the door and went back to the couch where she had spent the rest of the night.  | " You do n't have to crack up over this , " he said . " You used to tell me you 'd do it for me until you died . You used to tell me  --  " " I used to tell you a lot of things . " She could stillsmell cigar smoke on his coat . " Leave me alone . " " I 'll leave you alone , " he said finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the couch , her eyes fixed on a bowl of dead roses , until four o'clock in the afternoon . At four she called Les Goodwin . " Something bad is going to happen to me , " she said . " Something bad is going to happen to all of us . " She could hear a typewriter in the background . " Imean it . Take me somewhere . " " You got a map of Peru ? " She said nothing . " That 's funny , Maria . That 's a line from Dark Passage . " " I know it . " " I had a fight with Felicia at lunch , I 've got to have a rewrite by tomorrow morning , I tell you something funny and you do n't laugh . " " When I want to hear something funny I 'll call you up again . " After she hung up she packed one bag and drove to the desert.  |p183When  I first married Carter and my name began appearing in columns I received mail from mad people . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call our day but I am burdened by the particular , the mad person who writes me a letter . It is no longer necessary for them even to write me . I know when someone is thinking of me . I learn to deal with this.  |p184THE  FIRST NIGHT in the still heat of the motel on the desert Carter turned away from Maria without speaking . The second night he got up and lay down on the bed in the other room . " What 's the matter , " Maria said , standing in the doorway in the dark . " It is n't any better . " " How do you know . " He said nothing . " I mean we did n't even try . " " You do n't want it . " " I do too . " " No , " he said . " You do n't . " Maria turned away . After that either she or Carter slept most nights in the other room . Some nights he said that he was tired , and some nights she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one said anything.  |p185In  the motel on the desert there were the two rooms , and a bathroom with a scaling metal shower stall , and a kitchenette with a few chipped dishes and an oilcloth-covered table . The air conditioner was broken , and through the open windows at night Maria could hear the jukebox from the bar across the road . On those nights when Carter could not sleep she lay perfectly still , her eyes closed , and waited for the moment when Carter would begin banging drawers , slamming doors , throwing a magazine across the bed where she lay . " You are n't waking me up , " she would say then . " I 'm not asleep . " " Well go to sleep , cunt . Go to sleep . Die . Fucking vegetable . " After that point he would sleep . She would not . By the time Maria woke at eight-thirty or nine in the morning it would already be o5  --  , Ilo  --  . Carter would be gone . For the first week Maria would wash in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bathroom and then drive out to the location , but on Monday of the second week Carter asked her to leave at lunchtime . " You 're making Susannah nervous , " he said . " It 's only her second picture , she 's worried about workingp186against Harrison , now you 're here  --  the point is , when an actress is working , there 's a certain  --  " " I 've worked once or twice . As an actress . " Carter avoided her eyes . " Maybe you and Helene could do something . " " Maybe we could see some plays . "  |p187THE  TOWN WAS ON A DRY RIVER bedbetween Death Valley and the Nevada line . Carter and BZ and Helene and Susannah Wood and Harrison Porter and most of the crew did not think of it as a town at all , but Maria did : it was larger than Silver Wells . Besides the motel , which was built of cinder block and operated by the wife of the sheriff 's deputy who patrolled the several hundred empty square miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a store which sold fresh meat and vegetables one day a week , a coffee shop , a Pentecostal church , and the bar , which served only beer . The bar was called The Rattler Room . There was a bathhouse in the town , an aluminum lean-to with a hot spring piped into a shallow concrete pool , and because of the hot baths the town attracted old people , believers in cures and the restorative power of desolation , eighty- and ninety-year-old couples who moved around the /desert in campers . There were ap188few dozen cinder-block houses in the town , two trailer courts , and , on the dirt road that was the main street , the office for an abandoned talc mine called the Queen of Sheba . The office was boarded up . Fifty miles north there was supposed to be a school , but Maria saw no children . " You ca n't call this a bad place , " the woman who ran the coffee shop told Maria . The fan was broken and the door open and the woman swatted listlessly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So have I , " Maria said . The woman shrugged . By late day the thermometer outside the motel office would register between 1200 and 1300 . The old people put aluminum foil in their trailer windows to reflect the heat . There were two trees in the town , two cottonwoods in the dry river bed , but one of them was dead.  | " YOU 'RE WITH THE MOVIE , " the boy atthe gate to the bathhouse said . He was about eighteen and he had fair pimpled skin and he wore a straw field hat to ward off the sun . " I guessed it yesterday . " " My husband is . " " You want to know how I guessed ? " " How , " Maria said . " Because I  --  " The boy studied his grimy finger-nails , as if no longer confident that the story illustrated a special acumen . " Because I personally know everybody from around here , " he said then , his eyes on his fingernails . " I mean I guessed right away you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come from around here . " Maria had spoken to no one else all day and she did not want to go into the bathhouse . She did not even know why she had come to the bathhouse . The bathhouse was full of old people , their loose skin pink from the water , sitting immobile on the edge of the pool nursing terminalp190cancers and wens and fear . " Actually I grew up in Silver Wells . " The boy looked at her impassively . " It 's across the line . I mean it 's on the test range . " " How about that , " the boy said , and then he leaned forward . " Your husband could n't be Harrison Porter , could he ? " " No , " Maria said , and then there seemed nothing more to say . " My room , my game . " Susannah Wood was sitting on her bed rolling cigarettes . " So turn up the sound . " Carter walked over to the bank of amplifiers and speakers and tape reels that Susannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to complain , " Maria repeated . " So what , " Susannah Wood said , and then she laughed . " Maria thinks we 're going to get arrested for possession . Maria thinks she 's already done that number in Nevada . " BZ looked up . " Turn it down , Carter . " Susannah Wood looked first at BZ and then at Maria . " Turn it up , Carter . " Maria stood up . It was midnight and she was wearing only an old bikini bathing suit and her hair clung damply to the back of her neck . " I do n't like any of you , " she said . " You are all making me sick . "  |p191Susannah  Wood laughed . " That 's not funny , Maria , " Helene said . " I mean sick . Physically sick . " Helene picked up a jar from the clutter on Susannah Wood 's dressing table and began smoothing cream into Maria 's shoulders . " If it 's not funny do n't say it , Maria . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was standing in the sun by the window brushing her hair . " What about her . " Maria brushed her hair another twenty strokes and went into the bathroom . " I mean did you really like fucking her . " " Not particularly . " " I wonder why not , " Maria said , and closed the bathroom door . " Where 's Carter , " Maria said when she came into BZ 's room . " We had some trouble with Harrison , Carter stayed out there to block a scene with him . You want a drink ? " " I guess so . They coming back here ? " " I said we 'd meet them in Vegas . Helene 's there already . "  | " Let 's not have dinner at the Riviera again . " " Harrison likes the Riviera . " Maria leaned back on Helene 's bed . " I 'm tired of Harrison . " She licked the inside of her glass and let the bourbon coat her tongue . " Some ice might help . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria closed her eyes . " And I 'm also tired of Susannah . " " What else are you tired of . " " I do n't know . " " You 're getting there , " BZ said . " Getting where . " " Where I am. "  |p193THEY  HAD BEEN on the desert three weeks when Susannah Wood got beaten up in a hotel room in Las Vegas . The unit publicity man got over there right away and Harrison Porter did a surprise Telethon for Southern Nevada Cystic Fibrosis and there was no mention of the incident . When Maria asked Carter what had happened he shrugged . " What difference does it make , " he said . Susannah Wood was not badly hurt but her face was bruised and she could not be photographed . Carter tried to shoot around her until the bruise was down enough to be masked by makeup but by the end of the fourth week they were running ten days over schedule . " Was it Harrison ? " " It 's over , she 's O.K. , drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for BZ 's car . BZ had been in town for meetings at the studio . " Susannah doesn'tp194take things quite as hard as you do . So just forget it . " " Was it you ? " Carter looked at her . " You think that way , get your ass out of here . " In silence Maria pulled out a suitcase and began taking her clothes from hangers . In silence Carter watched her . By the time BZ walked in , neither of them had spoken for ten minutes . " They 're on your back , " BZ said . He dropped his keys on the bed and took an ice tray from the refrigerator . " I thought they liked the dailies . " " Ralph likes them . Kramer says they 're very interesting . " " What does that mean . " " It means he wants to know why he 's not seeing a master , two , closeup and reaction on every shot . " " If I started covering myself on every shot we 'd bring it in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't mean that . It means he wants Ralph to hang himself with your rope . " BZ looked at Maria . " What 's she doing ? " " Ask her , " Carter said , and walked out . " Harrison did it , " BZ said . " What 's the problem . " " Carter was there . Was n't Carter there . " " It was just something that got a little out of hand . "  |p195Maria  sat down on the bed beside her suitcase . " Carter was there . " BZ looked at her for a long while and then laughed . " Of course Carter was there . He was there with Helene . " Maria said nothing . " If you 're pretending that it makes some difference to you , who anybody fucks and where and when and why , you 're faking yourself . " " It does make a difference to me . " " No , " BZ said . " It does n't . " Maria stared out the window into the dry wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you thought things like that mattered you 'd be gone already . You 're not going any-where . " " Why do n't you get me a drink , " Maria said finally . " What 's the matter , " Carter would ask when he saw her sitting in the dark at two or three in the morning staring out at the dry wash . " What do you want . I ca n't help you if you do n't tell me what you want . " " I do n't want anything . " " Tell me . " " I just told you . " " Fuck it then . Fuck it and fuck you . I 'm up to here with you . I 've had it . I 've had it with the circles underp196your eyes and the veins showing on your arms and the lines starting on your face and your fucking menopausal depression  --  " " Do n't say that word to me . " " Menopause . Old . You 're going to get old . " " You talk crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For Christ 's sake leave . " She would not take her eyes from the dry wash . " All right . " " Do n't , " he would say then . " Do n't . " " Why do you say those things . Why do you fight . " He would sit on the bed and put his head in his hands . " To find out if you 're alive . " In the heat some mornings she would wake with her eyes swollen and heavy and she would wonder if she had been crying.  |p197THEY  HAD TEN DAYS LEFT on thedesert . " Come out and watch me shoot today , " Carter said . " Later , " she said . " Maybe later . " Instead she sat in the motel office and studied the deputy sheriff 's framed photographs of highway accidents , imagined the moment of impact , tasted blood in her own dry mouth and searched the grain of the photographs with a magnifying glass for details not immediately apparent , the false teeth she knew must be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next day she borrowed a gun from a stunt man and drove out to the highway and shot at road signs . " That was edifying , " Carter said . " Why 'd you do it . " " I just did it . " " I want you to give that gun back to Farris . " " I already did . "  | " I do n't want any guns around here . " Maria looked at him . " Neither do I , " she said . " I ca n't take any more of that glazed expression , " Carter said . " I want you to wake up . I want you to come out with us today . " " Later , " Maria said . Instead she sat in the coffee shop and talked to the woman who ran it . " I close down now until four , " the woman said at two o'clock . " You 'll notice it says that on the door , hours 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. , 4 p.m. to  --  " " 6:30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it . " " What do you do between two and four . " " I go home , I usually  --  " The woman looked at Maria . " Look . You want to come out and see my place ? " The house was on the edge of the town , a trailer set on a concrete foundation . In place of a lawn there was a neat expanse of concrete , bordered by a split-rail fence , and beyond the fence lay a hundred miles of drifting sand . " I got the only fence around here . Lee built it before he took off . " " Lee . " Maria tried to remember in which of the woman 's stories Lee had figured . " Where 'd he go . "  | " Found himself a girl down to Barstow . I told you . Doreen Baker . " The sand was blowing through the rail fence onto the concrete , drifting around the posts , coating a straight-backed chair with pale film . Maria began to cry . " Honey , " the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her head and looked in her pocket for a Kleenex . The woman picked up a broom and began sweeping the sand into small piles , then edging the piles back to the fence . New sand blew in as she swept . " You ever made a decision ? " she said suddenly , letting the broom fall against the fence . " About what . " " I made my decision in ' 6i at a meeting in Barstow and I never shed one tear since . " " No , " Maria said . " I never did that . "  |p200When  I was ten years old my father taught me to assess quite rapidly the shifting probabilities on a craps layout : I could trace a layout in my sleep , the field here and the pass line all around , even money on Big Six or Eight , five-for-one on Any Seven . Always when I play back my father 's voice it is with a professional rasp , it goes as it lays , do n't do it the hard way . My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was one of the two lessons I learned as a child . The other was that overturning a rock was apt to reveal a rattle-snake . As lessons go those two seem to hold up , but not to apply.  |p201SHE  SAT IN THE MOTEL in the lateafternoon light looking out at the dry wash until its striations and shifting grains seemed to her a model of the earth and the moon . When BZ came in she did not look up . " Let me entertain you , " BZ said finally . Maria said nothing . " I could do my turn about Harrison calling one of the grips a vicious cunt . " " Please do n't smoke in here , BZ . " " Why not . " She got up and filled a glass with the warm water from the tap . " Because it 's a felony . " BZ laughed . Maria sat on the bed and drank the water and watched him roll a cigarette . " I said do n't , BZ . " " I get the feeling you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like talking to anybody . " " You do n't have to talk to me . " He lit the cigarettep202and handed it to her . " You want to know where Carter is ? " " Still shooting . " " Maria , it 's seven-thirty . " " I give up . " " He 's with Helene . " " I thought I did n't have to talk to you . " " You are n't paying attention , Maria . Carter is fucking Helene . I thought these things made a big difference to you . " Maria got up and walked back to the window . In the few minutes that BZ had been distracting her the light had changed on the dry wash . Tomorrow she would borrow a camera , and station it on the dry wash for twenty-four hours . " Tell me what matters , " BZ said . " Nothing , " Maria said.  |p203If  Carter and Helene want to think it happened because I was insane , I say let them . They have to lay it off on someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Helene also believe that people are either sane or insane . Just once , the week after the desert , when Helene came to see me in Neuropsychiatric , I tried to explain how wrong she had been when she screamed that last night about my carelessness , my selfishness , my insanity , as if it had somehow slipped my attention what BZ was doing . I told her : there was no carelessness involved . Helene , I said : I knew precisely what BZ was doing . But Helene only screamed again . Fuck it , I said to Helene . Fuck it , I said to them all , a radical surgeon of my own life . Never discuss . Cut . In that way I resemble the only man in Los Angeles County who does clean work.  | " WHAT DO YOU THINK about it , " Maria asked Carter . " About what . " " What I just told you . About the man at the trailer camp who told his wife he was going out for a walk in order to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria . Just give me the punch line . " " There is n't any punch line , the highway patrol just found him dead , bitten by a rattlesnake . " " I 'll say there is n't any punch line . " " Do you think he talked to God ? " Carter looked at her . " I mean do you think God answered ? Or do n't you ? " Carter walked out of the room . The heat stuck . The air shimmered . An under-ground nuclear device was detonated where Silver Wells had once been , and Maria got up before dawn to feel the blast . She felt nothing.  | " I 'm giving this one more chance , " Carter said when he saw her sitting by the window . " Tell me what you want . " " Nothing . " " I want to help you . Tell me what you feel . " She looked at the hand he held out to her . " Nothing , " she said . " You say that again and I swear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had three days left on the desert.  |p206Exce|pt  when they let Carter or Helene in , I never minded Neuropsychiatric and I do n't mind here . Nobody bothers me . The only problem is Kate . I want Kate.  | " WE SHOT THE LAST MASTER after youleft this afternoon , " Carter said when he came in with Helene . " Three set-ups in the morning and we 're home . Fantastic . " " Susannah was fabulous , " Helene said . " Super-good . " BZ said nothing . Maria stared out the window . " You should have seen Carter working with her . " " I bet he was fabulous , " BZ said . " Fab . "  |p208The  one time Ivan Costello got through the switch-board to me here he told me that I had lost my sense of humor . In spite of what Carter and Helene think , maybe my sense of humor was all I did lose.  | " YOU WERE FANTASTIC TODAY , " Helenesaid when Susannah Wood came in . " Super-good , " BZ said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Maria 's bed . " Let 's go into Vegas . " " It 's all planned . " Helene did not look at BZ . " Sylvie Roth 's over , and Cassie and Leona and  --  " BZ stood up . " You go into Vegas . " " Do n't you want to see Sylvie ? " " No . " " Do n't you want to see Leona 's last show ? " " No . " The cords tightened on Helene 's neck . " Exactly what do you want . " Susannah Wood giggled . " I saw the charts today , Leona 's single stopped at 85 . " BZ looked at Helene . " Exactly nothing , " he said pleasantly . Maria dropped a tray of ice on the floor.  |p210Carter  and Helene still ask questions . I used to ask questions , and I got the answer : nothing . The answer is " nothing . " Now that I have the answer , my plans for the future are these : ( 1 ) get Kate , ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some canning . Dam-son plums , apricot preserves . Sweet India relish and pickled peaches . Apple chutney . Summer squash succotash . There might even be a ready market for such canning : you will note that after everything I remain Harry and Francine Wyeth 's daughter and Benny Austin 's godchild . For all I know they knew the answer too , and pretended they did n't . You call it as you see it , and stay in the action . BZ thought otherwise . If Carter and Helene are n't careful they 'll get the answer too.  | " I THOUGHT YOU 'D BE in Vegas , " BZ said when Maria opened the door . He was holding a bottle of vodka and in spite of the heat he was wearing a blazer and a tie . " With Carter and Helene and Susannah and Harrison and Sylvia and Cassie and Leona and  --  " " You knew I was n't going . " Maria lay down on the bed again . " All right , I knew . " He sat on the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me all duded up . Why are you in bed at nine o'clock . " " Why not . " " Beautiful . " Maria looked at him . " Tell me why you 're sad . " " You 're a good girl . " All the musculature seemed gone from BZ 's face . He put down the bottle of vodka and reached into his pocket . " You know what these are ? " He poured twenty or thirty capsules onto the bed before she answered.  | " Grain-and-a-half Seconal . " " You want some ? " She looked at him . " No . " " You 're still playing . " BZ did not take his eyes from hers . " Some day you 'll wake up and you just wo n't feel like playing any more . " " That 's a queen 's way of doing it . " " I never expected you to fall back on style as an argument . " " I 'm not arguing . " " I know that . You think I 'd be here if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and held it . " Why are you here . " " Because you and I , we know something . Becausewe 've been out there where nothing is . Because Iwanted  --  you know why . " " Lie down here , " she said after a while . " Just go to sleep . " When he lay down beside her the Seconal capsules rolled on the sheet . In the bar across the road some-body punched King of the Road on the jukebox again , and there was an argument outside , and the sound of a bottle breaking . Maria held onto BZ 's hand . " Listen to that , " he said . " Try to think about having enough left to break a bottle over it . " " It would be very pretty , " Maria said . " Go to sleep . "  |p213She  was almost asleep when she sensed that his weight had shifted . " Do n't . " After she had said it she opened her eyes . He was swallowing the capsules with a glass of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't start faking me now . " BZ turned off the light and lay down again . " Take my hand . Go back to sleep . " " I 'm sorry , " she said after a while . " Hold onto me , " BZ said . When Maria woke again the room was blazing with light and Carter was shaking her and Helene was screaming . Maria thought she had never heard any-one scream the way Helene screamed . She closed her eyes against the light and her ears against Helene and her mind against what was going to happen in the next few hours and tightened her hold on BZ 's hand.  |p214Carter  called today , but I saw no point in talking to him . On the whole I talk to no one . I concentrate on the way light would strike filled Mason jars on a kitchen windowsill . I lie here in the sun-light , watch the hummingbird . This morning I threw the coins in the swimming pool , and they gleamed and turned in the water in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I refrained . One thing in my defense , not that it matters : I mow something Carter never knew , or Helene , or maybe you . I know what " nothing " means , and keep on playing . Why/ , BZ would say . Why/ not , I say.
