From the Continental Divide to the Pacific shore , the Mexican border to the Arctic Ocean , only one statehouse remained in Democratic control last week . Even the lone holdout in Salt Lake City most likely would have fallen to the G.O.P. if Governor Calvin Rampton did not have two more years to serve . Of all the West 's Democratic gubernatorial candidates , only Incumbent John Burns in Hawaii survived the pervasive Republican wind . Another possible Democratic winner is Alaska 's William Egan , who withdrew an early concession in hopes that a recount and a tally of absentee ballots would return him to office . <P> No less significant were Republican gains in secondary statewide races , legislatures and courthouses . Democratic majorities were transmuted into Republican majorities in both houses of the legislatures in Alaska , Arizona and Utah . The G.O.P. also won complete control of a divided legislature in Colorado , half of previously all-Democratic legislatures in Washington , Oregon and Montana . <P> Pared Margins . Ronald Reagan will still be faced with Democratic majorities in Sacramento , but their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses . Even powerful Jesse Unruh , Democratic speaker of the lower house and longtime rival of defeated Pat Brown , appeared close to defeat for a time in his once-safe suburban Los Angeles district . Unruh 's margin : 9,000 votes . <P> Republicans racked up only slightly less impressive victories in the congressional races . The Democrats lost ten of their 48 Representatives , among them such Capitol Hill veterans as California 's seven-termer Harlan Hagen , defeated by Olympic Decathlon Champion Bob Mathias . In Senate contests no incumbent was defeated , and the Democrats had only one loss , the Oregon seat of retiring Maurine Neuberger that was captured by Mark Hatfield . <P> One Word . Officeholders at home are far more visible , however , than those in Washington , and are perennially harried by aggrieved voters . Partly as a result of introducing a sales tax , Robert Smylie , dean of U.S. Governors , lost out in Idaho 's Republican primary in August . He was joined last week by incumbent Democrats in Alaska , Arizona , California and Nevada . Three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Grant Sawyer-also were trying to surmount the voters ' antipathy to third terms . <P> Ideology played a minimal part in the elections . Indeed , there was little but the word Republican to unite the G.O.P. 's nine winning Governors . Arizona 's Jack Williams and Nevada 's Paul Laxalt stand close to Goldwater , while Idaho 's Don Samuelson stands , if possible , to the right of Barry . Colorado 's John Love , on the other hand , is more of the Scranton stripe while New Mexico 's David Cargo and Oregon 's Tom McCall would agree on most issues with Nelson Rockefeller or Jacob Javits.
