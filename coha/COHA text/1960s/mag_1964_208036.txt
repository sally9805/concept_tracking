There is nothing like a change of key to unlock a whole new career . At least such is the case of a tall Welsh lass named Gwyneth Jones . A year and a half ago she was a so-so mezzo , beset with a special problem : " My voice just kept going up and up . " Why fight it , she thought . So presto change , the mez zo became a soprano . <P> Almost immediately her stock as a singer also soared up and up . She was signed by London 's Royal Opera and two months ago awarded her first major role in Covent Garden as Leonore in Beethoven 's Fidelio . " Genius , " declared one critic . " She has it in her to be one of the great lyrical-dramatic sopranos of our generation , " raved the London Times . <P> Flying Colors . Last week Gwyneth Jones was put to her severest test yet , stepping in for the ailing Leontyne Price to sing the demanding role of Leonora in the opening of Covent Garden 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though she was scored for occasionally giving too free a rein to her voice when spiraling into the upper registers . What thrilled the audiences was the raw power of her bright , heroic soprano , a tidal wave of a voice that all but drowned out Tenor Bruno Prevedi . <P> Just 28 , Gwyneth lives in a middle-class London suburb with her Welsh husband Islwyn , a ladies ' underwear salesman and an amateur rugby player . <P> She was born in Pontnewynydd , Wales , worked as a secretary for four years in the local foundry before winning a scholarship in 1956 to London 's Royal College of Music . She was hired by the Zurich Opera in 1962 as a mezzo , but soon found she could n't restrain herself from " singing top Cs and trilling . " Zurich Conductor Nello Santi listened and forthwith pronounced her a soprano . <P> Furry Animals . She responded to the transition like an uncaged bird . " It was terrific , " she says , " so much more challenging and rewarding than mezzo parts . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now she is intent on making up for lost time , has performed a new role each month for the past five months . <P> But so far she has acquired none of the signs of soprano temperament , is instead almost girlishly exuberant about her new career . Her dressing room is crowded with " furry little toy animals , " and like a teen-ager after the senior prom , she brings home all her curtain-call flowers and heaps them in the bathtub until she can arrange them around the house . To get to Covent Garden she takes a half hour ride on the tube , studying her role en route . " I memorize beautifully when there is noise around , " she says . There promises to be a lot of noise about Gwyneth Jones for some years to come .
