" Daily I repeat to myself ' I believe , ' " the Rev. Daniel Alfred Poling once said . " I could say , ' I doubt , I deny , ' but that is negative . " The beliefs of Poling-who died last week of a heart attack at the age of 83-could serve as a compendium of what classic American Protestantism used to stand for . <P> A Christian activist of unflagging energy , he nonetheless believed that it was the business of the church to change the hearts of men , not to change society . Although frequently engaged in politics-he was the Prohibition candidate for Governor of Ohio in 1912 and four decades later ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Philadelphia as a Republican-Poling fought all his life to preserve the separation of church and state . Above all , he had a profound yet simple faith in God , the words of the Bible , and Jesus , whose biography , he said , could be summed up in five words : " He went about doing good . " <P> Much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an Evangelical minister , he was born in Portland , Ore. , accepted his first call as a preacher at a United Evangelical church in Canton , Ohio , in 1905 . From then on , his life as a minister of the Gospel and a servant of man were inextricably interwoven . During the ' 20s , he was probably the nation 's most popular radio preacher , and for eight years he was pastor of Manhattan 's prestigious Marble Collegiate Church-a post now held by his friend and disciple , Norman Vincent Peale . Poling also served for a time as head of the J. C. Penney Foundation , which supported such charitable institutions as orphanages and homes for the aged . He also traveled widely through the world on behalf of Christian missions and relief services . <P> Poling had an abiding hatred of war - he was gassed as a Y.M.C.A. volunteer during World War I , and his son Clark was one of the famed " four chaplains " who went to their deaths aboard the U.S.S. Dorchester in 1943 - but he was no pacifist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later was an ardent , vociferous foe of Communism , which he described as " the supreme threat " to the world . <P> As editor of the nondenominational Christian Herald from 1927 to 1966 , Poling had an ideal forum for his views , and he made the monthly one of the nation 's most persuasive organs of Protestant opinion . Even after he retired two years ago , Poling stayed active as head of the Christian Herald Charities , which operates the 83-year-old Bowery Mission . Playwright Robert Sherwood once said of Poling that " the whole United States is his parish . " It might better have been said , the whole world .
