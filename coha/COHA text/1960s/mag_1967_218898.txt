Poland 's Roman Polanski ( Knife in the Water ) is hopping mad about The Fearless Vampire Killers , or Pardon Me , But Your Teeth Are in My Neck . Alleging that his U.S. producers cut 19 minutes of footage and otherwise tampered with his handiwork , he sputters : " What I made was a funny , spook fairy tale , and this is a sort of Transylvanian Beverly Hillbillies ! " <P> Polanski has requested that he not be mentioned in any connection with the movie . The difficulty is that there are so many connections : he not only directed but also helped write the film , plays one of the principal parts himself , and his girl friend ( Sharon Tate ) is the female lead . But it is easy to see why Polanski would prefer to blush unseen . Neither spooky nor spoofy , Vampire Killers never manages to get out of the coffin . <P> <P> Hunting the wily vampire , a batty professor ( Jack MacGowran ) and his simpleton assistant ( Polanski ) come to Dracula country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific against bloodsuckers . Things augur well when the luscious Sharon Tate is savagely fondled and fangled in her bath by caped Count Krolock , who makes off with her into the snowy night , leaving a sinister splash of blood on the soapsuds . But by the time that professor and assistant totter to the rescue with their bag of crucifixes ( to ward off the vampires ) , the plot creaks even more than the doors and floor boards of Krolock Castle . <P> <P> There are some pretty snowscapes , though , shot in the Italian Dolomites . And there is one hilarious reprise of an old burlesque gag : girl in bed raises crucifix to thwart approaching snaggletooth , who merely chuckles . " Baby , " he says in a richly Yiddish accent , " hev you ever got the wrong vempire ! "
