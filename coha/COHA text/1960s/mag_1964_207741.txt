Nothing illustrated the worth of overhead weather surveillance better than Tiros ' advance warning fortnight ago that dangerous winds were gathering force in the Atlantic , 1,100 miles southeast of Puerto Rico . <P> To experts , photographs flashed down from the orbiting satellite suggested a big blow 60 miles across . Sure enough , within two days Hurricane Cleo was island-hopping toward Miami , and before the storm dwindled off the Georgia coast at week 's end , it had left behind 150 deaths and a jagged line of destruction that cost property owners more than $300 million . <P> Blocked Vision . The French island of Guadeloupe took the first serious impact of Cleo 's winds . There , the capital of Basse Terre suffered hundreds of demolished homes , and the hurricane devastated sugar and banana plantations , and left 14 dead . Bypassing Puerto Rico , Cleo next moved into Haiti , where the port city of Les Cayes was practically leveled , and 124 Haitian lives were lost . <P> What happened to Cleo next was obscured by Cuba , where , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , the peaks of Cuba 's Sierra Maestra mountains blocked the view for the big new radar in Miami used to track hurricanes up to 300 miles away . Cuba 's mountains did something else . They broke up Cleo 's eye , forced the hurricane to regroup . When it did , it changed direction to a more northerly course , was thus only 200 miles from the Florida coast when the hurricane trackers spotted Cleo again . Flying into the storm 's eye , one tracking plane was buffeted so badly that seven of its crewmen were injured . <P> Blasted Windows . Even so , Miami got ample warning that a big blow might be near . Nevertheless , the citizens on Florida 's Gold Coast were so nonchalant that hotel and shop windows were unboarded , luxury yachts still at their moorings when Cleo struck . Sucking up energy from the Gulf Stream and being carried along by a fast-moving upper air mass , Cleo hit Miami full force . It was the first time in 14 years that a hurricane had done that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence . It bent palm trees to the ground , crumpled street signs , uprooted shrubs , took gravel right out of roadways . Blowing at 115 m.p.h. , Cleo knocked down so many power lines that more than 60,000 telephones in Dade County were without service . At least two dozen fires broke out in Miami , and winds were so high that firemen could not cope with them for hours . At Opa-Locka Airport , a DC-3 was lifted 50 ft. off the ground , flopping helplessly at the end of its ropes . A runaway freight car was blown eight miles from Hollywood to Fort Lauderdale , finally crashing into a railway station that had been nudged onto the tracks by the gale . <P> The hotels were hit just as hard . A huge plate-glass window at the Fontainbleau Hotel collapsed , and water and wind caused as much as $250,000 damage to rooms in the Deauville and Americana hotels . " It was worse than Argonne , " said a 72-year-old World War I vet , but incredibly , the most serious injury Cleo appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suffered by a 60-year-old woman guest at the Fontainbleau when a door fell on her .
