If there is anything Tony Lema likes better than champagne , it is money - understandable , considering the price of champagne . Unfortunately , he has not yet found a way of making money without working , which for Tony means playing golf . Not that he has n't tried : last year 's No. 4 money winner ( with $67,112 ) took five weeks of vacation this spring , spent most of it lying around the house , contemplating ways to get rich quicker . All that happened was that his golf game went to pot . But last week Tony finally staggered home $20,000 to the good in New York 's Thunderbird Classic and made a solemn resolution . From now on , when Lema hears that Arnie Palmer or Jack Nicklaus is taking a week off to rest up for some big tournament like this week 's U.S. Open , he will grit his teeth and swing away . Exercise , not rest , is Champagne Tony 's new prescription for success . <P> In Among the Pines . At that , he almost did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes to go , Lema was 12 under par , seven strokes ahead of burly Mike Souchak . A sudden thundershower made the pros dive for their umbrellas - and almost literally Tony landed on his nose . He lost a stroke at the sixth hole , another at the eighth , two more on the 480-yd. ninth when he bombed his drive under the branches of a lowhanging pine tree ( see cut ) and barely managed to salvage a bogey . ( " I just crawled in there on my hands and knees , said a quick prayer , and backhanded the ball , " said Tony . ) But the real disaster occurred at the 14th hole , a dinky ( 139 yds. ) par three . Tony 's No. 8 iron landed off the green ; a chip and three putts later , he found himself trailing Souchak by a stroke . Lema actually seemed relieved . " That took the pressure off , " he said later . " I had been leading for so long that I was choking to death . " He then birdied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still raining by the time the players reached the 18th green . Huddled under an umbrella , Lema watched Souchak line up a 25-ft. birdie putt-and push it 4 ft. past the hole . Tony 's approach was 8 ft. from the pin . For nearly a minute he stood motionlessly over the ball , putter poised-and abruptly walked away . " I could n't bring the club back , " he said . " I stood there , looking at that thing , thinking , My God , this is a $20,000 putt-and I just could n't hit it . " Finally , Tony addressed the ball again . And this time he punched it squarely into the center of the cup for the winning birdie . <P> Bring on the Bubbly . The Thunderbird victory was Lema 's first since January , and tripled his year 's official winnings to $31,684-not quite the $49,006 he had last year at this time , but still worth a bubble or two . Within min utes , waiters were wheeling case after case of Mot et Chandon champagne into the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of his game , Lema knocked in six straight birdies in Michigan 's Buick Open , had a two-stroke lead at the end of 54 holes , and started dreaming about the blast he will throw if he wins the U.S. Open . " Champagne wo n't be enough , " he said . " I win that and I 'll spring for the hors d'oeuvres too . "
