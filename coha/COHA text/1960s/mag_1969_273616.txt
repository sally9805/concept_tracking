WITH this week 's issue , TIME begins a new feature and welcomes a new colleague . Louis Harris and Associates , one of the nation 's leading political polling organizations , will conduct public opinion surveys and research for TIME and other Time Inc. publications on an exclusive basis in the magazine field . Under that arrangement , the editors of TIME will regularly ask Harris to explore how Americans feel about the urgent political , social and moral questions of the day . The first poll , which appears this week in The Nation , was begun in mid-March . It examines public convictions about military power , past , present and future , and how far the American people are willing to go in the exercise of U.S. strength . The results at times are surprising . <P> Harris ' work has been distinguished by a high degree of accuracy and insight . Having studied public opinion with the Elmo Roper organization and then founded his own firm in 1956 , he came to national prominence as chief polltaker for John Kennedy . Since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senators and a score of Governors , taken commercial surveys for many firms , and run polls for TV , magazines and newspapers ; his own column , distributed by the Chicago Tribune-New York Daily News Syndicate , appears in over 50 papers across the U.S. For any given poll , he can call on a nationwide network of 27 field supervisors and some 3,000 part-time " stringers , " who do the actual interviewing . His analysts in Manhattan study the answers amassed in the field , and from the tabulations Lou Harris then writes what he calls an " overlay , " a summary and conclusions . <P> Neither Harris nor TIME 'S editors believe , of course , that polls provide an infallible guide to public opinion . We do believe that they can be a highly valuable journalistic tool to help report how people live and what they think , which is often , as Harris puts it , " less visible , less easy to define and analyze than such overt breaking news as the shooting down of a U.S. plane or a student uprising at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " merges the best practices of journalism with the new field of polling . It 's the most exciting thing I could be involved in . " <P> Last February , TIME 'S Education Program sent a kit called " Black and White America " to 5,000 high school teachers for use in classroom discussions . The kit contains seven booklets , and it has proved so popular that requests for reprints have come in from all over the U.S. The kits are now available to the general public , at $3 each , from : <P> TIME Education Program <P> Black and White America <P> Box 870 <P> Radio City Station <P> New York , N.Y . 10019 <P> The Cover : Acrylic over polyester resin base on wood , by Californian Vincent Perez .
