Lana Turner knew only too well that she was the model for the lurid 1962 novel Where Love Has Gone , and stopped talking to its author , Harold Robbins ( The Carpetbaggers ) . But by two years ago , she had made peace and signed to star in Robbins ' The Survivors , an ABC television series about the jet set he concocted for the forth coming season . That , it turns out , may be grounds to break off relations permanently with Robbins - and just possibly is the worst decision of Lana 's 45-movie , seven-husband career . The Survivors has so far proved to be the most overpriced and troubled TV series ever . <P> In the ten months since shooting began , the show has run through three producers . <P> Also down the chute went one director , the costume designer , the executive story editor - and the original Robbins story line itself . <P> Says Lana , one of the few charter members of the company left on the set last week : " If we were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would believe it . " <P> The narrative is , so to speak , pure Robbins . He conceived The Survivors for a couple of reasons . Though he has sold more than 40 million books , Robbins has long lusted for a larger audience : he figures that " even if the show is a failure , more people will view it in one night than all the people who have ever read or seen The Carpetbaggers . " Secondly , he has always felt that two-hour movie adaptations of his novels were too truncated and that 100 hours were really needed . <P> Sophisticated Saga . So Robbins went to the production brass of ABC , and spieled out a scenario . There is this banking family , he winged - Morgan or Roth schild types , with the second generation vying among themselves for command after the death of the patriarch . The saga would unfold in novel form , not with self-contained weekly story segments but chapter by chapter . The Survivors would also be more sophisticated than conventional television - " A story , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> If people go to bed together , they 'll go to bed together on the show . We are not bowing down to TV in any way . " <P> ABC was sold , with nary a script or a pilot , and commissioned Universal to produce it . Robbins would get a percentage of any profits , plus $10,000 a show . Furthermore , he says , he was guaranteed a full 26 weeks the first year instead of the customary 15 or 17 , and payment for a second season of 26 shows " whether it bombs or not . " For that unprecedented , sweet contract , Robbins gave ABC only a nine-page " treatment , " conferred a few times with Universal , and then took off for his Riviera home . <P> Journeymen Hollywood scriptwriters would hack out the weekly chapters from the Robbins outline and flesh out such supporting characters as Louis Armond St. Verre , described in the scenario only as " the debauched scion of an old French family whose main claim to fame is that he has made love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
