" He sent Deputy United States ' Delegate Charles W. Yost to the Guinean Mission at 17 East Seventy-third Street to call on the diplomat . Mayor Wagner heard of the case while on a primary campaign tour of the Bronx and phoned Chief Police Inspector Francis J. M. Robb . The Mayor also extended his regrets to the African delegate through Mrs. Joyce P. Austin , Assistant to the Mayor . Deputy Police Commissioner Walter Arm said late in the day that the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the police wanted further details . He promised that a full report would be made . The department assigned Deputy Chief Inspector Patrick Whalen , commander of the // Sixth Division on the upper West Side , to the case . The investigation was con- ' ! tinuing early this morning at ; ! the West 135th Street station ' with the questioning of all per-1 sons involved .

The 25-year-old police- ; man was not available at his ' home at 114-59 203d Street in ' St. Albans , Queens . As the police reconstructed the incident , M. Collet , driving alone north on Eighth Avenue , struck the back of the taxi . Mr. Morris , the taxi driver , got out and asked to see M. Collet 's license and registration . a normal procedure in an auto accident . At that point the diplomat , who is said to speak only a little English , allegedly shouted in French and pushed and punched the taxi driver . Patrolman O'Grady , tempo-. rarily assigned to Harlem , ' reached the scene and started ' to question the diplomat . The ? police said M. Collet became ! " belligerent " and " pushed and ! punched the officer with his ; fists .

But on the way , the police con- ' tended , the diplomat " had to be forcibly restrained from grab-. bing the steering wheel and pushing down on the accelerator . " The police said they were not aware that M. Collet was a diplomat until he identified himself at the statiod house as ' Guinea 's Deputy Permanent Representative and produced a United Nations identification card . His car , however , bore diplomatic registration plates , DPL156 . Inspector Whalen obtained the diplomat 's version of the in cident last night at the Guinean ; delegation 's headquarters .

The diplomat also was quoted ; as saying that the taxi driver ! had cut in front of his car . The ' inspector was shown green and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diplomat 's black sedan . Inspector Whalen said . scratches , possibly from a bite .. had been found on the taxi ' driver 's arm . Earlier this month M.
