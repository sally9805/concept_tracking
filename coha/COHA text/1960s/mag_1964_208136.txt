The Toilet and The Slave , by LeRoi Jones , are one-act spasms of fury . Naked hate , like naked love , is very hard to project or sustain on a stage , but Negro Playwright Jones can do it with venomous intensity . <P> The Toilet takes place in the lavatory of a boys ' high school . There are seven urinals . A Negro boy begins the play by using one of them ; near the play 's end , a white boy 's bloodied head lies in one of them . In between , Jones makes it abundantly clear that he would gladly consign every white man 's bloodied head to that identical place . <P> The form of the play is an act of vengeance . The white boy , Karolis ( Jaime Sanchez ) , has written what can only be construed as a homosexual love letter to a Negro boy named Foots ( Hampton Clanton ) . Foots 's eight Negro buddies brutally punch , kick and stomp on Karolis . Directed with nightmarish brilliance by Leo Garen , the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls of toilet paper seem to crackle with terroristic menace . The Negroes spew the vilest of obscenities at Karolis and each other . On any absolute scale , the dialogue is air pollution of the highest scatological and pornographic density ever recorded on a U.S. stage . Relative to the play , it is an act of verbal violence , matching and intensifying the drama 's physical violence . Just before the play ends , Foots cradles Karolis in his arms on an otherwise empty stage and bathes his battered face , as if to imply that this is an interracial love that dares not speak its name . <P> The Slave is essentially a kind of Greenwich Villagey talkfest . War has broken out between Negroes and whites , and with the sound of machine-gun and artillery fire in the near distance , a Negro military leader ( Al Freeman Jr. ) revisits his former white wife , who is now married to a white history professor . Ostensibly , he has come to see his two daughters , possibly to kill them , but mostly to gloat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point , the professor asks if there will be more love or beauty or knowledge in the world after a Negro victory . " That was not ever the point , " the Negro retorts . " The point is that you had your chance , darling ; now these other folks have theirs . " <P> Jones 's plays belong to a relatively new dramatic genre that has been called the theater of cruelty . The theater of cruelty aims to punish an audience , flog it , and maybe even make it sick at its stomach . But which audience ? Jones seems like a man who needs an enemy so badly that the nearest friend will do . His true target in these plays is the well-intentioned liberal intellectual with namby-pamby notions of cozy , overnight , instant brotherhood . The Toilet 's depiction of Negroes as semi-cretinous urban cannibals is calculated to affront precisely those white racial ameliorators who passionately argue that Negroes are not like that at all . <P> Like Jean Genet , Jones , who is rnarried to a white woman , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage . His chief fantasy is retaliation . In these plays , the Negro has the gun . He gives the orders , he slugs , he kills , he wins . Dramatically , the virtue of this is that action follows idea like a dagger thrust without the shadow of explanations , descriptions and rationalizations that fall on drama like a blight .
