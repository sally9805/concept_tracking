txt After 35 years the forest in Spruce Notch is tall and sturdy . It began during the Depression when work gangs planted thousands of tiny seedlings in abandoned pastures on Richmond Peak in the northern Catskills . Nothing spectacular has happened there since ; the forest has been left undisturbed . But now we have a large spread of Norway spruces a foot thick at the butt and forty or fifty feet high . Their crowns look like thousands of dark crosses reaching into the sky The forest is a good place in which to prowl in search of wildlife . But also in search of ideas . For the inescapable fact is that the world of civilized America does not have such a clean record . Since the seedlings were planted the nation has fought three catastrophic wars , in one of which the killing of combatants and the innocent continues . During the lifetime of the forest 350,000 Americans have died on foreign battlefields . Inside America civilized life Is no finer . A President , a Senator , a man of God have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , armed assaults , looting , burning , outbursts of hatred have increased to the point where they have become commonplace . Life in civilized America is out of control . Nothing is out of control in the forest . Everything complies with the instinct for survival  --  which is the law and order of the woods . Although the forest looks peaceful it supports incessant warfare , most of which is hidden and silent . For 35 years the strong have been subduing the weak . The blueberries that once flourished on the mountain have been destroyed . All the trees are individuals , as all human beings are individuals ; and every tree poses a threat to every other tree . The competition is so fierce that you can hardly penetrate some of the thickets where the lower branches of neighboring trees are interlocked in a blind competition for survival . Killing for Food Nor is the wildlife benign . A red-tailed hawk lived there last summer  --  slowly circling in the sky and occasionally drawing attention to himself by screaming . He survived on mice , squirrels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the depth of the woods . He hoots in midmorning as well as at sunrise to register his authority . He also is a killer . Killing is a fundamental part of the process . The nuthatches kill insects in the bark . The woodpeckers dig insects out . The thrushes eat beetles and caterpillars . Aerial Warfare But in the forest , killing is not wanton or malicious . It is for survival . Among birds of equal size most of the warfare consists of sham battles in which they go through the motions of warfare until one withdraws . Usually neither bird gets hurt . Nor is the warfare between trees vindictive . Although the spruces predominate they do not practice segregation . On both sides of Lost Lane , which used to be a dirt road , maples , beeches , ashes , aspens and a few red oaks live , and green curtains of wild grapes cover the wild cherry trees . In the depths of the forest there are a few glades where the spruces stand aside and birches stretch and grow . The forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never out of control . Although they are wild they are not savage as they are in civilized life . For the tensions are absorbed in the process of growth , ana the clusters of large cones on the Norway spruces are certificates to a good future . The forest gives an external impression of discipline and pleasure . Occasionally the pleasure is rapturously stated . Soon after sunrise one morning last summer when the period of bird song was nearly over , a solitary rose-breasted grosbeak sat on the top of a tall spruce and sang with great resonance and beauty . He flew a few rods to another tree and continued singing ; then to another tree where he poured out his matin again , and so on for a half-hour . There was no practical motive that I was aware of . After 35 uneventful years the spruces have created an environment in which a grosbeak is content , and this one said so gloriously . It was a better sound than the explosion of bombs , the scream of the wounded , the crash of broken glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pace siren . The forest conducts ' its- affairs with less rancor and malevolence than civilized America . BROOKS ATKINSON is a longtime observer of the theater of man and nature .
