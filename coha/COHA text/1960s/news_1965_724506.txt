txt Visitors to a growing number of housing developments around the country might think they had wandered back into the gaslight era . Look as they may . they 'll find no telephone poles or electric power lines . But the lines are there  --  underground . ' Utilities have cut sharply the cost of running them beneath the earth to homes , rather than stringing them overhead . And builders are hastening to order the sub-surface lines , to improve the view from the picture window . The move is particularly marked in areas where " the trend toward Outdoor living is helping to heighten awareness of the land and airscape around homes . " as Charles L. Beaty . Jr. , head of Dallas Power &; Light Co ' s underground engineering division , puts it . Thus , Southern California Edison Co. hooked sonic 23.000 homes to buried power lines last year , against 4,800 in 1963 and only 200 in 1954 . San Diego Gas &; Electric Co. figures nearly half the developments wired into its lines last year had underground cables , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Across the continent in Miami , Florida Power &; Light Co. says it is running underground lines to homes priced as low as $14,000 ; two years ago it extended them only to houses in the $30,000 and up class . Chicago . Too But the trend is also catching on in the now-frozen North . " At the rate we 're going , we probably wo n't be installing overhead utility lines anywhere in our system five years from now , and the rest of the country wo n't be far behind . " says William E. Nelson , senior distribution engineer of Commonwealth Edison Co. in Chicago . Builders generally still pay . and add to house prices , the extra cost of buying cables ( utilities usually absorb , and add to power rates , the cost of stringing overhead lines ) . But " undergrounding " costs have been cut sharply by development of polyethylene-insulated cable which can be fed directly into the ground ; this eliminates the laying of expensive copper or other metal conduit to encase the heavy lead-covered cables used previously . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ten years ago we were charging close to $1,000 a lot for undergrounding. " says R. Carter Blankenburg , an official of Southern California Edison . " Nov it averages $140 or less . " And some electric utilities waive all , or nearly all , cable-burying charges for builders putting up " all-electric " homes . Portland General Electric Co. in Oregon absorbs undergrounding costs up to $250 for all-electric homes . But if the builder puts in a gas range and oven he pays the full cost , which averages $160 a house . Builders generally find the now relatively cheap buried cables an important selling " extra " in today 's hotly competitive housing market . Not many mention the lack of unsightly overhead power lines in newspaper ads , but such firms as R. A. Watt Construction Co. stress it in placards at the development site and brochures handed out to potential buyers . Few buyers realize how much the lack of visible power lines adds to the scenery until they get to the site , says Ray A. Watt , president . Dollars-and-Cents Beauty In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be translated directly into cash terms . Leo D. Tandus , proprietor of Ocean Avenue Realty Co. in scenic Carmel , Calif. , says buried cables make " view " lots starting at $10,000 in his area " worth at least $2,000 more " than they would be if the scenery included a tangle of above-ground power lines . Underground lines have other attractions , too . They do n't break during storms . They do n't put poles in the way of tipsy motorists , or lines in the way of low-flying planes , and they ca n't fall on the head of a pedestrian coming home in a blizzard . Utilities are spared the cost of trimming trees to keep them from damaging overhead lines  --  a cost which runs " hundreds of thousands of dollars " a year for Commonwealth Edison ( the utility also spends more than Si million a year repairing storm damage to overhead lines ) . But the buried cables also have disadvantages . They 're sometimes damaged by water seepage , particularly in areas where salt is used to melt snow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home owner who gets overly enthusiastic about gardening to cut an underground line  --  which generally runs three feet deep  --  while digging a hole to plant a tree . More important , says a Florida utility executive , installers of sewers , storm drains and water mains , and sometimes of gas lines or even driveways , cut underground cables as many as seven times while working on a single lot , costing his utility as much as $100 per house in extra materials alone . Utilities customarily provide other contractors with maps of their buried lines , he says , but workers rarely pay any attention to them , and contractors hardly ever make good the damage they cause .
