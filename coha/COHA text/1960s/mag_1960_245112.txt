U.S. Roman Catholics are not sufficiently interested in the rest of the world . So says a distinguished Catholic layman , General Alfred M. Gruenther , onetime head of NATO and now president of the American National Red Cross . In Manhattan last week , he told 1,400 Catholic high school teachers : " In my experience Catholic groups have been less international-minded than groups of other religions . Interest in international problems is no longer a luxury ; it is a must . " <P> Replied New York 's Cardinal Spellman pointedly : " We are aware of our brothers in other lands . " But he conceded : " The children must become international-minded just as the church is universal-minded. "
