Paris Blues ( United Artists ) has something for the tourists : autumn in Paris . It has something for the cats : regressive jazz by Duke Ellington . It has something for the newspaper ads : a hint of interracial romance . It has something for the marquee : Paul Newman , Joanne Woodward , Sidney Poitier , Diahann Carroll , Louis Armstrong . All it lacks is something to pull these parts into a sensible whole . <P> Two American girls-one pink ( Woodward ) , one beige ( Carroll ) - take a two-week holiday in Paris , where they meet two American boys-one pale ( Newman ) , one brown ( Poitier ) - in an integrated cave where the boys play sliphorn and piano . At first Newman makes a pass at Carroll , but the kids are quickly segregated , and soon they are in love . For Newman , love is short but art is long ; he sends Woodward home and stays in Paris to study music . For Poitier , love is a ticket back to the U.S. ; he decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Director Martin Ritt ( The Long , Hot Summer ) has obviously sought for artistic truth in this film , but the only general truth that Blues propounds is one that might have prevented this production : expatriates are a pretty dull bunch .
