A CEREMONY OF INNOCENCE by Robert Wool . 308 pages . World . $5.95 . <P> <P> A power play by the CIA to maintain the United States ' dominant position in Latifundia , a fictional South American country , sounds like the inevitable background for one more pale carbon copy of The Ugly American . Classified communiques pop up like toast at the breakfast table , a recording device is hidden in a tie clip , new leaders are found by a spin-the-bottle technique , and the real rapport between nations rests on a Jellolike foundation of friendship between Latifundia 's President and the American ambassador . Despite the apparently insurmountable handicap of so familiar a scenario , Robert Wool has managed to produce a finely written first novel that explores the personality of a South American nation while revealing the lives and characters of two strong and complex men . Neither of them fits the good-guy , bad-guy stereotypes that infect not only this literary genre but diplomatic thinking about Latin America in general . <P> Octavio Demasiado , the President of Latifundia , is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ex-football hero and the son of a prostitute , he is as wily and emotional in his diplomatic dealings as a wildcat forced to play parlor games . Almost his opposite in personality and background is Carl Aspinwall , the U.S. Ambassador to Latifundia . Harvard-educated scion of an aristocratic New England family , Aspinwall has tried to build a diplomatic career on plain dealing , only to find his word and position repeatedly betrayed by shifts in policy . <P> Confounded once more by a CIA coup , which deposes his friend Demasiado , he suddenly sees his carefully dedicated life about to be destroyed by political duplicity . Fleetingly , the U.S. Embassy becomes a symbol of the blind arrogance and wastefulness of all great powers . " He walked around the corner and saw the Embassy , every light on , the only building on the street with a bulb burning , a beamless lighthouse with all its light shining in on itself . " <P> In or out of power , visionary Demasiado goes on scheming for American ( or Russian ) money to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on fighting to prove that honesty , if not justice , will prevail in political affairs . As the author records in lean , reportorial prose , in any struggle to salvage both dignity and power from such a situation , the winner takes nothing . Well , almost nothing .
