Dammit , I may have faults , but being wrong ai n't one of them . <P> - James Riddle Hoffa <P> Just how wrong he could be , the pugnacious , taciturn boss of the Teamsters Union learned last week when the iron gates of the federal penitentiary at Lewisburg , Pa. , swung shut on him . Jimmy Hoffa was in on an eight-year sentence , and could be rapped with an additional five-year term if the courts reject his appeal from a conviction for fraud and conspiracy . Said he : " It 's a very unhappy day in my life . " <P> It was a day Jong in coming . Ever since taking over the 1.8 million-member union ten years ago-from Dave Beck , who was imprisoned for larceny-Hoffa , 54 , has been the object of almost constant investigations and allegations by the Federal Government . Six times he was brought to trial but only twice convicted . Hoffa took modest refuge in an ancient businessman 's gag : he festooned his desk with a bronze plaque inscribed with the dog-Latin motto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear you down ) . <P> Perverse Sympathy . He never did . In fact , Hoffa 's stubborn fight against imprisonment touched a perverse chord of sympathy among his union members . Casting himself in the role of Jean Valjean , Hoffa shouted : " To hell with all our enemies " - and his Teamsters loved it . He played to the hilt the fiction that he was the persecuted Everyman , the scapegoat of the Establishment . <P> He was no underdog when it came to running his union . Hoffa ruthlessly crushed opposition , demanded total obedience from his officers . His iron-fisted rule led him into questionable associations with gangsters , shady deals with employers and flagrant misuse of union funds . Bobby Kennedy , who as counsel for the Senate rackets committee and later as Attorney General showed that he could be as rough an infighter as Hoffa , called his handling of the union a " conspiracy of evil . " So fierce was the enmity between Hoffa and Kennedy that special police guards were assigned to Bobby after Hoffa 's imprisonment , as protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his fashion , Hoffa accomplished a great deal for the Teamsters . He molded the union , once a disparate collection of feuding regional fiefdoms , into the most powerful labor force in the nation . A formidable bargainer , he scrupulously kept to the letter of contracts once they were signed and swiftly stamped out wildcat strikes . By equalizing drivers ' wages throughout the country , he eliminated labor costs as a factor in competition and thereby helped stabilize the trucking industry . He opened the union 's doors to Negroes and , characteristically , disdained any praise as a civil rights advocate . It was only " bread-and-butter " common sense to encourage Negro members , he explained , because otherwise they would become strikebreakers . He recruited not only truckers for his union but every other worker he could muster , from aircraft workers to hatcheck girls . So large was his union that a nationwide Teamsters ' strike could paralyze the U.S. economy , and Hoffa lost no chance to brag about such power .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
