To the nervous Communist bosses of East Germany , teaching kids to be vigilant against " Western imperialist agents " is just as important as the alphabet or arithmetic . Latest evidence is a recent issue of ABC Zeitung , a magazine aimed at " Young Pioneers " aged six to eleven , which even includes a cutout cardboard model of an amphibious truck used by " our National People 's Army . " Best of all is a game called " On Guard for Peace . " Like similar U.S. games , the idea is to roll dice and advance so many spaces on an illustrated board . But for the Communist schoolchildren , the heroes are all border guards armed with automatic weapons . The game 's rewards and penalties : <P> 1 . Awake promptly : advance three spaces . <P> 2 . Healthful gymnastics ; take another turn . <P> 3 . Boots badly shined ; start over . <P> 4 . Greeted villagers cordially ; advance five . <P> 5 .
