SINCLAIR LEWIS ( 867 pp. ) **25;130;TOOLONG ( $10 ) . <P> <P> If the term had been invented earlier , Sinclair Lewis might have qualified as the U.S. 's first Angry Young Man . He was obstreperous enough , and like his latter-day counterparts , his anger at society was that of a jilted lover . <P> Lewis was the third son of a stiffnecked Minnesota small-town doctor , whose approbation the writer always sought and never quite won . ( Dr. Lewis wrote of his son in 1925 : " It is certainly marvelous how such a bundle of nerves can pull in the money . " ) Christened Harry Sinclair Lewis and usually called Hal or Red , he was a tall , skinny , ginger-headed man afflicted all his life with a badly blotched complexion that set the seal on his ugliness . His physical unattractiveness made his youth lonely and affected his character and work . In this long and lovingly detailed biography , Critic Mark Schorer suggests that his volatile temper , his insatiable hunger for male companionship and female company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his short and abortive acting career late in life , were the result of an emotionally starved childhood and adolescence . At a 1922 reunion dinner of his Yale class , Lewis said : " When I was in college , you fellows did n't give a damn about me , and I 'm here to say that now I do n't give a damn about you . " <P> Some Bod . Deprivation , like fame , is a spur . The turning point for Lewis came late in 1920 with the publication of Main Street . He was then 35 , had published six novels and numerous short stories to mixed notices . But Main Street touched a contemporary nerve as no novel has done since . It sold furiously and was discussed endlessly . Within ten years , it was followed by Babbitt , Arrowsmith , Elmer Gantry and Dodsworth . They brought Lewis wealth and world renown , both of which were cosmetics for an unattractive man . And in 1930 they brought him the Nobel Prize for literature , making Lewis the first American to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated in the ten-year span from 1920 to 1930 . The novels after 1930 , even the successful It Ca n't Happen Here and Kingsblood Royal , were jerry-built , and some of them were embarrassingly bad . E. M. Forster predicted his decline as early as Dodsworth ; in an essay on Lewis called " A Camera Man , " he wrote : " Photography is a pursuit for the young . So long as a writer has the freshness of youth on him , he can work the snapshot method , but when it passes he has nothing to fall back upon . It is here that he differs from the artist . " <P> In fact , all his life Lewis was by disposition a journeyman commercial writer . In his youth he sold plots to Jack London , and when he came home from Stockholm with the Nobel Prize , he sat down to write some popular magazine fiction . Like other writers whose personal tastes are those of a mass public , he viewed all his work-including his magazine stories and movie scripts-with equal seriousness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
