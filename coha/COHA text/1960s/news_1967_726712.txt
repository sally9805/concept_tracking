txt When Alabama 's George C. Wallace is on the stump he is usually sandwiched in between the gospel music and the hippie walkout . Another place the fiery former Governor and states ' rights champion seems firmly sandwiched is in both Democratic and Republican craws . But neither party likes to admit it . Mr. Wallace , bent now on a third-party bid for president in 1968 , stumped California all last week . And this week he has taken his Southern-twanged bid to Ohio . In pavilions , arenas , and halls here the order of each evening was similar . First , the gospel singer , backed by an upright piano , footstomped and handclapped through " Pray , pray , pray for the U.S.A. " The crowd , bigger than at the last stop , kept drifting in and sitting down . Outside the hall , hippies and others circled in placard-toting protest . " George Wallace speaks  --  brought to you by Barnum &; Bailey , " sneered one placard . Another allowed how " Wallace plays piano on the white keys only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park their placards and file inside to heckle and hoot . Fast trade denounced Then to the podium comes Mr. Wallace himself , pancaked between a covey of Alabama security police . All around the hall hang the red , white , and blue bunting bearing the slogan of the new American Independent Party : " Stand up for America . " Mr. Wallace stood up at the rostrum at the Orange County Fairgrounds and his voice ricocheted in waves off the pavilion 's galvanized tin roof . It said , " I want to see the democratic institutions turned back to the states . " His hands ruffled through the pages of his speech as he said emphatically that any country that trades with Communists should have its foreign aid cut off . Next night in the lofty-ceilinged Long Beach Arena he told a crowd of 6,000 ? the biggest of his 10-day Western swing ? that he was " against federal government dictating local policies . " And he said he was against taking away " the rights of people to determine the use of their own property . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech he rapped " pseudo-intellectuals " who give bad advice to the government and are listened to instead of the " average man . " All this said , Mr. Wallace then threatened to run for president . " If the two parties do n't give you an emphatic straightforward choice in 1968 , " he vowed , " I 'll be back and we are going to stir things up in California . " Battle of songs Mr. Wallace is certain to be back , Because by a " choice " he means that if the platform of one of the parties does n't embody " what we 've been saying here tonight , " he will run . It is n't likely that either the GOP or the Democratic platforms will . Not long before Mr. Wallace reaches this climactic vow , the hippie contingent stands up en masse and departs . In Long Beach it left singing " We Shall Overcome . " The pro-Wallace part of the audience applauds its departure and responds with a few bars of " God Bless America . " Even as Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes nightly across California , a cadre of workers , including an imported nucleus of Alabama cabinet officers , labored to put the former governor 's name on the state 's ballot next November . The way Wallace backers hope to do it in California is to qualify the American Independent Party . To do that , they must persuade 66,059 voters to change their registrations from Democratic , Republican , or plain independent . That wo n't be easy . So far , one Wallace backer estimates , the party has convinced about 10,000 Californians to switch their registration . " We are signing them up about 600 to 700 a day , " he says . " If we can keep it up we will make it . " The party must have its 66,059 registrants by Jan. 2 next year to then get Mr. Wallace on the ballot in November . Failing that , the only recourse is to collect 330,000 names on petitions over a three-week stretch next fall . That would be no easier . William K. Shearer , the mustachioed chairman of the American Independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wallace candidacy . " If we can get him on the ballot in those two states , " he says , " I believe we can get him on in every state in the Union . " The Wallace drive is zeroing in now on both these key states . To get him on the By Norman Mathenv , staff photographer George C. Wallace We are going to stir things up ' ballot in Ohio will take 433,100 names on circulated petitions . After that , Mr. Shearer says , the other states will be less burdensome . Mr. Wallace , for instance , can qualify in Illinois with only 25.000 signatures ; in Indiana with 8,000 ; in Michigan with 13,000 ; and in Idaho with 3,000 . In at least three states ? Montana , Nebraska , and Oregon ? the Wallace name can make the ballot by the party just holding a convention and nominating him . California target Once on ballots around the country , Wallace backers think their man could ax a mighty chunk of votes from the Democratic and Republican blocs . In many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vote is all a winner needs to take a state 's entire electoral vote , they think he might even win . In Wisconsin and Maryland in 1964 , Mr. Wallace , without mounting a serious campaign , polled a third of the vote in primaries . They think that by campaigning hard this time he can show even bigger . Mr. Shearer says he can do well in California especially . He looks at the overwhelming 1964 vote against fair housing and predicts most of it would go to Mr. Wallace . He also says his candidate could carry most of the South and enough of the unionized , urbanized , industrial East and North to carry off the presidency . No serious Republican or Democrat here , however , thinks so . And both parties insist Mr. Wallace , if he is hurting anybody , it must be the other side . " He 's not turning many Republicans on here , " says one California Republican . " Frankly , he has been such an unimportant factor that I have n't paid any attention to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juncture . " California 's Democratic National Committeeman , Eugene Wyman , disagrees : " As far as cold politics is concerned , he is doing more harm to Republicans than Democrats . " Mr. Wallace on TV smiles only slightly and says , " I am hoping to hurt them both . "
