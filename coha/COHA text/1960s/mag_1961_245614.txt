Where the Boys Are ( Euterpe ; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) is one of those pictures every intelligent moviegoer will loathe himself for liking-a corny , phony , raucous outburst of fraternity humor , sorority sex talk and housemother homilies that nevertheless warms two hours of winter with a travel-poster tanorama of fresh young faces , firm young bodies and good old Florida sunshine . <P> Suggested by a story in TIME ( April 13 , 1959 ) , Where the Boys Are describes one of the more frantic phenomena of the affluent society : the annual Spring-Ding or Florida Flip of the book-bashed , sun-starved North American undergraduate . Come Easter vacation , students from all over the Northeast and Midwest pile into anything that holds gas and roar south . In recent years , more than 20,000 of these " migratory shirkers " have settled for the two-week season in Fort Lauderdale , and there the camera finds them-soaking up sun and beer , sleeping twelve to a motel cell or two to a car trunk , and assiduously playing the great American game of " separating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A among the three leading ladies of this picture : Should a Girl Scout trade her merit badge for a wedding ring , for a fraternity pin , or just for the hell of it ? Two of the girls ( Dolores Hart , Paula Prentiss ) play it safe , and though they miss their fun they get their men . The third ( Yvette Mimieux ) plays " backseat bingo " and in the last reel finds herself all smashed up by an automobile . Not very subtle , but it squares the censor . <P> What squares the moviegoer , who must endure all these plotitudes , is the booming adolescent vitality of the actors . Actress Hart has a fresh-scrubbed , not-quite-grown-up charm that may make her the June Allyson of the ' 60s . Soft-faced <P> George Hamilton looks like the Jimmy Stewart of the ' 90s . Actress Prentiss emerges as a deft comedienne with a style reminiscent of the late Kay Kendall 's . Jim Hutton looks like Jim Hutton , a gangling young funnybones who already knows how to lose a laugh in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hardy , short-stemmed wallflower . <P> Sometimes when Scriptwriter George Wells tries to write juve-in-the-groove talk , he betrays his age ( 51 ) with the sort of yacketa ( " Gee , that 's absolutely mystic ! " ) that may make moviegoers under 20 smile and shake their heads sadly . But when he straightens up and writes right , he gets off some pretty cute lines . He ( seductively ) : " Tuggle , are you a good girl ? " She ( anxiously ) : " T.V. , I do n't want to disillusion you . " He ( eagerly ) : " I wo n't be disillusioned . Say anything ! " She ( reassured ) : " Yes . I am . " He ( stunned ) : " Oh . "
