txt " It 's like being black . Employers do n't like to say they are prejudiced against women , but they are  --  although once you 've made it , you 're all right .. Then they adopt you as a sort of mascot . " This is the conclusion drawn by Miss Diana Beckett , a University of London honors graduate in her mid-20 's who figuratively pounded on the door of 70 companies in Britain seeking an executive position . Miss Beckett answered -a London newspaper ad which turned out to be a part-time research job for International Commerce , a public-relations ? firm making a survey to determine if there was active discrimination against the employment of executive women . International Commerce had undertaken the project on behalf of the Gordon Yates Bureau , Ltd. , an employment office which wanted to see if it was feasible to place executive women as well as secretarial and clerical personnel . Dual capacity Miss Beckett played a dual role . She did the job for International Commerce but also she was actually seeking an executive position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking if they could use her in their organization .

Miscellaneous free-lance jobs . The 70 companies she wrote to included shipping agents , travel companies , wine merchants , pharmaceutical firms , light and heavy machinery companies , consumer exports , and publishing firms . Three job offers She received 15 " sorry we do n't have a job for you " letters . Six of the firms offered her a secretarial or accounts job and two sent her letters addressed to " Mr. Beckett . " - She came up with 14 interviews and three job offers , one of which she accepted . She now is employed as a market-research executive with a large paper company . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Beckett points out that of course many of the 70 ' she may not have had vacancies . But she feels that three job offers in 70 speaks for itself . Some of the company executives interviewed her as " a curiosity . " Some were sympathetic but did not know where she could fit into their organization . They simply had never hired a woman executive before . " Often , " she laughs , " they did n't know what to do with me . " Waste deplored Based on the total research done by International Commerce the Gordon Yates Bureau concludes : " One of the strongest impressions gained from employers is that many of them have never had to think deeply about employing women in senior posts . Thus it is an entirely new problem to them . " It is clear that poor employment techniques have resulted in an appalling waste of womanpower in this country . This continuing discrimination evolves mainly from changes in socioeconomic conditions . " It is discrimination , based on confusion rather than malice . So was the inquisition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of women in the country are employed in the professions . But there are flutterings of hope on the whole question of discrimination against women in employment opportunities , equal pay , and in legislation . Pay rates negotiated Hardly a day goes by without Britain 's daily newspapers covering some phase of the question  --  a broadside from some women 's labor unions demanding equal pay with men , promising reports issued by the Labour and Conservative parties trying to lure women into their camp before the general election , interviews with woman executives who have " made it , " new legislation proposals attempting to bring Britain 's laws into line with the changing role of women in society . But in the whole issue of woman 's equal rights in Britain , equal pay is the hydra-headed monster . There is no law on British books which insures equal pay for women . All pay rates are negotiated between unions and employees and employers . Inequality of pay exists in most businesses , industries , and professions . There are " men 's rates " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs . There are exceptions ? in medicine , teaching , the civil service , and in the newer technology fields . But generally women count out only 75 percent of men 's pay in their weekly wage packets . For example the lowest weekly rates in food manufacture are 213s. for men and 154s. for women . In wool textiles the men 's rate is 196s. 7d. to the woman 's 129s. 9d . The differential is sometimes even greater because women are prevented under the factory acts from working long overtime hours or on night shifts . It is understood that the government plans to remove these restrictions . Little action taken Comparatively little has been done by women within the labor unions to force the issue of equal pay . Because they usually have family responsibilities women frequently miss union meetings and they know they face the displeasure , if not hostility , from their men coworkers . Male union members know that equal pay for women means less for them . Labour Party statistics show that only a quarter of all working women belong to unions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude that a man shoulders the main financial burdens of a family and therefore he should be paid more . Many women , however , carry equal responsibilities  --  supporting elderly parents , having to care for children by themselves and so on . Organization urged According to Mrs. Marie Patterson , national woman 's officer of the Transport and General Worker 's Union , women are their own worst enemies . They will have to organize much more effectively to improve their lot , she contends . She says too that the whole climate for action on pay is " jelling now . " " Unions are starting to negotiate with individual firms and there are movements toward us. " - But if the worst offenders in industry do not take steps to initiate equal pay " we 're going to have to start headhunting . " Mrs. Patterson agreed equal pay would rebound onto the public in higher living costs . But , she pointed out , the country had always been able to absorb higher prices , that it was a fact of life although it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted There is much coupling of equal pay with equal opportunity . The argument goes that if an employer must pay higher wages to his women employers he will take a hard look at her and the work she is doing to see if he can not automate simple jobs and use her in a more productive capacity . On the other hand , Mrs. Maureen Bateman , one of the deputy heads of the confederation of British industry 's industrial department says : " We feel that in some cases equal pay will be a depressant on the women 's labor market . " If an employer has to choose someone for a job which . can be done equally by a man or woman presumably a married woman ? he will choose the man . We see job opportunities and equal pay as two separate things . " When full equal pay and equal opportunities become fact many experts expect that patterns in marriage and the family will emerge .

With night-shift work becoming available to them , women might spread their working hours over a seven-day week . They would be able to work out a schedule with their husbands so that young children always would have one parent at home . The government is being asked to establish more day nurseries to care for the babies of working mothers . And it is expected that soon playpens and sand piles will be standard equipment attached to industrial sites . Third of four articles .
