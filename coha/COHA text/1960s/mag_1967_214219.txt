" Relief is coming for the Boston commuter , " promised American Airlines ' full-page ads . American , hoping for some relief itself , was touting its fancy new Boston-New York Jet Express service , which begins this week . Once king of the route , the airline is challenging the upstart that has virtually swept the rich Northeast Corridor since 1961 : Eastern Air Lines ' pinchpenny but popular Air-Shuttle . <P> Eastern drew chuckles from other airlines six years ago when it put 28 aging , piston-engine Constellations in shuttle service between Boston , New York and Washington . When passengers found they could drop in and fly on a guaranteed-seat , pay-on-the-plane basis , the other lines nearly dropped out of sight . Eastern now has 79% of Boston-New York business , compared with about 18% for Northeast ( which is be ginning to phase in jets on the route ) and a minuscule 3% for American . <P> Though earnings are still " marginal , " the entire Air-Shuttle operation brought in $41 million carrying 2,800,000 passengers last year , which alone would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v. Flights . Understandably . Eastern has been loath to fiddle with the Air-Shuttle formula : 16 roundtrip , no-reservation flights a day , with back up planes ready to take the overflow . <P> The back-ups have endeared the service to Eastern shuttlers - including the entire Boston Symphony Orchestra , which once popped in at the last minute , instruments and all - and have held off would-be imitators , who lack the necessary extra planes to compete . Still , betting on extra frills rather than extra flights , American President Marion Sadler vows to take half the business with a new fleet of short-haul BAC-111 jets and " make money on it too . " <P> Riding six abreast on the jets replacing Eastern 's piston planes , Air-Shuttle passengers get to buy a ticket and read their own newspaper . American 's Jet Express , by contrast , offers two-class service , continental breakfast , $1 drinks after 11:30 a.m. and coffee any time - while matching the Shuttle with a $16 tourist fare and 16 daily flights . <P> Though they must make phone reservations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigmarole by using a supply of blank " Express Tickets , " to be turned in on boarding and paid for later by mail . <P> Eastern 's New York-Washington shuttle may be in for a fight before long . " We see these guys standing at our gates with clipboards , making notes , " says one Eastern man in Washington . " We know who they are . " Eastern takes the position that the Jet Express is n't any way to run an air shuttle . Striking back , its own ads are featuring a stewardess who asks : " Coffee , tea or planes ?
