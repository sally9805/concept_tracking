THE seven unpaid members of the Warren Commission represented both parties and every major region of the U.S. , had a common bond of integrity and accomplishment . As chairman , President Johnson picked Chief Justice Earl Warren , 73 . From the U.S. Senate came Georgia 's conservative Democrat Richard B. Russell , 66 , the leader of the Senate 's Southern bloc , and Kentucky 's liberal Republican John Sherman Cooper , 63 , a former circuit judge and Ambassador to India . From the House came Louisiana 's Hale Boggs , 50 , the House Democratic whip , and Michigan Republican Gerald Ford , 51 , a Yale Law School graduate and an armed-services expert who is one of the most influential of all Republican Congressmen . In Allen W. Dulles , 71 , former CIA chief , the Commission had an investigator well experienced in the ways of Communists , fascists and plain crackpots ; in John McCloy , 69 , it had a banker who distinguished himself as Harry Truman 's U.S. High Commissioner for Germany and as John Kennedy 's disarmament adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commission members named as their chief counsel James Lee Rankin , 57 , a top Manhattan attorney who had been President Eisenhower 's Solicitor General , carried the Government 's argument in the 1953 school-desegregation cases and the Little Rock high school case . Rankin recruited a staff of 14 outstanding private lawyers and law professors . All 56 field offices of the FBI lent their help . So did the CIA , the Secret Service , the State Department , the Immigration and Naturalization Service-and even the Soviet government , which sent in sketchy reports of Oswald 's 32-month stay in Russia and his visit to the Soviet embassy in Mexico last September . <P> Not content to rely on secondhand reports , the Commission determined to investigate everything afresh . Earl Warren interviewed Jacqueline Kennedy in her Georgetown home and Jack Ruby in his Dallas jail ( Ruby called him " Earl " ) . Every member of the Commission flew to Dallas one or more times , painstakingly retraced the movements that Oswald was known to have made on Nov. 22 . They visited the rooming house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the jail basement where he was shot . At the Texas School Book Depository building , each one went to the sixth-floor spot where Oswald had stood , shouldered the 6.5-mm . Mannlicher Carcano rifle that he had used-and took aim . <P> In New York City , Commission staffers interviewed the teachers and psychiatrist who years ago had known the young , tormented Lee Oswald ; in New Orleans , they questioned those who had known him more recently from his pro-Castro work . They studied Oswald 's rambling diaries and letters , also read every book and major article that had been written on the Kennedy killing . FBI and CIA agents tried to discover and analyze every step that Oswald took during a curious trip to Mexico exactly one year ago . They questioned the drivers of the buses that Oswald rode to Mexico and back , and rounded up practically every passenger who had traveled with him . They spoke to waitresses at a restaurant where he often ate , to clerks and maids in the cheap Hotel del Comercio where he stayed . But with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one-half of Oswald 's time in Mexico .
