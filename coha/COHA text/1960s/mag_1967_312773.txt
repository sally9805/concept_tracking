Can Mickey make it ? Does life begin at 38 ? Will the Brat and the Professor come to blows ? Can Super Jew and No Neck survive the jug test ? Those were the weighty , provocative questions confronting every red-blooded American last week . It was that time again , and Poet Don Marquis was probably right when he rhapsodized : " Oh , what the hell , it 's spring . " Marquis , of course , was not a baseball fan . <P> The season 's start was still three weeks away , but in New York , Mickey Mantle 's conversion from outfielder to first baseman-and his subsequent stop of a sizzling grounder in an exhibition game-competed for attention with President Johnson 's return from Guam . Column after column chronicled the comeback attempt of Yankee Pitcher Whitey Ford , 38 , who underwent surgery for a circulatory blockage after a sorry 2-5 season in 1966 . Ford was not going to sign his 1967 contract until he tested his repaired arm in spring training ; the World Champion Baltimore Orioles bombed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but against the Los Angeles Dodgers , Whitey went five innings and allowed just one run . So Ford signed for $65,000 . <P> There were all sorts of ways to get into print . Eddie ( " the Brat " ) Stanky , manager of the Chicago White Sox , did it by trading insults with Casey ( " the Professor " ) Stengel . Stanky was plumping for a new rule that would permit the same pinch hitter to appear more than once in a game ; Stengel called the proposal " a farce , " and Stanky retorted : " I do n't make rules for farces , no matter what any 75-year-old expert says . " Stengel is 76 . <P> Finally , there were the rookies ; and their flirtation with fame may very well end as soon as the pitchers throw them a few " jugs " - curves . But so far , at least , the 1967 harvest looks like a bumper crop . <P> The White Sox are singing the praises of Walter ( " No Neck " ) Williams , a runty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through four minor-league seasons . The Red Sox are high on Outfielder Reggie Smith , last year 's batting champion ( at .320 ) in the Class AAA International League . <P> Baltimore Manager Hank Bauer may have the drop on the rest of the rookie crew with California 's Mike ( " Super Jew " ) Epstein , who stands 6 ft. 3 in. , weighs 238 Ibs. , has a Star of David stenciled on his glove and can belt a baseball clear out of sight . The only trouble Hank has with Mike is carrying on a conversation . Mike , who studies social psychology in the offseason , likes to quote Socrates , Shakespeare and Ralph Waldo Emerson ; even when he is talking baseball , he tosses off such words as indigenous and meaningfulness . Bauer finally had to take him to task . " Do n't give me none of your high-falutin talk , " he ordered , " I ca n't understand you . " Which might get to be a problem if Mike passes the jug test .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
