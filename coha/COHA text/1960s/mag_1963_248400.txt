The U.S. 's 20 million Negroes have more income ( $27 billion annually ) than ever-and some pragmatic beliefs about spending it . " The quickest way to a white man 's conscience , " goes a favorite Negro saying , " is through his pocketbook . " This may hit the mark , because the most successful Negro civil rights stratagem so far has been neither sit-in nor lawsuit . Negro leaders , skirting restraint-of-trade laws , call the device " selective buying . " It is really a consumer boycott , and it can be devastatingly effective . <P> " Name the Traitor . " Northern and Southern techniques vary . Southern Negroes with broader goals boycott entire business districts as a community protest . In Birmingham , retailers have averaged a $750,000 weekly loss , some because Negro trade boycotted stores , some because whites did not venture downtown for fear of possible violence . " The boycott seems to be moderating , " says one businessman . " But it has been effective all right . " In Macon , Ga. , last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back only after the bus company , suffering a 50% fare loss , capitulated . Charleston , S.C. , Negroes won 16 clerks ' jobs by selective buying , tightened their boycott with weekly " name the traitor " meetings at which line breakers were singled out . Negro women in Jackson , Miss. , last week launched a " Do n't Buy on Capitol Street " campaign , stationed pickets outside J. C. Penney 's . <P> Success in such broadsides varies . But hitting all stores concurrently is never as potent as the single-shot selective buying staged by Northern Negroes for job equality . Last year 300 Detroit ministers asked their congregations to bypass Tip Top bread and Borden 's milk , and alerted nonchurchgoers among Detroit 's 400,000 Negroes with catchy leaflets ( " Lock the Gate . Elsie Wo n't Cooperate " ) . Negroes were soon hired or upgraded not only by those companies but by 40 more who got the message . Philadelphia ministers have singled out , among others , A. &; P. , Sun Oil , Tasty Baking Co. and Breyer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for 1,000 new jobs for Negroes , amounting to $4,000,000 more in Negro buying power . In Boston , Continental Baking Co. has just hired eight Negro salesmen after 29 days of selective buying by Negroes . <P> No Fault . Boycotts occasionally backfire because the companies involved are not really at fault . Hit by selective buying in Los Angeles , Anheuser-Busch showed that it was ready to hire Negro truck drivers but that the Teamsters Union was not . Against such union discrimination , some Negro boycott leaders are considering a new wrinkle , which they learned from labor itself : a general strike of all Negro workers that would call attention to the situation .
