Jessica was enrolled in nursery school as early as decency would permit . The idea was to get children out of the home and into the sandbox before any real damage was done . After two arduous years at La Paloma , a bright little bungalow in West Los Angeles , where Jessica sulked in a teepee , barked her shins on the seesaw , and swallowed gallons of room-temperature pineapple juice , she was prepared for the rigors of elementary school ? or so it was adjudged by " Bunny , " a sunny graduate from Wellesley , who wore peasant skirts , rayons , and sneakers . Bunny possessed occult powers of observation . She could determine , from watching her unsuspecting brood at play , significant personality configurations and telling evidence of academic potential . Of Jessica Canaan she reported : " She has a keen imagination , has twice been elected leader of the Sunflowers the boys ' group was called the Tiger Lilies  --  Jesse 's father indelicately referred to them as the Pistils andthe Stamens in a parents ' meeting , responds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her crayon work , and can go to the lavatory by herself . In short , we think she is ready for elementary school . " In the fall of 1942 Jesse entered public school . She loved it . She learned Joyce Kilmer 's " Trees " ( every last word including the dirty part about " upon whose snowy breast " ) , The Prayer of Thanksgiving " ( " Sing praises to His name , He forgets not His own " ) , and the National Anthem ( surely " daunzerli " light was the loveliest light of all ) . There she developed motor skills as well , such as window opening ( no knight with his lance was surer of his target than Jesse with her transom pole ) and eraser clapping ( Jesse was perhaps the last of the great blackboard washers ) . She also distinguished herself at both fire and air-raid drills . It seemed to her , even then , that there was something dramatically 85 correct about " absolutely no talking " as she rehearsed for annihilation . She was quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp the mechanics of arithmetic and spelling . The interest was there , but it began to wander rather quickly with apples to add , and oranges to subtract . She was made library monitor once , and thinking she could save the semester by really throwing herself into the job , she lovingly lettered a sign and hung it on the door . Embroidered with waxy daisies , it read : LIBARY . " Sound it out , " her teacher prompted wearily . " I did , " Jessica confessed sadly . Swept ahead by a relentless series of promotions , she also failed to grasp the importance of " outside reading . " Alas , it appeared that Jessica Canaan was not a speller , or a reader , or a divider . The Canaans were concerned . Her teacher was concerned . Jesse did n't seem to care at all . Then one day the Canaans overheard Jesse 's best friend , one Chucky " Chuckles " Hempstead , announce that he was studying to be a tackle for the Packers . " Well , now look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football , " Douglas Canaan soothed , " and it 's probably unfair for us to impose our values on the Hempsteads . " " I went through Vassar with Polly Hempstead . We went to the same boarding school . We came out ' together , for God 's sake , " Connie replied in a swivet . " So ? " Doug said , looking up over his paper . " So she knows better . That 's all . " " Snob . " " Alin I ! After listening to all that Boola-Boola nonsense for fifteen years , now I 'm supposed to believe you do n't care about education anymore ? All right then ..... 0onnie said , resigning herself openly , mysteriously . " All right what ? " " All right Jesse can be an airline stewardess then . " " That 's ridiculous , Connie . Jesse is n't going to be any airline stewardess . " " No ? Ask Jesse . She 's going to be an airline stewardess . Pan Am . " " That 's ridiculous . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ridiculous . " " Oh . And she 's going to marry Chucky . So when he 's not having his face pushed in , and she 's not handing out Chiclets over Santiago , or something , maybe they can come and see us . " " Look . I think we 're rushing things a little . They 're only eight , after all . " " Attitudes , and I quote Bunny , are formed early in life . Parents must help mold ? " " Who the hell is Bunny ? " " Bunny was Jesse 's teacher in pre-school . " " My God . Jesse 's only eight and she 's been in school five years . And she wants to be an airline stewardess ? Are n't they teaching her anything down there ? " Doug roared . " Where is this Bunny ? " " I just told you . She does n't have Bunny anymore . " " And a good thing too ! Who does she have now ? " " Elizabeth Trumwell . " " Oh . come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's her name . Honest . " " That 's what she wants you to think . But we both know nobody is really named Elizabeth Trumwell . " " Doug , please . This is serious . Miss Trumwell says Jesse is behind her age group in practically everything but Recess . I 'm going down there to have a talk with her . She says Jesse also distorts spatial relations . " " She does not , " Douglas said and then paused . " What 's spatial relations ? " he asked suspiciously . " I do n't know . But she distorts them . " " I see . Then we may conclude from all this that our daughter is not only mentally retarded but spatially distorted ? " " What a thing to say . " " And I was so hopeful when they said she could go to the bathroom by herself ? " " Doug . stop this . I 'm sure Jesse is as bright as anyone else . Brighter . " " Polly may have the right idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She and Chucky might make a wild passing combination , " he mumbled . " Doug . I 'm simply saying that it may mean some tutoring and that 's all . Lots of kids get behind . " " Well it seems to me that 's the school 's business . . . . What are they doing to her anyway ? She can read Time , sort of , fix a broken toilet , run a lemonade stand . I ca n't fix the toilet . And they make her out to be some sort of moron . We got ta get her out of there , " he said , shaking his head with alarm . The following morning Mrs. Canaan found herself perched on an undersized cream-yellow chair opposite the celebrated Elizabeth Trumwell . Connie had trouble concentrating on what Miss Trumwell was saying , despite her concern about Jesse 's curious lack of achievement in school , to which Miss Trumwell was addressing herself . It was something about Miss Trumwell 's carriage , the way she tilted her stiffened torso a sincere thirty degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her very grammar , were like conversationally achieved hospital corners . Connie wondered how Miss Trumwell managed to sit so modestly in her tiny chair , sure that she herself was offering an untoward display of garters and lingerie . " So we feel , that with a little more help in the home , some of the mechanics can be worked out to everyone 's satisfaction , " Miss Trumwell summarized . " Yes , of course , " Connie agreed vaguely , appraising a stupefying display of hand-lettered signs about the room . One read " My Reading " and listed titles like " Fun with Dick and Jane , " " Willy the Wallaby , " and " Honest Abe . " " The children make these signs ? " Connie asked idly . " No , no , I do , " Miss Trumwell smiled proudly . " They do n't make the signs . " " No  --  not yet . Perhaps next year . Some of the girls are coming along very nicely . " " Next year , " Connie repeated , not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right re-reading , " Willy the Wallaby . " " If I may interject here , Mrs. Canaan , I did want to talk to you about Jesse 's distortion of spatial relations . " " By all means , " Connie assented , feeling a run in her stocking creeping up her calf . " Jessica has been boasting that she and a friend with whom she plays Commandos ? " " Oh , Chucky Hempstead probably . " " Yes , I believe it was Charles . I was going to ask you , do they really play at being Com-mandos ? " " Oh , yes . Chucky fights the Japs and Jesse fights the Germans . They wo n't come in for dinner until they 've killed them all off 1 " Connie laughed merrily , alone . " Fascinating , " Miss Trumwell said . " I always say children are more interesting than adults . " Connie nodded her head ambiguously , certain that Miss Trumwell always said just that . Julia Whedon made the trip " Back East " three times before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV writer . She later settled down to attend Sarah Lawrence and Harvard as a Wood-roe ' Wilson Fellow . She is married , and has had stories in " Redbook " and " Seventeen . " " All this brings us nicely to the point . Jesse says that she and Charles mixed Coca-Cola , Pepsodent , thumbtacks , and library paste , sealed the bottle and sent it to Adolf Hitler , C/O Germany , the Second World War . " " Jess probably put Pepsodent in it because she thinks ' Irium ' sounds like something poisonous , " Connie giggled . " Yes , of course . Well , apart from the fact that the parcel would never get to Hitler , as it was improperly wrapped and did n't have enough postage  --  Hitler would n't drink that anyway . I mean to say , Mrs. Canaan , that we are talking about a basically infantile fantasy  --  and a rather hostile one at that . Since we regard this as more of a family or personality problem , I knew you would want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Mrs. Canaan , but frankly there was some question in this case ? " " I assure you Jessica is a whole child , " Connie replied frostily . " I was n't inferring that she ? " " Implying , " Connie broke in . " I 'll do the inferring . " " Implying , then , that Jessica was only part of a child . Goodness no . My point is this : she seems mixed up about the war . This is an instructive point for we educators . I might add . So often we forget how world affairs often make their mark on the lives and perceptions of children . " " What makes you think Jesse is confused about the war ? " " Well , for one thing , she thinks the Japanese are on our side . In any case , she does n't believe they 're the enemy . It 's most confusing for the other children . " " Go on , " Connie prompted . " She tells this story naturally we all know about Jessica 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway she says you had a Jap  --  a Japanese , a nisei I believe is the correct term there  --  uh , working in your garden . She says he was very nice and so on . Well , then , she says one day , without any warning , or reason , and here 's my point , that this nisei was carted away in a truck . Just like that . He was edging a lawn with a miniature lawn mower , and suddenly he was taken away . Naturally , as I say , we recognize much of the detail to be the distortion , or shall I say invention , of a very vivid imagination  --  the tiny lawn mower and so on . But I did want to tell you the story as it was told to me . " " He had a tiny lawn mower , " Connie asserted flatly . Tiny ? This tiny ? " Miss Trumwell triumphantly produced a crayon drawing . Jesse 's name was printed drunkenly in letters as tall as the trunks of the palm trees pictured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor guard of tulips , and a figure of a little yellow man pushing a small , ad-mittedly awfully small , lawn mower . " Well , maybe not that small .. . " Connie conceded . " Exactly . Spatial relations , Mrs. Canaan . Then the idea that this poor wretch was dragged off by the authorities for no good reason ? " " He was , " Connie interrupted . " Well , Mrs. Canaan , I 'm sure you and I can agree there was a reason . " " Miss Trumwell , you 're not talking about spatial relations  --  you 're talking about racial relations . " " Mrs. Canaan , I 'm not one for quibbling over semantics , and should have thought that this Hitler incident , this preoccupation with war , her willful distortion of reality , acting out . I was simply going to ask you if there was n't perhaps some trouble in the home . " " The home is just dandy , thank you all the same , and I 'm sure I do n't understand what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spatial relations . I still do n't know what it or they are , but evidently it had something to do with drawing tiny lawn mowers . Then I 'm told my daughter is some kind of nut because she sends Cokes through the mails . Then I find out we 're really talking about concentration camps . The gardener was her friend . There is a war going on . Jesse knows that . It was stupid and vile and inhumane that her friend was dragged off like that . It seems perfectly clear that Jesse , in her small way , was trying to say something about it all . " " Well , I hardly call sending a Coke through the mails a realistic solution . Had it opened , it might well have defaced some individual 's private property . Be realistic . It just was n't a good idea . I do think your daughter would be well advised to worry more about her numbers and spelling , and be less fanciful . After all , next year they 'll be doing decimals . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " my daughter will be enrolled in a private school back East where , I trust , they will he able to appreciate her imagination and teach her the fundamentals you mention without insulting her intelligence . Where , Miss Trumwell , they will a story by Julia Whedon 87 have my permission to teach her tooth by tooth , limb by limb , leaving what is left of my whole child to me . " " I 'm very sorry indeed to see you taking this attitude . Generally we find our parents ? " " And I 'm not your parent ! " Connie cut in , and finding herself in the advanced stages of high dudgeon , with nothing more to say , she stalked out of the classroom , down an antiseptic corridor , and into a blast of sunlight . She strode across the playground mumbling to herself . So Jesse was n't psychotic or braindamaged  --  that much was clear . And there was an outside chance Trumwell was one or both . Well , not really of course . . so Jesse sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mein Ftihrer . I had to give the messenger three pfennings for it . Not enough post-age . " " Ah so ! What have we here ? A Coke ! Join me , Goebbels ? " " No , Mein Ftihrer . I just finished a Doctor Pepper . " Connie giggled to herself , and then her expression changed . Jesse , given half a chance , would catch up in her subjects . If they could only get her into a decent school back East . It would all be different . The Canaans had always told themselves that living in California was a purely temporary arrangement . That one day they would go back East . Not only for their own sake but for Jesse 's . Jesse 's horizons were alarmingly trim . As far as she was concerned , North was the Sequoias , West was Pearl Harbor , South was Tijuana , and everything beyond the Mohave Desert was " back East . " Despite their resolve to move , the Canaans did n't free themselves until three years later . Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion was simply too attractive to turn down . Jessica and her teachers endured one another for three more photo-finish promotions , when finally the family decided to make the move . Jesse 's parents conducted a lot of good-natured psychological discussion about transitions and adjustments in a subtle effort to ease whatever fears and resentments Jesse might secretly harbor about breaking up old friendships and forming new ones . Are you going to miss Mrs. Hempstead ? " Jesse asked one day . " Of course I am , dear . Why ? " " I &lna.; You keep talking about how you 're going to miss all your old friends and everything . So I figured you were going to miss Mrs. Hempstead . " " Are n't you going to miss Chucky ? " Connie hinted wisely , sure that she had tapped the sweet , sad heart of the matter . " Nope . " " Chucky 's your best friend ! " " Chucky 's a dope . " " Jess , what a thing to say about your best friend . " " Ile 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why is he a dope ? " " Because I told him we were moving to New York and I gave him my whole playing-card collection  --  with Pinky and Blue Boy and everything  --  and he said ' I hope you do n't go back there and get stuck up or anything . ' Boy , is he a dope . " Connie looked at her daughter a moment , not knowing what to say . " Mom ? You do n't go back there and get stuck up or anything , do you ? " " Of course not . Chucky 's probably just a little jealous . " " He 's not jealous . He 's got my whole playing-card collection and he gets to stay here . What 's so good about New York , Mom ? " " Well , lots of things . Lots and lots of things . " " Give me a for instance . " " Well , for instance , they have carriages like in olden days , with horses . And there are subways , and double-decker buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in store windows . And the Automat . Oh , you 'll love the Automat . You put a nickel in a slot and a little window opens and there 's a piece of chocolate pie . " " You can see all the food ? " Jesse asked . " All the food . And you can have whatever you want . And best of all  --  New York has seasons . You 'll like having seasons . " " Do they have tuna sandwiches ? " " Hmmm ? " Connie said , distracted by thoughts of windy days on Fifth Avenue . " Behind the little windows ? " " Oh , I 'm sure they must . " " Seasons , " Connie thought , sighing to herself . All Jesse knew about fall was making cut-out turkeys in school , of orange and purple , to paste on the windows . And when the surrealistic gobblers began to fade and curl , up went the snowflakes , also orange and purple , fashioned with blunt-nosed scissors . And then in spring  --  Crayola tulips of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turtles were placed in foster homes ( Jesse 's turtle named Turtle was reluctantly placed with Chucky , who also had a turtle named Bob Water-field ) . A team of great sweaty moving men arrived on the scene , and with leather wristlets and throbbing temples , stowed the furniture in their van . It seemed odd to Jessica that a whole house could be so tidily compressed in a single truck . It left her with an inexplicable feeling that their possessions were n't worth much after all . Even stranger was the realization that if you turned left at the end of their street , and kept going , you 'd get to New York . She 'd always imagined that New York was somewhere beyond the gully that ran behind the house , She 'd been warned not to wander too far off in the weeds , so it seemed natural that New York should be in that direction . But down Belleview and turn left  --  that was right on the way to the A &; P. Jessica had begun the trip back East a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Canaans boarded a plane in the winter of 1948 and headed for their new home  --  an establishment called Castle Village on the Upper West Side . " Castle Village  --  is n't that just like in a fairy tale ? " Connie said enthusiastically to her daughter . Jesse remained silent , her large brown eyes fastened on the sights below . Geometric night-lighted pools sparkled shamelessly beneath them like semi-precious stones . " It 's high on a cliff overlooking the Hudson  --  named after the very Henry Hudson you 've read about . " Jesse remained silent . " Remember Henry Hudson ? " " Nope , " Jesse answered . " Sure you do . Think . " " He was an explorer . " " Right ! See ? And what did he discover . . . ? " " The Hudson River , " Jesse sighed . " Right , darling . You see , all you had to do was try . " " But that 's stupid , Mom . It 's like when Edgar Bergen asks Mortimer Snerd who the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not the same thing at all , and there 's no reason to get smart with me , " Connie snapped irritably . " And it just so happens our new apartment looks out over the George Washington Bridge , " she added truculently , irrelevantly . Connie sank back in her seat and lit a cigarette . She thumbed through a brochure which included cheerful cartoons demonstrating how people escape from an airplane when it drops into the sea . She snapped it shut and looked at her husband across the aisle . A passenger lurched by on his uncertain route to the toilet . " Hi ? " Connie said to Doug hopefully . " Hi , " Doug soothed . After a month in New York , Connie began to worry about Jesse . She was n't adjusting . Not even a little bit . She was suffering . Connie felt partially to blame . All the promises she had made . The carriages turned out to be inflationary , the double-deckers had been taken off the line , the subways were dirty , and the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault ? Things change . It seemed as if the only friend Jesse had was a middle-aged woman in 2B . Jesse visited her every afternoon . " What do you talk about ? " Connie asked idly one day . " Different things . " " I know  --  but what kinds of things ? " " I tell her about California and she tells me about her husband . " " Oh ? I thought she was a widow . " " She is . She keeps her husband 's ashes in an urn by the fireplace . " " What a grisly thought . Are you sure ? " " Oh yes . She showed me . " " Did n't that scare you 7 " " No , " . Jesse responded thoughtfully . " She told me that there was one man who had his ashes sprinkled over New York . I think when I die I 'd like to be sprinkled over somewhere . " " Oh , Jess , " Connie said , frowning at her daughter . Jesse pulled up a chair in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge with a pair of binoculars . " What do you see ? " Connie asked from her chair . " I just counted fifty dollars , " Jesse replied . " Daddy says if I stayed here an hour I 'd probably count a thousand . " " You might at that , " Connie sighed . " That must be the richest bridge in the world , " Jesse said vaguely . Suddenly she leaned forward and started spinning the focus mechanism . " Hey Mom ! Look out there . Something funny ! " " What is it ? " Connie said with alarm , racing to the window . She peered into the night . Down below the streets were white and the sounds of the cars had become muffled . " Snow ! Jesse ! Your first snow ! Put down the binoculars and look ! " Swiftly it became like a storm in a paperweight , swirling , thickening , eddying around the building . Jesse 's eyes became huge with looking . a story by Julia Whedon 89 " It 's queer ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the windows . " That 's really snow . " " It 's beautiful  --  quick call Daddy , " Connie said . " I see it , " Doug smiled as he strolled into the room . " Did it used to snow like this when you used to live here ? " Jesse asked them . They looked at each other and smiled . " Well , sort of . But not as good as this . No , I think the snow is better now than it used to be , " Doug answered soberly . " Really ? " " Absolutely . " " I 'm going to make hot chocolate and we can all sit here in front of the window . How 's that ? " Connie asked , leaving the room without waiting for an answer . Doug stood over Jesse and looked out into the night . Then he walked over to a window , opened it , and swept some snow off the ledge . He packed it into a tight hall and handed it to Jesse . " Have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her palm , firm and cold . " Now what ? " she asked . " Throw it , " Doug answered . " Right here ? What will Mother say ? " " Do n't ask . " Jesse eyed the room slowly , then let loose with a terrific line drive at her father . It caught him on the forehead just as Connie entered the room . " Jesse ! What are you doing ? " Connie de-manded , horrified . Doug packed another snowball and pitched it at Connie . " Do n't ! " she cried too late . " Has everyone gone crazy ? " she yelled , ducking still a third snowball . " Aw , it 's just water , " Doug argued weakly . " Just water  --  well try one yourself ! " she yelled , pitching a handful of snow at them both . The fight was on . They ducked behind wing chairs , dove under coffee tables , pitching snow , crying , " bully , " " cheater , " " rat " until they fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement , thought of all the wonders of the world  --  they were all in Ripley 's . The seven-year-old girl who had a baby , the Chinese man with ten-inch fingernails , the man who slept on nails . Now this , her first personal wonder of the world . " You know what ? " Jesse yawned . " What ? " her parents asked in unison . " Maybe I 'll have my ashes sprinkled over New York . " " Aw , Jess . That 's disgusting , " Doug reproved . " That 's all you know , " Connie interrupted , smiling gratefully at her daughter .
