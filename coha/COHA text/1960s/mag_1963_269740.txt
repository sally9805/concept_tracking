Atlanta 's ambitious Emory University , which had searched a year for a new president , last week snagged just the man . He is Sanford Soverhill Atwood , 50 , pipe-smoking provost of Cornell University . In grabbing Presbyterian Atwood , the trustees , who by charter are two-thirds Methodists , happily broke a tradition of Methodists as presidents that goes clear back to the school 's founding 127 years ago . Atwood simply " swept this campus by storm , " said Acting President Judson C. Ward . <P> Agronomist Atwood is a Phi Beta Kappa out of the University of Wisconsin , where he simultaneously earned B.A. and M.A. degrees , later got his doctorate in plant cytology . He went to Cornell in 1944 as an expert on developing new kinds of hay and other forage crops , became dean of the graduate school in 1953 and provost of the university in 1955 . Popular with the faculty , Atwood might have succeeded Cornell 's retiring President Deane W. Malott . This spring the job went to an outsider , Carnegie Corporation Vice President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Refreshing Pause . Atwood credits Emory with " the greatest potential of any private university in the country . " New presidents always talk that way , but Emory has plenty of promise . Named for an early Methodist bishop , it was horn a country college in Oxford , Ga. , had a heady rebirth in 1915 after the Methodist Church divorced Tennessee 's Vanderbilt University . Having dumped Vandy , the Methodists launched two new universities-Emory and Southern Methodist in Dallas . Atlanta 's Coca-Cola King Asa G. Candler gave land and $1,000,000-leading to a short-lived suggestion that Emory be renamed for Thomas Coke , another early bishop . Thus lured to Atlanta , Emory still drinks from the same bottle . Coca-Cola money accounts for about half its $70 million assets , and the current Coke king , Alumnus Robert Woodruff , is Emory 's biggest single angel . <P> An odd pile of Italian Renaissance buildings huddled on a sweeping , 500-acre campus , Emory has 4,200 students , one-third of them women . Graduate students set the pace , and sports are played down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat down in the courts a Georgia law threatening its tax-exempt status if it integrated . This fall it expects to enroll half a dozen Negroes , including Hamilton Holmes , the University of Georgia 's first male Negro graduate , who will become Emory 's first Negro medical student . <P> Law &; Medicine . Emory has the Deep South 's first fully accredited law school and a topflight medical school that supervises six hospitals , delivers 7,000 babies a year , has a $3,000,000 research budget . Medical alumni include two of the world 's leading cancer fighters : Drs . John R. Heller Jr . and the late Thomas M. Rivers . The university also produced three noted historians-Yale 's C. Vann Woodward , Virginia 's Dumas Malone , Stanford 's David Potter - plus Columbia Classicist Moses Hadas ( see story below ) , Golfer Bobby Jones and the late Veep Alben Barkley.
