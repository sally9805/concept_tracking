" Daddy , buy me a program . I ca n't tell the players . " <P> " Everybody knows these players , son . This is the All-Star game . See that old fellow with the funny crouch ? That 's Stan Musial . The one with the frown is Roger Marls ; the right fielder with the limp is Mickey Mantle . And that fellon-whose cap keeps falling off-that 's Willie Mays . See how easy it is ? " " Daddy , who 's on third ? " " Here 's 50 son , Go buy a program . " <P> The 45,480 fans shoehorned into Washington 's brand-new stadium for last week 's All-Star game could be pardoned for wondering who was on third ; the Minnesota Twins ' Rich Rollins was not even a big-league regular this time last year . But when American League players , managers and coaches cast their All-Star ballots for the 1962 games , they not only elected Third Baseman Rollins to the team , but they also gave the 24-year-old third baseman more votes ( 184 out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the league , including Mantle and Maris . <P> " Everything Right . " In the first of the two games last week , Rollins proved that he was worth the votes . He was the only American League standout in a contest that saw Willie Mays cover centerfield like a vacuum cleaner , Maury Wills steal everything except the Scoreboard , the National League win 3-1 . But in a losing cause , Rollins handled three hot shots to third flawlessly , and shut off a National League rally with a one-hand grab of Tommy Davis ' ripping sixth-inning grounder . At bat , he was the only American Leaguer to reach base twice , scored his team 's lone run . Said Rollins : " Maybe after you 've been picked for the All-Star team five or six times , you can think you 're pretty good . But a man in my position ca n't afford to think that way . I 'm not a success yet . " <P> Perhaps not quite yet , but at $8,000 a year , Rollins is certainly the year 's best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits ( 108 ) , ranks fourth in batting ( .315 ) , fourth in R.B.I.s ( 59 ) . and his hot bat is the main reason why the Twins , seventh-place finishers last season , are basking in the American League 's first division . " Even when the team is doing everything wrong , " says Minnesota Manager Sam Mele , " Rich does everything right . He hits with one on , he hits with two on , and he hits with none on . With seven more like him , we might never lose a game . " <P> Son of a Cleveland welder , Rollins was one of those college phenoms that the scouts all rush to see-and then dismiss . <P> At Ohio 's Kent State University , he flashed a .358 batting average in his senior year . But he was short , bowlegged and stubby-armed . Worse yet , he wore glasses to correct astigmatism in his right eye . Only the Twins were interested enough to make an offer . Two years ago , they signed him up for a paltry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Class B Carolina League .
