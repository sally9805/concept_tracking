that title . There was something monkeyish about her , too . Her tiny wrists and ankles , emaciated by long illness ; her bright eyes rimmed with black , made me think of delicate monkeys from the rain forests . " Do you think I look like a monkey ? " she asked me once with disapproval , in a deep voice . " Of course , " I said , but added quickly , " you understand that I love monkeys above all creatures . And besides they are divided into twelve wildly diversified groups , one of which , the Hominoids , includes man . So everybody reminds me of some kind of monkey ! " She pretended to be mollified at this . My Calendar Is Flexible Princess Caetani gave a luncheon party for Tania at Ninfa . ( " Nymph " ) , a ruined medieval town south of Rome named for the icy mountain stream which flows through it .

The Caetani family restored the town hall for a country house , using the rest of the town as a garden . The Princess and her daughter had rare plants and roses from all over the world planted around the ruins . Streams run through the gardens , the sound of running water is everywhere , and the nightingales sing by day , especially from a huge thicket of oleander . If one remembers the tone of Isak Dinesen 's tales , it is easy to see how Ninfa was a perfect site for her entertainment . Two big round tables had been set under the magnolia tree on the lawn near the house . Princess Caetani presided over one , Tania over the other .

" How is it , " asked a man near Tania , " that you never write about modern times in your fiction ? " " I do , " she replied , " if you consider that the time of our grandfathers , that just-out-of-reach time , is so much a part of us . Also I write about characters who together are the tale . I begin , you see , with a flavor of the tale . Then I find the characters , and they take over . They make the design ; I simply permit them their liberty .

" " But all your work takes place in the nineteenth century , does n't it ? " " More or less . I may begin in the eighteenth and come right up to the first world war ; my calendar is flexible . Those times have been sorted out ; they are clearly visible . Besides , so many novels that we think are contemporary in subject with their date of publication ? such as novels of Dickens or Faulkner or Tolstoi or Turgenev ? are really set in an earlier period , a generation or so back . The present is always unsettled , no one has had time to contemplate it in tranquillity . No painter wants the subject right under his nose ; one wants to stand back and study a landscape with half-closed eyes .

I did n't play very well , but the idea was the thing and the bubbly sounds of the instrument were nothing if not bucolic . Besides it excited the nightingales and they all tuned up . But then we heard a tremendous explosion of dynamite on the hillside beyond Ninfa . " I thought we 'd done something about them , " said the Princess , shading her eyes to stare off in that direction . " It 's a new quarry . " Prince Roffredo Caetani , then in his nineties , turned to Tania . " Are you acquainted with Buffalo Bill ? " he inquired . " I have n't had the pleasure , " she answered , looking into a pocket mirror which Clara had produced . Clara had whispered something in Danish about the pollen on her nose and now Tania was whisking it off . * * One Sunday morning we went to see the Etruscan collection in the Villa Giulia .

I suppose because his sweet fat helps to keep us warm in the darkest and coldest time . Very intelligent animal .... Look at the lion on that sarcophagus . How could the Etruscans have known the lion ? In Africa it was the animal I loved best . " " What made you decide to go to Africa ? " " Theodore Roosevelt , as much as anything .

From my first day in Africa I loved the country and felt at home . I was very keen on shooting in my young days , but my great interest all through the years in Africa was the African natives of all tribes , in particular the Somali and the Masai . They were beautiful , noble , fearless , and wise people . " " I suppose that you began to write seriously there ? " " No , I began to tell stories seriously there . The Africans are great listeners . I never once wanted to be a writer .

When I was quite young , I studied painting at the Danish Royal Academy ; then I went to Paris to study in 1910 but I did little work . The impact of Paris was too great ; I felt it was more important to go about and see pictures , to see Paris in fact . I painted a little in Africa arid , yes , I did write there to entertain myself and I told stories constantly to the natives , all kinds of nonsense ; they loved it . I 'd say , ' Once there was a man who had an elephant with two heads , ' and right away the natives would say , ' Oh ? Yes , well , Mem-Sahib , 50 ISAK DINESEN CONQUERS ROME how did he find it , and how did he manage to feed it ? ' and the tale would go on .

I 'd say things like ' Wakamba na kula mamba , ' which means , ' The people of the Wakamba tribe eat snakes , ' and which would have infuriated them as a prose statement but amused them mightily in rhyme . Afterwards , they 'd always say , ' Please , Mem-Sahib , talk like rain , ' so then I knew how much they liked it , for rain was very precious to us there . And listening was a fine art . Nowadays people ca n't listen very long to something related , unless they 're very simple or very worldly indeed . For me , all of fiction is divided into what can be told and what can only be written , One can tell ' Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves ' but one ca n't tell Anna Karenina . And a real storyteller 's pleasure consists in rearranging details each time he tells the story . " When Clara came in breathless , Tania turned to her .

After a brief glimpse of the rain-grayed city from the flooded terrace we went in and found a table in a little brocaded room with brightly colored carpets and pictures . " This is very pleasant , " Tania said . " I was here in 1912 . " Then she looked about , and suddenly uttered a little scream . " Oh , I shall go mad ! " " What is it ? " I asked , alarmed . " Look how crooked that picture is ! " she said , pointing to a blackened portrait across the room . " I 'll straighten it ! " I cried , and jumped up and went to it . " Like this ? " " No , more to the right , " said Tania , eyes half-closed . Two bald Roman gentlemen whose table was below the picture looked hopelessly confused . " That 's better . " " It 's like that at home , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to keep straightening the pictures . " " Aeroplanes , " muttered Tania , lighting a cigarette . ' ' Do you mind if we just stay here for a while ? I hate to change once I 'm installed in a decor I like . People are always telling me to hurry up , to come on for this or that . Once when I was sailing around the Cape of Good Hope and there were albatrosses , people kept saying , ' Come on in , it 's time for lunch , ' and I said , ' Damn lunch ? I can eat lunch any day of my life , but I sha n't see albatrosses again . ' Such wingspread ! " Thus the days passed , and my ravenous curiosity about Isak Dinesen was satisfied a little . We talked of everything on earth , especially of books and theatre . And then her visit to Rome came to an end . One night we said our goodbyes in the lobby of the Flora , and next morning Tania and her Sancho Panza flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was amusing to meet such an original , " said Princess Caetani . But why must she wear all that black around her eyes ? " Rut the Princess was very pleased with a group of manuscripts that Tania had consented to show for Botteghe ( ) scare , and she chose one of the longest , loveliest , and most evocatively Danish , " A Country Tale , " which appeared amidst a flurry of excitement , since Tania had not published a new book in ten years . Only One Tania During the war Tania had written a wildly romantic novel called The Angelic Avengers , which she published under a pseudonym . After the reading public finally caught on to the fact that the mysterious " Pierre Andre-zel " was really " Isak Dinesen , " there were several odd affairs of books by other authors attributed to the Baroness . In November 1956 , I mentioned one such attribution in a letter to Tania . She wrote right back : " I am not the author of Madame Solaria .

You will be receiving the faire-part of my coming marriage , also of my conversion to the Orthodox Church someday of the new year . Yours ever , on earth , as in the treetops . . . " But there was another book which was rather more of a problem . Tania was reluctant to discuss the matter , but I heard from Danish friends that it had saddened her , seeing herself stolen from and copied in a very inferior manner . It seems that a certain writer , a kind of adventurer who had knocked about the world , went to great trouble to be introduced to Tania , who received him with the usual generosity she showed to writers and painters and musicians . After she had known him for a year or so , her bookseller called one day and asked her , " Is it true that you have a new book of tales coming out under a completely new pseudonym ? " She insisted that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very reliably informed . A radio interviewer telephoned to ask the same question . The publishers recorded a large advance sale for the book , which was a series of tales of a plague year in Europe . Controversy raged . Indeed , the author had lifted bits and pieces from the Seven Gothic Tales , giving himself away in an amusing fashion . Tania kept and smiled ruefully over a note the younger writer once sent her . " Dear Baroness , " it purred , " every time I visit you , I take something away with me . . . " Shortly after Tania returned to Denmark , I heard that by chance the original manuscript of the book was in Rome , and I decided to get my hands on it . Since she shared my own sense of the magical properties of physical objects , I thought it would amuse her to make an incantation over this one and toss it into her grate .

My book Last Tales is coming out on the fourth of November , and I want to be away from Denmark on that day . Otherwise people ring you up too much . I have considered flying to Rome ? with Clara ? just for three or four days . Do you think there would be people in Rome prepared to make those three or four days really sweet to me , so that I should think of them later on with tears of joy in my eyes ? Would anybody ask me for dinner on the fourth in that pleasant place where the pictures all needed straightening , and tell me I look just seventeen years old ? Or would anybody ask me for supper at the darkest den of Trastevere , haunt of thieves and murderers ? Or could you possibly arrange a rendezvous with a Cardinal for me in moonlight in Piazza Navona ? Do send me a word . . . . The swallows and nightingales are now leaving us to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome , to drop a light Louis XVI kiss on you . . . . I danced a jig ! I could n't sleep that night for thinking of what partyings and surprises should be arranged . I decided to make a Party Committee and chose three extraordinary creatures , each of whom could have been invented by Tania : the Contessa Mitty Risi d'Ambra and Mrs. Virginia Campbell Becker ( both artists ) and Princess Briama Carafa d'Andria , a writer . They each agreed to give a great party . The third , fifth , and seventh of November were decided upon , so I hastily sent to Tania a proposed schedule of events , calling it " The Festival of the Two Monkeys " ( Menotti had just announced " The Festival of Two Worlds , " the first annual Spoleto summer festival ) . Mitty asked her maid Adriana 's mother to bring from the Tuscan woods a kind of mushroom which is available only in the first week of November , and only then if the rains have been ample and at the right moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began working on guest lists . Now I have always liked a party , and consider fun worth any amount of preparation . I like a sense of fantasy , of the commonplace slain . So I went to work choosing music , painting a souvenir fan for each evening ( with spaces for all the guests to write their names ) , and working on a marionette play to be performed in the Deckers ' marionette theatre . It was all really like an unwritten Gothic tale called " The Festivities . " At . the Spoleto Opera I had been impressed with a fine American soprano of Italian origin , Jeannette Pecorelloi She agreed to sing Tania 's favorite French songs . The pianist Alda Bellasich started learning some unknown Albinoni sonatas she had discovered in the British Museum . The Afro-Cuban singer Wanani , tall and elegant , known as " The Gazelle , " agreed to sing some Carib songs . A cable went to America , asking the composer David Walker to write some music for the marionette spectacle . ( It arrived too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolly Sisters dance for Tania and Clara , called " Twirl Parasols and Kiss . " ) I was beside myself when I picked up Tania and Clara at the airport . Seeing the Baroness in her mountainous bearskin coat reaching to the floor , with her black cloche poking impudently up out of it , I had the impression that I was living in a tale she was even at that moment writing . But I never doubted that she was a sorceress . More Magic 0 n the evening of November 3 , / fetched her in a taxi from her hotel to go to the first of our parties . As we set out I told her , " By dint of bribery , Latin skulduggery , and plain old-fashioned theft , I have right in my hand the original manuscript of the plagiary . I thought we might begin festivities by dumping it into the Tiber . " Her eyes lit up with sparkling mischief and she said throatily , " Yes ! Yes , yes , yes ! " 52 ISAK DINESEN CONQUERS ROME It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rome , but . the taxi driver obviously knew , seeing Tania 's bearskin , that no ordinary mortal was his passenger , so obediently he stopped smack in the middle of the narrow bridge that crosses the island , and we very ceremoniously got out . It 's always a pleasure to hold up the business of the world , and the more impatient and irritated that world is , the greater the pleasure in making it stand still . We stopped traffic for two blocks , and they blew horns and shouted Roman insults , but our taxi driver just looked wide-eyed at us as we went to the side of the bridge and performed our ritual . Tania , Clara , and I each held a corner of the manuscript and recited together , very slowly and solemnly : Rat shit , Bat shit , Three-toed sloth shit , Tiber and Oblivion Receive this book and its author ! And we dropped the manuscript and watched it sink . Since the author died shortly thereafter , I am now very careful with magic of this sort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a fine painter . Her apartment was one of the wonders of Rome . On the island in the Tiber is an old building constructed in the Middle Ages and attached to a tower from which the Caetani once dropped hot lead on their embattled cousins . For most of the last century and some of this one , the structure was a morgue for suicides fished out of the Tiber . Mitty found it empty , seized it , ripped out walls , tore up floors , and created a beautiful multi-level apartment looking onto water on both sides , Here , that evening , painters and writers and musicians came to honor Tania . First was a dinner which included the famous Tuscan mushrooms , served raw in a salad . Then came the reception , and champagne flowed like ditchwater . The guests included a swarm of famous Europeans , along with young Americans ? even the latest-arrived Fulbright scholars ? and a cross section of Rome , from the Almanac ! ! de Gotha to the police register . A good party has to have worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of the fourth we went out to dinner to celebrate the publication of Last Tales in five countries . Later that night I finished a manuscript of a cookery book with illustrations which I intended as a gift for Tania the following day . It was called The Dainty Glutton 's Handbook . My thought was that she should have fresh bouquets and new gifts or surprises at least three times a day during her visit . Some of them were mighty far-fetched but amused her , like a housefly carved in mother-of-pearl which demimondaines once glued in their ears . One was a small box made like a mandarin orange , filled with odd fragments of sea-smoothed glass . Others were more prosaic , such as books . I Was Promised a Cardinal The fifth was the great day of the marionette spectacle . The Beckers lived then in Palazzo Caetani and had a room set aside for their marionette theatre .

When the lights dimmed , the slow movement of a Handel oboe concerto was heard , and the curtains opened to show a drop with the title of the play worked out in jewels , feathers , and butterflies : Tania-Tania and Clara , Too ! This drop rose to reveal a snowy landscape seen through a scrim , with snow falling , and a tiny figure of Tania ( immediately recognizable ) sitting on a snowbank . Virginia Becker had invented splendid costumes for all the characters but the one for the puppet of Tania was the don : a cloche hat made of green parrot feathers , a miniature fox stole . and real diamonds . As the music died away , the figure stepped forward and said , " This is Denmark , it is winter , and 1 am Tania Blixem Facts are seldom important . Now I shall speak in blank verse .

There were coffee cups painted with butterflies , a crystal pendant from George Sand 's house , a buffalo cheese , French perfume , seashells from the seven seas , fans , hooks . my cookbook ( my idea was that clroolworthy recipes might jog Tania 's failing appetite ) , a kerchief with a view of the Bay of Naples . etc. , etc . Tania was like a child on Christmas morning as she tore at the wrappings . " I 'm so happy that I could dance ! " she said when she 'd opened everything . Then she added , " I will dance !

Princess Carafa 's rooftop apartment has a glass wall ; it was delightful to watch the twinkling lights off in the Borghese Gardens while we listened to the music . The next night Clara and Tania came to dine in my little house , which was not much larger than a refrigerator crate and was perched on a hillside in Trastevere . From ground level . in a dead-end alley filled with tin cans and broken glass , one climbed 157 steps through a garden to arrive . The terrace was covered by grapevines and honeysuckle , and from the front door one looked across far-off roofs to the mountains in the distance . " I want to see your house , " Tanis had said . " I want to know exactly what your setting is like , when r return to Denmark and think of you . " She decided that it was veritably an owl 's nest or an eyrie .

She said that while she lay in the hospital she had invented a series of interwoven tales to keep her sane . Albondocani was the name , and Naples in the early nineteenth century was the setting . The heroine was a gypsy girl who 'd been raised artfully for one purpose : to entice and destroy the young prince who had been raised in total ignorance of poverty or misery . Naturally they would fall in love , the opposites that make an entity . There were to be at least two hundred tales in all . " I should like this work to be one page longer than Proust , " Tania told me . The title of the Last Tales , of course , was one of her jokes : she planned to publish afterwards a greater number of pages than she had until then . When John Becker took us to the airport the next day , he made arrangements for her to go directly to the plane without the usual messing about . She murmured something about knowing she would never see Rome again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trevi Fountain , that old ritual which is supposed to ensure one 's return to Rome , she had gone through all the motions , but had kept her coin in her hand . John had ordered an enormous bouquet of the freshest and most beautiful celery , tied in ribbons and cellophane as though it were roses . There were violets and candied almonds as well . Sancho Panza was directing a bevy of porters laden with gifts and souvenirs , but insisted on carrying the most fragile herself . As they went out onto the runway , Tania turned and smiled and raised her hand in one deliberate gesture , then turned smartly and went off , the wind fooling with her scarf . It was the last time I saw her . I never was able to accept her invitation to visit her in Denmark ; I never had enough cash on hand for the trip . News of her death in September 1962 reached me , curiously enough , by way of a friend in Persia . I read the letter on a beach near Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . The news was appropriately acknowledged by the elements : a hailstorm in midsummer . I sat in a shack with water dripping down my neck , and the waves pounding the shore about ten yards away . I found an envelope in my pocket and wrote an apotheosis to the marionette play : A chariot pulled by wild swans appears and Tania gets in . ISABELLA : But where is she going now ? CARDINAL : To Africa , to run a finishing school for young lionesses . ARLECHINO : To the Ganges , to teach the gavotte to the gnats . PTERROT : She 's so busy , so everywhere at once ! Miss ROME : Why it 's true , she 's going off in every direction ! EVERYBODY ( murmuring admiringly ) : How clever of her ! How simultaneous ! Goodbye ! Ciao ! Au ' voir ! So long ! Ci vediamo !

Later , the American painter Clifford Wright , who lives near Copenhagen , said that at dawn on the night after she died , he happened to be passing Tania 's house at Rungsted , and saw a most rare sight : Two wild swans rose suddenly and flew away .
