At the Indianapolis Speedway and in theaters across the land a vast , unprecedented audience tensed for the start of the 48th 500-mile race . It had assembled  --  some 260,000 persons at the Speedway , another half a million before theater television screens  --  to witness a decisive struggle between the traditional Indy roadsters and swift , insurgent rear-engine cars . But less than five minutes after the start an exploding smashup snuffed out the life of one driver and fatally injured another , and from that moment on the race was not to the swift and car styles did not matter . It became , grimly and awesomely , a 500-mile race of men brave enough to stay in it and see it through . // In the end the winner was A.J. Foyt , of all the drivers the man most unshakably immune to the clash of cars and the smoke of death . He won driving calmly , icily at a record average speed of 147.35 mph through an atmosphere of high tension that made this year 's race  --  more than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macabre . // Foyt 's brilliant triumph was shadowed by the casualties of the day . A Speedway rookie , Dave MacDonald , and a veteran , Eddie Sachs , lay dead . Smooth old professionals , among them the 1963 winner , Rufus Parnell Jones , were sidelined with injuries and burns . Twenty-one drivers were out of the race in a somber accumulation of crashes and engine and tire failures ; Gasoline Alley was a clutter of broken cars and on the track a bleak testament to the dead remained  --  the powdery white residue of fire-extinguishing foam . // The race raised questions that would certainly alter future 500s , the most crucial concerning the relative hazards of gasoline as opposed to alcohol fuel . And it left the dispute over car design still unsettled . // It was Foyt 's unbending nerve that brought him out of it the winner . His final challenger  --  once Jones was put out of the race by a freakish pit-stop accident  --  was Rodger Ward , that steady old fox of the backstretch , usually a nerveless driver , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chance for victory by making a series of vital mistakes and five pit stops , " two more than we needed . " // " I thought I was n't getting the fuel to the engine properly , " said Ward after the race , wearily rubbing track grime from his face and looking his 43 years . " But I was running the fuel mixture too rich and burning it away . The first time I found I was out of fuel I could n't believe it . The car was capable of winning  --  the car should have won  --  but the driver did n't do a good job . " // In winning , Foyt earned $153,650 prize money , the richest purse in 500 history , and took a long lead toward his fourth national driving championship . He also became , against the backdrop of the day 's tragedy , the leading spokesman of racing 's old guard , those who cling to Indy 's traditional Offenhauser-powered , alcohol-burning , front-engine roadsters. // " I am sorry those guys died , " said Foyt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing . // " But I am afraid of those rear-engine cars . I am scared of having all that gasoline around me in that type of chassis . Why , damn it , you are sitting on gasoline , you have gasoline on each side of you . Well , I can carry just as much fuel in my front-engine car  --  my so-called antique car  --  with a much greater safety margin . " // Foyt had not been the only one concerned about the safety margin . At the customary meeting of all drivers the day before the race , Chief Steward Harlan Fengler had made it a special point . " Gentlemen , please , " he said , " remember that you will be starting the race with heavy loads of fuel , and your cars will handle differently than when they are light . Be careful out there . " // But on race morning , under a charcoal-gray sky and with a chill wind blowing across the Indiana plain , thoughts of the dangers of racing were submerged in a scene of festival gaiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of colored balloons rose from the infield . Then , two minutes after the start of the race , some five minutes after Speedway President Anton Hulman had barked out his traditional " Gentlemen , start your engines , " the fantastic series of accidents began . // Scotland 's Jimmy Clark , his face taped for protection against the wind , jumped impressively into the lead from his pole position . His Lotus-Ford is so low-hanging that it looks like a water bug skimming along the track , and on the first lap  --  at a record 149.775 mph  --  he had pulled in front of the pack by some 200 yards . On the second lap he came whining past in a blur of British racing green at 154.613 mph . Behind him came disaster . // Twenty-six-year-old Dave MacDonald , a fine sports car man racing his first 500 in a Ford-engined car built by speed merchant Mickey Thompson , suddenly veered out of control rounding the last turn before the homestretch . He caromed like a deadly billiard shot off the low walls on both sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puff of orange . In the seconds that followed the race became a fiery tangle . Six other cars were caught in the path of fire MacDonald had painted across the track . Some made it through . Eddie Sachs , who had said before the race , " You will find me out there in the middle of things , " did not . His Ford-engined American Red Ball Special slammed into MacDonald and spun away . An explosion made an enormous whoosh . Sachs was crushed against his steering wheel by the violence of the collision and was apparently already dead when fire engulfed his car . A huge , ragged pillar of black smoke rose above the wreckage . // Not far away Driver Ronnie Duman , his clothing afire , popped out of his burning Offenhauser , leaped a retaining wall and rolled on the grass to extinguish the flames . Bobby Unser in a Novi Ferguson , Johnny Rutherford in an Offenhauser and Chuck Stevenson in an Offenhauser threaded their way to safety . // The race was stopped , the first time ever due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the next hour , while work crews cleaned the track , the drivers regrouped on the track opposite the principal grandstand . // Over the public address system came the somber announcement : Sachs was dead . The crowd stood , uncovered and fell silent in a long moment of tribute . The drivers froze in a tableau of bright-colored uniforms . An hour and 45 minutes after MacDonald 's fateful slide , the race began again . // But now , chillingly , the atmosphere had changed . The long-awaited battle between old and new , between Offenhauser and Ford , did not seem so important . The surviving cars lined up single file for the restart in the order in which they had been running . Foyt , in fifth place , pulled on red golfing gloves , banging his fists together like a boxer to tighten them across his knuckles . He rested coolly in his cockpit , three sticks of gum taped on top of the driveshaft housing , just below his left arm where he could reach them handily . At the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew . He fidgeted with his helmet , finally climbed into the Lotus . // The engines sounded again , and after the inspection lap by the pace car , Clark sprinted ahead once more . Bobby Marshman made a great rush at him in a 1963 Lotus-Ford that was the track 's fastest in practice . He took the lead and poured it on , pulling away from Clark with astonishing ease . Behind Clark came Ward and next was Dan Gurney 's Lotus-Ford . Those four Fords in front looked unbeatable as Jones and Foyt struggled in fifth and sixth place to uphold the old guard . On this day , however , nothing was sure or certain . // With only 40 of the race 's 200 laps run , Marshman was out with a ruptured oil pan . A few minutes later Dave MacDonald died in Indianapolis ' Methodist Hospital . Then Clark 's car came down the homestretch with its left rear wheel cocked up at a crazy angle , sparks spewing from suspension parts dragging on the track . He fought to control the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the infield. // Ward fell back , Gurney too , and suddenly the Fords had all but had it . Foyt and Jones were locked in a stirring , savage wheel-to-wheel duel for first place . This lasted seven laps , then ended abruptly as Parnelli pitted for fuel . His cheering section waited with a placard : " Parnelli , yes . Lotus , no. " // Suddenly , unexplainably ( Had fuel spilled on his hot exhaust pipe ? Had a spark ignited the tank when the filler cap was closed ? ) , Jones 's car was afire . The flames rolled out from under the chassis as he pulled away , and he looked back over his shoulder into a sheet of fire . He bailed out and the car turned into a torch , slamming into the pit wall while crewmen scrambled away . // It was now 1:35 p.m. , 55 laps were in , and Foyt had the lead for good . Ward once closed to within 12 seconds , but his subsequent pit stops put him out of the fight . Foyt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then came Ward , Lloyd Ruby in an Offy and rookie Johnny White in an Offy . The first four had all broken Jones 's 1963 record of 143.137 mph. // The rush of the slipstream around Foyt had frayed a hole in the right elbow of his racing uniform and his lips were cracked and raw . " You guys , " he rasped to reporters in his garage , " did n't come right out and say it  --  but you sort of hinted I would lose . You thought this so-called antique front-engine roadster could n't hack it against the high-powered Fords , against the rear-engine cars . " He shrugged . " We just did n't think the Fords would make it . We could n't believe it . We were right . " // There was backstage drama as well . On the night before the race , his chief mechanic , George Bignotti , had been forced to install a new engine in Foyt 's car after the other had developed a strain during practice . And , gambling on not changing tires ( Foyt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive the race on one set ) , Bignotti removed the front air-jacks from the car to lighten it . // Indy Champion Foyt looked at his car and the garland of roses perched crazily over the cockpit . " We are , " he mused , " thinking about something real drastic for next year . We are going to go into streamlining . Maybe something with an enclosed cockpit . I ca n't tell you more about it because I do n't know myself what it will look like , but .... " // Said Bill Ansted , Indianapolis auto parts millionaire and Foyt 's sponsor : " We will , of course , buy him anything he wants for next year . " // Firestone was in the same mood . Within an hour after the race was over , company officials were standing by with a new contract to test tires . The mercurial Texan , a Goodyear tester through the past year , had switched on the first day of qualifying from Goodyears to Fire-stones , then half-switched back and wore a Goodyear driving uniform in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $7,500 in prize money if he won the race . " We have made out the check , " said a Firestone official . " Whether or not he accepts it is up to him . " // The race had other startling aspects . Ford , in lending its powerful new overhead camshaft engines to private car owners for the race , had kept a tight rein , specifying that they must run on gasoline during the actual race . Ford , in fact , had forbidden the crews to tear the engines down and had provided a supply of fresh , new ones from Detroit as replacements . All seven Fords in the race , said company spokesmen , had raced on gasoline as ordered . Not so , said A.J. Watson , the builder of Rodger Ward 's car and his chief mechanic . He had , he said , closed his garage doors to Ford 's engineers one night and converted the engine to alcohol . Ward had burned alcohol during the race . // As for the Lotus-Fords , fuel was not the problem . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil . Both Clark and Gurney were put out by mishaps with their Dunlop tires . The tread began to peel from Clark 's left rear tire , and the resulting vibration , Lotus Builder Colin Chapman said , caused the suspension to fail . Gurney complained that a tire sounded " funny , " had it replaced and finally was called in for keeps on Chapman 's orders . // The stage thus was set for another year of ferment at Indy : design changes were in the offing , a fight over fuel was shaping up and the tire companies were squaring away to fight anew . // This year of transition had been the bad one . At breakfast in the driver-mechanic cafeteria under the grandstand , Mickey Thompson had talked of his plans for Dave MacDonald and the Sears Allstate Specials . " Why , we 'll even put out a line of Dave MacDonald T shirts , " said Mickey , " and sell them through Sears catalogues . And Dave MacDonald toy racing cars . You know : stuff like that to make the kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumpled , unwashed  --  still in his suit with the wind-ripped elbow  --  winner A.J. Foyt stood talking earnestly in Gasoline Alley . " Looky here , " he said . " You ca n't let this get you down , about those guys getting killed . You got to carry on in racing . Maybe you have n't noticed it about me  --  but I have n't got any close friends in racing . You ca n't let anyone get too close to you in this game . If they get killed it breaks your heart . And if you are going to race you have got to race alone . "
