TRUSTEE FROM THE TOOLROOM ( 311 pp . ) A/ew/ Shute-Morrow ( $3.95 ) . <P> The late Nevil Shute took characters of clay and left them shod with steel . Keith Stewart , hero of Shute 's posthumous novel , Trustee from the Toolroom , is unassuming to the point of extinction . Keith is past his prime , hard up , pastily pale and running a little to fat . In an ugly mortgaged home in the London suburb of West Baling , he shares teatime monosyllables with his dumpily comfortable wife Katie . Yet Keith is not a nonentity . <P> He is the backbone of the Miniature Mechanic , a magazine for which he writes articles on the tiny models of locomotives , generators , planes , and assorted engines he himself designs . At the drop of a soldering iron or the wrong twist of a vise , like-minded hobbyists from Havana to Hong Kong lay their problems on the workbench of this toolroom Da Vinci . Patiently , Keith answers each letter . Just as patiently , he seals a little copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballasting of his brother-in-law 's yacht , and agrees to take care of the couple 's ten-year-old daughter Janice while the pair sails for western Canada via the South Seas . <P> Steady old Keith has also sealed a bargain with adventure . During a typhoon the yacht smashes up on a coral reef near Tahiti , and Janice 's parents are killed . As the child 's trustee , Keith pieces together the puzzle of her missing legacy : the box of " trinkets " contained 27,000 in diamonds smuggled out of England to dodge currency restrictions . Keith 's conscience will not let him rest until he gets a look at the wreckage on that distant coral reef . <P> The ensuing odyssey is a kind of poor man 's **27;177;TOOLONG . There is a low-keyed humor in Keith Stewart 's role as a provincial Ulysses , for the West Baling mechanic has never before set eyes on a piece of foreign currency , taken a shower , or been on the water , and he packs his English woolens for the tropics . But Keith 's loving care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the reader 's respect . In the end , though , it is neither tropic adventures nor miniature marvels that generate the fundamental emotion in Trustee from the Toolroom . That comes from giving a small man a big word-trust-to live up to . It was Nevil Shute 's enduring conviction that " the job 's the thing , ' ' and that a job well done makes and proclaims the man .
