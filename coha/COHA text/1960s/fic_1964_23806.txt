A Minute Forty Seven of the Second A story by Tom Mayer My little brother Johnny went into training on a Wednesday in April , two and a half weeks before the fight . That afternoon I got a note in my two o'clock study hall telling me to report to the office of Mr. Emory D. H. Bascomb , the principal , after school . Mr. Bascomb was the principal of both Barrington Junior High , where I was in the seventh grade at the time , and of GoodeyGormley grade school across the street , where my brother was in the fourth grade . When I got the note I thought maybe they had found out about the brass knuckles I had made in shop class , but that was unlikely because I had sneaked them out and now they were at home . Even so , I was somewhat nervous when I got to the office . Mr. Bascomb was a very dignified-looking man ; he could have passed as a bank president or the chairman of the board of a big company in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was because he was a strong Republican , and my mother is something of a wheel in state Republican politics , a big wheel in fact , and Mr. Bascomb wanted a nice tenure job with the state system . The pay was better than in the citysystem . He had to act like a nonpartisan , of course , so that he would n't get the city school board on his tail , but he wanted my mother to know what his principles were , and that was pretty lucky for me more than a couple of times . I did n't know any of that then , only that he seemed to like me . " Sit down , Jerry , " he said to me , and pointed at a chair . " I 've got grave problems to discuss with you . " " Yes sir , " I said and sat down . " It 's about your brother Johnny , " he said and I relaxed . " He 's done something wrong , sir ? " I asked . Not exactly wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole situation is very unusual , and I 'd like to have your help in trying to solve it peace-ably . " " Sure , sir , " I said . " Well , it seems your brother 's been threatening people . He 's terrified one boy so thoroughly that the boy 's mother has called and asked that I intervene . " " No bull ? " I asked . " Johnny got sore at somebody for real ? " 62 A MINUTE FORTY SEVEN OF THE SECOND Johnny was by about two inches and ten pounds the puniest kid in the fourth grade , and the only argument he ever had with anybody before that I knew about was when he made me beat up Larry McGurk , the undertaker 's son . That was when Johnny was in the second grade and MeGurk took all his marbles , including a good steelie and some clearies I had given him , so I had to beat McGurk up , which was n't exactly easy . " Watch your language , Jerry , " Mr. Bascomb said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear that Johnny had had an argument , much less threatened anybody . " So was I , " Mr. Bascomb said . " But the boy 's parents have called on me and I have to do some-thing . " " Who is it ? " I asked . " Melvin Oglethorpe , " Mr. Bascomb said , and I could n't help laughing . Melvin Oglethorpe was not tough or anything , but he was one of the biggest kids in the fourth grade and he must have been at least a foot taller than Johnny . " It must be some kind of joke , " I said . " No , " Mr. Bascomb said . " It 's no joke . In fact , it 's very serious because the boy 's future wellbeing is involved . Mrs. Oglethorpe called me up and told me Johnny has been threatening young Mel on his way home from school , and Mel is so upset that he is n't hungry anymore . Mrs. Oglethorpe took him to Dr. Barnaby , who said the boy is growing very fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disastrous to his future health . " I said , " Well what can I do ? " " We have to find out what 's at the bottom of this , " Mr. Bascomb said . " Of course I 'd like to settle it peaceably  --  it 's not good to let grade school children indulge in violence  --  but if we ca n't patch it up we 'll have to put the gloves on them . I want you to explain this entire situation to your mother , and between the two of you perhaps you can discover what 's troubling Johnny and help me solve this . I 'd appreciate it if you 'd tell that to your mother . " " I will , sir . I 'll see what I can do . " " That 's fine , " Mr. Bascomb said . " Let me know when you find something . " " I 'll probably know by tomorrow , " I said . " I imagine Johnny 'll tell me about it . " Tom Mayer , who has spent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harvard , will have a book of stories , including this one , published by Viking Press this year . " I hope so , " Mr. Bascomb said , " but one thing 's for sure , this threatening has got to stop . It 's a terrible thing when a boy ca n't walk home from school without being molested . " " Yes sir . " " If Johnny is intractable you can tell him I said that , and you can also tell the young man that I 'll have to call him in here if he does n't shape up . " " I will , " I said . " Remember , " Mr. Bascomb said , " we 'll settle this with gloves if we have to . I do n't like violence , but we 'll do it that way if necessary . " I told Mr. Bascomb that I understood , and he said that was fine , and then we talked awhile about what a fine woman my mother is . When I got outside it was four thirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I decided to skip it . T was n't overconfident , but I knew I was the only good right-hand pitcher Apodaca 's General Store had , which was why the manager , Martin Lopez , picked me first choice in the Little League player draft . Also because I could catch , and you can never carry enough good catchers . I figured I could tell Mr. Martin Lopez I got kept after school and he would believe me . Iran home and found my brother in the TV room watching TV . He was waiting for Crusader Rabbit , a five-minute cartoon serial , and I knew I could n't talk to him about anything until after that . Personally I always found Crusader Rabbit very frustrating , because they spent three minutes out of the five telling you what happened the last time , and you had to watch almost every show anyhow or you lost the thread . Each story went on for about a year , and Johnny watched every one while my mother kept waiting for him to outgrow it . When Crusader Rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up on a straight-back chair and began punching the bag . The TV room was also the playroom and my father kept a light punching bag there . My father was the two-time middleweight champion of the Australian Army , and he once knocked out " Bono " Quintana , the light-heavyweight champion of the Southwest  --  a nationally ranked contender at the time  --  with one punch in a street fight at the Plaza . I have a newspaper clipping to prove it . " Bopo " said something vile about my mother , and my father knocked him through the plate-glass window at Woolworth 's My father did n't fight in the gym anymore , but he punched the bag for a half-hour two or three times a week to keep his eye sharp and did some roadwork on Sundays when he got the chance . He could hit very hard , they said , had shoulders like a heavyweight , and he never let himself get above one seventy . His only weakness as a fighter , something not his fault , was that he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody even jabbed it hard . Johnny banged away at the bag for awhile , not saying anything , and doing an awful job of it . Even standing on the chair he was way too low for the bag , and he did n't know how to hit it . My father showed me a little about boxing when I was a kid , and I used to spar and fool around a lot with him , but Johnny was never interested and my father did n't make him learn . " What the hell are you doing ? " I asked . " Practicing , " Johnny said , and almost fell off the chair . " Do n't hook it so much , " I said . " Do n't try to hit it so often . Let it bounce . " " Like this ? " Johnny said , and hooked it again so that it bounced back at him on a diagonal . " No . Jab it , " I said . " How ? " I got up and shadow-boxed a few jabs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . Cross with the right when you got him set up . " " I 'll try it . " He jabbed on the bag a few times , and it went back and forth on a straight line so that he could keep hitting it . " That 's better , " I said . He jabbed it again . " Whatcha doing this for ? " I asked him . " Nothing , " he said . Johnny has always been good at keeping his own secrets . " What for ? Come on and tell . " " I feel like doing it , " he said . " That 's bull , " I said . " All right . I do n't feel like doing it . " He jabbed the bag twice , the second time nicely , and then he hooked with his right . The chair slid when he swung , and he had to grab the back of it . " Hit it straight , " I said . " Jab it straight , but throw the right straight too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A straight punch gets there first and hurts the most . Honkers are nothin ' but brawlers . Boxer with a punch can lick a hooker any day . " " Is this it ? " He threw a straight right , but it hit the side of the bag instead of the center . a story by Tom Mayer 63 " That 's the idea , " I said . " Now why are you doing this ? " " I want to . " " Ha ha . I know better . " He stopped punching and looked over at me . Then he started punching again . " I hear you 're out to get Melvin Oglethorpe , " I said . That stopped him completely and he said , " Who says ? " " Mr. Bascomb , " I said and smiled at him . " No kidding , Jerry ? " Johnny asked . Mr. Bas-comb 's name shook him up some . I nodded . " Mr. Bascomb says you 're having a blood feud with him . His mother called up and complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's chicken , " my brother said . " How come you 're sore at him ? " I asked . " Mr. Bascomb told me to find out , but I wo n't tell him if you do n't want me to . What happened ? " " He did n't do anything to me , " Johnny said . " Aw come on , " I said . Johnny looked at the bag , and hit it once . He did n't hit it again , just stood there on the chair looking at it until it stopped swinging , and then he turned to me and said , " I ca n't tell you . " " I wo n't say anything , " I said . " Honest . " " Yes you will . " " No I wo n't . You can count on me . " " I 'd like to tell you , " he said . " But I ca n't tell anybody . " " Well give me some idea . " " He insulticated me , " Johnny said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did he hit you , " I asked , " or what ? I could 've beat him up , like Larry McGurk . " " He just insulticated me . " " And what did you do to him ? " " Nothing . " " You have n't hit him ? " " No . " " Well what 's going to happen ? " I asked . " I do n't know , " Johnny said . " I got ta learn to fight . " " It 's about time , " I said . " Oh yeah ? " Johnny said . " Dad can show you a lot , " I said . " He 's good himself . " " I know , " Johnny said , " but I do n't want him to find out about it . " 64 A MINUTE FORTY SEVEN OF THE SECOND " Why not ? He wo n't care . " " I just do n't . " " He 's going to anyway , " I said . " How come ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " ' Cause Mr. Bascomb told me to . He will himself if I do n't . You know how he is . " " You have to tell her ? " " Yes . " I said . " Then I guess it 's okay to tell Dad too , " Johnny said . " Okay ? " I said . " It 's better to tell Dad . He can be a big help . " " T guess so , " Johnny said . We talked about it awhile longer , and decided to tell my father after dinner that night . The more Johnny thought about it the more he agreed with me that Dad could show him how to fight , and , what 's more , would probably jump at the chance to do it . After dinner we said to Dad that we had some big business we wanted to talk to him about alone , without my mother and grandmother . He said okay , but not too long , he had some work to do , and we took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He thought about it a minute , and said we had to get Johnny into training right away . Then he asked Johnny what Melvin had done to him to get him riled up , and Johnny said Melvin had insulticated him . Dad said he understood . We talked it over , because Dad said good managers always make up their preparation plans long before the match , so they can play all the angles , and we decided I should go to see Mr. Bascomb the next day and explain that Johnny wanted to fight . Dad said I should get the date of the bout set as far in the future as possible to give - Johnny training time . Dad said Johnny had better get started right away . He put Johnny up on the chair and watched him punch the bag awhile . Then he said the bag was too high for Johnny , but I told him that did n't matter , because Melvin was too high for Johnny too . My father took me aside and said we had to build up Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anymore . My father showed Johnny how to jab that evening , and how to keep his hands up . He told Johnny to keep his hands in front of his face , elbows down in order to block punches with his forearms , and his chin behind his shoulder . Then if he jabbed a lot , my father said , he could keep the other guy off balance until he opened him up . Dad said legs were very important , and he got an old jump rope from the closet in his office and showed Johnny how to jump with it . Dad had good timing and he could do all sorts of fancy stuff himself , crossovers and the like , but Johnny just got tangled up . Dad said that was happening because the rope was too long , so he took out a pocket knife and cut the rope down to where Johnny could use it . That helped , and Johnny began to get the idea , although he still tripped pretty hard a couple of times . Dad said diet was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed Johnny the right things , and both Johnny and I said that might be pretty tricky . Mother did n't approve of boxing . Just about then Mother came in anyway , and wanted to know what we were up to . Both Dad and Johnny were sweating considerable amounts , and Mother wanted to know if they were trying to shake the house down . She said she had just had the ceiling in the hall plastered , and it was flaking down all over the place . My father explained that we were training Johnny for a fight . " Little Johnny ? " my mother asked . My father said yes . He said Johnny was already learning a jab , and they were going to do some running together the next morning . Johnny liked to sleep late , he never got up until just before breakfast , and even then you had to shake him , and he did n't look too happy about the running bit . Mother said we were n't going to turn her baby into a fighter , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melvin and Mr. Bascomb , and Mother said Mr. Bascomb was a blathering idiot . She kissed Johnny sweetly on the forehead and said it was mean of my father and me to make him fight . Johnny said he wanted to fight , and Mother said she did n't believe him . " Cot no choice , " he said . Mother asked what Melvin had done to him , and Johnny would n't tell her any more than he had me . Mother saw it was no use . Johnny was the stubbornest one in the family when he made up his mind about something , and my father told her she would have to start fixing training meals . He said Johnny should have steak twice a day , preferably three times , and lots of milk and orange juice . That made Mother mad , and she said Johnny and all the rest of us ate very well as it was . My father was embarrassed and said that was true , she and Ramona were the best cooks in the business , but a fighter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day . Mother said she 'd think about it . Then my father said that Johnny ought to cut out between-meal snacks , and no candy , and of course no cigarettes or liquor . My mother looked at my father as if he were crazy , and my father said he knew Johnny did n't drink or smoke , but he wanted to emphasize the importance of condition . He asked Mother if she 'd like to see Johnny 's jab , and Mother said not particularly , but she stayed while Johnny shadow-boxed . " Snap it hard , " my father kept saying , " stick it in his face , make it sting . That 's a boy . " My father said it was time for bed , because Johnny would have to get up early for roadwork , and he asked Johnny if he wanted a rubdown . Johnny said okay , and my father detailed me to give Johnny a massage . Johnny took a bath and went to bed , and I rubbed down his arms and legs and hack . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been looking sharp , trying to build up his confidence . He said he did n't think roadwork sounded like much fun , and went to sleep . The next morning my father got him up at six , and they ran around the block three or four times before breakfast . My father ate four eggs when they came in , said he had n't felt so well in years , and Johnny looked tired . My father made him drink three glasses of orange juice , and told Mother to get some wheat germ and vitamin pills . At school I went to see Mr. Bas-comb and told him that Johnny wanted satisfaction , I told him Johnny had been mortally insulted and wanted to fight Melvin . " But what did Melvin do ? " Mr. Bascomb asked . " Terrible things , " I said . Then I asked Mr. Bascomb when he wanted the fight . He said something about the sooner the better , and would next Saturday be suitable . I lied and said we were all going to the ranch the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? Mr. Bas-comb said that was fine with him , but he did n't look forward with any relish to telling Mrs. Oglethorpe about it . When I told my father about the fight date he said he wished I 'd gotten more time . I said I 'd done the best I could , and he said that was okay , he thought he could have Johnny ready , but he wished he had more time to strengthen up those legs . He ran Johnny a lot the next week and a half , and taught him how to punch straight . I sparred a story by Tom Mayer 65 with Johnny , not hitting hard , and it was amazing how he picked up moves . He was very coordinated , which was something we had never suspected before because he hated sports so , and in no time at all he could do a fine bob and weave . Dad made him carry a small rubber ball around in each pocket , and told him to squeeze them all the time . After about a week Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept working with him mainly on the simple stuff , keep the right up , the chin tucked in , the left jabbing ; cross to the jaw when you get a clean shot , bob and weave when you get in trouble . Dad bought a medicine ball and tossed it to Johnny to toughen up his middle , but the ball was too big and it knocked Johnny 's wind out . That happened a couple of times , but Johnny got right back up and asked for more , and I was astonished at how tough he was getting . The last week Dad had him running around the block ten times before breakfast , eating wheat germ , steak , and orange juice , taking four kinds of vitamin pills , and sparring six rounds after school in addition to rope skipping and bag work . The Wednesday before the fight Dad bought Johnny a new pair of red silk fighting trunks , a jock , and a steel cup . The trunks fit fine and the jock was okay , but the cup was too big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Dad said he had to have a cup , ca n't fight without protection , and the next day he spent most of the morning buying up boy's-size protectors . He brought about twenty of them home , and at least ten fit , On Friday Johnny just skipped rope and sparred a round with me . Dad wanted to keep him home from school to make sure he took it easy , but Mother said she would n't hear of it . My father said , " But it 's the day before the fight , " and Mother said no , absolutely no . Dad fed Johnny a huge steak that he cooked himself , and put him to bed at eight-thirty after giving him a sleeping pill to make sure he relaxed well . The fight was scheduled for ten o'clock , and we got to school at nine-thirty . Johnny changed at home , and wore a blue bathrobe in the car . Dad asked him three or four times how he felt and if he had the right size cup in place . Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights , any fights , they were brutal , and she was n't about to watch one with her last baby in it . 66 A MINUTE FORTY SEVEN OF THE SECOND The fight was in the Goodey-Gormley gym , and the ring was a joke . They had put down a wrestling mat in the middle of the floor , with a steel folding chair at each corner , No ropes at all . The referee was Mr. Nestor Gonzalez , one of the sixth-grade teachers . He was hunchbacked , wore glasses , and talked in a high thin voice . I had had him the year before and he was very nice , and very intelligent . Melvin Oglethorpe and his parents showed up at a quarter till . Mrs. Oglethorpe had a red scaly face that looked as if she had just been yelling at someone . Lots of blood in her cheeks . Mr. Oglethorpe was huge , around six four , with hairy hands . Melvin was at least a foot taller than Johnny . He had black hair he was always brushing back out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared stiff , I figured , and he was dressed in a regular shirt and khakis . When he took the shirt off he was skinny underneath . Mr. Bascomb was there too , and the first thing he did was run up to my father and ask how my mother was . Then he asked if there was n't some way we could solve this peaceably , and my father told him to ask Johnny . Mr. Bas-comb asked Johnny , and Johnny said , " I wan na fight . " Mr. Bascomb said he guessed fight it was , and Melvin looked very unhappy . I was going to be Johnny 's second , of course , and I had a bucket filled with ice water , four towels , a big box of Band-Aids , and some iodine . I picked a corner and told Johnny to sit down in the chair . Mr. Gonzalez gave us some school gloves , twelve-mincers , and I tied them on Johnny , being careful to tuck the laces in . This was according to plan . My father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school would have twelve-mincers , so Johnny 's hands would feel light and fast . Mr. Gonzalez asked if everybody was ready . I said Johnny was , and Melvin sort of nodded . Mr. Gonzalez told the boys to come to the center of the ring . " We 'll fight three rounds , " he said , " of two minutes each , and after that everyone should be happy . I do n't know much about boxing , but no hitting below the belt , no biting , and no kicking . The edges of the mat are the out-of-bounds lines . You both sure we ca n't talk this thing out ? " " Yes , " Johnny said . " All right , if that 's the way you feel about it . Back to your corners . Mr. Bascomb is going tobe the timekeeper and he 'll ring the bell . Do n't hit each other after the bell . " Johnny came back to his corner and I said , " Go get him . " Johnny nodded . I took off the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father had gotten Johnny a mouthpiece , and I put it in . It made his face look swollen . Johnny did a couple of deep-knee bends , which Dad said would loosen up his ligaments . Then he jabbed the air a couple of times , and I had to admit it looked impressive . Straight with lots of snap . Mr. Bascomb said , " Everybody ready ? " and rang the bell . Johnny came out fast , hands up high , and had to wait for Melvin at the center of the ring . Melvin was moving cautiously . When he got within range Johnny feinted a jab and circled around him twice , doing a little bobbing and weaving as he went . Dad told him to be careful in the first round and feel his opponent out . Dad said only rank amateurs and club fighters went rushing in . Melvin swung softly , a long roundhouse right , and Johnny ducked it easily . Johnny countered with a hard jab that landed square on Melvin 's shoulder . Melvin said ouch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a problem . Melvin swung again and missed and Mrs. Oglethorpe yelled loudly , " Murder him . " Melvin looked a little embarrassed . Johnny faked a one-two to the jaw , and when Melvin pulled his hands up Johnny hit him in the gut . Dad had told him to give the guy 's midsection a going over early in the fight . That would slow him down . I looked around and Dad was smiling . Melvin backpedaled a bit and then swung with his right again . Johnny ducked it with his head and hit Melvin with a right of his own square on the chin . Considering Johnny weighed all of about eighty pounds at the time , it was quite a punch . Melvin 's knees buckled , and he went staggering back off the mat . His shoes squeaked loudly as he caught his balance on the hardwood floor , and Mr. Gonzalez said , " Wait a minute , are you okay ? " Melvin nodded and rubbed his chin . Melvin got back on the mat , though he took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , with Melvin heaving wild haymakers from time to time , until Mr. Bascomb rang the bell . Johnny came back to the corner and bobbed up and down to show how strong he felt . I took his mouthpiece out . " Take it easy , " I said , You got two more rounds . " " It works , " he said . " What works ? " " The things Dad says , " he said , " I told you they would . Now sit down . I got ta sponge the sweat off you . " Johnny sat down and I dipped one of my towels in the ice water and rubbed over his face . The towel must have gotten in his mouth , because he spit two or three times after I took it away . " You 're not supposed to stuff it down my throat , " he said . " Sorry , " I said . " You got any cuts you want bandaged ? " I had stripped the wrappers off several Band-Aids and stuck them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them fast , and the iodine was in my pocket . I also had a roll of cotton . " He did n't hit me , " Johnny said . " How could I have cuts ? " " I ca n't see everything from here , " I said . " Sometimes your back is turned to me . I thought he might 've got you . " " Did n't touch me . " " Do n't get overconfident , " I said . " You can take him but do n't get cocky . " Just then Mr. Bascomb rang the bell , and I said , " Hey , you ca n't do that . " Mr. Bascomb said , " Why not ? " " You 're supposed to give me a thirty-second warning , " I said . " I have n't got his mouthpiece back in . " " Oh , " Mr. Bascomb said . " Well , get it in , " Mr. Gonzalez said , and I stuffed it back in Johnny 's mouth . " Get him , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kill the little snot , " Mr. Oglethorpe yelled . Dad said that if the first round went well it would be okay to open fast in the second , which is what Johnny did . Melvin had his hands up to protect his face , and Johnny got him with a four- or five-punch combination in the belly before he knew what hit him . Melvin grunted and dropped his hands and Johnny got him on the chin again . Not as hard as the time the round before , because Johnny was off balance when he threw the punch , but Melvin was stung . Not hurt , but stung . " Clobber him , " Mrs. Oglethorpe yelled . Melvin rushed at Johnny and swung a terrific roundhouse left . Johnny had his hands up the way he had been taught , and he caught the punch on his forearm , picked it off clean , but Melvin had all his weight behind it and it knocked Johnny halfway across the ring . Johnny landed a story by Tom Mayer 67 on the seat of his pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , " I yelled . " Take your time , Johnny , " my father yelled . " You 're not hurt . " " Kick him , " yelled Mrs. Oglethorpe . Mr. Gonzalez began to count . " One . . . two . three ... four . . . five ... six ... " At six Johnny got up , He was about to cry , so I knew he was mad , and there was a red spot on his forearm from the punch . " Keep cool , " my father yelled loudly , and I could tell Johnny had heard because you could see him relax . " Bob and weave . " Melvin started in on Johnny again , and Johnny began to bob and weave . Melvin missed him three or four times , and then hit him on the top of the head . That knocked Johnny back again , but he did n't go down . Melvin came after him , displaying vast amounts of the old killer instinct , and missed with a big right . Johnny was fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left himself wide open off balance , Johnny hit him with a perfect one-two in the solar plexus . You could hear the air rush out of Melvin . He doubled over and my father yelled , " Take him . " " You got him , " I yelled as Melvin staggered . " Bomb him . " Melvin was bent over now so that he was closer to Johnny 's height , and Johnny went to work . He hit him with two good straight lefts to the chin , and then he caught him with a beautiful right cross to the nose . That was what did it . Melvin was set up , his hands over his gut , hair flopping in his eyes , and Johnny pasted the right square into his nose , from good balance , with all his power behind it . Melvin stood up straight , Then he sat down hard , arms hanging at his sides . Then he began to cry . Then his nose began to bleed . The blood ran down over his upper lip , and dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mouth . Mr. Gonzalez began to count with Johnny standing there looking down at Melvin , and my father yelled , " For Chrissake get to a neutral corner . Quick ! Remember Dempsey and Tunney . " Johnny did n't hear him , though , and stayed there standing over Melvin . When Mr. Gonzalez saw the blood he stopped counting and said , " The fight is over . " Mr. Gonzalez and Johnny helped Melvin up and began to walk him around . " Keep your head back , " Mr. Gonzalez said . I brought over one of my unused towels and said , " Here . Take this , " 68 A MINUTE FORTY SEVEN OF THE SECOND Johnny was walking with Melvin and finally he said , " Are you okay , Melvin ? " Melvin nodded . " I 'm sorry , " Johnny said . " I 'm not sore at you anymore . " Melvin nodded again . He was still crying . Then Mr. Oglethorpe and my father came over , and we all stood around Melvin , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head back and a towel over his face . Except for Mrs. Oglethorpe . She stayed in her seat and she looked very mad . My father said to Mr. Oglethorpe , " Yon got a game boy there , " and Mr. Oglethorpe said , " Yours is okay too . " " You fought hard , " my father said to Melvin . " You got pretty fair power . " Melvin looked as if he might be trying to smile underneath the towel . " That boy a yours , " Mr. Oglethorpe said . " If I was his size I would n't a climbed in the ring with nobody , much less a kid the size a mine . " " My boy 's been training , " my father said . " I could tell . " Then Mr. Bascomb , who had been standing there listening , said , " Are the young men reconciled ? " " I think so , " Mr. Gonzalez said . " I 'm not sore anymore , " Johnny said . Melvin shook his head to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here , " Mrs. Oglethorpe said loudly from her chair . Mr. Oglethorpe turned around and looked at her and said , " As soon as I get ready . " My father told Mr. Gonzalez he did a fine job refereeing , and Mr. Gonzalez said if the truth be known he did n't like anything about boxing . My father did n't know what to say to that . He knew that I had liked Mr. Gonzalez from the year before when he was my teacher , but Dad thought only women did n't like fights . I got Dad away before he 'd have time to think about it any and ask Mr. Gonzalez questions about why he felt the way he did . Dad probably would n't have said anything more though anyway , because he never did well in school himself and is still afraid of teachers and only talks to them when he has to . He always thinks teachers are different from other people . In the car on the way home my father did n't say anything , and neither did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny would jerk his head to the side every so often , without moving any of the rest of him , and I knew he was practicing a head feint Dad had showed him that he had n't had a chance to use . when we got home we told my mother all about it , and she made Johnny sit on her lap , which he plainly did n't want to do . She felt his forearm where he had been hit , and said perhaps it was broken and ought to be X-rayed . It was getting black and blue . My father said he knew it was n't broken . Then my mother asked Johnny again why he had been mad at Melvin . " He insulticated me , " Johnny said . " But what did he do ? " Mother asked . " You must have had something happen to you to bring all of this on . " " I was insulticated , " Johnny said . " It 's all over now , " " You 're not the slightest bit angry anymore ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can quit this ridiculous training program , " my mother said . " For awhile , " my father said . " Training was kind of fun , " Johnny said . " I ca n't imagine how it could be , " my mother said . " You fought a good fight , " my father said . " Yeah , " I said . " Showed you can take it too , " my father said . " Fighter 's got to be able to do that . " " I wish Mr. Bascomb had kept time right , " I said . " I did n't know when to put his mouthpiece back in . " " Johnny is not going to fight anymore , " my mother said . " Not ever . " " I might have to , " Johnny said . " No , " Mother said . " You ca n't tell about things , " Johnny said . " He can hit too , " my father said , more to himself than to the rest of us . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was a stopwatch too , if you needed it to be . It was a flyer 's watch from World War II that he picked up surplus . " That was a good right in the first , " my father said , " and he TKO 'd him in a minute forty seven of the second . That 's not bad at all , for the first time out . "
