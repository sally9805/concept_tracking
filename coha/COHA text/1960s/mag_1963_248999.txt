Who owns the moon - lovers and songwriters , or the first nation to establish a base there ? Who pays damages if one country 's space capsule crash-lands in another 's biggest city ? May political propaganda be beamed to earth from space ? Or TV commercials ? When the U.S. orbits a reconnaissance satellite , are the Russians entitled to knock it out if they can , like another U2 ? If space explorers meet a race of intelligent nonhumans , how are men and bug-eyed monsters to live together under the rule of law ? Such questions were once the specialty of science-fiction writers ; lately they have become the serious concern of lawyers and diplomats . <P> Open to All Mankind . With no space cases to set precedents , legal theorists are scratching hard for down-to-earth parallels to these no longer far-out problems . The most compelling comparison is to the law of the high seas-as a pair of massive new books on space law make clear . In both Space Law and Government , by Andrew G. Haley ( Appleton-Century-Crofts , $15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Myres S. McDougal , Harold Lasswell and Ivan A. Vlasic ( Yale , $15 ) , maritime law , which has grown out of the common consent and reciprocal needs of seafaring nations , is described as one of the most effective , enforceable varieties of international law .

They prefer to leave the law flexible , to let it grow with a growing accumulation of cases . <P> As for " advanced forms of nonearth life , " the scholars emphasize the need for setting a law-abiding example . They make a sobering reminder of European excesses during the conquest of the newly discovered Americas . Any four-eyed visitors from Epsilon Eridani might well turn out to be ahead of mankind in technology , say the space lawyers ; earth may yet become someone else 's new world to colonize . <P> <P> First Enactment . Though they have yet to be put to use , in some respects the new law books have already been superseded . Last week the U.N .
