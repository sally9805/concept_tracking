PUBLIC HEALTH <P> As Medicare marked its third birth day last week , its growing pains were all too evident . Both Medicare , the fed erally financed program that pays hos pital bills for all Americans over 65 , and the related Medicaid , which is financed jointly by Washington and the states and assists the poor of all ages , have been plagued by huge cost underestimates , administrative tangles and messy scandals . Now doctors who treat patients under both programs will have to contend with the Internal Revenue Service and Senate investigators . <P> In Washington last week , as the Senate Finance Committee began hearings into alleged abuses , Chairman Russell B. Long told IRS representatives that he had evidence of kickback arrangements involving nursing homes , doctors and drug suppliers . At the same time , the IRS announced that it planned to conduct a special audit of the income tax returns of an estimated 10,000 doctors who had received more than $25,000 apiece in Medicare and Medicaid payments from the Government last year . <P> Last-Minute Reprieve . The prospect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments was especially disturbing in view of the states ' growing reluctance or inability to shoulder their share of Medicaid 's relentlessly spiraling costs . So far only 40 states have set up Medicaid programs ( the 40th , Virginia , began operation last week ) , and some have already been forced to cut back services . Last week close to 200,000 of New York City 's low-income Medicaid recipients were dropped from the rolls when the state lowered the eligibility level to an annual income of $5,000 for a family of four . New Mexico last May withdrew from the Medicaid program altogether in hopes of re-entering at a lower level of services . <P> Concerned about Medicaid 's rising costs , the Department of Health , Education and Welfare issued a new regulation last week designed to limit the fees charged by doctors and dentists . Such fees accounted for about 29% of the $2.4 billion spent by Washington and the states on Medicaid last year ( the Federal Government spent an additional $6 billion on Medicare ) . Under present regulations , Medicaid fees are determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will limit fees in most states to the level that prevailed last January . Increases will be permitted , but only under a formula based on the consumer price index . The new regulation is expected to save about $65 million in its first year of operation and substantially more later . <P> National Goals . The Senate meanwhile passed and sent to the House a measure that would permit states to reduce certain Medicaid services without risking the loss of federal aid . Under the bill , states would still be required to provide basic services : hospital and nursing-home care , outpatient treatment , preventive care for children , physicians ' fees , laboratory costs and X rays . But the states would be permitted to drop coverage of dental care , prescription drugs and eyeglasses . The Senate measure will enable financially pressed states to cut burgeoning costs without abandoning their Medicaid programs altogether .
