America 's leap into space has stimulated science and spawned new industries . It has also created a new idiom : space-speak . Many a scientist finds the growing , and sometimes incomprehensible jargon essential to the simplest conversation about new devices and techniques . But many a layman has become convinced that it is only one more irritating and unnecessary obstacle looming between him and a better grasp of scientific accomplishment . In a detailed analysis of space-speak for the magazine Science , University of Michigan Psychologist David McNeill suggests that there is something to be said for both points of view . <P> Creativity Limitation . Such space-speak metaphors as " umbilical " ( the cord connecting a space-walking astronaut to his craft ) and " milk stool " ( the arrangement of a missile 's three rocket engines ) are vital additions to the language , says McNeill . He is equally impressed by such metonyms as " eyeballs in " and " eyeballs out " ( describing extreme conditions of acceleration and deceleration , respectively ) , and he approves of neologisms such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Unfortunately , metaphors , metonyms and neologisms-and the creativity required to invent them-are limited . They constitute only about one-eighth of the entries in official NASA diction aries of space terms . <P> Most of the remaining space jargon , according to McNeill 's analysis , is made up of " nominal compounds " - words strung together endlessly in what scientists consider a logical order to describe complex devices or systems . Controlling the attitude of a ship by ejecting gas through nozzles , for instance , is called " nozzle gas ejection ship attitude control . " The longest nominal compound discovered by McNeill appeared in the Congressional Record , and sounded as if it had been translated literally from the German : " liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen rocket powered single stage to orbit reversible boost system . " <P> Such unwieldy compounds , McNeill says , constitute 19% of all the words in written NASA reports-substantially more than he found , for example , in papers by psychologists ( 8% ) or in articles by educators ( 3% ) . But they are also used extensively by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for technical terms in greater numbers than metaphors , metonyms or neologisms can supply . " <P> Possessive Pretension . On the other hand , McNeill stresses , the compound is often used to extremes , especially by those who pretend to possess a degree of technical knowledge that they do not have . Establishing a " pretension index " based on the length of nominal compounds and their frequency of use , he discovered that in their speeches , members of Congress were even more compound-conscious than NASA engineers . A space-technology magazine was a worse offender . It printed 300% more six-word compounds than did written NASA reports . <P> Even the engineering mind has begun to boggle at the profusion of space-speak-which explains the reduction of some complex nominal compounds to straightforward acronyms . " Augmented target docking adapter " has become ATDA , " astronaut maneuvering unit " is known as AMU , and the " electronic ground automatic destruct sequencer " - used to blow up missiles that have gone astray-is known simply as EGADS.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
