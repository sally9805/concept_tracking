Sands of the Kalahari . A hired plane crashes and burns in the wastes of South-West Africa . Out of the flaming wreckage crawl six survivors : five men and a woman . Their plight unknown , they face an ordeal by sun , sand , hunger , thirst and , as it turns out , sexual desire . Who will live ? Who will die ? Who will prove his strength , or weakness ? And who will get the girl ? <P> All such questions were answered satisfyingly in William Mulvihill 's novel . Here they are spelled out according to the conventions of steam-heated movie melodrama , but the film still turns the guesswork into good grim fun . Competition within the group begins in earnest after they find refuge in a hillside cave . While a herd of baboons observes the vagaries of humankind , the six rapidly dwindle . The hardy pilot ( Nigel Davenport ) sets off to seek help . An old German ( Harry Andrews ) and a professorial type ( Theodore Bikel ) are eliminated one way or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to look out for his rifle , his woman ( Susannah York ) and his injured rival ( Stanley Baker ) . <P> The drama remains doggedly minor because Writer-Director Cy Endfield too often concentrates on the man-womanman conflict , which is sexier but not so interesting finally as the elemental battle for survival . In Actor Whitman 's display of beefcake villainy , muscles are defined more clearly than motivation or character . The threat of death from heat and starvation seems remote when Susannah lazes by a fresh-water pool while Whitman strides forth fully armed , bagging big and small game with reassuring regularity . Kalahari is most effective when it shows men pushed to the last extremity , as in the brutal spectacle of a wounded gemsbok being slaughtered for food , or in Whitman 's climactic hand-to-hand combat with the baboons ' snarling leader . Though ferociously exciting in itself , this bout between man and beast in the wilderness only points up the failings of a movie that has n't yet gone primitive when it suddenly goes ape .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
