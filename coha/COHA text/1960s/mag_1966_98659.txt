There is a strong suspicion that the most valuable member of the Patriots last season was Bill Bates . Bates does not run , pass , kick , block or tackle . He tapes . As the team trainer , Bates taped the Patriots to a 4-8-2 record , worst in Boston history . But , in retrospect , it is difficult to understand how he and the team did that well . // Due to injuries , Boston played much of the year without its only experienced running back ( Larry Garron ) , its best pass receiver ( Art Graham ) , an All-League linebacker ( Tom Addison ) , a starting offensive guard ( Charlie Long ) and a starting corner back ( Tom Hennessey ) . Graham had tendonitis , which is unusual enough . But Addison and Long were affected all year by early-season cases of mumps . Not even Bates had the answer to that . // As a result , Coach Mike Holovak could no longer hide what has always been a Patriot weakness  --  a serious lack of depth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved futile against big backfields , and thus revealed further gaping holes in the Patriot defense . // Quarterback Babe Parilli , who never got much blocking anyway , got even less after the offensive line was hit by some key injuries . The Babe never knew who was going to be lining up in front of him from one Sunday to the next and , though he had at least been introduced to his backs , he was never completely sure which way they would be going . The Patriots lost their first five games , were last in scoring , last in rushing , last in kickoff and punt returns and next to last in kicking and catching . // In a way this was a fate deserved by the Boston hierarchy , which in all the seasons since the founding of the AFL had been last in money paid to graduating college seniors . It is mortal sin in pro football to take a cheese-paring approach to the signing of talent , and the Pats have been among the sinners . But last winter somebody must have decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Boston spent some money . The result was the most meaningful draft the team has ever had . // To patch up the offensive line Holovak signed two excellent prospects  --  6-foot-3 , 250-pound Karl Singer of Purdue and 5-foot-11 , 254-pound Dick Arlington of Notre Dame  --  and moved strongboy Len St. Jean over from the defense . Singer is bulky enough to occupy three positions , and his work in the exhibition games brought an immediate improvement in the blocking of the Patriots ' line , as well as a marked decrease in the number of men pouring in to push Parilli 's face into the ground . Arrington has been a slow learner , however , and so another rookie , Jim Boudreaux from Louisiana Tech ( 6 feet 4 , 260 pounds ) , has been converted from a defensive end . These three new faces in the relatively colorless and unheralded position of offensive blocker could mean as many as three games to the Patriots . Second-year men Justin Canale and Tom Neville and Center Jon Morris  --  all are young and improving  --  return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though last year was a miserable one for him neither John Huarte , who was well paid for carrying a clipboard and earphones down the New York sidelines last season , nor anybody else on view in the Patriot camp is about to replace him . // Parilli may not have to throw 30 times a game , as he has for the last two years , if Fullback Jim Nance is the runner he appears to be . Nance had a so-so rookie year after fighting a weight problem . But he will start the season at 230  --  almost 20 pounds lighter . He feels much quicker and has learned to block . // Nance 's development , along with that of first-year backup man Bob Cappadona , has made it possible for Garron to return to halfback , where he belongs but where he now finds himself battling J. D. Garrett for the job . In any case , the Boston running attack looks 100% improved . // Whether the same can be said for the receiving probably depends on the health of Graham . He handles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries , but he has been out for long periods ever since he came into the league three years ago . The excitement over Joe Bellino has subsided so drastically that he has been cut from the club , and so the flanker will again be Gino Cappelletti. who is small and slow but catches more than his share of passes and may be the best field-goal kicker in football . He scored a record 28 points in the final game last season to win the scoring title with 132 . Tony Romeo , who can block , and Jim Whalen , who can catch , fight it out for the tight-end job , and rookie Charlie Smith from Boston College may be a sleeper . // On defense , the Pats still have some of the best in Ends Larry Eisenhauer and Bob Dec and Linebackers Addison and Nick Buoniconti , who is small hut the real thing . But they could use some help . Opponents run away from Tackle Houston Antwine  --  into the void on the opposite side . Holovak desperately needs another tackle , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magnum  --  seem lacking , and he may have to go trading . Jim Eraser , acquired from Kansas City , will solve the punting problem but , at 29 , his All-Star linebacking days are over . Corner Back Hennessey , completely recovered from a knee injury , could be a star in his second year . The rest of the secondary , though experienced , is inconsistent . // Boston finished strong after the injury hex had departed last season , but it has always been a strange team to figure . All of a small nucleus of quality players  --  Parilli , Cappelletti , Nance , Graham and the defensive standouts  --  have to have good years for the Patriots to finish respectably in the East . They may make a race of it , but it is a long road back . Probably too long .
