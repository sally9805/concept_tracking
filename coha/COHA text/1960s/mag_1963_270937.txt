On and on went the extraordinary outpouring of grief for John Kennedy . No American , not even Franklin Roosevelt , had been so deeply mourned abroad . The great churches echoed the requiems - Paris ' Notre Dame , Rome 's St. John Lateran , London 's St. Paul 's . In smaller London churches , too , there were so many services that the U.S. embassy nearly ran out of American flags to lend . In Kenya , the Communist-leaning Minister for Home Affairs prayed before 5,000 people to Mungu ( God ) to give Kennedy a good place in heaven . <P> Throughout Europe and Africa , cit ies were renaming buildings , bridges , streets in honor of the dead President . Hamburg now has a John F. Kennedy Bridge , Algiers a Place John F. Kennedy . In West Berlin , 300,000 people gathered before the city hall to pray , and to hear a band play Ich hatt ' einen Kameraden - the dirge of the fallen soldier . In East Berlin , a Chinese Commu nist was hissed at a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Playwright Sean O'Casey , nearly blind at 83 , painfully scrawled a note to a New York friend : " Peace , who was becoming bright-eyed , now sits in the shadow of death : her handsome champion has been killed . Her gallant boy is dead . We mourn here with you , poor sad American People . " And BBC 's famed satirical TV program , That Was The Week That Was , turned sentimental , broadcast a memorial to Kennedy that included a synthetic folk song : <P> A young man rode with his head held high <P> Under the Texas sun . <P> And no one guessed that a man so blessed <P> Would perish by the gun . <P> Lord , would perish by the gun . <P> The Plot Theory . Amid the mourning for Kennedy , the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald brought an image of U.S. lawlessness to millions abroad . A West German government spokesman , usually friendly to the U.S. , said : " It was in credible . How can you announce you are going to transfer a man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the United States today ? " <P> Most people simply could not or would not believe that the two murders were isolated events . It seemed impossible , as one Beirut paper put it , that " the craziest of crazy fools destroyed Kennedy with the ease of one swatting a fly " - and did so unaided . Communists everywhere presented it as a carefully conceived " rightist " plot , tied up with the Ku Klux Klan and the John Birch Society . In this version , Oswald had somehow been a tool of the rightists , and Jack Ruby had shot Oswald , with police connivance , to silence him . A headline in a Warsaw paper called it BAD WESTERN . <P> Communist propaganda aside , millions held the plot theory on their own , mostly because it is easier to accept evil than meaninglessness in life , to see in the two murders a wicked plan rather than wicked pointlessness . Out of the bitter need to give the event some meaning , men cast their own enemies in the villain 's role .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
