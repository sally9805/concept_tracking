MISS MACINTOSH , MY DARLING by Marguerite Young . 1,198 pages . Scrioner. $10.95 . <P> <P> The mind boggles . The disc slips . Marguerite Young 's phantasmagoric novel of a dream journey across the U.S. contains 1,198 pages . Some phantasmagoric novel ! Only a fictional pressagent 's verbal weapons could describe it : " Marguerite Young 's new novel is so big that if its air conditioning is turned off , clouds form inside . Its electrical system contains 11,425 miles of copper wire . None of it connected . The cement that went into its construction could build Grand Coulee Dam , with enough left over to fill a wash tub into which might be placed the feet of the Scribner 's editor who okayed it for publication . " <P> Ledge of Actuality . In fact , this is an outrageously bad book , written by an author with very little of interest to say , even to herself , and very little skill in saying it . It is composed of a swamp of hallucinated recollections , in the center of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madly and endlessly about her childhood , which was spent-in thin reality or thin dream-in a fantastic seaside mansion in New England . There she lived , or never lived at all , with an opium-soaked mother , two butlers , only one of them real , a spooky lawyer named Spitzer and a nursemaid named <P> Miss Macintosh , who may have been a man and who was almost certainly a suicide . All this is recalled on a nightmarish bus trip , which the middle-aged Vera takes , or does not take , in search of the dead Miss Macintosh . <P> This is unpromising in summation and wholly unreadable in execution . The author 's method is to teeter on the window ledge of actuality for a few sentences at the beginning of each chapter and then jump into vagueness , singing like Ophelia . <P> Big Bad Books . How did such a book come to be written ? The author 's error may have been in accepting too literally a favorite fancy of the 20th century-the psychiatric truism that omens seen in dreams are more accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the publisher , there are two possibilities . One is that Scribner recalled , in a wistful twinge of corporate memory , that Thomas Wolfe manuscripts used to arrive in packing cases , too . The other is that the publisher is employing the Big Bad Books technique . This variance of the Big Lie depends on reviewers becoming nervous and thinking that no book could be that big and that incoherent without being a little bit great . If Scribner can squeeze one " vast panorama " out of one important-sounding reviewer , Novelist Young has nothing to worry about . Unless , of course , the air conditioning fails .
