A BURNT-OUT CASE ( 248 pp. ) - Graham Greene-Viking ( $3.95 ) . <P> Alexander Pope , the bitter cripple who wrote of " that long disease , my life , " never admitted his deformities into his art . Spiritual deformity-symbolized by the ultimate horror of man 's physical being , leprosy-is the central theme of Graham Greene 's latest and greatest novel . <P> In probably the longest , certainly the most intensely sustained metaphor in modern fiction , Greene has made the leper a symbol of modern man , and of the " long disease " of modern life . It is the leper 's fate to die piecemeal : limbs , members , features deaden and fall from the still living body . But it is not on these horrors of pathology that Greene 's imagination centers . It is the quiet , and some would say merciful , side effect of leprosy-the disappearance of sensation , of the power to feel even pain-which haunts Greene , and which he makes the basis of a novel that would be called existentialist , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not also Christian . <P> Powerful Magic . Greene 's hero is Querry , a famous architect , celebrated-like Greene himself - as a major Roman Catholic artist . He is rich , successful , greatly loved ( " fame is a powerful aphrodisiac ' ' ) , and he is also dead . He has " had it . " The act of love and the creation of beautiful buildings have become empty of meaning . Baldly stated , this spiritual situation is hard to comprehend . But by means of Greene 's great novelistic art , the powerful magic of a born and practiced fabulist , the reader is compelled to understand and share such desiccation of soul . As British Critic V. S. Pritchett says of Querry-in a sense of contemporary man- " He can face a fact ; he can not feel . " In the face of intolerable pain , man responds by anesthesia . His fate , made visible and horrible in the doom of the leper , is death on the installment plan . <P> Querry , whose name suggests both a question and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ends of the earth . As an uninvited and anonymous guest , he comes to a leper hospital on a tributary of the Congo in what could be either the former French or Belgian Equatorial Africa . The river boat goes no farther , and symbolically , the road is never more than a week 's repair ahead of the all-encompassing jungle . <P> The hospital is run by the White Fathers , a Roman Catholic missionary order , and by temperament and their own rule , they ask no questions . For them , all questions have been answered ; they are happy , childlike men busy with their assignment , whether it is Mass , plumbing , electrical repairs , moral theology , or the grisly business of lepers ' laundry . They could not care less about entertaining a VIP , and Querry might live unhappily ever after , driving the mission truck or designing the cheapest possible hospital , but for the intrusion of the world .                   @ @
