A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is a good clean dirty show . It stands for something . It is pro mammal . It is pro burlesque . It is pro the golden corn of vaudeville , flawlessly husked by Zero Mostel , David Burns , Jack Gilford and John Carradine . What Forum brings back to Broadway is good for high , low , middle , and knitted brows-the belly laugh . <P> This musical comedy is set in pagan Rome and is lewdly adapted from the plays of Plautus , who should really have been named Sub-Plautus . He was a genius at inventing endless slapsticky plot complications . The story is that Pseudolus ( Zero Mostel ) , a slave , will be granted his freedom if he can secure as his master 's bride a dumb blonde virgin ( Preshy Marker ) who has completed her basic training as a courtesan . After a dilatory start , George Abbott 's pell-mell direction crosscuts from the chaste to the chase . Pseudolus must foil all the males who are panting after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , panderers , aging lechers , vainglorious soldiers , and defrocked vestals . For most of them , the stage-right bawdyhouse is home . <P> Lust makes this particular world go round , and Zero Mostel is its comic axis . Seemingly composed of double chins that reach to his knees , Mostel is a paradoxically dainty and light-footed man whose humors merge the ballet with the pratfall . Whether he is rolling his eyes like berserk marbles , mincing archly in his tunic , or playing tick tack toe on the bare midriff of Lucienne Bridou ( the nubilest Roman of them all ) , Mostel tickles playgoers into eruptive laughter . The show 's music lacks distinction , but no one will seriously think of humming once the cast 's six girls undulate onstage . Costumer Tony Walton wisely lets nature take top billing : these are girls for whom clothes would do nothing .
