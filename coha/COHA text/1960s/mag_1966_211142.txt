If it takes discretion , judgment , finesse and expertise to run a first-rate art museum , it should take no less of those qualities to run a first-rate art auction house such as Christie 's of London . Consider last week 's strange case of the " discovered " Rubens . <P> The case began last spring when a frail , 82-year-old lady named Eva Savage consigned a batch of 35 presumably undistinguished paintings to Christie 's to be auctioned . Her husband , who died 15 years ago , had been a picture framer whose practice was to buy old frames which he would then regild and use . Often the pictures in the frames went with the deal . On one such occasion in 1933 , Mrs. Savage recalls , her husband bought a wagonload of frames at an average price of 10 shillings each from a dealer in York , who for good measure happened to throw in a florid baroque painting of a traditional mythological subject , The Judgment of Paris . <P> Scent on the Hill . When Paris came in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christie 's director , David Carritt , was on vacation , and his evaluators , incredibly , attributed the work to a mediocre 17th century copyist named Lankrink , appraised it at $280 , and placed it in the July 28 auction catalogue . Then it was hung in " the Hill , " a long , sloping corridor where a few specialists are allowed to browse among works soon to be sold . There it was that Oliver Millar , deputy surveyor of the Queen 's painting collection , paused and pondered one day last July . As he surveyed the two plump goddesses surrounding Paris and Venus , Millar now recalls , " I smelled a Rubens . " <P> According to standard art-market plots , Millar should have kept mum , sent an unknown agent to the auction and picked up a six-figure painting for a three-figure pittance . But as a public-service scholar and a proper servant of the Crown , he says , his only ethical course was to get the painting properly identified . Besides , as he somewhat testily adds , the Crown collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millar sought out Christie 's Carritt , diffidently asked : " Is n't that a rather important picture you 've got in your sale ? " Carritt took a quick stroll through the Hill , cast an eye at Paris , exclaimed , " My God ! " and withdrew the work from the sale . <P> Like Brer Rabbit . He left it hanging in the Hill , though , and somehow a tantalizing rumor spread through the art market that there was something up at Christie 's . Soon everyone in the trade was haunting the Hill and sniffing the air , each desperately trying to look at the painting without being caught looking at the painting . Indulging in a price-piquing little auction-house charade , Christie 's directors twice escorted London 's National Gallery director , Sir Philip Hendy , past the painting , slyly watched his reaction . Said one later : " He just sat tight like Brer Rabbit and said nuffin ' . " Hendy was thinking plenty , though . During a silverware sale , a red baize screen was placed just below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned , Hendy says , " I slipped in behind the screen and spent the entire morning looking at the picture . It was terrific . I thought we had a cinch. "
