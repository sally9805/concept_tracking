It is axiomatic in medicine that if many different treatments for a single condition are listed in the textbooks , none of them can be much good . Dozens are listed for the pain and disability in muscles and joints that commonly result from everyday injuries . They include drugs , heat , cold , rest , exercise , etc . Lieut . Colonel Arthur E. Grant , chief of physical medicine at Brooke Army General Hospital in Texas , was aware of all the possibilities because he was responsible for thousands of G.I.s who kept getting themselves banged up . He wanted something more effective than traditional medicine . <P> Dr. Grant had noted , as has many another TV sports fan , that athletic trainers seem to get good results with a cooling ethyl chloride spray . And he knew about applying hot-water bottles filled with ice cubes . But if a little cold is good , Dr. Grant reasoned , deeper chilling might somehow ease the pain and help the accident patient get his muscles and joints working sooner . Dr. Grant was certain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint is immobilized by pain , the harder it is to get it working again . <P> Dr. Grant 's team of physiatrists hit upon ice massage as the way to induce a deep chill . As they developed their technique , the medics began to use half-pound chunks of ice , frozen in cans , held in a washcloth . Patients complained of an uncomfortable chill , then of a burning sensation , then of an ache , but finally they reported a blessed numbness and easing of pain . If the injury was in a part of an arm or leg that could be dipped in water , it was dunked , then ice cubes were dropped into the water until the cycle of discomfort ended in numbness . <P> Among the first 1,000 patients-young G.I.s with fresh injuries-the deeper-chill method was successful in about 90% of the cases . Dr. Grant extended the method to 7,000 soldiers and ex-soldiers of all ages , and their wives , now reports that it has worked well in more than 75% of such patients . <P> Ice massage , Dr. Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorders as rheumatoid arthritis , which are known to be eased by heat and aggravated by cold . But for routine strains , sprains , bruises and Charley horses , he finds chilling to the point of numbness the most effective treatment yet devised . And even though patients may complain at first of its discomfort , they usually feel so much better after the treatment that they go home and do it for themselves .
