50 BAUDELAIRE IN THREE INJECTIONS Again I stood in line on the staircase . When I arrived at the top , the same voice said , " Entrez . " " Ah yes , " said the doctor . " Now , the inoculation , eh ? " " Wait a moment , " I said . " I had an injection yesterday . " " There are three injections . This is the second . " He filled the hypodermic needle and I took off my jacket and shirt . This time , when he stepped behind me , I thought I knew what to expect and braced myself accordingly . But the shock was no less , nor the pain . " Holy Mother of God ! " Three hours later I was tossing on my bed in delirium . The Sahara , dry as a bone , stretched to the hurizon . An Arab on a came came riding by .

Without taking his head out of the text , he said , " What course do you wish to take ? " " Baudelaire , " I said . He did not answer , but whispered to someone standing on the other side . The whisper traveled up the staircase . The door at the top flew open , and a voice shouted , " Baudelaire , three injections ! " The next day , instead of going to the university I sat down at a table at the Fiore and thought things over . Then I tore up the application forms .

No one blazed at me ; then I saw My mother and my father , he leaning On a dog-chewed cane , she wrapped to the nose In the fur of exhausted weasels .

The Makepeace Experiment by Abram Tertz Translated from the Russian by Manya Harari Prologue This is the story of Lyubimov , a city perhaps more ancient than Moscow itself and which might easily have become as important as Magnitogorsk* ? all it needed was a railway and an oil well conveniently in the neighborhood . But the ways of progress have passed us by , and there is nothing within miles of us but marsh , bog , and stunted woods in which the only game is hare and a few varieties of inedible birds . It is true that there is good shooting beyond Wet Hill , a district famous for its wild ducks which are said to have been so plentiful in the old days that they were exported by the cartload * Main European center of Russian metallurgy .

Bittern have a terrifying way of booming in the dark . But the town itself is attractive and cheerful , the people are wide-awake , the Komsomol* has a lot of members , and there is a fairly dense stratum of intellectuals .

She truly amazed US , Yet she was much too proud for anyone to take any liberties with her . Dr. Linde went nearly out of his mind . He had bet us two dozen bottles of beer : " Give me two evenings , " he 'd said . " and I 'll be on intimate terms with her . " Well , we drank his beer and laughed . The furthest he ever got with her was her fingertips : about a finger nail and a half . I once tried an experiment with her myself . She had dropped in at the Town Library and asked me in a bored voice for something to read . " What about Dear Friend by Guy de Maupassant ? " I suggested with a piercing glance . " It 's a very dissolute novel about French life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it somehow . " She yawned and stretched , her breasts straining at her blouse . " I 'd sooner have something by Feuchtwanger or by Hemingway . " That made me sit up . " What d' you mean ? " I asked in a whisper . " We do n't have any such things . We finished with all that rotten stuff in ' 47 . We got special orders from Moscow about Feuchtwanger . " " Really ? I did n't know . Then would you please give me Spartacus by Giovagnoli ? I like an adventure story to read in bed . " " That you can have . As many adventure stories auk you like . We actually have two copies of Synetaetts in our town . . . " And all the time I was kicking myself ! I was old enough to be her father . And I 'd read her Feuchtwanger and her Hemingway ( there 's nothing so very special about them ) and if I 'd had one Serafima in my life I must have had fifty  --  some had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a girl came from Leningrad and had been to college , she could so embarrass me that I had to drop my eyes ! What it is to be a provincial ! I forgot to mention our architectural monuments . We have a former monastery in our city , built in medieval times . After the Revolution the holy Fathers were sent to corrective labor in Solovki and in 1926 there turned up a Professor with a work party to do research and discover the secrets of the past . They spent all that summer poking about in the ruins , measuring and digging -- looking for amummy , they said . But of course we knew better . Buried treasure was what they were after  --  gold , something solid to lay their hands on  --  but they never found it . All they dug up was a skeleton of a monk with boar 's tusks instead of teeth , and with that they went away . Many of us at the time were curious about those tusks and went to the lecture the Professor delivered gratis  --  about the formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal and vegetable worlds . I too was sufficiently interested to drop in on him . I remember tying a silk sash over my Russian shirt , and putting on a straw hat , and strolling across to the dig . " Good morning , " I said politely , raising my hat . " And how is your research getting along ? " The Professor  --  he was in gym shoes and so modest , so unassuming , you would scarcely have known him for what he was  --  he gave me a friendly look and ran his frail , elderly hand over his small silvery beard . He had a wedding ring on , I noticed . " Well , well , " I said to myself . " A 53 representative of the Old Regime ! " I took my hat off respectfully and fanned myself with it , smiling . Suddenly he took a step toward me . " Perhaps you can tell me , young man . " ( I was still in my twenties . ) " There used to be an ancient chapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to ? I ca n't understand it at all . " And when I pointed to an empty space and told him all about it  --  how our chapel was blown up during the struggle against illiteracy , because it was the object of too much veneration and the center of popular gatherings , mainly consisting of women , and because of certain coincidences. such as when a blind man miraculously recovered his sight ; and of how there was not enough explosive , so that the work had to be finished by hand ( they wanted the site for a bakery ) ; and how afterwards the Chairman of the Town Council was burned to death on Christmas Day , and Maryamov 's arm withered , and Pasechnik , who had egged everyone on , was hit on the head by a log at the sawmill ( they carried him he me and hedied before the night was out ) ? when I told him all this , the Professor looked at me with an even warmer expression and said , " You should write it all down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your truthful chronicle of the life of your city would make a valuable contribution to the history of mankind . It would serve the common cause and perhaps make you as famous as Pushkin . " Being young at the time , I did n't take him literally . All I thought about in those days were girls , flirtations , teaching myself the guitar in twenty lessons , bicycling . . . But the years went by and suddenly there I ? vas -- a widower with a bald patch on my head , my daughter Ninochka married , and no longer the same love of bicycling in my heart . It was then I began to reflect . What 's the point of all this agitation , I asked myself . Why should a man struggle and exert himself when he can pick up a book and on the very first page get himself a new wife and children , a new home and a mass of colorful impressions  --  all virtually without any risk ? For the point of reading is , of course , that all the while your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seas , fighting with swords , suffering , and ennobling itself  --  your body sits comfortably in an armchair and you can even quietly smoke a cigarette and enjoy a refreshing drink . You can forget everything , you can become Spartacus if you like , or Ring Richard the Lionhearted ( out of Walter Scott ) , yet neither your absenteeism nor your political initiative runs you into the slightest danger . You put down the book and relax , and bask deliciously in your safety . The only bitter moment is when you realize that the author has been letting his imagination rip . There you were , sweating and suffering with his heroes , cold shivers running up your spine , and it turns out that he made it all up ! This I do n't hold with . The writer should write about what he has seen for himself or at least learned from a reliable source ; the reader should be given useful information to contribute to his mental development , and not made to feel he has been wasting his eyesight . What the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somebody 's blood  --  you ca n't expect him to feed on air . My own passion for literature developed after I was appointed Municipal Librarian . From reading to kill time , I became addicted to it . Then I tried my hand at writing . I wrote verse . It was n't bad  --  even the rhymes . But I still felt that some-54 THE MAKEPEACE EXPERIMENT thing was lacking , though I could n't make out what it was . It was then I recalled my conversation with the visiting Professor in 1926 . " Ahl " I thought , " if only something would happen in our city ! If only there were a fire or a political trial ! How gladly would I immortalize it for the generations to come ! " It was n't as if many people came to the library . Apart from Dr. Linde dropping in for a chat on the progress of science , or the Regional Inspector calling to see what the papers were doing about the shortage of cattle , there was only one other who came regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , it was there , in the library , under my very eyes , that he met Serafima Petrovna Kozlova and it all began . . . But all in good time . One day I came to work ... No , that wo n't do . One day I went out . . . No . You would n't believe how difficult it is to begin , to put down that opening sentence which triggers off the rest ! Afterwards it gets easier . Afterwards , as I know well , it gets so easy , it goes with such a rush , that you ca n't turn the pages fast enough . You write and you ca n't imagine where the words are coming from  --  words you never meant to use , words you 've never even heard in your life !  - -  yet they bob up of their own volition from under your pen and go sailing down the page , all in good order , like so many ducks or geese or black Australian swans ! It gives you such a fright , you fling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible ! It ca n't be right ! I ca n't have written that ! " But you look again and you see that everything has been put down correctly , exactly as you saw it happen . God almighty ! What can it mean ? I swear I 'm not directly responsible . Is it possible that not only is our city under a spell , but I myself am regularly wound up and set in motion by some invisible hand ? Iwarn you , whoever you are : if I 'm caught , I 'll deny everything . If I have to stand my trial , hands and feet bound , face to face with a terrible judge , I 'll recant , I 'll say there 's not a word of truth in it . ? " Citizen Judge , " I 'll say , " I 've been slandered and confused and tripped up . You can shoot me if you like but I 'm an innocent man . " Now I come to think of it , this may be the very reason why it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first sentence may have been sitting in my addled brain all along and I just ca n't bring myself to put it down . ? It 's simply that I want to stay alive ! Well , who would n't ? It 's nice . . . Nice to have a drink and a ciga rette ... Nice to read a book in peace and quiet ( reading is n't like writing ) . Nice to go fishing . . . or have a steam bath ... or an argument with Dr. Linde about pterodactyls .. . There it is again  --  pterodactyl ! How could I possibly have thought of such a foreign word ? I ca n't even pronounce it , and there are certainly no such creatures in our parts , as I 've already said ! I wo n't have it ! Get out , whoever you are ! Avaunt ! One day I went out into the porch and I saw ... Wait ! Not so fast ! First of all , why " I " ? Why this stupid habit of always putting oneself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was he who came out  --  Leonard Makepeace himself , our best mechanic and bicycle repairer in town ! And secondly , all these details are a terrible nuisance . Once you talk about a porch , you have to describe it  --  was it low or high and were its pillars carved and if so . . . and so on and so forth . .. until very soon you are writing quite a different story . To avoid this difficulty , chroniclers and historians make use of footnotes and I propose to follow their example . Thus if any reader wants to , he can take a breather and look up the details that interest him . But if he ca n't be bothered , let him by all means push on ahead as fast as he likes . And now , let 's begin.1 God , it 's terrifying ! It 's just like being an inveterate drunkard  --  it pulls you , you ca n't help yourself , you feel the rush of irresponsible words to your head . Well , let 's get on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Makepeace , dressed in a new steel-gray suit and with sandals on his bare feet , came out and stood in the low porch of his house . After a moment of indecision he drew a small homemade notebook a from his pocket and seemed to immerse himself in mathematical calculations . The weather was perfect . Clouds melted like sugar lumps in the bright blue sky , everything danced and shimmered in the brilliant sunshine , and Leonard , seen through the wattle fence , appeared at a first glance to be wearing a golden halo . A closer look revealed that Makepeace could not be merely doing simple sums in his notebook . 1 It was the 1st May , 1958 . Bless us , 0 Lord . 3 Scribbled all over with minute writing . He was concentrating on it with all his might : his lanky , narrow-chested body swayed in a curious rhythm , his breathing was labored , and two veins stood out on his forehead in the form of a V and were alarmingly swollen.1 Soon , however , the loudspeaker in the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day Parade and the sound brought Make-peace back to his surroundings . Snapping the notebook shut and putting it away , he uttered an enigmatic " Ah ! " and relaxed . " No , thank you , " he refused his mother 's offer of a little cottage cheese and sour cream . ( A frail old woman , shuffling in her felt slippers and clanking a pair of pails , she had joined him in the porch and was gazing at him devotedly . ) " You have some . Mama . I think I 'll go for a stroll before breakfast . " He walked down the steps and vanished from the porch for the rest of the morning . We will now look at the main square . It was echoing to martial music . A platform had been erected in the middle of it and upholstered in red cloth and upon this enormous crate the entire Administration stood , looking bright and alert and waiting for Comrade Tishchenko , Secretary of the Town Party Committee , to open the parade by ascending the tribune . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sand and not a single cow or sheep was nibbling the young grass . A red flag waved proudly in the wind from the top of the fire tower , while the five militiamen who formed the garrison were drawn up at the bottom , keeping a sharp lookout for drunkards , whose premature appearance in the square would have lowered the tone of the celebrations . 1 Such swellings can cause hemorrhage of the brain . Clouds of dust rose gaily in the distance as the citizens advanced in procession from the far end of Volodarsky Avenue . Marching in the van were small children in white shirts , some waving flags or carrying paper lanterns , while others walked unburdened and unconcerned , guzzling sweets and smearing snot over their rosy cheeks . A few workers came next  --  men from the sawmill and employees from the food store and the post and telegraph office , followed by a couple of truckloads of girls brought in from the collective farms . Comrade Tishchenko watched the procession and as he saw the children  --  that sturdy younger generation marching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . His face as radiant as if he had breakfasted on buttered pancakes , he waved to the crowd , or held his hand to his visored cap , or merely nodded , as much as to say , " Move on , citizens ; we too would like a rest from our official duties , " while the citizens cheerfully scuffed up the dust in time to the music and shouted , " Hurrah ! Glory to our valiant army ! " Suddenly there was a holdup . Instead of marching past , the crowd jostled in front of the tribune , looking up with curiosity at Comrade Tishchenko ; he had raised his hand and opened his mouth as if about to speak but his face was working in perturbation and not a sound was coming from his lips , though even the loudspeaker had encouragingly lowered its voice . We naturally thought at first that he wanted to make a statement on foreign affairs or to wish us a happy Day of Solidarity notthat it 's usual to change the order of the proceedings and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it 's long past their dinner time , but it was not for 56 THE MAKEPEACE EXPERIMENT us to know who should make a speech on what , or why , if they had to , they could n't get on with it . Ours was to listen to Comrade Tishchenko and drink afterwards . We were n't alcoholics , we could wait , it 's never too late for a drink if you have the money . After Comrade Tishehenko 's speech , there was nothing to stop us from drinking for the rest of the day . But what Comrade Tishchenko had to say was totally unexpected . His voice strangled , the words coming a couple at a time with long pauses in between , he sounded as if someone were twisting his tongue and making him speak , while his mind was groping desperately in the dark , trying to make out what the devil had come over him , " Dear fellow citizens ! " He stopped in obvious agitation . " Dear fellow citizens . . ? I wish , . . We wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He twitched , flushed crimson , and the next words came in a rush , all on one note and in a loud expressionless voice . " This day marks the start of a new era in the history of Lyubimov . I and the rest of the leadership are voluntarily , I repeat voluntarily , divesting ourselves of our functions , and I now urge you to unanimously elect a leader to replace us . . . a man who . . . our pride . . . our joy . . . I command ... I beg . . . " He faltered , gasped and , grabbing his neck with his two hands , squeezed his windpipe as if trying to stop the torrent of words . His eyes bulged , his body swayed to and fro , the boards creaking beneath its weight , and it looked as if at any moment he would fall down dead , strangled by his own hands , when a power evidently stronger than his own loosened the deadly grip , freeing the bruised throat , and his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crab 's claws , were slowly forced back . Standing in this defenseless posture , he concluded , " To elect as our supreme ruler , judge and commander in chief " his breath gasped and whistled ? " Comrade Leonard Makepeace , Hurrah ! " The silence was so deep that you could hear the chattering of Comrade Maryamov 's teeth . As head of the special branch of the secret police , he stood at his post on the edge of the tribune , as pale as a one-armed statue . ' The only other sound was the mooing of a cow in its untimely labor in some distant backyard.2 Within half a minute , however , isolated voices rang out in the crowd and very soon the whole This was the Maryamov who had lost his arm in the struggle against illiteracy . 2 This was the cow which haul been in the habit of infiltrating the square and nihhling the grass . multitude was stirring , rumbling and shouting its approval of the proposed resolution , " Long live Makepeace ! Long live our glorious Leonard ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how he had deserved the highest of honors , but he was immediately shouted down : " Do n't you know our Lenny Makepeace ? Our best mechanic and expert on bicycles ! Disgraceful ! Back to your village , you ignorant oaf ' . " No one thought it strange that young Lenny , an obscure mechanic , should have suddenly been raised to such a height . On the contrary , everyone was astonished that his administrative gifts had remained unrecognized by our foolish bosses and that no leading position had been offered him until now . " It 's all Tishehenko 's fault , " people were muttering . " He 's the one who stood in our poor Lenny 's way . . . Well , he 's asked for it . Look at him now , paralyzed  --  ca n't even straighten his arms  --  all humped up and twisted like an oven fork ! Serve him right , the devil . " The comments in the crowd were overheard by a swaddled infant of two months , asleep in its mother 's arms  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought it with her to watch the parade . Still too young to raise its head , it woke up , wriggled in its shawl , bared its toothless gums from ear to ear , and squealed , " I want Lenny to be our Tsar ! I want Lenny Makepeace to be our Tsar ! " Its childish prattle was drowned in a thunder of applause . Mad with enthusiasm , the crowd clapped and roared , chanting the familiar syllables of the leader 's name , " Leo-nard Make-peace ! Leo-nard Make-peace ! " There was nothing for it . Leonard had to step out of the ranks . Though still in his new , steel-gray suit , he looked bashful and a little embarrassed . ' In the middle of the square he stopped , bowed in the traditional manner to the four points of the compass and said , " Sorry , comrades and friends , I simply could n't think who you were calling for when I heard you shouting my name . I 've done nothing to deserve such kindness . Still , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bow to the people 's will . I 'll do my best to serve you  --  but one thing I beg of you : no personality cult ! For the time being I think the Ministries of Justice and Home Affairs might as well stay in my hands . Of course the State is withering away , but we ca n't do quite without control , can we ? What do you think , former Secretary Tishchenko ? " .1 It was for this occasion he had put it on . " Let go , Leonard , " Tishchenko moaned from his elevation . " Let go , " he repeated menacingly , though unable to move a single joint . Leonard only clenched his lean jaws , the veins swelling on his forehead and his expression conveying , " If you think you 're going anywhere , Semyon Tishchenko , you can think again . " All the strength and authority seemed to drain from Tishchenko 's body and suddenly  --  so the old women of Lyubimov say and such is the legend sprung from the imagination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribune like an idol overthrown . His head hit the ground and he vanished  --  but from where he hit it a feathered crow flew up with a loud squawk . " Quick , a gun ! " Leonard cried in a changed voice . A. s usually happens , no one near him had a gun , but Makepeace was no fool ; he took a run and threw himself face down on the same spot . immediately his arms developed the structure of wings , his legs contracted and folded up , and his gray suit turned into feathers . His beak stiffened and curved , his small , round eyes blinked , and a fully fledged hawk tore into the sky in pursuit of the screeching Tishchenko . Swooping and diving like experienced pilots , they fought their air battle while , down below , the people marveled and showed their approval of the new regime : " At him , Lenny ! Go for his eyes ! " But just as Lenny had forced him down and was about to sink his talons into the villain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57 a fox with a bushy tail . Had the rascal changed into a hare , our hawk would have made short work of him , but a sly fox is a match even for an eagle , so they say . If you have ever seen a fox on the run you know that in the open country its evasive tactics make it quite impossible to catch it with your bare hands . But where was Tishchenko to hide in the city , with nothing around him but houses , fences , legs , girls hitching up their skirts to give Lenny a clear view ? Heartened by the moral support of the population , Lenny changed his shape to that of a Borzoi . Dog though it is , this animal with its narrow face and long legs is as frisky as an antelope ; its body is as involuted as a monogram and it leaps and weaves over the ground as if it were writing Chinese hieroglyphics in the air . ...
