TELEVISION Flip-Side Streisand <P> It was Barbra Streisand 's second television special , and the publicity buildup made it sound like the Second Coming . " The most electrifying entertainer in the world , " pealed a CBS advertisement on air day last week , " has a new hit on her hands . . . even more exciting than the first . " The morning after , many a critic looped ecstatically through the hoop . Color Me Barbra , the show was called , and one reviewer exclaimed , " Color her magnificent . " " She is the only younger superstar around , " cried another . " The show of this year , " declared a third . Yet for all the press raves and the excessive bravos of the studio audience , last week 's Barbra was , at best , flip-side Streisand . The addition of color was Color Me Barbra 's single improvement over the original . Otherwise the show was over-cute , overwrought and suffocatingly overproduced . <P> Last season , in her showstopper , Barbra was given the run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opener and attempted topper , she gawked girlishly through the hallowed marble halls of the Philadelphia Museum of Art , singing as a Modigliani lady , now a latter-day Nefertiti , now Marie Antoinette . Later , she serenaded her poodle in French ( with subtitles ) , tromped like a kangaroo on a trampoline , played Tarzan on a trapeze , juxtaposed noses with an anteater and hoofed with a squad of penguins . <P> If anything , the show proved that one full hour of Streisand 's peculiarly nasal voice is about 45 minutes too much , and that her choice of songs-Sam , You Made the Pants Too Long ; Animal Crackers in My Soup-can be appalling . The Streisand talent is considerable , but it is getting lost in a myth .
