The trouble with being a girl athlete is that people often do n't really think of her as a girl . Australia 's Margaret Smith , however , never encounters that difficulty . She could trounce most of the world 's male tennis players , but to anybody 's eye she is vividly and unmistakably a girl . <P> Pretty and auburn-haired , Margaret Smith , 21 , is the best woman tennis player in the world . She was the best girl tennis player in Albury , New South Wales ( pop . 15,000 ) , when she was only ten , and the " keeper " of the local public court would let her play only against boys . She liked to station herself at the net and casually flick the boys ' best shots right back into their faces . " That 's how I got to be a good volleyer , " she says . <P> By the time she was 15 , Margaret had already won 60 tennis trophies .

Under Sedgman 's coaching , she ran , lifted weights , avoided boy friends . " They do n't mix with tennis , " she explains . In 1960 , at 17 , she upset Brazil 's Maria Bueno in the finals , became the youngest woman ever to win the Australian championship . <P> Margaret has been beaten since-but only by herself .

Losing at Wimbledon , Margaret says , was " the biggest disappointment of my life . I let a lot of people down . " She made up for that defeat by besting Billie Jean in straight sets in this year 's Wimbledon final , running out the last game in typical slash-and-smash Smith fashion : two booming sideline forehands , a perfectly placed passing shot in the corner , and a lunging , lashing volley that kicked up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounded out of reach . <P> Her rivals backhandedly insist that Margaret Smith is " as strong as the average man . " At hearing that Margaret shudders slightly , smiles sweetly , and says : " I 'm really a homey type . " Last week she certainly seemed in a hurry to get home . At South Orange , N.J. , in the finals of the Eastern Grass Court championships , she needed only 24 minutes to wallop the U.S. 's No. 1-ranked Darlene Hard , 6-1 , 6-1.
