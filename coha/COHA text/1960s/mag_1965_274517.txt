" IF I had learned education , " old Cornelius Vanderbilt once said , " I would not have had time to learn anything else . " That was the voice of a past America , which admired the man of letters but adored the man of action . It was an America that believed in the self-taught pragmatist , the graduate of life , the tinkerer who achieved progress through hunch and persistence . The intellectual was , at worst , distrusted as arrogant and impractical ; at best , he was respected as a cultural adornment and considered all right-in his place . <P> How long ago that seems . Today the intellectual 's place is everywhere . He is far better off than ever before and far more widely respected . He burst out of the academy not only into government but into business and industry , and he moves back and forth between them with complete assurance . A few names tell the story . Presidential Adviser Walter Heller and Ambassador Kenneth Galbraith are now back at their academic posts ( Minnesota and Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lecturers . The University of Pittsburgh 's Chancellor Edward H. Litchfield is also chairman of Smith-Corona and a director of Studebaker and Avco . M.I.T. Nutritionist Samuel A. Goldblith is also a vice president of United Fruit . Around Boston , particularly along famed Route 128 , there are some 1,000 space and electronics firms in whose executive echelons businessmen and scientists are often indistinguishable . Professors do consulting work for research firms , often earning double or triple their academic salaries . Similar business colonies and " think factories " have sprung up everywhere : Arthur D. Little in Boston , The Rand Corp . in Santa Monica , Aerojet General in Sacramento . <P> The intellectuals ' new affluence is not confined to the scientists and economists . Archaeologist Nelson Glueck was recently asked to join the board of a Cincinnati insurance company . Philosophers and novelists are not exactly swamped with management job offers , but their salaries are higher , their lecture fees munificent , and , what with paperbacks , they not only can get anything published , but published for gold . Then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guggenheim , one can always get a Ford , and if not a Ford , a Rockefeller . At the last meeting of the Northwestern University Finnegans Wake Society , a discussion group of professors and friends , eleven of the 14 members reported they were going to Europe for the summer-and not paying for their trips . For intellectuals , the greeting " Good Day , " it has been suggested , should be replaced by " Fair Fulbright . " <P> Anti-eggheadry is at a new low . What with the new concern about education , scholars and writers-in-residence are often community heroes ; professors get the celebrity treatment on TV . The much-derided middlebrow culture in a sense serves the intellectual because its members look up to him . The ordinary man , suggests Critic Leslie Fiedler , " can now identify with the intellectual . " <P> Who Qualifies ?
