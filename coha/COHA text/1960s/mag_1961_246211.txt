In 1838 , when Chopin wintered there with piano and Mistress George Sand , Majorca was a Mediterranean Bali Ha'i far off the beaten tourist track . Since then , thanks to cut-rate package vacations and a climate even kindlier than Spain 's Costa Brava , the island has become a kind of Costa Coney ( 436,000 visitors last year ) , where the local patois in peak season is more Cockney than Catalan . <P> Last week a campaign to lure the carriage trade back to Majorca was launched by Monaco 's Prince Rainier , a resort operator whose flair for free publicity is the despair of rivals from Cairo to the Catskills . On a visit to Majorca last year . Rainier was impressed by plans initiated by two U.S. promoters to convert a magnificently battlemented castle ( vintage 1900 ) into a luxury hotel and country club and bought into the venture . Called Son Vida ( Life Estate ) , the castle is now an air-conditioned , lavishly plumbed hotel , boasts its own swimming pool , a golf course abuilding , 1,000 acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) high enough to discourage the cut-rate crowd . <P> One Up for Elsa . To open the Son Vida in approved International Set style , Rainier invited a task force of names and name droppers and sailed on Aristotle Onassis ' yacht Christina . Besides his beautiful wife Princess Grace , the guests included the sari-clad Maharani of Baroda , Hollywood Columnist Hedda Hopper and Partygiver Elsa Maxwell , and , of course , Onassis ' great and good friend , Maria Callas . There was some worry about the propriety of Rainier 's and Princess Grace 's traveling on Onassis ' yacht , since Ari and Maria are not married-a condition that Princess Grace , as a good Catholic , finds distasteful*- But at least the Rainiers were spared the embarrassment of having Ari and Maria register at the hotel with them ; Ari and Maria stayed on the yacht . <P> The hotel-warmers attended a bullfight , at which the stocky Prince gamely assisted a matador and took a royal pratfall as the bull charged . No press cameras were permitted , but Princess Grace dutifully filmed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a terrible stare these beasts give you when you get close to them , " confided Rainier breathlessly . At one dinner Elsa got one up on Hedda by taking over the piano to play Cole Porter tunes , accompanied by Rainier on drums . Then Ari bellowed the theme song ( in Greek ) from the movie Never on Sunday , while La Callas rattled the maracas but declined requests for an aria . <P> Revenge for Hedda . Next day , Hedda got her revenge when a reporter asked if she had launched more movie stars than Elsa . Snapped Hedda : " The only thing Elsa knows how to launch are boats . " The big party reached its climax with a dinner for 125 cosmopolites , at which island dancers and singers performed for the guests and Hedda announced grandly that she would try to land them Hollywood contracts . <P> All in all , Rainier allowed , beautiful Majorca " is a wonderful escape place , " adding hastily : " It will never compete with my principality .
