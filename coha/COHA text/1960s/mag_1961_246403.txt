Blast Wave , also referred to as the shock wave , is the wall of pressure generated by a nuclear explosion . It speeds outward from the explosion point at 2,000 m.p.h. , slows as the distance increases . <P> CONELRAD is an abbreviation for Control of Electromagnetic Radiation . It is an emergency communications system in which all commercial broadcast stations will leave the air except those assigned to instruct the public at 640 and 1,240 kilocycles . It is intended to nullify enemy equipment that uses radio signals to pinpoint targets . <P> Dosimeter . An instrument that indicates the amount of radiation a person has absorbed . <P> Gamma Rays , generated by a nuclear explosion , are similar to X rays and form the radiation that is most dangerous to life . They are the main reason for fallout shelters . <P> Ground Zero is the point on earth closest to the center of the nuclear explosion . <P> Kiloton , a unit used in measuring the energy of a nuclear weapon , is equivalent to the energy released by the explosion of 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons . The Hiroshima bomb was a 20-kiloton bomb . <P> NAWAS , standing for National Warning System , is a civil defense warning network , controlled from North American Defense Command headquarters in Colorado Springs , linking 449 cities , military bases and other defense points by 45,000 miles of telephone lines and microwave radio circuits . <P> NEAR , standing for National Emergency Alarm Repeater , is a home warning system still under study . In NEAR , a 240-cycle signal carried on regular 110-volt power lines would set small buzzers , plugged into alternating current outlets , to squawking . NEAR units could be installed in each home for a few dollars , might give warning to all within one minute after the discovery of an oncoming attack . <P> Overpressure is the number of pounds per square inch ( p.s.i. ) above normal atmospheric pressure exerted by the blast wave of a nuclear explosion . An overpressure exceeding 20 p.s.i . can be fatal to a human being . <P> Ratemeter is an instrument similar to a dosimeter , except that it indicates the rate at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roentgen is a unit used in measuring gamma and X rays . It is named after Wilhelm Konrad Rntgen , a German physicist who discovered X rays in 1895.
