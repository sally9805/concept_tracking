txt Premier Maurice Couve de Murville declared tonight that France 's monetary allies had assured her of " all the help she might need or will need in the future , without any reservation . " To combat what he described flatly as an international monetary crisis , he announced also that he would go before the National Assembly tomorrow and demand slashes in Government spending , a revamping of the nationalized industries to cut their losses , and a " fundamental reform " of the financial market . The silver - haired Premier , looking grim and tense , addressed the nation on television in an effort to allay fears that have encouraged a run on the franc , and to prepare the public for strong measures to meet it . The brief talk was staged as an interview , with questions posed by an official of the state broadcasting network . Devaluation ' Omitted The word " devaluation " was never uttered , but the burden of , the address was to reaffirm General de Gaulle 's comment last week that this would be " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France would take strong measures , with foreign help , if necessary , to protect the , franc at its present level . Foreign help , Mr. Couve de Murville said , was assured by central bank governors of 11 major industrial countries in Basel , Switzerland , last weekend . No decision had been announced at the meeting . " This is riot , properly speaking , a French crisis , " the Pre- ' mier said . " It is an international crisis , it is one of those monetary crises of which we have known many for several years . Speculation Abates " It was set off by a frantic , I would say phenomenal , speculation in German money , which some claim should be revalued . It has , in truth , hit all Europe and even the United States , and naturally this time France has been hit , too , because there were the events of May ; because she was weakened and because , even though her recovery is under way , and well under way , it is not yet complete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed here to have lost more than $200-million of reserves last week as holders of francs bought foreign stocks , gold and , above all , German marks . The British pound is thought to have suffered even more . Mr. Couve de Murville re // called that France had long preached that " the monetary system is sick " and should be overhauled . " Unfortunately , this was not done , " he said . This does not , however , deny the existence of " international solidarity , " he continued . At Basel last weekend , he said , " nobody put in doubt this international solidarity , particularly in so far as it is shown by aid that some should grant others . I must tell you that from this point of view all the help France might , or will need , will be granted her without any reservation . " He cast no light on whether any specific loan arrangement had been made .

The economic situation , he said , has " good " and " less good " , aspects . Under " good , " he reported that production was beginning to surpass the rate it had reached before the strikes of May , order books were amply filled , unemployment had reveled off and exports had increased more than imports . Under " less good , " he listed an " excessive " deficit in the budget for the calendar year 1969 , now estimated at nearly $3-billion ; the tax burden , and the many other handicaps on business , notably excessive Government intervention and a defective credit system . All these he promised to remedy without offering details . Although the National Assembly has nearly completed action on the budget , Mr. Couve de Murville said he would call upon it tomorrow to adopt revisions . Taxes could not be raised without hurting the expansion of business , he said , so a sub , stantial reduction of the deficit would have to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries , which include the railroads , telephones , much of aviation , and many mines , auto plants and others . The Premier added that the 1970 budget would mark " the real return to equilibrium . "
