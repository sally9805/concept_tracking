Chile 's rugged , reformist Christian Democratic President Eduardo Frei is nothing if not ambitious . Not only has he promised to end Chile 's spiraling inflation and redistribute the land-but he has challenged an even more sacred institution : the three-hour lunch hour , with its hallowed tradition of siesta . <P> Ever since the founding days of Bernardo O'Higgins , Chileans have paused in the day 's occupation at noon to go home , dine on three courses and Riesling , and once upon a time , snooze it comfortably off before returning for another three hours of work in the late afternoon . In modern times , however , workers in downtown Santiago , Valparaiso and Concepcin , many of whom live six or seven miles from their jobs , have spent most of their lunchtime stalled on buses in traffic jams . So when Frei 's government , seeking to boost efficiency and save electricity , last year asked the University of Chile to make a survey , results showed 94.6% favoring an uninterrupted working day , with only 4.5% opposed to the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week bravely decreed new 9 to 4:30 working hours , with only a 30-minute break for lunch , for government employees and large private corporations in the nation 's ten biggest cities . Unfortunately , most downtown areas were woefully short of lunch counters or cafeterias to feed the hungry hordes , but most Chileans , for the present at least , seemed disposed to bring lunch in a paper bag , or wait in line . " It is rather expensive , " moaned Jorge Soto , a government clerk who earns $53 a month . " I have to pay 600 for a one-course meal , and this will cost me 20% of my salary . " Even less popular was another new rule . To make sure that Chileans really use their new free time to get home to dinner with the wife and children , all bars were ordered to close between 4 and 7 p.m.
