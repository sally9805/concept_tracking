In the high , marbled central chamber of the Supreme Court , Earl Warren sat last week for the last time as the 14th Chief Justice of the United States . It was an occasion of ceremony and speechmaking . Richard Nixon was there to watch Warren Earl Burger , the man he had named as Warren 's successor , take his oath of office . But the President put in an appearance for another reason : to offer symbolic support to an institution that he himself had attacked so harshly during last year 's election campaign . Emphasizing the court 's importance as an instrument of " continuity with change , " Nixon praised Warren for having personified " fairness , integrity and dignity " during his 16 years as Chief Justice . In his valedictory reply , delivered with an occasional quaver , Warren said of the court : " We serve only the public interest as we see it , guided only by the Constitution and our own consciences . " <P> Decision Days . Until the very last , the court that Warren led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though many critics complained that in some instances it had already gone too far . Just minutes before Burger 's swearing-in , it handed down three decisions that further protect the rights of criminal defendants : &gt; In a pair of cases from Alabama and North Carolina , the court ruled that a man who gets a criminal conviction set aside but is convicted a second time on the same charge , may not be given a longer sentence without any justification . Bad conduct after the first trial may be sufficient reason for a harsher sentence , the court said , but a man may not be punished merely for exercising his right of appeal . By a 7-to-l majority , the court ruled that unless the trial record adequately explains the reason for the longer term , the defendant has been deprived of due process . <P> &gt; In a Maryland case , the court declared by a 6-to-2 vote that the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy applies to the states . In so ruling , the court upheld John Dalmer Benton , who had been convicted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Benton had sought a new trial on the burglary charge , but instead was retried-and convicted-on both charges . &gt; In a California decision , the I. most important of the three , the court reversed the conviction of a numismatist named Ted Chimel , who was sentenced to prison in 1966 for stealing rare coins . When police arrested Chimel at his home in Santa Ana , Calif. , they examined the premises without a search warrant and found some of the stolen coins . Such searches are common . Many police departments , seeking to avoid the necessity of justifying a search warrant before a judge , wait to arrest a suspect at his home , then claim that the search is " incident to a valid arrest " and therefore legal . A 6-to-2 majority of the Justices disagreed . Police , they said , may search an arrested man 's person and , to prevent him from destroying evidence , " the area within his reach . " But if broader searches were permitted without a court warrant , they concluded , the Fourth Amendment privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
