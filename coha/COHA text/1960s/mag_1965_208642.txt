BEWARE OF CAESAR by Vincent Sheean. 244 pages . Random House . $4.95 . <P> <P> The Roman philosopher Seneca came to a sad end . Spurred by patriotism , he came out of exile to tutor Emperor Claudius ' unstable stepson Nero and was rewarded for his pains several years later when his onetime student ordered him to commit suicide . At least Nero recognized greatness ; ordinary mortals died by torture when a shadow crossed the Emperor 's demented brain . In this threadbare , novelistic pastiche , Vincent Sheean treats Seneca far worse . Though the historical Seneca was second only to Cicero as an exponent of Stoicism , Sheean 's Seneca has only windy self-pity and a maundering facility with cosmic clichs ( " In my opinion the wickedest and unworthiest of men are generally the most rewarded " ) . He shows little understanding of his venomous pupil , perhaps because Sheean 's Nero is not a character at all but a dim amal gam of perfumes , painted lips and libido . In all , Sheean has taken one of history 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and produced a dry tract full of petty non sequiturs . <P> <P> CATS DO N'T CARE FOR MONEY by Christiane Rochefort. 183 pages . Doubleday . $3.95 . <P> <P> Christiane Rochefort 's first novel , Warrior 's Rest , won the Prix de la Nouvelle Vague in 1959 . That book told , with almost clinical clarity , of the inexorable destruction of a young woman who surrenders herself to an insatiable , mad alcoholic . It is not likely that Rochefort 's new novel will win any prizes . Celine is a casually wicked misfit who can not abide middle-class posturings . So she marries Philippe , a stuffed middle-class shirt who is " obsessed with the Absolute the way some people are with golf . " Middle-class sex with Philippe only accentuates Celine 's boredom , and so she drifts into some high-class sex with her friend Julia , which seems to make life tolerable until Julia gets killed in an automobile accident . Well , that 's the way the chassis crumples . Author Rochefort says that married life is hell for a woman who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore either . <P> <P> THE LONG DAY WANES by Anthony Burgess . 512 pages . Norton . $6.95 . <P> <P> The illustrious line of British colonial fiction may have arrived at parade 's end with this trilogy of short novels about the last days of British rule in Malaya ; Britain has no place to send another Kipling , Maugham , Forster , Greene or Waugh . Author Burgess ' witness to the waning of the imperial day is Victor Crabbe , a teacher in a multiracial prep school solemnly modeled by its British founders after Eton and Harrow ( Burgess himself served for three years as an education officer in Malaya ) . Bemusedly , Crabbe sees that the system is crumbling , but the snobbery is not . Malays hate Indians , who hate Chinese . Every Asian hates the British , and secretly despises himself for not being British . Crabbe , who does not think himself superior to the Asians , is regarded as a madman . Who throws away superiority unless he is mad ? The turnabout suggests what is wrong with the novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is very hard to write about such a hero . <P> <P> MRS .
