Until the overthrow of King Idris last September , Libya was an oasis of Western opportunity between Egypt and Algeria . But in the four months since a group of young army officers seized power , much of that has changed . Last week U.S. Ambassador Joseph Palmer acceded to the wishes of Strongman Muammar Gaddafi , who demanded that the U.S. withdraw entirely from Wheelus airbase outside the city . The base was used for bombing and gunnery training for NATO-assigned U.S. fighter squadrons . In similar sessions , the British also agreed to give up smaller bases at Tobruk and El Adem . <P> The U.S. had no option except to give up a base whose lease would have expired in 1971 anyway . " The sky over Arab Libya , " charged Colonel Gaddafi , " is being polluted by foreign planes . " Whipping up popular sentiment against the American and British military presence , Gaddafi asserted that Libyans were being " terrified " by colonialist soldiers . Unless Britain and the U.S. agreed to give up their bases , he threatened to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the members of his nine-man Revolutionary Command Council were virtually unknown in Libya before the September coup . Gaddafi , for example , was a poor boy who grew up in a tent . Now , while Arab boys hawk his pictures in Tripoli 's Ninth of August Square ( named for Libya 's Army Day ) , Gaddafi leads a campaign to wipe out the graft and privilege that depressed the country during the monarchy . About 600 ranking officers , politicians , civil servants and wealthy businessmen have been jailed . The 25,000 Italians , 7,000 Americans and 5,000 Britons , who previously enjoyed special status in a backward Arab society , are uncertain about their future in Libya . <P> Libya 's new rulers are stressing their allegiance to the stern precepts of Islam . One of the junta 's first decrees was to outlaw beer and whisky . In Tripoli TIME Correspondent Gavin Scott discovered that " up " and " down " elevator buttons had been covered by tape to obscure the offending English words . All foreign-language street signs were removed . Because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels must translate aloud the list of dishes to non-Arabic-speaking diners . To their great embarrassment , hotel guests are confusing the Arabic equivalents of " ladies " and " gents . " <P> Reason to Get Along . The Libyan junta plays up its dedication to the Arab cause . It warmly received Al-Fatah Leader Yasser Arafat and presented him with $240,000 for the guerrillas . But the U.S. and Britain are trying to get along with the new rulers , and the main reason is Libyan oil . Since the ' 67 closure of Suez , Libyan exports have doubled because high-grade Libyan oil lies closer to Europe without the canal than most Arabian oil . Thirty-eight companies , mostly American and British , presently pump about 3.7 million barrels a day . Libya now ranks as the third largest oil exporter ( after Venezuela and Iran ) . Since the government receives $1 on each barrel , oil accounts for 80% of Libya 's national income .
