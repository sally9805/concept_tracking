txt Indonesia ? the only nation to quit the UN ? may be back in its seat by the opening of the General Assembly next September , high officials here believe . One factor might still delay the return until next winter : a slowdown of the provisional People 's Congress scheduled to start July 1 in Jakarta . The return of Indonesia would now be more a matter of symbolic than financial or voting importance to the UN .

It takes its name from some tall , delicate Javanese sculptures that wait impassively for their homeland 's return .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
