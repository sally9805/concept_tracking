However tattered Barry Goldwater 's influence may be in the Republican Party , he put every shred of it on the line last week to save his beleaguered national chairman , Dean Burch . <P> In an extraordinary two-page letter to each of the 132 Republican National Committee members who will meet in Chicago on Jan. 22 to vote on Burch 's future , Barry proved that he , at least , still had a powerful faith in his cause . " I feel the removal of Dean Burch now would be a repudiation of a great segment of our party and a repudiation of me , " wrote Goldwater , " and in this sense would be harmful rather than beneficial to the future of our party . " Things could get even worse than that , Barry warned . " For the Republican Party to turn its back on our cause now would be to destroy the two-party system - and that would be the prelude to the destruction of our nation . " <P> He offered neither excuse nor explanation for his Election Day defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaimed bleakly that the G.O.P. would become " meaningless " if it wandered from Goldwaterism into " the vanity of today 's popularity . " <P> Later , Dean Burch himself sent a long , hopeful letter to committee members . " Let me assure you , " wrote Burch , " that my interest in continuing to serve as national chairman is not simply a personal one . My concern is not financial , nor even primarily a loyalty to a particular leader or ' faction ' of the Republican Party . I am dedicated to just three things : the unity , the strength and the achievements of the Republican Party , across the board and throughout the nation . " <P> Still , it was highly questionable whether the Goldwater pen-pal plan would save Burch . Moderate Republicans were confident last week that they had a firm committee majority ready to vote against him .
