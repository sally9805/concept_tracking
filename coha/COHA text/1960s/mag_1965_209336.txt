Achtung ! The Parisian windows flew open-there below " they " had returned . The street teemed with Wehrmacht uniforms , trucks and gunning motorcycles . Over in the Place de la Concorde the scene was even more incredible : U.S. Sherman tanks were grinding over the cobblestones , shooting it out with panzer units . On the He de la Cite , sandbags were piled up before cafes and Molotov cocktails exploded all around the Palais de Justice . <P> Off and on for the past four months , Parisians have found themselves jolted right back into a bad dream as a Hollywood production unit has ground out the on-the-spot scenes for Is Paris Burning ? The end is in sight , if Parisian nerves can stand up till then . This week , in perhaps the most chilling re-enactment of all , the Fiihrer himself confronts his Paris commandant , General Dietrich von Choltitz , and orders him-once he can no longer defend the City of Light - to leave it " nothing but a blackened field of ruins . " The actor who plays Hitler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is afraid to leave the set except mustacheless and in mufti . The porcine , Prussian-looking fellow cast as General von Choltitz worries less , for during the past year he has got as many off-screen hisses as autograph requests . His name is Gert Frobe , but no one remembers him as anything but that malevolent archvillain in his most famed film . Gold finger . <P> Empathic Powers . Is Paris Burning ? boasts a luminous roster : Jean-Paul Belmondo , Charles Boyer , Orson Welles , Kirk Douglas ( as George Patton ) and Glenn Ford ( Omar Bradley ) . But it is significant that the actor that Paramount and Seven Arts signed up first for their $6,000,000 epic is blubbery ( 230 Ibs . ) Gert Frobe . And it was not just on the strength of his Goldfinger portrayal . Though his international following dates only from that role , the 52-year-old Frobe has some 80 film credits , five acting awards , and an infinite range-from the frightening psychopath in It Happened in Broad Daylight to the goatish dupe in Banana Peel to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Their Flying Machines . <P> Raised in what is now the East German city of Zwickau ( his mother still lives there , but they are allowed to exchange visits ) , Frobe was a violin prodigy and opera-set designer before he turned actor . During World War II , the man now cast as a German general never rose past the rank of corporal . He is convinced , however , that his empathic powers are limitless , for no role has eluded him yet . " I can not stand on my hands , " he says , " but I feel certain that if I were acting a part which required me to stand on my hands , I could do it . " His Paris Burning producers , he recalls , wanted him " to speak French or English for the Von Choltitz part , but I could not ; it would change things . " Probe 's intuition has proved bang-on ; his spitting out of the traditional Junker officer 's accent is breathtakingly authentic .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
