" Repulsively ugly " wrote a German archaeologist , Paul Wolters , of his finds on one of the Greek islands in 1891 . By the artistic canons of his day , the classical Greek figure was the ideal of feminine form and the hourglass Gibson girl in her geegaws and gilded garters the height of fashion . To Wolters , the pinched sculpture found in the Cyclades , as the isles south of Troy and north of Crete are called , must have seemed pretty slim pickings . Yet these ostensibly crude figurines , despite their small scale , emerge as the first monumental sculpture in the Western world , and in their search for symmetry are the direct forerunners of the Venus de Milo . <P> Preclassical sculpture is now back in fashion , largely because the work of such modern sculptors as Giacometti , Arp , Brancusi , and even the nudes of Modigliani , have changed what constitutes the canons of beauty . But Cycladic sculpture itself is as rare as golden fleeces . A recent show at Manhattan 's Andre Emmerich Gallery had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from $100 to $37,000 , and outnumbered the Metropolitan Museum of Art 's total collection of them by better than 3 to 1 . The Greek government bans their export , but as long as the farmers on Naxos , Paros or Amorgos islands turn them up with plows , a small number are smuggled out , guaranteeing that the Cycladic market will stay open , opulent , small-and pregnant with pre-classical Greek significance . <P> Marble Passion . Actually Cycladic figures , as rudimentary as they seem , are the end product of many millenniums of sculptural development . During the Stone Age , the female figure was treated in sculptural artifacts as a talisman of motherhood , with thighs and stomach huge in relation to arms and head . With the arrival of the Bronze Age , Cycladic sculpture of 2600 to 2000 B.C. trimmed these fetishes down to a sterner , more geometric expression . The bodies flattened out , the frontal silhouettes took on the lines of violins rather than double basses , with elongated necks topped by heads mostly undetailed save for straight , almost abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slender statuary of male musicians playing harps and the syrinx , or pipes of Pan . <P> As Greece rose toward its golden age , the rigid canons of Cycladic art , ready for change , submitted to many influences . In its ivory and gold bull dancers , Minoan art from Crete mixed in the snaky rhythms of Egypt and Mesopotamia . Later inhabitants of the Greek peninsula added the black , angular stick figures of early vase painting . By the 6th century B.C. , Greek archaic sculpture , with its faintly smiling athletes , elevated the male figure to an aggressive human presence in nature . From the period of the figurines of the Cyclades , the contours of sculpture gained more and more grace until one ancient historian , Diodorus , could say that Praxiteles , the 4th century B.C. sculptor , " informed his marble figures with the passions of the soul .
