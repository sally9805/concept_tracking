" Listen . Tomo and Hirohito and you . Nomuru and you Kurusti , and all the rest of you heathen suns of heaven , you wo n't understand this , it 'll be far over your pagan heads , but , even so , you ought to hear about it . " ? C. E. McBride , Kansas City Star , - March 27 , 1944 . Reprinted in Best Sports Stories 1944 ( Dutton ) . Crew Slammer never made Best Sports Stories . He never gut farther than the bulletin board at the Fort Worth Press . He was a victim of the industry , for he collided time and again with the mentality ceiling that bears down on every newspaper I know anything about . Nevertheless , I believe that Crew Slammer in his way was a better sportswriter than C. E. McBride , Stanley Woodward , or even Red Smith . He was inquisitive , sardonic , satirical , cynical , opinionated , hedonistic , and what intelligence he had was easily offended . He hated sport . " To watch it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baseball was something that the twentieth century had a right to do without . Spectator golf ranked in importance with bridge tournaments and Junior League rummage sales . Football , tennis , hockey , and boxing interested him for aesthetic reasons . Crew Slammer fancied that he wrote like Hemingway . A typical lead describing a junior swimming meet would begin , " In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that ... " Crew Slammer was like all my friends in those days . He wanted more . He had a competitive drive to be the best . Why did he become a sportswriter ? That is the question we were all trying to answer . Inevitably we turned to the Best Sports Stories anthology , there to prosper or rot . I am sad to say that Crew Slammer did not prosper , but pretend you do n't know that for a while . For Crew Slammer was a myth , a symbol of our tragic graveyard , a commentary on conditions . He lived onlyin our imaginations , which of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports in 1958 at the Press , I already knew something about basic reporting . I covered the night police beat for two years at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. , much to the despair of a night city editor named Ed Capers who used to tell me , " Your trouble is , your fingers are too fast for your mind . " I thought he had it backwards , so I quit and joined the sports staff of the Press . Instinctively I realized that the only way to move forward was to change newspapers every two yearsa pattern I followed to the Dallas Times Herald , the Dallas Morning News , and finally the Philadelphia Inquirer , where , like Crew Slammer , I became a victim of the mentality ceiling . But almost every important thing I learned , I learned at the Press . The Fort Worth Press is one of those dilapidated brick-box institutions that Scripps-Howard used to stake between the railroad yard and the farmers ' market . Its city room with the eras of dirt and the rancid smell of machine oil reminds you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years it has been vanishing in a cloud of soot , and momentarily it will reappear as a parking lot . It is maintained as you would maintain a shoe box of old letters by a few faithful servants who are nearing retirement age . Good writers have come and gone , and the others have joined the scenery . I can not visualize the Press city room without calling up Delbert Willis , the one-legged city editor who periodically takes a leave of absence to hunt fur the Jap who got him ; Caroline Hamilton , a husky , old-maidish feature writer in cowboy boots ; or Marvin Garrett , a meek silverhaired farm and county editor . Marvin is sitting at his desk , barely visible behind an enormous mound of publicity releases ( which we would sometimes take , turn over and use for copy paper 84 CONFESSIONS OF A WASHED-UP was , " How the hell would I know ? " Newsday , the magazine pointed out , demanded an answer . There was no way for Newsweek to know it , but sports editor Blackie Sherrod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950 . Sherrod surrounded himself with such men as Dan Jenkins and Bud Shrake , now well-known and excellent writers at Sports Illustrated , not to mention the irresponsible Crew Slammer . He let them write from the gut . What obsessed us all was the species . We could watch for hours out the window of the Press composing room which overlooked the New Gem Hotel , where God knows what the Negroes were up to , speculating out loud what the species might otherwise become . Without sport , what would Mickey Mantle do ? He would drive a fork lift , Crew Slammer was certain , Joe Kuharich would be night watchman for a company that manufactures caskets . Joe Narnath raised carrier pigeons and sold hubcaps . Roger Maris operated a liquor store on the Illinois-Missouri border . Bud Wilkinson was Norman Rockwell 's chauffeur , and Vince Lombardi operated an academy for the suns of South American dictators . Rice football coach Jess Neely , a slight , shallow-faced man with a Southern drawl who has since retired , was a kindly Southern scientist who devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephant . He always seemed to be at cross purposes . It was a great joke , of course , but after a while Jess Neely did suggest something unusual . I remember being assigned to do what we called a jock-strap story after an SMU-Rice game in Houston about 1960 . It appeared from the press box that Rice lost the game because Neely refused to gamble on fourth down late in the fourth quarter when the alternative was certain defeat . in the twenty minutes before deadline I had to race to the Rice dressing room to gather some quotes from Neely and write six hundred words . All I could think to ask was , " Coach Neely , what were you thinking out there on fourth down ? " Neely gave me a sorry scowl and said , " Why , young man , to score more points than my opponents , naturally . " At the time I questioned his sincerity . Now that I am older and wiser I believe that Neely was answering as well as he knew how . Frank Howard , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men I ever interviewed . In a situation much like the one Neely found himself in , Frank Howard first talked about the other team ( " Those big old fine-looking athletes " ) , then concluded , " We were gon na get our tails whipped , it was a question of by how much . " In most cases the argot of the sports industry SPORTSWRITER can be traced to the sports pages . An American Football League player discussing the ability of a rival kickoff-return man observed recently , " He good ! He good ! He have developed the knack to alter directions on a dime . " He read that somewhere . On the other hand , originality and imagination can be trouble , as Darrell Royal frequently discovers . Royal , the University of Texas football coach , thought himself amusing a few years ago when he likened the rival team from Texas Christian to " a bunch of cockroaches . " And he was . The trouble started because a few sportswriters stopped short of explaining that while TCU had not won many games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good thing for someone else . This slip is still a psychological spook anytime TCU plays Texas . Press conferences such as this one are hazardous . Sportswriters are too absorbed by their own questions to understand the answers . Harold Ratliff , sports editor for the Associated Press in Texas , is the dean of the press conference because he has made himself a focal point for years . Harold likes to bait his subject . He is always asking coaches to predict how much they will win by , or better yet say something rotten about the opponent . While he is never successful , he believes that he is . A recent AP story out of Dallas begins . " Coach Tom Landry of the Dallas Cowboys professed concern over his team 's future Wednesday although the Cowboys hold a three-game lead ... " On the face of it , this is a strong story . Good Lord , the entire future of the Cowboys ? Well , not quite , as the story goes on to explain . What happened , I am certain , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your team about has it the championship wrapped up , would n't you say ? " Landry would not . Landry pointed to the difficult schedule in the final weeks of the season , and he said , " We could still lose it . . . " Iremember a discussion that several of us had with Landry one afternoon . The subject was " field position , " a term you hear more frequently from college coaches than professional coaches . The concept of the game of football is attack and retreat , the same as war . The ultimate object is to capture the opponent 's goal , but a secondary consideration is keeping the ball as far as possible from your own goal line . Professional teams with their superior striking power are less cautious about field position , but no less concerned , as Landry was explaining . After taking some time to ferment his question , Ratliff cornered Landry and asked , " Tell 86 CONFESSIONS OF A WASHED-UP SPORTSWRITER " I kept thinking : I 'm just a statistic now . I thought about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in Pittsburgh . Boy , that 's gon na be a dead affair ! Pittsburgh ! Boy ! That 's the irony ? the only team in the league I never wanted to play for , and here I was dying on their time . " Someone called a priest and Stautner made his final peace with The Maker . " Father , " he said weakly , " I do n't have much time , so if it 's okay with you I 'll just hit the highlights . " V Just as an athlete , if he 's any good , will rise to the occasion , so will a sportswriter . That is the essence of his profession , and one of the reasons there are so few good sportswriters . The other reason is editors . Unfortunately , there is not a hint of a parallel between the average coach and the average newspaper editor . There was an abundance of writing talent in Texas at the time when Crew Slammer and the rest of us still considered the impossible dream to be a dateline from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize it . The Dallas Morning News ' Bill Rives had Tex Maule working the slot . His reasoning was that it took more judgment to arrange stories than it did to write them . Maule hated the job . Now he is senior editor at Sports Illustrated and one of the top sportswriters in the country . Roy Terrell , SI 's assistant managing editor , was stuck away somewhere in Corpus Christi . The sportswriters everyone heard of in the 1950s were Jesse Abramson , New York Herald Tribune ; John Carmichael , Chicago Daily News ; Red Smith , New York Herald Tribune ; Maxwell Stiles , Los Angeles Mirror ; Ed Danforth , Atlanta Journal ; Earl Ruby , Louisville Courier-Journal ; Milton Gross , New York Post ; Joe Williams , New York World-Telegram &; Sun ; Jimmy Cannon , New York Post ; Prescott Sullivan , San Francisco Examiner ; Tim Cohane , Look ; Bob Hunter , Los Angeles Examiner ; Si Burdick , Dayton News ; Shirley Povich , Washington Post . As E. P. Dutton &; Co. , Inc. spread the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furman Bisher , Atlanta Journal ; Jack Murphy , San Diego Union ; Murray Olderman , NEA ; and Bill Rives , Dallas Morning News , joined the pack . Still later , Blackie Sherrod clamored over the wall of the Fort Worth Press , found an outlet at the Dallas Times Herald and became ? along with two Los Angeles columnists , the Times ' Jim Murray and the Herald Examiner 's Mel Durslag ? one of the best day-in day-out sportswriters in the business . These men worked for the big papers and covered the big stories , and E. P. Dutton &; Co. , Inc. , sorted them out each year for recognition . Others , such as Dan Jenkins and Bud Shrake , would occasionally break through on pure ability . The men in Best Sports Stories wrote with a diversity of styles and emphasis which only helped to confuse a novice . I ca n't think of his name but there was an old-timer from Philadelphia who started every game story like this : " Army 's powerful Cadets defeated Navy 's game but outmanned Midshipmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a crowd of 81,392 . " The second sentence was always , " Army won the toss and elected to receive . " Having created that , he tacked on the play-by-play and got drunk . We could see that this style went nowhere . We were in danger of being replaced by the ape . As far as I know this exercise is still tacked to the bulletin board of the Fort Worth Press : By CREW SLAMMER The World 's Greatest Sportswriter Baltimore , Nov. 27 ? Late in the fourth quarter when Army 's Black Knights of the Hudson had traveled on their bellies long enough to be mistook for Arlington National Cemetery , and had risen in an agonizing mass and smashed the United States Navy 's football team to bobbing bits and pieces , Army coach Red Blaik craned his neck toward the score board clock , whispered to an assistant , and squirmed off in the direction of the men 's room . Army had won , 23 to 7 , and Blaik was ready to wash his hands of the whole affair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph . After all , it was written for the bulletin board , not the five-star final . Crew Slammer was 1,500 miles away , emptying the wastebasket , when Army defeated Navy . There was something else , though , which Bill Rives ( by then assistant managing editor of the Dallas Morning News ) explained to me a few years later : You ca n't use men 's room in a family newspaper ! " I also learned from Rives that you ca n't use " Jap-a-Nazi Rat " in a family newspaper , even when you are quoting Jules Feiffer 's Great Comic Book Heroes . Rives looked like an VI aging Rudolph Valentino . He was a fanatic for words . The walls of his department were posted with signs ordering KEEP IT SHORT ! or WRITE LIKE YOU TALK ! The trouble was , neither Rives nor any of the other name writers followed those orders . Maxwell Stiles 88 CONFESSIONS OF A WASHED-UP SPORTSWRITER Illustrated it was difficult to plead his case . Take the creative mind and lash it to a pillar in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattle of Western Union printers . Give it headlines to write and other people 's stories to read and paste up , and you will understand why from time to time rats have been trained to play the piano . Boredom may be the mother of genius ; certainly it comes equipped with its own safety valve . Boredom is the reason why at the Dallas Times Herald in 1960 we came to invent the mythical football power from Metcalf R. The name honors the late newspaper poet James J. Metcalf ( the R. stands for nothing in particular , it just sounded better than Metcalf U. or Metcalf Poly ) . On any Sunday among the agate lines of type telling who won , a Times Herald reader was privileged to find the results of the Metcalf R , game . Metcalf R. scheduled such worthies as Indiana MeGruder and Southeastern Oklahoma Central , and always won by three points . Do not suppose this went unchallenged . On one occasion when the Metcalf R. score was accidentally lost on the composing-room floor , a neighbor of the city editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move : the invention of the Corbet Comets , a small high-school football power of unspecified classification . The Comets streaked along on the energies of their twin halfbacks , Dickie Don and Rickie Ron Yewbet ? named for TCU football coach Abe Martin 's speech pattern ( " We gon na play some foobuhl , yewbet we are ! " ) , Every Friday night we inserted under a 14-point headline a paragraph celebrating Corbet 's newest triumph . Corbet did not lose for two seasons , in which time Rickie Ron got mumps and died , Someone had blue and black Corbet window decals printed , and someone else suggested a story to the editor of the women 's page when E. 0 . ( Shug ) Kempleman , Corbet Ford dealer , donated the world 's largest tuba to the Fighting Corbet Band . Later , when I worked for the Dallas Morning News , someone slipped in to print the results of the city of Corbet municipal elections . F. D. Orr defeated E. 0 . ( Shug ) Hempleman , 43 votes to 38 . Rives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IIe called me " flip " and suggested that I read The Texas Almanac sometime and grow up . What is much harder to forgive is what Rives did to my " Study in Black and White " story , the year that the Mississippi State basketball team conquered everyone except its state legislature . There was a law in Mississippi prohibiting integrated sports events . On the day before the MSU basketball team was supposed to leave for the NCAA tournament in Louisville , this law was stretched to include sports events anywhere in the world so long as they involved state teams from Mississippi . This was a banner story anywhere in the country . No one had to tell me to place a longdistance call to the captain of the MSU Learn . I do n't remember the captain 's name , but I remember that he was surprisingly candid . To his way of thinking there was justice in the fact that the Mississippi State basketball team could not claim a national championship until it had played and beaten teams of Negroes . In a touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior dance in his hometown of Poplarville , Miss . That night , some of the town rednecks kicked down the jail door , hauled out a Negro named Parker , tied him with rope , and threw him in the river . The MSU captain could not remember what the victim had done to rile the population , but the lynching dampened his heart where it would never dry . " The night of our senior dance he repeated . " Imagine . " I wrote the story straight and Rives killed it . He gave this reason : " This puts the Dallas News in a position of taking sides . " Well , my God , what if it does ? Rives could have just dropped it there . Instead , in an amazing burst of rationale , he added , " If it were a wire-service story , maybe it would he different . But this story . . . this story is written by our own man . Our own man ? " Rives was n't there a few years later when the Morning News destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned from a friend that Dallas Country Club was discreetly planning to drop its annual invitational tennis tournament rather than open it to Arthur Ashe , a Negro . The friend put me in touch with an influential club member who confirmed the story and added , " We ca n't very well have an invitational tennis tournament without inviting the best player in the country . And the mossbacks who run this place ca n't very well bring themselves to let Arthur Ashe in the front door . " For several years running I had been assigned to cover the tournament . I did n't like it , but there it was in my assignment folder . Dallas Country Club is where The Establishment that Dallas claims does not exist runs the city , including both of its newspapers . Hence the annual DCC Invitational Tennis Tournament was displayed by both Dallas newspapers as you would display WORLD WAR THREE ... right up till the moment when my story that the whole thing had been dropped was dumped in the editor 's wastebasket . After a 90 CONFESSIONS OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowding darkness . An old woman in a stocking cap stomped her feet to keep from freezing . A boy ? he could n't have been ten ? pressed close to a burning trash basket . Something stirred Bunker ; he started and saw them too . He looked at them a while , then he told me , " Boy hi-dy , that 's what I call The Great Unwashed . ' " I carried the three hundred dollars with me all morning . I really was broke , having ripped through my expense money from the Times Herald in defense of sanity . But I gave back those three bills . I finally realized they were payment for all the Mickey Mouse stories I would ever write . That is the only time anyone ever offered me money . There is a more subtle practice , however ? hiring sportswriters to do program stories or other inconsequential writing jobs for the team they are assigned to cover . It pays well , up to $50 for a couple of pages . I could nominally consider myself a professional writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about the same as baseball writers accepting $25 a game to serve as " official scorer . " The answer to conflict of interest , Texas E. Schramm used to explain , is to write positive . Schramm is president and general manager of the Dallas Cowboys , but he learned the business as publicity man and later general manager of the Los Angeles Rams . Los Angeles was and still is a sportswriters ' holy place . Athletes step softly . Management is generous . Nevertheless , a big game is a big game , and tickets can be hard to come by . When the Rams ' management prohibited passing out free tickets to the 1951 championship games in the Coliseum ( in accordance with league rules ) , local newspapermen talked it over and decided that the event was not worth covering . They stuck by the position until the Rams reassessed their own and purchased at full price from the league office several hundred " complimentary " tickets . As a publicity man , Schramm sometimes wrote a column under the by-line of a well-known Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his employers , he wrote nothing that the columnist might not have written for himself , had he been up to it . All Schramm did was accent redeeming qualities , Ex-Tulane publicity man Larry Karl provided a similar service for a New Orleans sports columnist in the 1950s . Karl would write the column , deliver it , fix it with a standard headline and tuck it in the columnist 's typewriter . On one occasion Karl appendaged the column with a personal note ? " Ed " ( or whatever ) , " the plane leaves at noon . " He discovered how far things had gone when the message appeared in print as the final sentence to the column . Let me make one thing plain:most sportswriters have no business in journalism . They are misfits looking for a soft life . The worst sportswriters are frustrated athletes , or compulsive sports fans , or both . The best are frustrated writers trapped by circumstances . Westbrook Pegler called sportswriters " historians of trivia , " but Pegler learned his craft by writing sport . Scotty Reston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Paul Galileo wrote about sport . Winston Churchill covered cricket during the Boer War . The New York Times ' John Kieran was a sportswriter , but he was much more . When students at Yale protested that a sportswriter had been invited to address them , Kieran delivered his speech in Latin . Sportswriting should be a young man 's profession . No one improves after eight or ten years . but the assignments get juicier and the way out less attractive . After eight or ten years there is nothing else to say . Every word in every style has been set in print , every variation from discovery to death explored . The ritual goes on , and the mind bends under it . Ask a baseball writer what 's new and he 'll quote you the record book . Baseball writers are old men , regardless of age . Crew Slammer contended it was the sport that made it so , but all sport has a tedium that eventually gets too heavy for the human soul . Men who have traveled the deadly dull cycle too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One writer with the Philadelphia Bulletin has been with the Philadelphia Eagles Football Club so long that he refers to them as " we . " Difficulty with pronouns is a terminal sign for the journalist . A writer whose ear is gone can become an editor , which is to say he can become a censor and accountant . Newspaper editors pretend to be appointed guardians of the old mentality ceiling ( " write to the sixth-grade reader " : never mind why he is sixth-grade ) , yet in reality they are the mentality ceiling . Crew Slammer and the rest of us formulated the theory that the higher a man climbs in the newspaper business , the less he becomes . It must be like a pencil sharpener up there . I never did learn the name of the man in The Tower who had me fired from my last job as sports columnist of the Philadelphia Inquirer . I saw him once . He was pale and , as I recall , walked with a limp . I believe the last time he came down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulletin truck or something . His reason for letting me go was he could n't understand what I was writing . I appreciated his position .
