The fact may have generally escaped notice at the time , but when New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller leaped back into the race for the G.O.P. presidential nomination on April 30 , precisely 100 days remained until the balloting was to begin in Miami . Last week , despite enthusiastically cheering crowds and some other encouraging signs , there was increasing worry among his followers that Nelson 's Hundred Days might well wind up as Napoleon 's did-with a Waterloo . <P> Not that Rockefeller was allowing any such thoughts to distract him from his hard-fought , late-starting drive . Through the week , he swept from New England to the Great Plains to Arkansas and Texas , bringing to 35 the number of states he has visited since he rejoined the race . He cracked jokes and lobster in Maine , clanged through the streets of Sioux City , Iowa , in a fireman 's hat , was greeted on the green in New Haven , Conn. , by Sybil , a seven-year-old elephant with a Rockefeller sticker on her trunk , and dropped in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick up gifts for Happy and the two boys ; when the $21.08 bill was rung up , he had to borrow $1 from an aide and 8 from a LIFE reporter . <P> The Difference . Despite Richard Nixon 's long lead in the delegate count ( see box ) , Rocky was drawing big and often enthusiastic crowds . Encouraged by last week 's Gallup poll showing him trailing Democrat Eugene McCarthy but leading both Hubert Humphrey and Nixon , the Governor told a Boston press conference : " I was just flying over your race track and I saw the horses coming into the stretch . If I could get into the lead in the stretch , believe me , that would be tremendously helpful . " In Maine , he reminded audiences that he had been born in Bar Harbor and cried : " We 're going to have a Maine President at last ! " * <P> Everywhere that Rockefeller spoke , he asserted that he stood a better chance than Nixon of winning for the party in November . In Huron , a delegate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nixon , is there ? " " Not much , " Rocky shot back , " except that I can get elected . " Addressing New Haven teenagers , most of them black , he declared : " We 're a minority party , and if we could get together with some other minorities , that would be the best thing we could ever do . " <P> For all his ebullience , Rockefeller knows that without a big break his chances may be doomed . There were a few hopeful signs , but nothing that was important enough to slow down Nixon 's momentum . The South Dakota poll showed Rocky as the strongest candidate for President , despite Nixon 's victory in last month 's uncontested primary there . He got a good word from Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger , who called him the best candidate still on the political scene . <P> Seeking to make his own break , Rocky kept lambasting Nixon . For several days , he made capital of a blooper by Nixon 's Southern campaign manager , Congressman Howard ( " Bo " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get George Wallace on our side . That 's where he belongs . " Nixon finally disavowed any connection with the former Alabama Governor .
