It was as natural as two lumps in his cup of tea . The year was 1782 , and there was Elkanah Watson , 24 , a Massachusetts-born merchant visiting London with 100 guineas to burn . As he dined with the famous expatriate painter John Singleton Copley , Watson resolved to spend the money on a portrait of himself . Together they decided to include in the painting , as Watson wrote , " a ship , bearing to America the intelligence of the acknowledgment of Independence , with a sun just rising upon the stripes of the union , streaming from her gaff . " <P> Prudently , the artist waited until the royal proclamation of U.S. independence . Returning from the House of Lords where on Dec. 5 , 1782 King George III recognized the freedom of his former colonies , Copley invited Watson to his studio . " There , " recalled Watson , " with a bold hand , a master 's touch , and I believe an American heart , he attached to the ship the stars and stripes . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old England . " <P> The portrait ( see color ) is Copley at his finest hour . Commingled with the puritanical solidity of American realism are the extravagant fancies of Britain 's " Grand Manner " - sharply outlined bulks interrupted by thin , evanescent cuffs , ruffles and fluttery papers . The painting underlines the irony of Copley 's dilemma . As is documented by a current show * on the 150th anniversary of the artist 's death , he was the first great American painter , but his very quest for art destroyed that vision . <P> Frivolous &; Sacrilegious . Brought up in the thrifty , strait-laced atmosphere of colonial Boston with its population of 18,000 , Copley had no great art works to study . Art was held to be frivolous , even sacrilegious , except for sign painting and portrait limning . Complained Copley : " Was it not for preserving the resemblance of particular persons , painting would not be known in the place . The people generally regard it no more than any other useful trade . " <P> Forced to learn from local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His metallic colors , hard lines and precise realism produced steely likenesses of such colonial worthies as Paul Revere , Samuel Adams , John Hancock . Learning by trial and error , he made his clients sit for as many as 900 hours while he perfected their portraits . Rates were strictly by size : " Whole lengths 40 guineas , half lengths 20 , pieces or busts 10 . " <P> Ten years before the Revolution , Sir Joshua Reynolds had seen Copley 's Boy with Squirrel in London , had it hung at the Society of Artists without knowing the painter 's correct name . Copley 's contemporary , Pennsylvania-born Benjamin West , living in London since 1763 , urged him to visit Europe 's art treasures and learn to eliminate his too " liny " look . Not until the eve of the Revolution did Copley , accused of being a Tory sympathizer , dare risk ocean passage . He left behind him three houses and 20 acres on Beacon Hill . Copley never returned to America .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
