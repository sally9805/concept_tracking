" It is understandable , " declared Protestant Theologian Paul Tillich , " that a conference like this meets widespread skepticism , perhaps by some in the conference itself . " He challenged both the encyclical and the possibility of realizing its dream of world order . <P> <P> Tillich pointed out that the ideas behind Pacem in Terris , being strictly Western and Judaeo-Christian , are alien to religious traditions that do not consider the dignity of man as an ultimate value , and should not be forced onto the rest of the world willy-nilly . As for the sweeping condemnation of war , Pacem in Terris , said Tillich , did not consider the problem of resistance to violations of human dignity . " There are situations , " he warned , " in which nothing short of war can defend or establish the dignity of the person . " <P> Effective authority , Tillich said , needs power , and the conflict of authority with authority leads , inevitably , to the use of force . " But when is coercion a just expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medieval concept of the just war , for example-no longer serve in an age of possible atomic conflagration , and the many laws that apply to men can only obliquely serve as guides to the proper conduct of nations . <P> <P> These problems led Tillich to conclude that there is a definite limit to hope for peace on earth as prescribed by Pope John . Men must " distinguish between genuine hope and Utopian expectations . " Genuine hope is found in such factors as the atomic threat that has imposed on mankind a common destiny , the conquest of space that makes neighbors of distant nations , international cooperation in science and medicine . <P> Out of this limited cooperation may emerge what Tillich called " communal eros " - the love of men for other nations . But , he said , " there is no hope for a final stage of history in which peace and justice rule . History is not fulfilled at its empirical end ; but history is fulfilled in the great moment in which something new is created , in which the Kingdom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This means that we can not hope for a final stage of justice and peace within history ; but we can hope for partial victories over the forces of evil in a particular moment of time .
