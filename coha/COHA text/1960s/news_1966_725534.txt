Franklin D. Roosevelt-Jr. , Howard J. Samuels , a businessman , City Council President Frank D. ' O'Connor and Nassau County Executive Eugene H. Nickerson. ? all attacked Governor Rockefeller , . Particularly on fiscal matters . They disagreed on few issues . One notable exception was on keeping the 15-cent fare in New York City . All but Mr. Roosevelt favored retaining it . ? $1.50 Minimum Wage Urged The . 51-year-old son of the late President said that he favored keeping ' it under present conditions , but that if the mini= mum wage was increased from $1125 to $1.50 an hour he ' would support a fare increase to make more money available for education . The contenders were introduced for their 10-minute opening statements by Senator Robert F. Kennedy , who praised them all as " highly qualified to be Governor .

Kennedy in Background Mr. Kennedy scrupulously avoided getting into issues himself lest he take the play away from those competing in the forum , which lasted more than two hours . But , besieged on the stage afterwards , he said that while he was " not certain " the party 's nominee would come from among the four men on display today , there was a " good chance " of it . In the opening speeches , Mr. Samuels dug deepest ' . into a single **25;791;TOOLONG his entire 10 minutes to it . The 46-year-old ' father of eight whose home is in Canandaigua , told the audience of 900 , mostly upstate political leaders , students , and professors , that he favored an increase in education to a level of at least $5.5-billion a year by 1970 .

He suggested that Mr. Udall be asked to report his findings within six weeks . Mr. O'Connor , the only participant who has yet to announce his candidacy , was also the only one to speak merely from rough notes . His informality and humor brought him the most applause during the opening speeches . Nickerson Charges Neglect The 56-year-old former Queens District Attorney devoted himself largely to asking biting questions of Mr. Rockefeller . " What ever happened to ' pay as you go ' ? " Mr. O'Connor asked , referring to Mr. Rockefeller 's assurances against increasing the state debt . Noting that the State Constitution required the voters to approve new state borrowing , Mr. O'Connor asked : " Is n't it a fact that , of all the new indebtedness , not a single dollar has been approved by the people ercept money for a park band ?

Noting that New York had once been first but now was 29th among the states in the percentage of high school graduates going to college , Mr. Nickerson added : " It has been said that all history is a race between education and catastrophe . Yet New York today sends less than half of- its high school graduates to college . And so our future is slipping away . " The forum . was conducted in the auditorium , of Statler Hall ; which houses Comell 'S School of Hotel Administration , including a " practice inn " where students may try out what they learn on paying guests . The hall was given to the university by the family that established the , huge hotel chain . Delegations of party leaders from 17 upstate counties were scattered through the capacity audience , their locations marked by wood-handled , placards that gave the forum , a convention atmosphere . Republicans from Cornell marched in front of the auditorium with signs bearing such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put Me Through School . " Senator Kennedy shook hands with them when he arrived , and invited them in to hear the speeches . The Senator received in return an invitation to a house party .. He expressed his thanks , But had to leave Ithaca after the forum . ? Mr. Nickerson insisted that what he could do for his county he could do for the state as a whole , saying : " If , in one county , government can open new doors in employment , in housing , in education , for the victim of bigotry , it can be done for New York State . " There will be at least five more forums , although the places and dates have been set for only three . They are : Brooklyn College , May 24 ; Saratoga Springs , June 4 ; Buffalo , June 14 .

Comment Mr. Roosevelt took another viewpoint . " Let us enlist . the universities of the state in the systematic eradication of decay , blight , discrimination and poverty , " he said . State Chairman John J. Burns supervised the question-andanswer period . During this , Mr. Nickerson said it was important to subsidise mass transportation , if necessary , rather than raise the fare because , he said , 20 times as many people could be moved on one track as could be moved on one highway lane . Mr. Samuels drew a burst of laughter when in answer to ' a question on what he would do about Mr. Rockefeller 's large public relations organization if he were elected , he said : " I 'd fire half of them and make my image my accomplishment "
