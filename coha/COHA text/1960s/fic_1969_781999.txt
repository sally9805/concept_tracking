 | " Anyway , I 'm here as a proxy . Seems like she got herself a kidney-stone attack . It 's out now , she 's doing okay , but she 's still over at Saint John 's Hospital and she wants some reading . You can get awfully tired of television . " " More people are reading books than ever , thanks to television , " agreed Fremont seriously . " There is nothing like the experience of a good book , as your wife obviously knows . " " A good book , " repeated Kellog . " Yeah , that 's what I want to get her . " " Well , now , we 've got something to satisfy every taste . If you could give me an idea . . . " Kellog stepped closer to the bookstore proprietor . " The old girl reads everything . Even history . But mostly I guess it 's fiction , novels . Anyway , for the hospital , I do n't think it should be anything too deep or sad-like . Maybe something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a little snap to it . And new , it should be real new , so 's I wo n't be getting anything she 's already got from her friends . I asked her to give me some help last night ? what does she want ? ? but she just said , Otto , you go and surprise me . And if you get real stuck , you go over to Ben Fremont 's and ask what he suggests . ' So here I am . " " Well , now , I 'm sure we can find ? " " Of course , " Kellog interrupted , leaning over the counter , lowering his voice , " I do n't think she 'd mind if the book had a little realistic life to it . You know , something with a bit of  --  well . . . " " Oh , sure , sure , I understand . " " Do n't get me wrong . She goes for the heavy intellectual stuff too , but she sure got a kick out of that Lady Chatterley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you know what I mean . Still , it was a classic , but at least it was n't boring . Well , there she is in the hospital , and if you 've got anything half as good and brand new ... " " Half as good ? " Fremont had come to life . " The minute you described your wife , I was going to suggest something . Listen , I 've got a brand-new book in , spanking new , not even officially published yet , and this book , it 's ten times as good as Chatterley or any similar classic , maybe a hundred times better . I 'm telling that to every woman who comes in the shop , and I do n't recommend everything . In a couple weeks , I 'll bet you , the eyes of every  | woman reader in Oakwood , in all of Los Angeles , will be glued to this book . " Fremont snatched a volume from the pile beside the cash register . " Here it is . She 's in the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kellog began to lift his sunglasses . " What 's that cover say ? " Fremont 's forefinger pointed at the title on the front jacket . " The Seven Minutes , by J J Jadway . This is something no woman 'll ever forget . Your wife , it 'll excite her , absolutely excite her  --  and yet it 's literature . " " Oh , it 's literature . Well . I 'm not sure , maybe that 's not exactly ? " " Forgive me . I misled you with that word . I just meant it 's nothing to be ashamed to read if you are a reader , a sophisticated reader like your wife . Most people , not being sophisticated , being clods or puritans , they might take offense at the whole thing . But if you know what life 's all about , you can appreciate the frankness of a novel like this . As far as I 'm concerned , you can take them all , the books by Cleland , D. H. Lawrence , Frank Harris , Henry Miller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading Jadway . They do n't know a thing about sex , and nobody ever did , until Jadway came along . He invented it . He invented it for The Seven Minutes , except his is real , realer than anything I ever read . " " You read the book ? " " Twice . First time in Paris . The Rtoile edition . The French would n't allow publication in French , and the United States and Great Britain would n't allow publication in English , so there was only that little special Paris edition for tourists . Then I read this first public edition , the very first for the general public . Did n't you see the big ad in the Sunday paper ? The most banned book ever . " " Why was The Seven Minutes banned like that ? " Kellog wanted to know . " Is it obscene ? Is that why ? " Fremont frowned . " This book was banned because  --  yes , I guess you might say it was banned in every country in the world because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally had the courage to say , Maybe the world 's grown up a little , at least some people , and maybe now 's the time to bring  | it out  --  because , whatever this book has been called , obscene or whatever , it is still a masterpiece . " " How can a book be obscene and still be a masterpiece ? " " This one is . It 's both . " " Do you think the book obscene , Mr. Fremont ? " " Who am I to say ? That 's only another word . There 's a fourletter word some people think is dirty and other people think is beautiful . So there we are . Some people , maybe most people , will say this is dirty , but there 'll be plenty of people who 'll say it 's worthwhile . " " Sophisticated readers , you mean . " " That 's right . They do n't give a damn about obscenity if in the end they have some great reading that gives them new insights and understanding into human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Kellog . " It sure does . " " Despite those bannings ? What 's there about it ? I mean , what 's it about ? " " Simple , very simple , like all great art , " said Fremont . " A girl , young woman , is lying in bed thinking about love , that 's the essence . " " And that 's what the fuss is about ? " said Kellog . " You almost had me interested , but when you put it that way  --  that sounds pretty dull . " " Dull ? Wait a minute , listen to me . I said she 's lying in bed , sure , but while she 's lying there she 's getting laid , I mean really laid . And all the while she 's thinking , on her back thinking , and Jadway shows us what 's in her mind about what 's happening to her down below , and what 's in her mind about other men she 's had or ones she wished she 'd had . The way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy . " Kellog grinned . " Sounds a little better now . That 's more like it . And you think this is the sort of thing my wife would enjoy ? " Fremont grinned back . " It 'll sure take her mind off her kidney stone . " " How much is it ? " " Six dollars and ninety-five cents . " " That 's a helluva lot of money for such a little book . " " Dynamite comes in small packages , " said Fremont . " This is  | dynamite , guaranteed . The book 's not even out yet , officially , until next week . We get our shipments here on the Coast early , and so we had to unpack and put our copies right out because there was such a big demand since the advance advertising . Already Jadway 's our biggest seller . " " Wrap it up . You 've sold me . " Kellog had his wallet out . " Here 's a ten . Can you change a ten ? " " Sure thing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made change , then placed the receipt and the copy of The Seven Minutes in a striped paper bag . " I 'm sorry I was such a tough customer , " Kellog said apologetically . Fremont smiled as he handed the striped bag across the counter . " I like a discerning customer . I do n't mind being challenged . Keeps me on my toes . And do n't worry about the book . It 'll help your wife get on her feet fast , believe me . Good day . " The second that he was out in the sunlight once again , Kellog slid his hand inside his sport jacket and flipped the lever on the box beneath his armpit . Hastily he headed in the direction of the waiting Ford coupe , and as he did so he hoisted the striped paper bag above his head . Immediately Ike Iverson stepped out of the car , carrying a similar bag , and strode over to join him in front of the jewelry shop . As they met , Kellog asked , " How did Eubank do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clear , " said Iverson . " Sa-ay , you were in there long enough . " " Those literary conversations take a little doing , " said Kellog with a wink . He shook his purchase . " But it 's in the bag . Duncan 'll be happy . Well , we 'd better start comparing . " Kellog removed his copy of The Seven Minutes from the striped bag . He opened the book , found the loose end paper at the front of the book , located his pen , and carefully signed it with his initials and the date . When he finished , Iverson was beside him , also holding a copy of The Seven Minutes . " Ready ? Let 's get it over with , " said Iverson . " Same jacket and title , right ? " " Check . "  | " Same publisher , publication date , copyright , correct ? " " Check . " " Same number of printed pages , right ? " " Exactly , check . " " Let 's compare the marked passages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just bought . " " Okay , " said Kellog . Working quickly , the two men compared a half-dozen pages . " The same , " concluded Iverson . " Well , Otto , the books are identical , agreed ? " " Agreed . " " Guess we 'd better pay Mr. Fremont another visit . " " Yeah , " said Kellog , returning his book to the bag . " Otto , do n't forget your Fargo unit . " 1 Kellog reached into his sport jacket , found the switch beside the microphone of his portable Fargo F-600 intelligence unit . He Pushed the lever . " It 's on . " Briskly , striding in step , the two returned to Fremont 's Book Emporium and entered it . the Once inside , Kellog saw that Ben Fremont was still behind counter next to the cash register , busy Pouring a Coke into a large paper cup . Kellog led the way , with Iverson right behind him . Fremont had just brought the soft drink to his lips when he recognized Kellog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Kellog , " ? you are Ben Fremont , proprietor of Fremont 's Book Emporium , are n't you ? " " What do you mean ? Of course I am . You know that . " " Mr. Fremont , we 'll have to introduce ourselves officially . I am Sergeant Kellog , assigned to the Vice Bureau of the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Office . " He held out his badge , then returned it to his pocket . " My partner here is Officer Iverson , also of the Sheriff 's Vice Bureau . " The bookseller appeared bewildered . " I  --  I do n't get it , " he said , setting his Coke down hard and spilling it . " What 's going on with ? ? " " Ben Fremont , " said Kellog , " we are placing you under arrest for violation of Section 311.2 of the California Penal Code . The Code states that every person who knowingly offers to distribute any obscene matter is guilty of a misdemeanor . Under Section  | 311a , obscenity ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards , the predominant appeal of the work in question , taken as a whole , is to prurient interest . That 's to say , the work goes beyond customary limits of candor in its descriptions , and is utterly without redeeming social importance . The District Attorney believes that the book The Seven Minutes , by j J Jadway , would be found obscene if taken to court , and therefore you are to be put under arrest for selling that book . " Ben Fremont , mouth agape , face ashen , gripped the counter 's edge , trying to find words . " Wait a minute , wait , now , you ca n't arrest me . I 'm just a guy who sells books . There are thousands of us . You ca n't . " " Mr. Fremont , " said Kellog , " you are under arrest , absolutely . Now , for your own sake , do n't cause any trouble . We want all your invoices from Sanford House for purchased copies of this book . We 've got to confiscate every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take them into our custody . We 'll also have to take that advertisement from the window , and any other promotional materials concerning the book . " " What about me ? " " I thought you remembered the procedure . Never mind . We have a police vehicle outside . You will have to accompany us to the Sheriff 's Office on West Temple Street for booking . " " Sheriff 's Office ? For what  --  for what , dammit , I 'm no criminal ! " Kellog became suddenly impatient . " For selling an obscene work . Did n't you yourself tell me ten or fifteen minutes ago ? " Iverson hastily came forward , placing a restraining hand on Kellog 's shoulder . " One minute , Otto . Let me tell the gentleman his rights . " He addressed himself to the bookseller . " Mr. Fremont , everything you said before your arrest and everything you are saying now is being recorded by a wireless transmitter attached to Sergeant Kellog 's person and relayed to a magnetic tape recorder in our police vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your rights before your arrest . Now that you are under arrest , it is my duty to warn you that you need answer no questions , that you have the right to remain silent , that you have the right to the presence of an attorney . Now you 've been fully informed . If you want to ask questions , answer questions , that 's up to you . " " I 'm not saying another word to either one of you , goddammit ! "  | Fremont shouted . " I 'm not saying anything until I have an attorney ! " " You can make a call , " said Kellog , controlled . " You can call your attorney and have him meet you at the Sheriff 's headquarters . " Instantly Fremont 's anger vanished , and what was left was fear . " I  --  I do n't have an attorney . I mean , I do n't even know one . I 've only got an accountant . I 'm just a ? " " Well , you can have the court appoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait , " Fremont interrupted . " I just remembered . The publisher 's salesman , the Sanford House salesman out here , when he sold me the books he said  --  he said if there was ever any kind of trouble , to call him right away , because they were standing behind their book , and young Sanford , he 's the publisher , he 'd pitch in , he 'd get any one of us an attorney . I 'm going to call their salesman . Can I call him ? " " Make any call you want , " said Kellog . " Only make it fast . " Fremont grabbed for the telephone . But before dialing he stared at the officers . It was as if some new thought had crossed his mind and he was considering whether to speak what was on his mind . He spoke . " Listen , do you guys have any idea what you 're doing ? " he said , voice trembling . " You think it 's nothing . You think you 're just arresting some poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , maybe you 're not . You know what you 're really doing ? You 're arresting a dead author and his book  --  you 're arresting a book , something a man had to say . You 're arresting and fingerprinting a freedom , one of our democratic freedoms , and if you think that 's nothing , you wait and see what can happen .... " Fr WAS WHEN he was driving along Wilshire Boulevard , halfway between the law office in Beverly Hills that he had just left forever and his three-room apartment in Brentwood , that the complete realization of what had happened to him struck Mike Barrett with its fullest impact . After all the years of struggle , he was liberated . He was one of the emancipated ones . He had made it . From the corner of his eye , he could see the carton on the seat next to him . An hour ago he had filled it with the personal papers and effects that had accumulated in the firm 's walnut desk , the  | desk which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The contents of the carton , in a way , represented the corpus of one frustrating , unfulfilled , second-rate legal career spanning a decade of his thirty-six years . The carton itself , the act of its removal , symbolized a victory that ( on the blackest of the sleepless and selfhating nights ) he had nearly given up hope of ever achieving . It wanted a celebration , a triumphal parade , an arch , at least a garland . Well , they were all present in his head and his heart . But still , some outer celebration of independence won and success attained was required . Firmly holding the wheel of the car with one hand , he undid the knot of his tie with his free hand , and yanked the tie off . Next the shirt collar . He unbuttoned it and spread it open . Tieless at high noon of a working day . Lese-majeste in the kingdom of the American Bar Association , unless you are majeste himself . Then the Latin phrase came to him . Rex non potest peecare . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely day . The sun , beautiful . The City of the Angels , beautiful . The people in the streets , his subjects , beautiful . Osborn Enterprises , Inc. , beautiful . Faye Osborn , beautiful . All friends , beaut ? No , maybe not all  --  not Abe Zelkin . Abe , beautiful , yes their friendship , yes , that too , except that it might not exist a few hours from now , and he felt guilty , and a blemish suddenly marred the face of joy . He became aware of Westwood passing outside his top-down Pontiac convertible , and there were people , the sidewalks were crowded with people , and they were not his subjects applauding him on this great day . They were Abe Zelkin admonishing him for selling out . Honest Abe . Who the hell needs a conscience for a nag when he has a friend like Honest Abe ? Yet , curiously , and in truth , it had been Abe Zelkin who had planted the seed that had borne this day , the undoing of Zelkin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind sought the beginnings , bit by bit revived them , to give him his brief before he pleaded his case to Zelkin at lunch . Where had it begun ? Harvard University ? No . That had been his friendship with Phil Sanford , when they had roomed together . No , not Harvard , but sometime later , in New York City . Not at that big factory of a law firm he had started with , because he had  | not liked that firm , had still been interested in defending human rights , not property rights , in retrospect immaturely idealistic , a stupid legal hick with a cowlick for a brain . It was that next place , that hothouse for the flower children of the law , the Good Government Institute on Park Avenue , where your salary consisted of elbow patches for your threadbare coats and quotations from Cardozo and Holmes on the high purpose of the law . The Good Government Institute , a foundation supported by twenty bigbusiness corporations as a sop to their own bad consciences , where every case was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where every client was the ever-present underdog . Six years of that , of living off peanuts because you felt that 1 you were upending a few evils and many wrongs , deluded into thinking that they were the real enemies , until you learned that they were only prop windmills to keep you busy putting on a public-relations show for the Institute 's founders . Six years to learn the identities of the real enemies , to learn that your work was a fraud , that the do-gooding was a fake . Six years to learn the truth of how you 'd been manipulated by the power people . When he and Abe Zelkin had learned , they had both got out . They had quit within a month of each other . Barrett had been the first to quit . His disillusionment with the Institute had become complete due to his mother 's death . He had obtained some hints of evidence that the newly marketed drug which had been administered to keep his mother alive had actually hastened her death . And , since he could scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untimely deaths from aplastic anemia , a side effect induced by this same drug . Shocked , Barrett had built up his sketchy outline of a legal case , found an eligible complainant , and finally presented his memorandum to the managing director of the Institute . The memorandum was an indictment of one of America 's most renowned pharmaceutical companies . Barrett requested funds for a thorough investigation , and urged , if the findings substantiated his suspicions , a legal prosecution of the drug company or a hearing before the federal Food and Drug Administration . He was positive that he would be encouraged to go ahead . Eventually , the managing director of the Institute had summoned Barrett to a private meeting . The director spoke , and Barrett listened , stunned . Barrett 's request to proceed with an  | investigation , to be followed by a lawsuit or a hearing , had been turned down by the governing board . His evidence had been regarded as too flimsy , and , besides  --  oh , besides , it just was n't the kind of clear-cut case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's disbelief and bewilderment lasted only fortyeight hours . At the end of that time , after discreet inquiries , he had learned the truth . One of the Institute 's chief backers and major contributors was the very pharmaceutical company that Barrett had attempted to indict . The following day , Mike Barrett had resigned from the staff of the Good Government Institute . Abe Zelkin , after a similar disappointment , had resigned a short time after Barrett . And then each of them had had to make his choice . How well Barrett remembered . Zelkin had made his choice first : He had moved to California , been admitted to the bar , and taken a post with the Los Angeles office of the American Civil Liberties Union . But Barrett had been made too cynical by the realities to emulate Zelkin 's choice . So he made his own choice . If you ca n't fight them , join them . He had joined the world of power , of big business , of big government . If he was to remain a do-gooder , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The name of the grownups ' game was  --  money . He would be a grownup , too . It was goodbye to all salaries of eight thousand a year and bonuses of **25;149;TOOLONG . It was hello to a new life of eighteen thousand a year and a new goal , which was : to become , by whatever means  --  by osmosis , by training , by association  --  one of Them , one of the powerful ones . The new life began with a position as a minor associate of a huge law firm on Madison Avenue  --  a beehive of forty attorneys ? that specialized in corporate law . It had been a dreary two years . The work had been technical , grinding , monotonous . He had I rarely had an opportunity to see a client and he had not once seen a courtroom , an arena he had so much enjoyed in his Institute days . He had been expected to employ his spare time participating in New York civic and cultural affairs , as prescribed by the firm 's elders . Opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been unhappy , restless and moody , his limited social life had been unhappy . There had been  | two love affairs , one with an attractive brunette divorcee , the other with a bright redheaded fashion model , and , while both had been physically satisfying , they had not satisfied him otherwise . Because he had been bored with himself , he had become bored with others . His situation was becoming clearer . He had tried to go to the other side  --  to stop fighting them , to join them  --  and become one of them . Oh , they welcomed every Faust with open arms , enlisted each with glowing promises , let each and every one eat cake instead of bread  --  and then assigned each to hard labor in the dungeon of corporate law , mergers , taxation ; and then they threw away the key . Yes , it was clearer . You could serve the powerful , but not easily join them  --  because there was n't enough room at the top , because somebody had to serve them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to Barrett , in his worst despair , at the time . A drastic change was wanted , and one day the possibility of a change was offered . In one of his monthly letters , Abe Zelkin had written of the many big-paying positions open for able and experienced attorneys in Los Angeles . Zelkin himself had been offered several , and resisted them , although admittedly one or two had been magnificent and even glamorous . From this the lure of California had grown in Barrett 's mind , and , shortly after , he had made his decision and made the change . He had passed the California bar examination , and a few months later he had found himself installed in a small but beautifully decorated office as one of fourteen attorneys working for the successful business-management firm of Thayer and Turner on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills . All of the clients were either celebrated or wealthy , or both , and the proximity to success had once more given Barrett hope that he might strike it rich . Yet , after almost two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the firm 's law library , in courtrooms , and in the offices of affluent clients  --  during which he had gradually specialized in tax law , Barrett had slowly begun to come to the conclusion that he was not one of those fated to make it big . His assets were many , and he could be coolly objective about them . He was n't classically handsome , true , but he had a rugged , weatherbeaten face . Part Polish , part Irish-Welsh , he had a craggy  | face marked only by scowl lines , the faint remnants of contracting brows and puckering eyes that grew out of skepticism and disappointment ( like those of a quick , slightly aging light-heavyweight boxer who was beginning to be hit more often and was still in the semi-windups ) . He possessed a shag of matted black hair , restless , roving eyes , a short , straight nose , hollow cheeks , square jaw . He was just below six feet in height , with supple , sloping shoulders , a sinewy swimmer 's body . His outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careless , but , like every man , he knew that he owned another man inside , and this one was alert , tense , crouching , a sprinter waiting for the gun . Only there was no gun . At work , Barrett was serious , dedicated , quiet , steady . On his own time he could be personable ( when not moody ) , since he had a fair sense of the ridiculous and a strong strain of sardonic humor , along with an accurate instinct for perceiving how other people felt and an understanding of why they behaved as they did . He was an easy and arresting talker when he cared , which was no longer often . He was well read beyond Sir William Blackstone . He had meant to major in English literature , but he had also wanted to be practical , and law offered a broader horizon . Also , he possessed two unique qualities marvelously useful in the practice of law . The first quality was that of an almost freakish memory . Like his more illustrious predecessors , Rabbi Elijah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five hundred scholarly volumes , including the Talmud and the Bible , and like Cardinal Mezzofanti , nineteenth-century curator of the Vatican Library , who had learned 186 languages and seventy-two dialects , Barrett 's eye was a camera obscura , forever capturing the sacred and the profane , the momentous and the trivial , and imprinting these on his brain , there stored for instant reference and recall . He could , on demand , recite most of the Code of Hammurabi , the Dred Scott decision , Shakespeare 's will , and Sir John Strange 's epitaph ( " Here lies an honest lawyer and that is Strange " ) . The second quality was that of a questing , trapping mind , one that enjoyed mysteries , riddles , games , all the unsolved phenomena of Charles Fort . He knew that he was suited for the profession of law , and he was stimulated by its promise of fresh challenges . Next to law , literature was merely a self-indulgence , a defrosting of the past .  | Yet , though the surface assets were there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , no question , no doubt about it , especially when you thought about it at three in the morning . He had skill in his work , but he lacked financial and social aggressiveness . While creative , he was not sufficiently self-promoting to claim credit where credit was due . He was too thoughtful and intelligent , perhaps too self-deprecating , to define himself or his role publicly . He was neither extrovert nor introvert , but ambivert , at once inand outgoing , uncertain and withdrawn . When he had fallen from the family tree , he guessed , his ego had been flawed in the accident . Barrett doubted that his seniors , Thayer and Turner , had ever thought of him as a unique personality , an indispensable individual . And the worst of it  --  yes , the very worst of it , his secret  --  was that he did not believe in what he was doing . He did not believe that it was important ( beyond the comfortable sustenance it afforded him ) , and , secret or no secret , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' built-in radars . It was as if ? well , hell , as if Henry David Thoreau had finally taken a job as a tax attorney . That was it . It was like that . He had reached dead end , he had decided , some months ago . The job had become as tiresome and routine as waking every morning , and Los Angeles was , as some kindred soul had once put it , just one goddam beautiful day after another . In desperation he had even spent four successive fifty-minute sessions with a psychoanalyst , but his sense of futility had not been dispelled . He had not wanted to discuss his departed mother and father , or really to go into his Id and flawed Ego , and he had canceled the fifth appointment . Then , overnight , as if the smog had cleared to reveal a pot of hope at the end of the rainbow , a small miracle had happened . And , a few weeks after that , there had been a greater revelation , a bigger miracle , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first , the hope , had come from Abe Zelkin . By now , Zelkin was a fixture in the community , with respectable connections , and he had decided to quit the American Civil Liberties Union and open his own office in Los Angeles . There was a definite promise of clients , the kind of Scopes-Vanzetti clients he and Barrett had once dreamed about , and cases that would enrich their lives if not  | their pocketbooks , important and never-ending opportunities to challenge injustice and inhumanity and bigotry . To open his own office , Zelkin wanted a partner . He wanted Barrett . The offer to be young again , to do good works , invest each day with meaning , had excited Barrett . He would be independent . He would be alive . He would help others . He would have everything ? except what he had so long thought he had wanted the most , and that was riches , which also translated as power . Barrett was interested , very interested , but still hesitant . He wanted to think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had to be certain . But yes , it was a good idea , the idea of Zelkin and Barrett , Counselors at Law , Specialists in Idealism , and he thought he would go for it . Zelkin had said to him that there was no hurry , because Zelkin still had to clean up a number of cases . When they were under control he would ask Barrett again , and if Barrett was ready they 'd put up their shingle . That was the Zelkin pot of hope . And four weeks later , like a vision out of the blue , there was the Osborn pot of gold . And then it was that Barrett had known he had made it , finally made it . With surprise , he emerged from his reliving of the recent past , to find that he had automatically turned off Wilshire Boulevard onto San Vicente Boulevard and that he was almost home . On Barrington Avenue he headed the convertible toward The Torccllo ( the owner had never quite forgotten that honeymoon in Italy ) , the six-story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had leased a three-room apartment after his first year in Los Angeles . Reaching the building , Barrett swung his car into the cavernous opening beside the entrance walk , and drove into the subterranean garage . Getting out of the car , he checked his watch . There was still an hour before his appointment with Abe Zelkin . Plenty of time to shower again , change into a lighter suit , and rehearse what he would tell Zelkin . He came around the convertible , bent down and removed the carton heavy with his past , and then jauntily made his way to the elevator . It carried him smoothly to the third floor of The Torcello . He went down the corridor , opened his door , deposited the  | carton in a dark recess of the guest closet , and then went to dial the switchboard . The living-room shutters were closed against the sun , and his apartment was cool . The room seemed less his own , and less comfortable , than it used to be , although admittedly it was smarter . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with time on their hands , she carried a decorator 's card . When she had first laid eyes upon his furnished apartment , she had shuddered . " The taste these landlords have . What 's the period they 've done it in ? Early San Fernando Valley ? " Soon the landlord 's sloppy , cushiony sofa had been replaced by an expensive reproduction of an austere Chippendale camel-back sofa . Soon , too , the walls had been covered with hemp-cloth , the lighting had become recessed , and a late-Victorian roll-top desk and a French country-style chair of walnut and cane had dominated one corner . After the first beachhead , the invasion of good taste had continued . He had submitted to a glass-and-steel coffee table , too low to have any use whatsoever except as an object upon which to nick his shins and fully awaken him in the morning . Most recently , the telephone had been inconveniently tucked out of sight inside a carved wooden cabinet that had found its way to Decorators ' Row on Robertson Boulevard from the Swiss Village in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragile pieces of Limoges . Whenever he was alone , as he was now , Barrett would reverse the position of the Limoges and the telephone . Removing the telephone from the cabinet , Barrett placed the Limoges inside , set the telephone down next to the curved arm of the sofa , and dialed the switchboard operator in the lobby . " Mike Barrett here . Any calls ? " " Oh , I 'm glad you 're back , Mr. Barrett . Two long-distance calls , urgent , in the last half hour . They were both from the same party . A Mr. Philip Sanford in New York . He wants you to call him the minute you get in . He left his business and home numbers . " " Let 's see . It 's only twenty after three in New York . Try his office . " Rising from the sofa , stripping off his shirt and tossing it aside , he went into the kitchenette for a soft drink . As he prepared it , his mind went to Phil Sanford . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephoned at long intervals , but  | when he did , a few times each year , it was always in the evening . Furthermore , the calls were always casual , unhurried , the reaching out of a lonely friend for a reaffirmation of friendship . Poor Sanford got little warmth from his wife and none at all from his tyrannical father . But this morning 's calls apparently had not been social . They had been urgent . And now Barrett wondered why . Sipping his root beer , Barrett thought of his old friend and of their friendship , a friendship that was older although less easy than the one with Abe Zelkin . After Harvard , when he and Philip Sanford had both gone to New York , he to become a disenchanted do-gooder , Sanford to start out as an editor in his father 's famous publishing house , he saw his college roommate frequently . Not only did he like Phil , but he owed him much after all that Phil had done during Barrett 's year of crisis with his mother . Even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their weekly lunch at the Baroque Restaurant and to go occasionally with him to some sports event at Madison Square Garden . Since moving to California , Barrett had seen Sanford only a half-dozen times . These occasions had afforded Barrett no pleasure . Phil Sanford had always sounded gloomy when talking about his wife and two children , and he had been as miserable as ever over his helpless serfdom in Sanford House , which his father ran as a one-man operation . But the last time Barrett had seen Phil Sanford , only three months ago or less , when Barrett had flown into New York on some overnight business and they had dined together in the Oak Room of The Plaza , it had been a happier meeting than usual . Sanford 's life had changed short months before this reunion with Barrett . For the first time , he had been given an opportunity to prove himself . While he was filled with anxieties , he was also filled with enthusiasm . That giant of publishing , Wesley R. Sanford , Phil 's father , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been a massive stroke , it had been a warning one , severe enough to force him into retirement . In the eyes of the stricken gray giant , Sanford House , so long the discoverer and sponsor of authors who had been knighted with the Nobel Prize in literature , the Pulitzer Prize , the Prix Goncourt , was now a house without a head . Phil Sanford , the only heir , had always been regarded with condescension ,  | even disdain , by his mighty father . It was as if the self-made giant had always known that he could not sire another in his image . He had regarded his son as a pygmy , a weakling , an incompetent , a total disappointment . This had been Phil 's Cross , and the fact that he had suffered such treatment for so long without going off on his own had infected Phil 's wife , who had also come to see him as weak and gutless . The word that Wesley R. Sanford had left a flourishing publishing business without a satisfactory heir had passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications complexes , conglomerates seeking diversification of their holdings , were eager to buy up the firm , with its valuable back list and presII it tigious name . Only partially recovering from his stroke , Wesley R. Sanford , it had appeared , would decide to sell . And then his only son had gone to his bedside and , for the first time , pleaded for a chance . Whether illness had deprived the convalescing giant of resolution or whether he had been waiting for such an appeal from his heir and been impressed by it , Wesley R. Sanford had gruffly told his son that he would have his chance . Philip Sanford had been given two years to prove himself as a capable independent publisher . If in that period he kept the firm in the black , maintained and expanded its prestige , the firm would remain in the family , with Philip as its president and eventual owner . However , if Philip 's guidance proved faulty in that period , he would be removed from the head office , and the publishing house would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the communications industries vying for it . Unused to decision-making and authority , Philip Sanford had got off to a poor start . Of the first twenty books published under his direction in his first year , the majority had been failures , and the rest had either barely broken even or made only minor profits . Not one could be called distinguished or had become a best seller . Not one had made a major subsidiary-sales strike to book clubs or paperback reprinters . At last , with the courage born of sheer desperation , Philip Sanford had made an effort to escape his father 's shadow and become his own man . He had determined to publish what he wanted to publish and not what he thought his father might have published . He had acquired a novel that he had read and admired during a sea crossing from Le Havre to New York , a  | book that had never been permitted to be published openly in any English-speaking nation in the world . It was a work called The Seven Minutes , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staked his entire future . When Barrett had dined with Sanford in New York that last time , Sanford had been manic about the book 's possibilities . For the first time in modern literary history , the climate was right for the appearance of such a book , Sanford had insisted . A Western world that had finally accepted Lady Chatterley 's Lover and Fanny Hill would be mature enough to accept The Seven Minutes . The book was already on the presses . Interest within the trade was mounting . It promised to be a smash hit . And then Sanford would have his publishing house , his haven , his future , and he would finally be his own man . Discussion of Phil 's survival had occupied most of their evening together . Only in the last ten minutes had Barrett been asked about himself . He had complained about his own crawling career at Thayer and Turner . He had cited as the only bright spots Abe Zelkin 's offer and his own fondness for Willard Osborn 's daughter . And now , suddenly , Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Considering what he knew of Sanford 's life , what could possibly be urgent that might concern him ? The telephone at his elbow was ringing . He snatched up the receiver . " Hello ? " " Mike ? " It was Sanford 's voice . No secretary had preceded him . That underlined urgency . " Is that you , Mike ? " " None other . How 've you been , Phil ? Sorry to have missed your calls . I just got in . How 's everything ? " " As usual , as usual , if you mean the family . This is something else . It 's a business matter . Mike , I 'm certainly relieved you called this soon . " Barrett was immediately aware of the tone of Sanford 's voice . It was nervous , harried . " You sound as if there 's something important on your mind . If it 's anything I can ? " " You can , you can help me . " " Shoot . " " Mike , remember when you were here last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go of it with my first list , my books , not the carry-overs from Wesley R. ? "  | Barrett remembered that Sanford had always referred to his father , Wesley R. Sanford , as Wesley R. He had never been able to call him Father . " Yes , but you were optimistic ? " " Exactly . Because of one book I had in the works . The Seven Minutes , by J J Jadway . I was putting all my chips on that one . All or nothing . Remember ? " Barrett nodded at the telephone . " That 's right . The novel no one had dared publish in thirty-five years . I saw your opening ad last Sunday . Tremendous . " Sanford 's voice had become anxious . " You 've seen the book , have n't you ? I had an advance copy airmailed to you . " Guiltily , Barrett 's eyes flicked toward his bedroom door . He had received the advance complimentary copy about three weeks ago , and the book had been resting unopened on the lamp table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read it so that he could write his friend an encouraging thank-you note , but there had been so much happening to him since that he had been unable to get to it . Goddam good intentions . " Yes , I received it , Phil . It 's next to my bed . Every day I 've resolved to write and thank you , wish you well , but I 've just been up to my ass in a million things . I skimmed the whole thing , and I 'd say the book is everything you 've been saying , a winner , a real winner . " " It is , " Sanford affirmed excitedly . " It 's shaping up to be the blockbuster of the year , maybe the biggest seller in a decade . You 've no idea what 's been going on with the wholesalers and the stores . We 're still days from official publication , and we 've had a second printing . We 've got two hundred thousand in print , and we 've already shipped a hundred thirty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell , you know plenty about the book business from listening to me over the years . Take your average novel . If it 's a first book , and Jadway 's is a first book , his only book , well , maybe you print four thousand copies for openers , and maybe your salesmen pick up two thousand advance orders and you ship these on consignment  --  any of them can be returned if they do n't sell  --  and maybe a half year or year later we wind up having sold seven hundred fifty copies . That 's the part of the book business , behind the hullabaloo of reviews and advertising , that the public knows nothing about . But once every few years , if you 're lucky , you get hold of a blockbuster , a first novel that  | just takes off like a jet . And that 's The Seven Minutes . Of course , it had built-in propulsion . All the bannings . The talk about its being dirty , which it is n't . Now , for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . So we have orders for a hundred thirty thousand copies , and we 'll have had the whole two hundred thousand ordered a week after it 's out . That 's only the beginning , Mike . Once it 's on display everywhere , and selling , and people are talking about it , arguing about it , word of mouth will keep it soaring . We could go to three hundred thousand or four hundred thousand copies in a few months . And that 's the least of it . We 'll put it up for bidding with the paperback reprinters . Once we 've made it respectable , shown it 's been accepted , they 'll be outbidding one another for the reprint rights . That can be a million dollars as a start , not counting future sales and royalties , and do n't forget that Sanford House , the publisher , keeps fifty per cent of the paperback income . You see what I mean , Mike ? No limit . Do you know what Lady Chatterley 's Lover had sold at the last report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million copies , and it is probably closer to seven million copies by now . Well , that 's what we 've got here , maybe bigger , much bigger , with The Seven Minutes . And you know my situation , Mike , that 'll make Wesley R. sit up , sick as he is , and that 'll put me in business on my own for keeps . You know what that means to me , Mike , nobody but you outside the family knows what that means . " The almost hysterical torrent of words abruptly stopped . There was only heavy breathing to be heard over the transcontinental telephone . Barrett said , " Yes , I know . " Then he wondered . " It sounds to me as if you 've got your winner . " " I have my winner , Mike  --  if nothing goes wrong . " Not thinking , almost automatically , Barrett started to say , " But what could go ? " " Censorship , " Sanford interrupted . " I 've got nothing if the police wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people buy it . If that happens , I not only wo n't have a success , I 'll have an utter disaster . Wesley R. will boot me out of here in nothing flat , and so will my sweet Betty girl . I 'll lose the business and my kids . I wo n't have anything except the trust fund from my mother , and that 's  | not enough to keep the insides of a man alive , believe me , Mike , it 's not . " Barrett was becoming mildly irritated with his friend 's forebodings . " Phil , you 've got a good thing going , so why anticipate a disaster when there 's no likelihood of one ? Censorship ? Little chance . We 're living in a different age now . Everything 's open and on the table . Everyone knows the Queen has legs . In fact , they know she 's got a damn sight more . You can get Fanny Hill on any drugstore rack . Remember when we used to rent mimeograph copies at school ? Remember reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing hairgrown mount over it , parted and presented a most inviting entrance ' ? And Lady Chatterley , remember Connie putting her arms round his white slen- 1 1r der loins , and drawing him to her so that her hanging , swinging breasts touched the top of the stirring , erect phallos ' ? And that sold  --  what did you say ? ? six to seven million copies . That 's the way it is now and will be for some years , maybe forever , unless people get tired of truth and we slide back to the age of the asterisk again . But not now . People are less afraid of sex , especially when it 's presented artfully ? " " Jadway 's book has n't been repressed just for sex alone , " Sanford interrupted . " It 's because some of the sex is sacrilegious . " " I do n't give a damn what it is , " said Barrett . " Plenty of experts who 've read it secretly have proclaimed publicly that it is a work of art . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't exist . " " Mike , wait , I 've been leading up to it . That 's why I 've been trying to get hold of you . You see ? " A sudden suspicion hit Barrett . His friend was used to living 1 in the future , picturing future success , future trouble , maybe this , maybe that , just as some people lived in the past . This was one of Sanford 's most exasperating shortcomings , since it kept him from speaking honestly of the present . " One moment , Phil , " Barrett cut in . " You 've been saying over and over you 've got it made if nothing goes wrong . " He paused . " Has something gone wrong ? " There was the briefest silence . " Yes , " said Sanford . " Why did n't you say so in the first place ? " " I was trying to explain how important all this is to me. "  | " What 's happened ? " Barrett demanded to know . " A bookstore owner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling The Seven Minutes . Maybe I 'm overreacting , making too much of it , because I 'm on edge . It 's probably just a little matter . Still , I want to make sure that 's all it is and nothing more . " " Okay , tell me . " " Our Coast salesman got a desperate call from a bookstore owner  --  let me see , I have everything written down  --  a Ben Fremont , he owns Fremont 's Book Emporium in Oakwood , wherever that is . " " Oakwood 's an upper-middle-class community , fair-sized , in West Los Angeles , between the Westwood and Brentwood areas and the city of Santa Monica , about ten minutes from where I am . It 's unincorporated , not part of the city of Los Angeles , but in the county of Los Angeles . All right , what happened next ? " " Fremont 's a good account , but he 's not big , and he does n't have an attorney . So he phoned our salesman for help , for protection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The salesman called me and I called you . Apparently there 's a group out there in Oakwood called the STDL , the Strength Through Decency League  --  those self-righteous names  --  and their president , a Mrs. St. Clair , read the book and registered an immediate protest with the District Attorney of Los Angeles . I guess this comes under his jurisdic-tion ? " " That 's right . The D.A . ' s Office and the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Office are in charge of the unincorporated areas . " " Well , the District Attorney got Mrs. St. Clair 's protest , and he in turn sent a letter to the Sheriff asking for an immediate investigation , and once the District Attorney had his full report he prepared a criminal complaint , and he had two deputies of the County Sheriff 's Vice Bureau go in and arrest Ben Fremont this morning . They confiscated all copies of The Seven Minutes Fremont still had on hand . About eighty copies . " " Go on . Was there anything else ? " Sanford quickly recounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relayed to the company salesman . " Fremont 's been in jail several hours now , waiting to be bailed out , " Sanford went on . " I want him bailed out at once . We 'll stand good for that , and for any other costs . I 'd send one of our own  | attorneys out , but that takes time and , besides , our attorneys do n't know California law . I need someone in Los Angeles who can act immediately and who knows his way around out there . And someone who understands what I 've got at stake . Mike , I ca n't have this little matter blown up out of proportion . I want it settled quietly and at once . Then the book trade will know we are standing behind every bookseller and behind the book . Then everyone will go ahead and sell it without being worried . There may be one or two other small arrests like this . We 'll have to back them up just like this . What we have to do is give the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chains in the largest cities . After a few weeks or months , once it has had its wide public acceptance , no law-enforcement agency will bother to get in our way . We 'll be safe . That 's why I want to quash the little nuisance arrests at the outset , before the big stores panic . I want this settled right away , quietly , as little as possible in the newspapers . Of course I thought of you , Mike . I know you have a job , but if you could ... " " I left Thayer and Turner this morning , Phil . I have something much bigger coming up . I 'll catch you up on it another time . But it just happens I am free . I 'll be glad to pitch in . " " Great ! That 's great , Mike . I needed someone I could trust , someone who knows what this means to me . I 'm sure you can wrap this up overnight . " Barrett had found his pen and a pad of scratch paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central jail ? We 'll have to put up bond , bail him out today . How do you want to plead ? " " Do you mean guilty or not guilty ? " " Yes . If he pleads not guilty , that means a trial . " " God , no . I want to get him out of this fast and quietly , to assure other bookmen they do n't have to worry , yet get him out with a minimum of publicity . " " Then we 'd plead guilty . Now , as far as I can remember , if you 're convicted for purveying pornography in California , and it 's a first offense , that 's a misdemeanor . You can be fined a thousand dollars plus five dollars for each unit of obscene material on hand . Fremont had eighty books , so that 's four hundred more  --  fourteen hundred dollars . And you can go to jail for six months . A second offense means a felony  --  two thousand dollars fine , plus the four  | hundred , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first offense ? " " It 's his second , Mike , his second . He was arrested once before ? I do n't know how many years ago , even he 's forgotten  --  when he had a smaller shop in downtown Los Angeles . I believe it was a magazine thing then . If this is a felony , that means a full year in jail ? I ca n't let a bookseller selling our book go to jail for that long . " " Well , it 's that or a not-guilty plea and a public trial , " said Barrett . Sanford groaned . " That 's just as bad . " " There is one more possibility , " said Barrett . " If this arrest does n't get too much publicity ? " " I do n't think it will . " " Well , if it does n't , I might be able to get the whole thing over with quickly and quietly . Enter a guilty plea , pay the fine , and arrange for the sentence to be suspended . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can swing it . We have a District Attorney here now ? his name is Elmo Duncan  --  who 's a very decent , straight sort of person . But he 's a realist . He knows where to give and where to get , and so I 'd guess he 's the kind of man you can talk to . I know him socially . I 've met him two or three times at parties at the Willard Osborns ' . If I went to him , he 'd remember . He 'd also remember I 'm going out with Osborn 's daughter . I think I can persuade him to be reasonable . " " Mike , you do n't know how much I appreciate this favor ? " Barrett wanted to interrupt and tell Sanford that this was no favor , merely the smallest down payment on a debt that he had long owed Sanford , and which he had not forgotten . But he said t nothing . He allowed Sanford to go on . " ? because I was really worried about this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a miracle man . " " Not yet , " said Barrett wryly . " Not until I get cooperation from our District Attorney . I think I can manage it . Tell you what . I 'll phone Elmo Duncan and try to make an appointment for this afternoon . Then I 'll get hold of a bail bondsman I know down on Hill Street , and I 'll see that he springs your bookseller . Then I 'll look in on your bookseller ? " he was making notes on his  | scratch pad now ? " Ben Fremont in Oakwood , right ? ? and I 'll find out exactly what happened and learn what he said and calm him down . Then , hopefully , I 'll be seeing the District Attorney . As soon as I have something definite from him , I 'll telephone you . It might not be until tomorrow . " " Whatever you say , Mike . Just as long as I know you 've taken over . " " I 've taken over . In forty-eight hours we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thanks , Mike . " " I 'll be in touch , " said Barrett . After hanging up , he thoughtfully finished his root beer . Putting the empty glass aside , he realized that he was hungry . Then he remembered his lunch date with Abe Zelkin . They had agreed to meet at the Brown Derby in Beverly Hills , a convenience to both of them since it was twenty minutes from Barrett 's apartment and only fifteen minutes from Zelkin 's new office , a suite in a recently opened high-rise building on the east side of Beverly Hills . Before making his calls to the bondsman and to the District Attorney , Barrett decided to telephone Zelkin 's secretary . He would request that she have Zelkin make the lunch date a half hour later , and that Zelkin bring along a photocopy of the section of the California Penal Code that dealt with the purveying of obscene matter . At least that would give him something else to talk to Zelkin about before he faced the moment of truth . It was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could simply explain the facts of life to Zelkin : Abe , listen , honest and poor is good , very good , but believe me , Abe , honest and rich is better , far better . He wondered whether Zelkin would understand  --  or , at least , would forgive him .  | THEY WERE SITTING in a comfortable semicircular booth , beneath the framed caricatures of show-business personalities , finishing their drinks , and had not talked very much at this point . The Brown Derby was crowded and noisy , and they were among the silent few . Mike Barrett , pretending to reread the photocopy of the censorship section of the California Penal Code , could see Abe Zelkin across from him , sipping a martini , absorbed in the large menu . He looked relaxed and cheerful , which increased Barrett 's guilt . Of course , as Barrett knew , Zelkin always looked relaxed and cheerful , and like an innocent  --  deceptively so , for nature 's face masked a tiger , especially when he was tracking evidence for a case in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now reminded , that Abe Zelkin 's head had the appearance of a small , happy pumpkin , if the pumpkin were adorned with an unruly sprout of black hair and a tiny egg of a nose upon which were perched oversized black-rimmed bifocal spectacles . He was short , potbellied , and there was always a trace of cigar ash on his lapels . Big men wanted to protect him , and big women wanted to mother him , unaware that this lovable toy-sized human had a brain one part missile detector , one part rocket launcher . Zelkin had two eccentricities and one obsession . His eccentricities were : absolute honesty  --  toward others , toward himself  --  no matter what the consequences and total purity of language ; rarely did he employ swear words ( when well shaken , he inclined toward the stilted curses of penny-dreadful literature ) . His primary obsession was the United States Constitution 's Bill of Rights , and the encroachments being made upon it . He liked to echo the sentiments of Chief Justice Warren , who had once remarked that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legislature today , there were strong doubts that Congress would pass it into law . A waiter had approached . " Are you ready to order yet , gentle-men ? " Zelkin lowered his menu . " What about you , Mike ? Want another drink ? " Barrett cupped a hand over his glass of Scotch and water . " I 'm standing pat . Let 's eat . What are you having ? " " If I had my way , I know what I 'd want . " Ruefully , Zelkin considered his protruding stomach . " But last night my youngest crawled up on my lap , and she poked at my belly and she said , Papa , are you pregnant ? ' Where in the devil she learned that word  --  progressive nurseries or television , of course  --  but I got the message . " He shrugged at the waiter . " Broiled hamburger steak , medium , no potatoes , no nothing . And some black coffee . "  | " Make it two coffees , " said Barrett . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The waiter had gone . They were alone . And Barrett was n't yet ready for truth . He had mentioned Philip Sanford 's call and the Ben Fremont arrest briefly when they had met . The Fremont matter was still a welcome diversion . He held up Zelkin 's photocopies . " This statutory definition of obscenity really makes the head swim . There 's no clear-cut guideline . " Zelkin grinned . " Richard Kuh  --  he used to be assistant district attorney in New York  --  once remarked that trying to define obscenity is as frustratingly impossible as trying to nail custard pie to trees . And Judge Curtis Bok said it was like trying to come to grips with a greased pig . But I 'll go along with Justice Stewart . He once said something to the effect that maybe he could n't define obscenity , but , by golly , he knew obscenity when he saw it . " " Well , maybe , " said Barrett doubtfully . " I 'd prefer to go along with Havelock Ellis  --  how can you define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing contemplated , but in the mind of the contemplating person ? You show one man a picture of a nude woman and he says Art , and you show the same to the next fellow and he says Dirty Postcard . " " My dear Michael , a nude woman is always Art . " Barrett laughed . " You 've solved that one . I wish it were as simple with a book . Here we 've got Sanford , who , despite his commercial interest , really believes this Jadway book is the essence of purity , and there we 've got Elmo Duncan , guardian of public safety , who by his very act this morning is saying the same book is filthy . On the one hand , Sanford insisting the book has social importance , and on the other Duncan insisting its appeal is solely to a  --  where 's that definition ? ? yes , to a shameful and morbid interest ' in nudity and sex and is utterly without redeeming social importance . ' And with that poor bookseller caught helplessly in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes a good trial  --  and the appeals that might follow it  --  can be a long step toward working out a more satisfactory definition . " , " Not this time , " said Barrett . " I know Sanford does n't want a trial , but he does n't relish a guilty plea either . He just wants the whole thing quietly quashed . I guess he 's right . Anyway , I have an  | appointment with our District Attorney at three-thirty . " He paused . " I hope he 's as agreeable behind his desk as he is at a dinner party . " " How well do you know him ? " asked Zelkin . " We 're not on a first-name basis , nothing like that . He 's been a guest at the Osborns ' several times when I was there with Faye . " " That wo n't hurt you . " " No  --  no , I suppose not . " Barrett stared across the table . " How well do you know him ? " " Duncan ? Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but after he was elected , when I was still with the Civil Liberties Union , I had many occasions to meet him in and out of court . " Zelkin unfurled his napkin and draped it across his lap . " I like him . I do n't know if I can tell you anything useful . You want to know his assets ? A Vietnam hero with two Purple Hearts . Thirtytwo years old . Big family man . Four children . An able attorney , honest , decent , square . A dynamic public speaker , marvelous television personality , not flamboyant but direct and forceful . But a political creature , by instinct . He knows he 's a winner . When he was elected district attorney it was by the biggest landslide in our local elective history . Elmo Duncan knows he 's bigger than his present job . Now the word is out that someone else , someone who counts , knows it , too . Ever hear of Luther Yerkes ? " " The Global Industries fellow ? Aircraft and electronics . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was n't much in it about him , only about his holdings and his worth  --  millions , billions , something like that . I did n't know he lived out here . " " He sure does , " said Zelkin . " Luther Yerkes has a place in Malibu , a thirty-room cottage in Bel-Air , and a pad in Palm Springs . You do n't know all this because Yerkes does n't like publicity . He likes money . He likes power . He does n't care about fame . Makes sense . Anyway , according to well-founded rumor , Yerkes wants his own senator in Washington  --  not a senator from California , but a senator from Yerkes . As you know , our incumbent , Senator Walter Nickels , is up for re-election come soon . Our Senator Nickels is in the doghouse with Moneybags Yerkes . Seems that Senator Nickels has been pressing in Congress to head up an investigation of aircraft industries who 've allegedly  | conspired to overcharge and otherwise gouge Uncle Sam in costplus government contracts . And Luther Yerkes has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like any snotty legislator giving him trouble . So how to stop such an investigation from getting under way ? Cut down its leader , of course . Get rid of him , and serve warning on his cohorts of what can happen to them if they get out of line . So how to get rid of the leader within due process ? Simply find someone more attractive , and build that someone up , and have that someone run against Nickels and crush him at the polls . Who 's the someone ? You guessed it . Elmo Duncan , boy D.A . of L.A. on the rise . I have n't got photographs to prove it . I do hear the whispering . And note that our District Attorney has suddenly blossomed as an authority on everything from A to Zygo . These last months , whenever you hear someone making a public speech you can be sure it is Elmo Duncan . In short , Mike , our Elmo Duncan is presently in the business of II wanting to be loved by everybody , especially by everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Faye Osborn is his daughter . And you are Faye 's fiance . Now you want a small favor from Elmo Duncan . My guess is you 'll get it , so relax . " " I feel better already , " said Barrett . Zelkin had removed his spectacles and was wiping them with his napkin . " In one way it 's too bad , " he muttered , " your having to sweep the arrest of Ben Fremont under the rug . If it could only be brought to trial , it would be the perfect case for Barrett and Zelkin to start their partnership with . It 's our meat , Mike , a good cause , a challenge , a publicity natural , everything . But what the heck , we 'll have plenty of other cases coming up . " Zelkin pulled on his spectacles again , and squinted at Barrett . " You are going to quit Thayer and Turner , are n't you ? " Barrett felt the lump in his throat . He swallowed . " I 've already quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Zelkin slapped his hands together . " Great ! " he exclaimed . " My gosh , why did you keep me in suspense ? Why did n't you tell me right away ? " Barrett 's forehead felt warm . He tried not to squirm . " Well , Abe , first let me tell you , let me explain " Excuse me , gentlemen . " It was the waiter , rolling the cart with their lunch plates up to their booth . " Sorry to be so long .  | The hamburger steak takes time . It 's all here hot , maybe even the chef 's salad 's hot . " Zelkin had tossed aside his napkin and was sliding out of the booth . " Hold still , Mike , " he said exuberantly . " Before you tell me about it , let me go to the little boys ' room . Be right back . I want to know everything that happened . " Unhappily , Barrett watched him go bouncing off toward the bar in the rear . Miserable , ignoring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat back against the padded booth , closed his eyes , and tried to review what had happened and assess how it would sound to his friend  --  or ex-friend . It had begun with the Osborn account . Willard Osborn II , president of Osborn Enterprises , Inc. , owned or controlled the majority stock in fourteen television and radio stations in Los Angeles , Phoenix , Las Vegas , San Francisco , Seattle , Denver , and elsewhere in the West . His interests in these stations alone , not including additional investments in motionpicture companies , tape-manufacturing firms , amusement centers , hotels , amounted to forty-two million dollars . While Osborn was no Luther Yerkes , no super-tycoon , he was , as the saying goes , comfortable . He was also ambitious . Persisting in his quest for empire , Osborn had become involved in an intricate negotiation over an immense new possible acquisition . His bargaining had been stalemated because the new business presented a complicated tax problem . In an effort to learn whether the problem could be resolved , he had taken on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Turner , as was their custom , had fragmented various aspects of the difficult taxation obstacle , and farmed these parts out to their junior members . To how many , Mike Barrett did not know , except that he was one of those assigned full-time on a crash program to create a tax structure that would make Osborn 's negotiation feasible . The work had been almost crushingly difficult , days without hours , weekends without rest , a project both back-breaking and mind-splitting . As much as he had come to detest tax law , Barrett had enjoyed the Osborn project . He had enjoyed it because it brought him close to dissecting the anatomy of power . For once , he could see it up close  --  so that legal precedents and business  | figures became translated into stately mansions and royal gardens ? and it intrigued him and spurred his creativity . He had been reluctant to give up his papers , his findings , researches , suggestions , and to live among lesser people and problems again , but at last he had turned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another word about the Osborn project until several months later , about four months ago , when old Thayer had announced at a staff meeting that their report had enabled Osborn Enterprises to conclude successfully a history-making multimillion-dollar deal in communications . Now Thayer , on behalf of himself and Turner , wanted to thank every person in the firm who had participated in this dedicated team effort . Three days after that meeting , old Thayer had summoned Mike Barrett to his office alone . He had offered Barrett a sherry . Unusual . Then he had said that Willard Osborn wished to meet Barrett briefly that very afternoon . No , not at the Osborn Tower Building , but at Osborn 's residence north of Sunset Boulevard in Holmby Hills . ' When Barrett had wondered what it was all about , Thayer had hesitated , then replied that Osborn merely wished to meet him . " I think you will find it interesting , " Thayer had added with a pinched smile . After lunch , Barrett had driven to the Osborn hillside residence . Even though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues who had been fortunate enough to be invited to the residence , the Spanish hacienda exceeded his expectations . Osborn had remodeled his mansion , Barrett had heard , after the Palacio Liria , the Alba town house near the Plaza de Espana in Madrid . Barrett had seen photographs of the original , and the smaller replica was equally impressive . There were the colorful gardens guarding the rolling driveway , and beneath tile roofing there were adobe facades with Doric columns in front of imposing pilasters . Awed , Barrett had allowed himself to be led by an immaculately uniformed maid through the vast entrance hall , down a long , wide passage , and into the high-ceilinged library . There , surrounded by Flemish paintings , and with a magnificent Goya oil as his backdrop , waited Willard Osborn II . He was lounging on a sofa near his ornate desk , teasing a friendly wolfhound , when Barrett appeared . Osborn rose immediately  --  a tall , droopy , aris-  | tocratic man with whitish hair , heavy-lidded eyes , angular features  --  and he shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then sat beside him . Slowly he turned toward Barrett and studied him . " Well , Mr. Barrett , " he said after a pause , " you may wonder why I had Thayer send you around . For one thing , I wanted to thank you personally . For another , I wanted to have a look at a young man responsible for making me , in tax savings , two million dollars . " Barrett 's eyebrows shot upward when he heard the figure . Osborn did not hide his amusement . " It 's true , Mr. Barrett , " he went on . " Oh , it was n't easy to ascertain to whom the credit belonged . Thayer and Turner would have liked to take the credit themselves , or prattle about teamwork , but I would n't have that nonsense . I pinned them down . It turned out that , of the many ideas submitted , it was yours that was both the most novel and the most practicable , and it was yours around which they built their proposal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gimmick , as my television colleagues like to put it  --  and most imaginative . In a time of mediocrity , it is not often that I have the good fortune to meet a young man like yourself . I would be fascinated to know precisely how you conceived the whole tax structure . But first , will you have a cup of coffee with me ? " During coffee they were joined by a third person . Faye Osborn , the host 's daughter and only offspring , fresh from the tennis court , had put her head into the library to remind her father of some social engagement . She had been introduced to Barrett . Meeting him , being told of his accomplishment , she had asked if she might have coffee with them . For the next half hour , it had become increasingly difficult for Barrett to keep his mind on tax matters . Faye 's eyes never left him . She seemed to be examining him with the cool objectivity of a horsewoman studying a derby winner soon to be auctioned off for stud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the glacial beauty of Faye 's face and the perfection of her figure . Her sun-blanched blond hair was drawn tightly backward and caught up by a red ribbon . Her features were fine , flawless , Grecian . Her open-throated white blouse offered glimpses of the slopes of her full breasts . Her gracefully crossed legs were long and shapely . Perhaps twenty-eight years old , Barrett guessed . Fin-  | ishing school in Switzerland , he guessed . And spoiled , he was sure . When the coffee and conversation had ended , it was Fay Osborn who saw him to the door . At the door she said , " I 'm having some interesting people in Saturday night for a buffet dinner . I 'd love to have you come . " " I 'd be delighted . " " I 'm pleased . " She stared at him . " Is there someone you want to bring ? " " Not especially . " " Then bring yourself alone . I 'll cancel my date . Do you mind being my partner ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it . In the next two months , Mike Barrett had become a regular at the Osborn mansion , always Faye 's partner . One evening , as they were returning to Holmby Hills from the Philharmonic Auditorium , Faye asked to see his apartment . After two drinks , curled up against him , she said that she loved him . He admitted that he loved her . " Why have n't you shown it ? " she whispered . " What do you mean ? " " You 've never invited me up here before . And I still have n't seen the bedroom . " " I 've been afraid to . You have too much money . It puts me down . " " What if I were a shopgirl or somebody 's secretary ? " " I 'd have undressed you on the first date . " Her hand caressed his thigh . " Mike , you inverted snob , please undress me . " After that evening , he had begun seeing Faye four and five times a week . Sometimes Willard Osborn II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osborn was taking his measure . Frequently , in the monotony of his legal work , Barrett caught himself daydreaming about what might be possible . It was this daydreaming , alone , that made him hesitate when Abe Zelkin had called him a month ago . Zelkin had wanted to know whether he had made up his mind yet about their partnership . Earlier Barrett had made up his mind to quit the rat race and join up with Zelkin . Now he had hesitated . Perhaps he was merely an-  | other one of Faye 's indulgences , and perhaps he misread the elder Osbom 's interest in him . Yet the daydreams continued . He had told Zelkin that he was overloaded at the office . Also , there was some prospect of a raise , and he was n't certain yet whether he should leave . Could Abe give him a little more time ? Zelkin had said , " A little more , but not too much , Mike . For myself , I ca n't wait . I 've given my notice to the ACLU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't carry it by myself . I 've got several good guys who want to go in with me , but none of them is you , Mike . Look , I 'll carry the load alone for a month and keep your desk ready and waiting . I 'm expecting you to say yes by then . I 'll wait for you to call . " Barrett had continued putting off that call . But three days ago he had almost decided that , while his relationship with Faye was the real thing , his hope about her father was something else and quite unreal , and that he should telephone Zelkin and agree to their partnership . Then , two days ago , Faye had telephoned . Her father wanted to see him that evening , after dinner , on business . On business . His hope danced , until he grabbed it and locked it out of sight . There they were , that evening , in the library once more , he and Willard Osborn II . " Michael , " Osborn had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been keeping an eye on you . I 've been waiting for the right moment to bring this up . Now the timing is right , and I 've made up my mind . I 'm sure you 've heard me discuss that Midwest television network that was coming on the market . I can have it , if certain tax details can be worked out . I need the right man to negotiate this . I 've had the choice of promoting one of my older men or taking on someone new . I 've decided on someone new . There 's only one condition . The new man would have to be available to take over by early next week . Michael , how would you like to be a vice-president of Osborn Enterprises starting at seventy-five thousand a year ? " The jackpot , at long last . There had been an excited sleepless night . His mind had been a happy Mardi Gras , except for one very real demon . He was on a project that might take weeks to resolve , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon a project  | without their consent . Yesterday morning he had been in the office early , awaiting Thayer 's arrival . He had gone in to see Thayer , and he had blurted out Osborn 's fantastic proposal . Sniffing , Thayer had listened . As he finished , Barrett felt that he could expect resistance . But old Thayer had merely sat up and said , " I 'll send Magill in to see you . Brief him on your project , and he 'll take over . You can terminate tomorrow morning . Good luck . It 's our policy never to stand in anyone 's way . " By the emphasis Thayer put on " anyone 's way " Barrett knew that the old man did not mean Barrett 's way , but Osborn 's way . And this morning he was free . He had wanted to telephone Faye immediately , and then her father , and make his acceptance formal . Instead , he had called Abe Zelkin to make a lunch date , not having the courage to tell him on the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osborns , but his sense of order , of chronology , of first things first , would not permit him to do it . He must see Zelkin first , get that unhappy task over with , clear the decks , and then he would be truly free . And here he was with Abe Zelkin . Barrett slowly opened his eyes to the present , and to his surprise there was Zelkin , in the booth across from him , grinning at him . " I was wondering when you 'd come out of the trance , " said Zelkin . " For a guy with only good news , you sure looked stricken . Or were you in yoga meditation , and was that the face of ecstasy ? Well , I tell you , I feel good , Mike . " He picked up his knife and fork and dug into the hamburger steak . " It 's sure taken us long enough to get together . " " Abe , let me ? " " Okay , I 'm sorry . You were going to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you the whole thing . " He picked at his salad without eating it . " It goes back to that day when I first met Faye Osborn . You remember , I told you about that . " " Great girl , Faye . " " Yes , but that 's not the story . The story is her old man . Now , do n't bust in , Abe . Let me tell it all , because that 's why I 'm here . " Carefully , sorting and rearranging the events that he had just reviewed in his memory , Barrett began to relate the growth of his  | relationship with Willard Osborn II . Eventually he came to the point where Faye had told him that her father wanted to see him privately . Then he began to recount the meeting with Osborn in his library the night before last , and he tried not to watch Zelkin when he quoted Willard Osborn 's offer of seventy-five thousand a year and a vice-presidency . He tried not to watch , but he could not help seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go taut beneath the fat . Zelkin ceased eating . It was no use avoiding the hurt eyes . Barrett looked up . " I 'm seeing Osborn tomorrow night . I 'm going to accept his job . I 'm sorry , Abe , but I have to . I do n't feel there 's any choice . Much as I have wanted to go with you , something like this Osborn thing comes up once in a lifetime . I ca n't let the brass ring pass . I 've got to grab . I  --  I hope you 'll try to understand . " Absently Zelkin touched the napkin to his mouth . " Well , what the devil , what can I say ? I ca n't say what I offered you is better as far as material things go . I mean , our law office could give you only crumbs compared to this . You could work thirty years and still never see seventy-five thousand dollars in three years , let alone one . And , while I got us some nice attractive offices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give you . And clients  --  well , you know , we 'd have the helpless and the dregs alongside the big shots you 're going to be meeting with now . The question is . . . what you 're after . " Barrett would not allow himself to weaken . " I know what I 'm after , Abe . " " Do you ? I never felt you were certain , even after you threw over the Good Government Institute to play Get Rich Quick . After all , you were considering going in with me . " " I was . That was sincere . But that was before this Osborn position came up . That 's the one I 've spent years waiting for . " Zelkin shook his head . " I 'm still not convinced that 's what you want . Forget the do-good part of you . Technically , you can do good for the rich , too . Like A. J. Liebling once put it about the columnist Westbrook Pegler . He said , Pegler is a courageous defender of minorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes . ' Forgive me , Mike . I did n't mean to say it to shiv you . I meant it as a funny . Only it came out bitter . Let me put it this  | way , Mike . You are an attorney , and what you 're going into is n't law , it 's business . You 're going to become a businessman . Granted that in the eyes of the world you 'll be a big success . But in your own eyes , Mike , you 've got to see sooner or later that the challenges wo n't be the same as in our kind of law . The people wo n't be the same as real people , and they wo n't need the kind of help only you could give the clients who 'd come to us . What 's there in it for you ? " " Money , " said Barrett bluntly . Nobody , not even Zelkin , was going to cast him as some goddam Benedict Arnold . " Honest money , honestly earned . As Milton put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and realms . ' Aptly from Paradise Regained . " " Well , as Thackeray put it , " said Zelkin softly , " We often buy money very much too dear . " Barrett was suddenly exasperated . " Abe , to quote nobody but myself , please do n't give me any more of that crap . Let me tell you something , something that I 've never told you about completely . My mother scrimped and pinched pennies and deprived herself to put me through Harvard , through law school . She and the old man came over on immigration boats , steerage , when they were kids , and grew up scared and alone , and were pushed around because they were poor . After they met up and got married in Chicago , my father worked twenty-five hours a day to keep his head above water and set aside a few bucks for a rainy day . And when he keeled over , there was that sum in the bank , a pitiful sum by our lights , to keep my mother and me alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Zelkin . " It was n't so different with my parents . " " All right , then it should be easier for you to comprehend the rest . Because when I got out of high school , my mother would n't 6 I play it safe with her little loot . She knew what it was all about in little golden America . It was money talks , and if you want to learn the language you 'd better go to school , and it better be the best school around . And then if you make it , you 'll be somebody and you can be independent and nobody can push you around . So she shot what was left on her son , so he could go to Harvard and make it . So far , so good , and some of that you already know . " " Of course I know , and I can appreciate ? " " You ca n't fully appreciate what I 'm saying , Abe , because  | there 's something you do n't know . And after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that Freudian twaddle about mothers and sons and why my mother did it and what that 's done to me and that crap . Look , I 'm as grown-up as you and I 'm a big Freud man , but I 'm sick and tired of a whole smart-ass generation that makes you some kind of neurotic nut if you say something good about your mother , or defend her , or say you owe her something . Well , dammit , I say the way Confucius say that I owed her plenty . She did nothing for me in order to get paid back . She did it for the pleasure of knowing I might be more than she and my father had been by society 's standards . But I owed her plenty , and when it was time to pay back , when she was in need , I could n't pay her , because I did n't have the legal tender of the realm . I had only the counterfeit scrip of idealism . " " Mike , I did n't mean ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll make it short and sour . After school , I passed up some good opportunities to take that job with the Institute and make the world more humane for humanity . It was just about the time I met you . My mother came down with a serious illness , serious . I 'll spare you the medical details . To stay alive , she needed the best surgeons , the best care , the best of everything . She needed money . Where was the money ? I 'm talking about life-and-death money now , not luxury money . ' Where was it ? No more rainy-day fund . That had been invested in me . And me , I was too busy doing good to save a dime . " " You were busy doing what you had to do , making your way . You were only beginning ? " " Abe , do n't give me any prefab apologies for my guilts . What I was doing was copping out , turning my back on realities and responsibilities , indulging myself in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real world out there that had to be dealt with . Look , Abe , the facts . I needed fast money , and I did n't have it . I had praise and merit badges , but they were n't legal tender . Money was legal tender , and I determined to get it . Do you know where I went scratching for it ? " " I have no idea , Mike , " said Zelkin quietly . " I had only one hookup with the world of affluence . Phil Sanford . I went to him . Long before this , he had once begged me to  | come into his family 's publishing house with him and make some real dough , and I 'd treated his invitation like I 'd been invited to work in a house of sin . I was an attorney and I belonged outside , busily attorneying . Now here I was , hat in hand , saying I had changed my mind and I would n't mind taking a better-paying job with Sanford House . Well , I 'll always give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightweight and insensitive in some areas , but that day I went to him his third ear was on my wave length and his perceptions were keen . He sensed trouble and he insisted on knowing why this drastic change of heart about my choice of career . At first I would n't tell him , but after we went out and belted a few drinks I spilled my guts , told him the whole thing . Well , he would n't have me diverted from my profession by my need for money . Why , if it 's only money , ' he said  --  only money ? and he pressed the money I needed on me . A loan . With it I bought the best surgeons , and they saved my mother , and with it I was able to give her the best care possible in her remaining days . That should have been my lesson . Money talks . Money saves . Money shall make you free . But one lesson is not enough when you 're young . It was n't until my mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they began treating her with that drug which , we found out later , should have been banned , that I learned my second lesson . After the drug killed her , I learned the do-gooders would n't do good if they had to fight one of the sources of their income . No , not until then did I get lesson number two and the full message . That 's when I made my vow . I 'm a slave , I told myself , and only money can set me free , and if the Main Chance ever comes , I vow to take advantage of it . That 's why I have to go with Osborn Enterprises . " Zelkin had been very still , staring down at his empty coffee cup . Finally he nodded . " I see , " he said . " I mean , I can understand . " " Just to be sure you do , " said Barrett , " let me add one last thing . I 've met some of the Hollywood entertainment crowd , and they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all in a single sentence . The saying is , You 've got it made when you 've got " fuck-you " money . ' That 's it in a nutshell . When you 've got enough money to say , Fuck you , buster , ' to any bastard on earth , then and only then are you your own man . I intend to be my own man . "  | Zelkin smiled weakly . " I read you loud and clear , Mike , only ? only there are many ways of being your own man . " " Fair enough . " Barrett extracted his credit card from his wallet and placed it on the restaurant check . " Let me pay , Abe . After all , I 'm going to be a vice-president . " " Okay . I 'll get it next time . " Barrett suddenly felt better . " I 'm glad you said next time . ' I was hoping you would . I did n't want this to hurt our friendship . " " Do n't worry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Barrett signed the credit-card charge slip , put down a tip , and consulted his wristwatch . " I 'd better hustle . I 've got less than a half hour to get downtown to the Hall of Justice and our Mr. Duncan . You do n't mind if I rush off , Abe ? Remember , it is my farewell performance as a do-gooder  --  a do-gooder who also wants to clean up his last debt . " IT WAS THREE MINUTES before his scheduled appointment when Mike Barrett strode toward the half-century-old building where District Attorney Elmo Duncan had his headquarters and exerted control over z6o lawyers in his department . Above the high arched entrance , chiseled into stone , were the intimidating words HALL OF JUSTICE . Pushing through one of the doors , Barrett hastened down the short flight of steps , went past the familiar lobby arcade with its numerous food-and-drink-vending machines , and caught the elevator . On the sixth floor , he found the curved modernistic reception desk , and he was directed straight ahead through another doorway into another broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door with lettering painted on its glass panel that said " Elmo Duncan , District Attorney . " Inside , there was a medium-sized room with two desks . On the one to his left was a name marker for " Lt. Hogan , " whom Barrett knew to be the District Attorney 's driver and bodyguard . The chair at this desk was unoccupied . Across the room , past the grouping of extra chairs and beside a copying machine , was the other desk , a busier-looking one , and this one was occupied . Not until Barrett had reached the clacking typewriter did the receptionist become aware of him . She looked up apologetically as he introduced himself . Quickly consulting her appointment sheet , she nodded and  | told Barrett that District Attorney Duncan was expecting him in the office of Mr. Victor Rodriguez , his special assistant and chief of the Appellate Division . Mr. Rodriguez ' office was at the opposite end of the corridor . She would buzz the District Attorney and alert him that Mr. Barrett was on his way . Retracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the Appellate Division . As he entered , the lone occupant of the room , a pretty , brown-haired girl , ceased typing and stood up . " Mr. Barrett ? Right this way . The District Attorney can see you now . " She held open a door to an inner office , and Barrett thanked her and walked past her . Two men were standing beside a table that was backed up against a desk , and they were deep in conversation . Barrett recognized Elmo Duncan at once . He was the taller of the pair , at least six feet tall . He had slick blond hair , narrow blue eyes , a thin nose and a cleft chin . His complexion was light and faintly freckled . He was tastefully dressed in a tailored blue alpaca suit and a blue-and-white-striped shirt . His companion , stockier , had jet-black curly hair and a swarthy face with a conspicuous nose over a neatly trimmed but full moustache . The moment that the door had closed behind Barrett , Duncan looked up , broke off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extended hand . Shaking hands , he said , " Good to see you , Mr. Barrett . Sorry to give you all that legwork . I can only get things done when I slip out of my office . Victor and I ? Oh , perhaps you two have n't met . This is Victor Rodriguez , my assistant . Victor , meet Mike Barrett , one of our more successful attorneys . " Barrett shook Rodriguez ' hand as Duncan stood beside them . " Mr. Rodriguez will be leaving us  --  he has an outside meeting ? unless you need him here , " said Duncan . " You said you wanted to discuss the  --  the ? What was that fellow 's name ? " " Ben Fremont , " said Rodriguez . " Yes , Fremont , " said Duncan . " Well , Victor Rodriguez is the man in charge of our pornography cases . Of course , like everything else , I review them , but if you 'd prefer to have Mr. Rodriguez sit in " That wo n't be necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Duncan gestured toward  | two leather chairs facing the desk . " Sit down . Make yourself comfortable . " Barrett went to one of the leather chairs and pulled it away from the shelves of law books and closer to the desk . Duncan had gone behind the glass-topped desk and lowered himself into the leather swivel chair . He indicated a pitcher of water , but Barrett shook his head . Duncan offered a pack of cigarettes . " I 'll stay with my pipe , if you do n't mind , " said Barrett . Duncan lit his cigarette , while Barrett busied himself filling his English shell briar and then applying a match to the tobacco . " I guess this is the first time I 've seen you outside Willard Osborn 's little palace , " Duncan said . " How is Willard these days ? I do n't have time for television , but everyone else seems to watch it , so I suppose he 's doing tolerably well . " Barrett smiled . " I 'd say he has no problems beyond Internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , " said Duncan cheerfully . " You know , Willard Osborn 's one of the few wealthy men I 've met whom I 'd like even if he were poor . He 's very clever and entertaining . " Barrett agreed . He was tempted to let the District Attorney know that he would shortly be a vice-president in the Osborn Enterprises , to impress him even more . But , as Duncan went on , Barrett saw that it was not necessary to identify himself further with Osborn . Elmo Duncan was doing it for him . The District Attorney was recalling several of the Osborn dinner parties at which Barrett had been present , and he was saying complimentary things about Faye , and then he was digressing into a long anecdote about a lawsuit in which Osborn had been involved and which was a perfect example of Osborn 's shrewdness . Time was passing , and abruptly Elmo Duncan stopped , lit a fresh cigarette off the stub of the old one , rolled his swivel chair in tight to the desk , and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get down to business . What can I do for you , Mr. Barrett ? " Barrett took the pipe from his mouth , emptied it into the ashtray on the desk . " You can do me a favor , " he said . " You name it . Anything  --  within reason . " " I 'm not here for Willard Osborn . I 'm here representing another client , an old friend of mine in New York . Philip Sanford , the  | head of Sanford House , publisher of The Seven Minutes , that book ? " " I know . The Ben Fremont matter . " " Exactly . " Barrett studied the handsome blond behind the desk . " Mr. Duncan , may I ask , have you read the book ? " " To be quite frank about it  --  no . " " Neither have I , " said Barrett . " But a number of important critics and professors have read it and had written about it long before its first publication in the United States , and they have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hard-core pornography created for commercial profit and dumped into drugstores and bookshops by some sleazy printer of filth out in Reseda or Van Nuys . This is the life 's work of a legendary figure of the thirties , and it is being published by one of the most renowned and prestigious firms in the book trade . This little action by the police this morning has caused my client some embarrassment and may cause him considerable financial hardship . So I thought it made sense to come up here and ? " " Let me see , " said Elmo Duncan as he lifted a pile of manila folders from the edge of the desk . " Let me see what this is all about . " He was checking the folder tabs . " Here it is . Fremont , Ben . Section 311 .. ' " He extracted the folder and set the others aside . Before opening it he said , " Of course , I 'm sure you understand , we do n't make these arrests casually . They are always preceded by a careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received , Rodriguez and his aide  --  that 's Pete Lucas , who 's a specialist in pornography and a capable trial attorney to boot  --  both read the book in question with care . Well , let me see . " He opened the folder and began scanning and turning the pages inside . Barrett remained silent and busied himself with refilling and lighting his pipe . Puffing steadily , he waited . When Duncan was through with the folder , he placed it on the desk , and rubbed his chin . " Well , now , what I 'm going to tell you is off the record , but what I think it comes down to is this . Mrs. Olivia St. Clair , president of the STDL in Oakwood , filed the complaint . Pete Lucas , and then Victor Rodriguez , as I said , read the novel . There was no question in their minds but that it was  | pornographic . The question was whether it was legally obscene by contemporary community standards . " " Since the book has been seized , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Once , in Flaubert 's time , Madame Bovary was considered obscene . Today it 's merely a mild and sad story about an unfaithful wife . Why , recently I read a respectably published memoir of an anonymous Victorian gentleman  --  it was called My Secret Life  --  in which the author explicitly recounts how he ' fucked ' ? his word  --  twelve hundred women of twenty-seven countries and eighty nationalities . The only one he missed , I think , was a Laplander . " Duncan had been squirming uneasily , but now he forced a laugh . " That 's right , " Barrett went on . " When that Victorian wrote his book , he could n't get it published . In our time it has been a best seller , and I do n't think it made any reader 's hair turn white . Why ? Because times have changed . It 's a new ball game . As one professor pointed out , sexual activity is no longer contrary to the prevailing ethos . So why not write about sex as openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anatole France who said  --  of all sexual aberrations , chastity is the strangest . " Duncan gave the slightest smile , but did not speak . He waited . Since he still had the floor , Barrett decided to take advantage of it . " Nor do I think this openness about sex has hurt any of us in our country . Dr. Steven Marcus once wrote about this new permissiveness . It does not indicate to me moral laxness , or fatigue , or deterioration on the part of society . It suggests rather that pornography has lost its old danger , its old power . ' I fully concur . " The District Attorney stirred . " Well , there is a good deal of truth in much of what you say , but I ca n't agree with it entirely . Perhaps some pornography has lost its old danger , but not all of it , I 'm afraid . We could spend a day , a week maybe , arguing this highly complicated problem . " " Forgive me , " said Barrett . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We all get carried away sometime . I meant to confine myself to the Jadway book . I 'll admit that in the thirties , forties , fifties , The Seven Minutes might have been regarded as obscene , but today ? ? Mr. Duncan , have you been to the movies lately ? Have you seen for yourself , on the screen , acted out , not only copula-  | tion , but female masturbation , homosexuality , well , you name it ? I only contend that today , to the average person , by contemporary community standards , by modern standards , the Jadway book is no more or less explicit than other works of far less artistic merit . So why the arrest ? " " Yes , well , yes , that was the debatable point . But our people finally came to the decision they did for two reasons . A large group of average and community-minded women had made the complaint , thereby reflecting that this book had exceeded what is acceptable by contemporary standards ? " " Do you consider the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Barrett acidly . " Of course I do , " said Duncan with surprise . " They 're no different from any other women . They marry , have children , do housework , cook , entertain , read books . Certainly they 're as average as can be . " Barrett wanted to challenge the District Attorney on this , but he realized that Duncan was sincere  --  had n't Abe Zelkin called him " honest " and " square " ? ? and nothing would be gained by antagonizing him . Barrett kept his peace . " And if ladies like that , a big organization , a very big one ? " Duncan went on . A big organization translated into a lot of voters , Barrett thought , remembering that Zelkin had also called the District At " political . " " ? if they feel disturbed by this book , it tells us that maybe there are more people in Oakwood with high standards of decency than may be evident in the numbers who attend some of the films you mentioned . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was that we felt this whole outpouring of shock litera disgusting sadomasochistic slime , was increasing and must be stopped , especially must be stopped so that it is not available to the young and impressionable . Perhaps , as you stated it , times have changed , moral boundaries have expanded , allowing for more candor and tolerance . Yet there are limits , there must be boundaries somewhere . Perhaps , as one Congregationalist clergyman so aptly put it , this country is suffering from an orgy of openmindedness . I remember attending a speech delivered in the East by Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Michael Musmanno . In  | that address he said , A wide river of filth is sweeping across the nation , befouling its shores and spreading over the land its nauseating stench . But what is most disturbing of all is that persons whose noses should be particularly sensitive to this olfactory assault do not smell it at all . I refer to District Attorneys and prosecuting officers throughout the nation . ' Well , Mr. Barrett , I 've never forgotten those words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does smell the stench . " " Certainly , " said Barrett . " Everyone wants to do away with the smell of commercialized hard-core pornography ? " Duncan held up his hand . " No . The sleazy back-street peddlers of hard-core pornography are not the ones we worry about . We worry that this same kind of obscene matter will be given respectability by notable imprints like Sanford House and become available in every bookstore . It is precisely because of Sanford 's reputation that we selected this Jadway book , to serve notice on the powerful publishers that this thing has reached its outer limit and must come to an end . Now , this was the basis for the arrest this morning . But actually , Mr. Barrett , I do n't want to overstate our case or my feelings . I mean , specifically in the matter of Ben Fremont I do n't feel that strongly . I do feel strongly about the whole trend in literature and motion pictures in this country , but I had no intention of making the People versus Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important crimes on our investigative agenda and court calendar . This is a relatively small thing . " " Well , then ... " " It 's those women in Oakwood . They were pressuring our office , with some justification , and we had to satisfy them . I 'm sure you can understand that . " " And with Fremont 's arrest you 've satisfied them , " said Barrett . " Right , " said Duncan . " We 've done our duty . But now , also , you have a client and you have a duty . I 'm willing to be cooperative , f within the limitations of what has already happened . The arrest has been made . The accused has been booked . You 've got him out on bail . What 's the next step you have in mind ? " Barrett drew on his pipe , and watched the smoke billow upward . At last he leaned against the desk . " I want to be reasonable , too , Mr. Duncan . I think this would satisfy my client . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him pay a fine of  | twenty-four hundred dollars , but in return his one-year jail sentence might be suspended . If that trade could be arranged , that would satisfy us . " " Mmm , well , if that could be arranged , you do understand that entering a plea of guilty would be tantamount to a banning of The Seven Minutes throughout Oakwood . All the other bookstores in Oakwood would be afraid of the STDL and of our proceeding against them also . " " We do n't give a damn about Oakwood , " said Barrett . " Let it be unavailable there . In that way , you 've satisfied the STDL in that community . Since Oakwood is an unincorporated part of Los Angeles County , a separate area even though it comes under your jurisdiction , it means the book could be suppressed there but would still be sold elsewhere in Los Angeles County . " " That 's right . " " Very well . My client is interested in the rest of Los Angeles County , and the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities around the country . If the book can remain on sale in most of Los Angeles County , that 's all that counts . As for Oakwood , no one in that community will any longer be offended by seeing the book there . And those who want the book can drive a few blocks farther , to Brentwood or Westwood or some other nearby section of Los Angeles , and buy it . That 's what it comes to . And in a week or two the book will be on sale in the large cities throughout the nation , and it will have its acceptance . The shock of it will be mitigated by this acceptance , and there wo n't be any further trouble over it . There you have it , Mr. Duncan . " Barrett waited . Elmo Duncan stubbed out his cigarette , came to his feet thoughtfully , thrust his hands into his trouser pockets , and walked slowly around the area between the swivel chair and the shelves of massive legal tomes lining the wall . Abruptly he stopped his pacing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to me . " " Good . " " We 'll satisfy those ladies . As for Lucas and Rodriguez , they 're so immersed in this sort of thing , I 'm sometimes inclined to think they 're oversensitive to every word they read . Of course , it 's un-  | dcrstandable . They have to field complaints almost daily . They must answer the complainants , like the group in Oakwood . But I know I can contain my assistants . In fact , I could come to an agreement with you right here and now about reducing the charges , except that I owe my staff the courtesy of discussing this with them first , since they 've given the case so much of their time . But I quite agree . This is a nuisance matter , a routine matter , and we can treat it routinely . So let 's give ourselves until tomorrow , Mr. Barrett . Let me smooth any ruffled feathers , and when that is done you can enter your guilty plea , and I can promise you that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than the fine and a suspended jail sentence . Fair enough ? " Barrett stood up . " Fair enough . " The District Attorney came rapidly around the desk to shake Barrett 's hand and see him to the door . " You be sure to call me around this time tomorrow . " " Do n't worry . I wo n't forget . " As he opened the door , Duncan seemed to remember something . " And , by the way , if you 're seeing Willard Osborn soon . . . " " I 'm having dinner with him tomorrow night . " " Well , do n't forget to say that you saw me , and that I wanted you to give him my regards and to tell him how pleased I am about the time and attention his network has given me lately . You can tell him I 'm most appreciative . " This , thought Barrett , is what it 's like in the marketplace , everywhere . " I 'll certainly tell him , " said Barrett . Duncan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better get cracking . I 've got a busy afternoon and an even busier evening . " ALTHOUGH 1H1 SUMMER 'S DAY had been mild and warm , with the coming of darkness the winds had begun to whip up from the west and by late evening it was chilly . Especially was it cold on this drive along the ocean . Shivering slightly from the unseasonable weather , Elmo Duncan huddled deeper in a corner of the rear seat of the Cadillac limousine that Luther Yerkes had sent for him after dinner . Duncan glanced at the windows to see whether they were completely  | rolled up ; they were . He considered asking the chauffeur to turn on the heat , then realized from the landmarks that they were no more than five minutes or so from the Malibu colony and soon enough he would be insulated from the wind and the cold . After a long , exhausting day , with hardly time enough for him to exchange gossip with his wife or give the children attention or eat a relaxed meal , this ride from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach place was doubly tiresome . He wished that Yerkes would use his more accessible dwelling , the vast French country-style habitat in Bel-Air , for these conferences . Or , at least , hold the conferences at his desert residence in Palm Springs  --  on weekends , when the distance did not matter  --  because the atmosphere was more relaxing . Yet , despite his chafing , he understood the wisdom of using the beach place . It was secluded . Yerkes put much importance on his right to personal privacy , and more so when he did not wish his behind-the-scenes activities subjected to public knowledge and speculation . These regular meetings between the District Attorney of Los Angeles and California 's wealthiest industrialist , which might be regarded with suspicion by many persons , had begun some months ago as weekly conferences , but now that Harvey Underwood and Irwin Blair had been retained and brought into them they had become two- and three-times-a-week conferences . Later the alliance between Duncan and Yerkes would have to come out . As yet it was too early , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' political organization , unsuspecting and therefore off guard . Tonight , aside from those with whom Duncan was meeting , only two persons knew of his destination . One was his wife , and the other his chief of police . As he idly watched the beach cottages that ran along flush with the Pacific Coast Highway pass by his view , the thought came to Duncan  --  as it often did at this stage in the drive  --  that he was extremely lucky to have been tapped for bigger things by a kingmaker . Many of those beach houses out there were the second homes , the summer homes , of the affluent . It would be nice to have one for the family . It would be nice to have much more than that . Even better , it would be wonderful to have power . Elmo Duncan had been raised in Glendale , strictly lower middle class , no poverty or real deprivations , but no extras or advantages  | either . His elders in the caste system of his youth had warned : Never exceed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living with that had been an advantage in itself . He had seethed to rebel against a life that revolved around economy ( you thought of money before anything else , because you had to ) and against a life that demanded humbleness ( you had to listen to other people who were your economic superiors , while they never had to listen to you ) . All things considered , he had come a long way . The night that he had learned he had been elected district attorney by an amazing majority , he had thought that he had achieved the absolute pinnacle of success . Only after two dramatic court cases , which he had prosecuted with great intensity and skill and which had made his name a household word in Los Angeles , had he heard the first whisperings of what was possible . Even after he became aware that there were summits beyond what he had already achieved , he had not believed himself capable of attaining one of those loftier positions . That is , he had not believed it until the fabulous Luther Yerkes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan knew that Yerkes never picked losers . Recollecting the golden weekend  --  last winter , it had been , in Luther Yerkes ' desert hideaway in Palm Springs  --  Duncan was once again warmed and his weariness was shed . When he had arrived on a Friday evening for that weekend , Duncan had tried to speculate on the purpose behind the invitation . Yerkes needed no favor from a mere District Attorney . Yerkes had no interest in collecting Names . So there could be only one motive behind his invitation , and it could not he social . Yet , as the Friday gave way to Saturday , and Saturday passed , and most of Sunday also , without his making any overture , Duncan 's hopes had deflated completely . He remembered that before dinner of that final day in the desert  --  he was to drive back to Los Angeles immediately afterward ? he hated himself for having been unrealistically ambitious , and he hated Yerkes for having made a fool of him in his own eyes . He remembered his first impression of Yerkes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kingmaker that he would not admit to himself until the beginning of the final evening , when his disenchantment had gradually set in . Luther Yerkes was a scant five feet five , yet he weighed 18o  | pounds . He had a round head crowned by a disconcerting auburn hairpiece . His fat face was bland , imperturbable , almost benign at first sight . It was the chubbiness and the layers of chin , plus the external trappings of power , Duncan had guessed , that deceived the court visitor . But as you came to know Yerkes , watch him at the ticker tapes , overhear him on the telephone , talk to him , the blue-tinted glasses he always wore indoors no longer hid the small marble eyes , and the bland fleshy face no longer masked the cunning , conceited , arrogant man behind it . The feminine bejeweled hands and mincing walk were lies also , because the hands figuratively disguised brass knuckles and could sign a death sentence , and the walk enabled him to keep his balance even when he walked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter weekend in the desert , they had dined alone . The moment after the entree had been served , Luther Yerkes had begun to speak in that clipped , faintly hoarse voice , and , except to gulp a mouthful of food , he had not ceased speaking to Duncan for almost a half hour . He had invited Duncan here because he had heard many favorable things about him . Before inviting him , he had investigated Duncan 's past and present life and career , and even his family and distant relatives and friends . So he had heard about Duncan . He had learned about him . But he had not seen him in person or in action or listened to him . That was what Friday night and Saturday and most of this day had been all about . To size Duncan up . Now he wanted to tell Duncan that he had sized him up , and Duncan fit . Fit what ? Why , the boots of the next United States Senator from California . Senator Nickels ? Certainly he would run for re-election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too big for his boots . He could be defeated . Yet only by the right man . Yerkes had decided that Elmo Duncan was the right man . If he was big enough to take guidance , he would be big enough for the United States Senate . Duncan had always been a quick study , and he understood " guidance " to mean that if he went along , if he were to achieve one of the highest seats in the land , he would be expected to remember who had put him there . Duncan had always had high regard for , and pride in , his own integrity . He had also learned along the way that one remembers friends and one compromises on small matters to achieve greater  | ends if one is to be a politician . And somehow one 's integrity remains intact , at least most of it , enough of it . And he sensed that Luther Yerkes understood and respected to what degree he might be willing to be Yerkes ' man . In Duncan 's eyes , Yerkes had undergone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome and fatherly . And by the time Yerkes had walked him to his car , Duncan had agreed to take guidance . Yerkes would be his mentor and his patron . Elmo Duncan had hummed aloud and happily all the threehour drive back to Los Angeles . Only later , a few days later , had he decided to investigate his patron just as his patron had investigated him . Duncan had always known that Yerkes was rich and powerful . Now , because he was curious and his wife was curious , he determined to learn the extent of Yerkes ' riches and power . Duncan 's wife , Thelma , had done the research . Luther Yerkes ' aerospace and electronics holdings were too vast and intricate for a layman to grasp . He owned the fifty-million-dollar Space Parts Center , employing seven thousand workmen and technicians , near San Diego . His Flight Propulsion Division at the edge of Pasadena had grossed one billion dollars last year . His Recomm Company in Dallas had outbid Lockheed Aircraft , Boeing , and Douglas with its air-frame proposal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a contract that might eventually earn him twenty-seven billion dollars of potential sales . Somewhere he had control of a Data Systems Division that turned out process-control computers . He had joined foreign firms to finance projects in the Middle East and in Latin America . Yerkes was sixty years old and had not married again after a divorce almost forty years ago . His sports were marlin fishing and a big-league baseball team he owned . His hobbies were collecting French Impressionist art and vintage Rolls-Royces and Bentleys . His interest in politics had never been made public . Yet there was evidence that he had financially supported four presidential candidates , six senatorial candidates , and three candidates for governor , and always against opponents whose campaign promises threatened his holdings . Every candidate Yerkes had supported , as far as Duncan had been able to learn , had been elected to office . Yerkes ' obsession was money . His politics backed no one party ,  | only his obsession , and its sole platform appeared to be : Defeat anyone who has obstructed or wishes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan a heady sensation to know that Luther Yerkes was taking not just a financial interest but a personal interest in building Duncan as a candidate for the Senate . " Here we are , sir , " the chauffeur announced . Duncan realized that they had turned off the Pacific Coast Highway and entered the gate beside the guardhouse of the Malibu colony , and were now drawing up before Yerkes ' sprawling beach place . As the limousine stopped , Duncan , without waiting for the chauffeur , opened the car door and stepped down on the flagstone walk . The gusty wind tore at his smooth blond hair and curled his trench coat against his legs . He pressed the doorbell , and a few seconds later the Scottish butler admitted him and took his coat . " They 're waiting in the billiard room , Mr. Duncan . " " Thank you . " He strode quickly through the grilled breezeway , a heated kidney-shaped indoor swimming pool on one side of him , a brace of dressing rooms and sauna baths on the other side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano in the parlor and descended the three steps into the comfortable billiard room , which was dominated not by a billiard table but by a huge ornate antique pool table . Harvey Underwood , who resembled a thoughtful heron , wearing his usual meditative look and inevitable English tweeds , was arranging three balls on the table , as Irwin Blair , rumpled wavy hair and baggy beige Dacron suit , chalked his cue stick and announced that he could n't make this trick shot more than once out of three times . Luther Yerkes , popping a mint into his mouth ( he had given up smoking recently ) , watched them with disinterest . Yerkes was attired in a checked sport shirt , clay-colored slacks , and ridiculous ankle-high suede Indian boots . To the critical eye , he looked like Hetty Green 's twin brother , had she had a twin brother . To Duncan , still , he looked superb . Duncan ran his comb through his disheveled hair , put it away ,  | and then gave a stage cough . Yerkes looked up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately . " Elmo , glad you made it at last . " " We were delayed by the traffic on Sunset , " said Duncan . " I hated to hold you up . " The other two were greeting him , and he raised a friendly hand . " Hello Harvey  --  Irwin . " " Let 's go into the living room and get right down to business , " said Yerkes . " It 's five after ten . We do n't want to be all night . " Blair 's acne-pocked mobile face registered dismay . " Hey , do n't you want to see this trick shot ? " " Yes , " said Yerkes with a tinge of sarcasm , " but I want to see you pull one off in your work , not in here . Come on , now . " A cakewalking Punchinello , Yerkes led the procession up the steps and into the huge living room , its airiness stifled by expensive antique furniture of baroque design , gilded mirrors and tables , carved chairs , an aged desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves rolling up the sand outside were incongruous in this room filled with such furnishings . g There were two deep armchairs facing a ten-foot sofa across a coffee table that looked like a stunted Sendai chest . Yerkes headed toward one armchair , gesturing for Duncan to take the other , and Underwood and Blair automatically found places on the sofa . It was then that Duncan realized that Underwood had been carrying an almost wafer-thin leather portfolio and was now removing some yellow pages from it . The Scottish butler entered silently with a tray of drinks . The drinking habits of each were already known to him . The butler dispensed the drinks : a brandy snifter of armagnac for Yerkes ; another snifter of the same for Duncan , who had ordered armagnac on his very first visit only because Yerkes had ordered it , except that his own had a glass of water on the side ; a J and B Scotch on the rocks for Underwood ; a Coca-Cola for Blair . The ritual was one sip and swallow each , and the meeting would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the others reached for their drinks . Duncan enjoyed the warming brandy and watched the pair on the sofa . No two men were more different . Underwood was a quiet , factual man , the perfect mathematical product of an age of communications . Blair was a raucous extrovert , full of exaggerated  | fancies , the perfect image-maker for this same age . Facts and figures provided precise weekly information on what people out there were concerned with and interested in , and this information could then be catalyzed by fancies and inventions into giving the people out there an approximation of what they wanted . The pair were partners . They represented the brains of Underwood Associates . Underwood was one of America 's most respected directors of private public-opinion polls taken for politicians and industrialists . He had established Underwood Associates . Later , realizing that he required an adjunct to his business that would implement his findings , thus giving his wealthy clients a complete service , he had taken Irwin Blair into partnership . Blair had started out as a Hollywood publicity man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to show business . When an actor he handled had determined to run for the United States House of Representatives despite the gibes of his colleagues , Blair had risen to the challenge . Because the actor had been charming and attractive , an actor , Blair had exposed him to endless rounds of handshaking and personal appearances , and because the actor had been slow-witted and superficially informed , an actor , Blair had made him keep his mouth shut and permitted him to open it only to smile . Blair had invented a half-dozen simplified slogans and credited them to the actor in advertisements , in pamphlets , on billboards . Then Blair had gone to work destroying his client 's opponent , and in this he had adopted the brilliant earlier techniques used by a firm known as Campaigns , Incorporated , while it had been headed by the ingenious man-and-wife team of Clem Whitaker and Leone Baxter , whom Blair worshiped . Whitaker and Baxter had been retained to defeat Upton Sinclair when he ran for governor of California . They had sought to divert attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what were made to seem apparent threats in his earlier writings . They had hired a cartoonist to draw thirty cartoons showing the more desirable aspects of California life ; then they had him smear a blob of black paint over part of each sweet American scene , and within each blob had been implanted a truncated quotation from Upton Sinclair that made him appear a monster and an anarchist . Upton Sinclair had been defeated . Imitating ' Whitaker and Baxter , Irwin Blair had demolished his actor client 's  | opponent . The actor had become a congressman by a total vote of three to one . Thereafter Blair had promoted himself from his job as publicity man for entertainment personalities to publicrelations consultant for politicians . Soon enough he had joined up with Harvey Underwood . Three months ago , at an astronomical fee , Luther Yerkes had retained the services of Underwood and Blair on behalf of the candidacy of Elmo Duncan . Watching them now , Duncan was once more uneasy , as he had been since the day Yerkes had hired them . He hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were in the business of sampling the feelings and desires of the public and playing on those feelings and desires , and in this conspiracy Duncan felt himself merely an instrument . It was n't dishonest , but it felt dishonest . He hated it , but he went along because even his wife said that he was being too square as usual , and because he wanted to be more than a mere county district attorney . Underwood was rattling his yellow pages , a prelude to reading off the results of the tabulated findings of his trained interviewers throughout the state who had questioned a thousand persons  --  a stratified random sampling , scientifically based on the sex , age , religion , race , occupation of each person questioned . Out of these pollings the four of them had tried to find issues with which the public was concerned and to which Duncan might devote himself both in his present office and in his increasing public-speaking engagements . When they had agreed on an issue , they tried to decide how Duncan could make use of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public aware that Duncan 's interests coincided with their own , and that he was ready to champion them and solve their problems . The first goal , Yerkes had pointed out three months ago , was to make Elmo Duncan 's name known to the entire voting population of the state . He must become as well known as was his opponent , Senator Nickels . Once this had been accomplished , work would proceed on making his image more attractive and the incumbent 's image less attractive . But the wider exposure of Duncan 's name was still the primary problem . Duncan was fairly prominent in Southern California , largely because of that last murder case he had prosecuted so brilliantly . But he still remained  | a local figure , " a provincial hero , " as Yerkes put it . He must become a statewide hero , as well known and worshiped in Fresno , San Francisco , Sacramento , in Salinas , Sonora , Eureka , as he was in Los Angeles . " Elmo needs one big , big court case , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , repeating what Yerkes had been saying for weeks . " You 've got to come up with something , Harvey , something that is real and that can work . " Duncan found himself nodding in agreement . A big case involving a vital issue . That was the crux of it . Underwood rattled his yellow sheets once more . " I ca n't alter facts , Mr. Yerkes . I have here our latest sampling . We are not questioning the public on international issues yet . ' We are still confining ourselves to what the registered voters in this state are concerned about domestically . And I must report again that by far the biggest concern our public has  --  by more than thirty percentage points over taxation and education  --  is their concern about violence in the streets . That is to say , the worry is about lawlessness , danger , unrest , not just racial , not just organized crime , but the violence engendered by the uncontrolled younger generation . I am not generalizing . You know that I never generalize . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons why our subjects feel this condition exists . The same reasons are still being given . We had worked on two of the reasons and could n't develop an issue , a meaningful issue , for Mr. Duncan . Two weeks ago we went to work on the third one , the feeling that much of this youthful violence and threat stems from or is provoked by the overt salacity in reading matter and films in theaters and on television . Well , we agreed that such a threat came within Elmo 's province , that it was something he could work on , and our discussion coincided with the appearance of that book that had been brought to Elmo 's attention . Then we agreed he was to try to implement the California Criminal Code on censorship , use the book as an issue to build a statewide case in which he was going to fight the . . . the ... " " The publishing Mafia subverting morals , " volunteered Irwin Blair . " Yes , " said Underwood , " and by this act and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a protector of the young and  | the old , and an enemy of violence-inciting literature . We agreed to try that ? " " We did not agree , " Duncan interrupted . " The three of you agreed . I was against it from the start . " " You went along with us , " Yerkes reminded Duncan mildly . " In the end , you agreed to try it . " " Well , of course , but ? " Duncan began . " And now I am given to understand that you have tried it , " resumed Underwood . " Mr. Yerkes tells me that you finally made an arrest this morning . Do n't you think , before we discuss any new steps , that we should wait to ? " " No , " said Duncan flatly . " I came here to talk about that very censorship angle , and I want to talk about it right now . I repeat , I did n't like the angle from the start , and I still do n't like it . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It should be plain to all of us that the whole thing is a flop . So let 's forget it and go on to something with more promise . " Irwin Blair wagged his hand . " Hold it , Elmo . Are n't you being a little impatient ? Maybe this Section 311 gimmick will catch on gradually . I admit it did n't go off like a rocket , but ? " " It fizzled , it flopped , and it 's a dud , " said Duncan with emphasis . He got up automatically , because he was always more effective on his feet . " You 're a great one for facts , Harvey . Well , so am I. We charge a book with being obscene , and we arrest a bookseller under Section 311 for purveying an obscene work . Of the four newspapers I 've seen since this morning , three barely mentioned the arrest , while one did n't bother to do even that . Of the three that mentioned it , one ran two paragraphs on page six , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ads or the obituaries . " Irwin Blair came forward so fast he almost tumbled off the sofa . " Look , if you 're blaming me , " he said defensively , " I 've got to point out that I 've tried . I alerted the press . They promised to give it space . I ca n't control what finally goes on in the city room . It must 've been cut down or crowded out by hotter news . But at least two news commentators mentioned it on television . " " Calm down , Irwin . " It was Yerkes . " No one is blaming you for the lack of attention this received . Elmo is n't blaming you , and neither am I. Let 's not waste our valuable time and energies on  | personal bickering . Elmo is right . We must confine ourselves to facts . " Blair sat back disgruntled , as Elmo Duncan moved behind his chair and then turned to the others . " Yes , fact , gentlemen . The harsh fact is that censorship is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he will grumble about the dangers of provocative smut , finds it difficult to relate a book to all the crimes in the streets . A book is inanimate . To begin with , not enough people know books or read them . And when they do , it is difficult for them to realize that printed pages can in any way threaten their security or their personal lives . In fact , some of them may resent us for interfering with their right to read what they wish or to be titillated by what they read . By interfering in this way , we 've satisfied only a handful of bluenoses and Grundys who could n't swing an election one way or another . Look , I sincerely believe some of the salacious stuff found today in books passing as literature is evil and corruptive , and my office tries to clamp down on the worst of it . But what I believe about this has nothing to do with the possibility of turning censorship , censoring a book , into a major problem of passionate concern to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hardly imagebuilding . What does it do at best ? It pits the District Attorney of a great city against some little two-bit bookseller and against some obscure printed words that not one person in a thousand will ever read or maybe even hear about . Gentlemen , that 's a wild mismatch , and it makes me look like a bully . Fortunately , not many people out there are going to know about it , because it was too dull an issue to get space . I say we 've got a dead issue , and I suggest we bury it as fast as possible . In fact , I half promised this bookseller 's counsel I 'd let the case expire quickly and quietly . Gentlemen , believe me , you 're not going to excite millions of voters with the proposition that a book can do them grave harm . " " But a book can do grave harm . " It was Harvey Underwood speaking from the far end of the sofa . Duncan looked at him sharply , and the other two gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was thinking , " he went on . " As you were speaking , Elmo , I was thinking of books that have been earthquakes , have moved masses of men and whole civilizations to do evil , to create change , to become good . How many millions  | of human beings died because of a book called Mein Kampf , by Adolf Hitler ? How many people died or were enslaved because of a book called Das Kapital , by Karl Marx ? How much violence was instigated , for better or for worse , by a pamphlet or book called Common Sense , by Thomas Paine ; by an essay in a book called Civil Disobedience , by Henry Thoreau ; by a book called Uncle Tom 's Cabin , by Harriet Beecher Stowe ? " He paused . " Elmo , do n't underestimate the incendiary power of a book . " Duncan frowned , knuckles tightening on the back of the chair . j " I wo n't argue with you about those books , about some books . However , you 've left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were effective in creating or helping create violence , revolutions , wars , protest , because each was linked directly to an immediate need among masses of people . Those books fulfilled or agitated or inflamed because they were aimed at live issues . Hitler 's book told the Germans why they were in trouble and showed them how to get out of it . Marx 's book gave a hungry Russia , ripe for revolution , a recipe for eating again . Thoreau 's writings gave Gandhi a new weapon stronger than British arms , and it freed his country , and this same Thoreau essay gave American youth the same weapon to use in resisting the military clique in the United States . Certainly a book that is explosive can be used as a piece of dynamite . But what are we working with ? What have we got ? An obscene sex novel written by an author long dead . A nation filled with people frightened for their lives because of lawlessness and violence . Can we say to those people  --  We 're going to convict this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it away all of your fears will vanish , or most of them will vanish , because you 'll be safer ? We can say that , certainly , and it would probably be partially true , but I assure you no one is going to believe it . If you have n't got believers , you have n't got a crusade . Without a crusade , you ca n't make a hero . " Duncan came slowly back to the coffee table , where he halted . " That 's why we 're here , is n't it ? " J he said , in a half-mocking tone to alleviate his embarrassment . " To make Elmo Duncan a hero ? " " Elmo , sit down , " said Luther Yerkes . " You 've spoken your piece , now sit down and finish your drink and let me speak my piece . " He slowly took off his bluish glasses and squinted at the others . " I 've heard your side , Harvey and Irwin . I 've listened to  | your side , Elmo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to the pair on the sofa . " Elmo Duncan has done everything we 've asked of him . He has cooperated . We suggested he initiate the censorship issue as a trial balloon , to see if it would take hold . As District Attorney , Elmo acted . But he was seriously hampered , in a public-relations sense , by our Criminal Code . He was firing at a pornographic book , and a big one , but the law forced him to aim at the vendor of the book , smaller game . The newspapers were not impressed . Even those two television mentions of the arrest  --  to be truthful , I arranged one of them , I left a personal message with Willard Osborn 's secretary saying that I would appreciate it if one of his stations covered it . Nothing much else , especially nothing spontaneous , happened . In my considered judgment , our District Attorney is right about the whole matter . A weak campaign issue is like a weak stock . Do n't ride it . Get rid of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If you say so , Mr. Yerkes , " said Underwood . " I say so , " said Yerkes . " I say let 's trust Elmo 's instinct . He 's a born politician , and every born politician has an instinct about what 's good for him or bad for him , and that instinct is more useful in understanding the electorate than any computer on earth . Elmo says drop this , find something that will make millions of people sit up , and I agree . What will make them sit up ? Not a book , we know . Then what ? I 'm reminded of something that some writer once said or wrote somewhere . Maybe that 's the answer . This writer said that murder mysteries are popular , and everyone is fascinated by them , because murder is the one irrevocable crime . Murder is final . You can get back the jewels , but never a human being 's life . In a way , that 's it for us too . Elmo here is a politician and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be dramatized in a public prosecution . He needs a big , irrevocable crime , one that by its very nature affects and disturbs the man in the street and the woman in the kitchen . A crime akin to murder . In the light of that , censorship of a book is a small and iffy crime , like the theft of some jewels , affecting a few people but not touching the masses at all . Our job tonight is to find the big issue . Do you go along with me ? " Duncan and Underwood nodded . Irwin Blair said , " Let 's get to work again . "  | " All right , " said Yerkes . He took up his brandy snifter and gently rolled the liquid around the bottom of the glass . Finally he resumed . " Harvey 's latest poll reminds us again that the highpriority concern is violence in the streets , the activities as well as the plight of the young , and the uneasiness this is creating among their elders . Very well . Here we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of people seething inside it , and , as Elmo will confirm , no minute passes without some kind of disturbance or conflict or crime of violence . What were the last FBI figures ? One forcible rape every thirty minutes in these United States . That 's one crime . God knows how many others every minute , let alone every thirty minutes . They are going on , these crimes , and they are happening this very instant , and then over and over again . We have to zero in on the right happening and the right moment , and seize the incident , and hand it to Elmo and say , Make your case with this and we will make you known from one end of the state to the other . Now , Harvey , we want to hear every detail of the results of your latest poll . Then we 've got to be imaginative and practical at one and the same time , and we 've got to determine what single act going on out there in the far-flung city tonight , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a case for our Los Angeles District Attorney and a showcase for the next United States Senator from California . One violent act , in the category of murder , not jewel theft , that 's all we need .... " JE-SUS , HE THOUGHT , if anyone ever learned the truth , if anyone ever found out , he 'd kill himself . He wanted to kill himself right now , this second . It was three hours since it had happened , and George was wrong about his feeling better soon , because nothing had helped . The passage of time had n't helped . The pot had n't helped . The being with others , that had n't helped . Nothing . Except maybe now he was less trembling and shaking all over . Now he was numb all over , and sick and crying in his gut and balls , and he wanted blank oblivion , nothingness , goodbye and no memory . His eyes went from the road ahead to his white hands welded like white hooks to the wheel of his Rover sedan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hey , you sure you 're okay ? "  | " I guess so , " said Jerry Griffith . " I guess I 'm okay now . " " You do n't look it . You look like a zombie . " " I 'm okay , " Jerry Griffith insisted . He turned the car into the east block of Kelton Avenue , just off the UCLA campus , where his friend George shared his apartment with two other guys . " There 's nothing to worry about , " said George , scratching i nside his beard . " Forget it . Make like it never happened . If it never happened , then it did n't happen . Put your mind on another plane , like you were in yoga or something . Know what I mean ? " " I 'm okay , " said Jerry Griffith . " Hey , cool it , feller , you 're driving right past my pad . " Jerry slammed down on the brake with what felt like a stump , not a foot , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it did n't hurt . " Sorry , " he said as George pushed himself back from the dashboard . He waited for George to get out , but George was still there . He realized George was staring at him . George was smoothing his long sandy sideburns and his beard and still staring at him . " Jerry , feller , just one thing ? " George was saying . He waited to hear the one thing . " Like I been telling you all night , you 're in the clear , you 're free . Nobody knows you were there . " " She knows . " " She does n't know your name . " " I forgot . " " So you 're free , " said George . " But one thing . If anything went wrong ? " " You said nothing could go wrong . " " It ca n't , if you wo n't let it , " said George meaningfully . " Like I sometimes tell you , you 're your own worst enemy . Like living at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , I know all about your old man and you . That 's the only thing that worries me . You go in looking unhinged , and he 'll pound the shit out of you until he finds out what 's eating you . And that gorgeous piece you call your cousin  --  that Maggie ? " " Cut it out , George . "  | " I got to say what 's on my mind . You 're bugged by this , but if you confide in her you 'll be digging a hole for yourself . " " I told you this is strictly between us . " " Just be sure it is , " said George . " Because if it is n't , and something goes wrong , you remember one thing  --  you were in this solo . I was n't there . Only you were there . Because if you ever said I was there , I 'd consider that an act of betrayal , and I 'd have to tell them it was you who hurt her . If you meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our agreement . I was n't there . So I could never say you were there . Do you understand ? " " Okay , George . " George Perkins opened the door , then he hesitated , and his manner was friendly again . " But like I told you , there 's nothing to worry about . It did n't happen . " " Okay " " Just keep a good thought like I 'm keeping . You got to admit , she was one helluva lay . " " Yes . " " You can thank me for opening her up . She was tight as a clam when I shoved it in there . But once I got in there , it was like going " Okay . " " You going straight home ? " " Straight home . " " See you tomorrow , then . See you when you get out of Knight 's Lit class . " " See you . " George Perkins left the car , and went up the apartmentbuilding steps two at a time , and disappeared inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed on the gas pedal . He pointed the Rover toward Veteran Avenue to take Sunset Boulevard to his home in the Pacific Palisades . It was the shortest way to get home , and he wanted to get home the shortest way , because he was alone and he could n't take being down a greased slide , and all her squealing and biting and hitting , I almost popped right off . It was great . " " It was great , " said Jerry , " if only ? " " Forget the rest of it , " said George . " You know my philosophy . Keep the good thoughts and jettison the garbage . Remember that , feller . "  | alone too long a time , not tonight , not the way he felt , which was sicker than before and still suicidal . But by the time he had reached Sunset Boulevard , and waited for the light to change , and spun the car left toward the Palisades , he knew something else . He was n't alone . The girl was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eighteen . Except she was n't squealing now , no , she was as still as a cadaver , and not uttering a sound and not moving at all . Jerry considered himself a visual person , because in his head whatever he thought of or remembered was mainly visual , in graphic pictures , not in a lot of wordy dialogue like other people said they had it . He wished he was alone now , but he was n't . He wished he was n't visual , but he was . It was there , that one picture that kept projecting itself inside his skull . The one picture that he took with his brain before he left , before George dragged him out of there . The girl lying flat on her back , stark naked on the rug beside the bed . She was lying spread-eagled , loose , the fleshy creamy thighs loose and apart so that what you saw most was that mound with the crease in between visible through the pubic hairs and looking like the slash of a woman 's lips turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other limp across her navel , and the little cream breasts flattened down , as if deflated , and the mouth hung open and the eyes shut and the red blood still trickling down from the scalp and tangled hair . That was the picture . He tried to turn it off , and did for a while , except that other pictures kept sliding into its place because he was visual . He could see them , George and himself with their Cokes , inside The Underground Railroad , their dance hangout on Melrose Avenue , and George hearing the girl saying to someone else she wished she had a ride to her place , and George striking up a conversation and saying that his friend had a car and where did she live because if it was n't too far out of the way they 'd be glad to drop her off . Her name was Sheri and she had an apartment  | with a roommate , Darlene , and it was just above Santa Monica Boulevard on Doheny Drive , so that was n't out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , she was in the back seat with George , and George kidded around , and her thigh was partially showing where her cotton dress had climbed up , and Jerry kept wanting to rip her clothes off and make love all night , imagining it , all visual , when suddenly George was getting out and she was getting out and George was signaling him and saying they 'd prove to her they were gentlemen and see her to her place upstairs . Another picture , upstairs , inside . She 'd got up to go to the bathroom that was off the bedroom . George winking , patting his crotch , saying no question she wanted it , whether she knew it or not , she was ripe for it , so maybe he 'd better wait for her in the bedroom , and when he was done Jerry could have her . Another picture , this of the bedroom door closing behind George . And of himself drinking from one of the cans of beer she 'd brought out . Then in a short while the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clothes on , big and hairy with that big wang hanging down the middle , and George grinning and saying , " Just wanted you to know I 'm still waiting to give her a little surprise . " That moment her voice , and George ducking back into the room , and her voice protesting , and something about Darlene , the roommate , and what sounded like scuffling . And then he himself jumping up and shutting the bedroom door tightly so 's not to hear them . Another picture , blurred . Except there was she naked on the bed now , and himself naked , and the moistness between her thighs and his hand clamping over her mouth . And then the picture of his getting up , getting his shorts and trousers , and her going after him , and his dropping his clothes and trying to bat her , and her jumping back , the rug going out from under her , and her falling , smashing her head against the sharp corner of the night table , then crumpling , sliding down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back . And then a montage of many pictures , this time with dialogue . George running in , his saying what in the hell did you do that for , and his own stuttering and stammering it was an accident .  | George 's saying for him to get dressed fast . George 's bending over her and saying what a mess and she 's out cold and thank God she 's alive and breathing . His dressing and wanting to telephone a doctor . George 's snatching the telephone from him , and saying is he crazy , taking a chance of getting themselves caught . His insisting on an anonymous call to a doctor , and George 's insisting no , making him finish dressing , telling him her roommate would be back any minute and would get the doctor and the girl 's all right and let 's get out of here while we can . The first picture again . Looking down once more at the nude , spread-eagled body . The rest of the pictures underexposed , no longer clear . Mostly with fragments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his car , George 's driving , and George 's saying you 're in no shape to go home yet , let 's go to The Garage , which was a real garage that George and some of the guys had rented and decorated as a kind of clubhouse for getting together and pot parties , and his saying whatever George wanted to do was okay with him . Walking to The Garage and George 's saying he had it figured out whatever happened it was going to be all right , because if Sheri was patched up and none the worse for it , she would n't talk , because then she 'd have to explain how she let herself be picked up , because after all there was no evidence anyone busted into her place to rape her , and if she was in serious shape or worse then she would n't be able to talk so that was that . Inside The Garage there were three of the guys , and two of the girls , regulars , and plenty of grass , and despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had himself a joint and inhaled it deeply and held the smoke and it settled him down a little , just a little , but not enough . After that he and George went for another long walk , until he could take the wheel himself and he took it to show he was better and then he drove George to his apartment . One last picture , again , again , the first one . The girl lying flat on her back , stark naked on the rug beside the bed , with the damp vaginal mound and the blood-clotted hair on her head . He had to pull himself together or he 'd be asking for trouble . He looked at the dashboard clock . It was almost midnight . His mother and father would be asleep . Probably Maggie too . He was safe .  | He twisted the wheel at the service station on the corner and left Sunset Boulevard , accelerating the car up the incline until he arrived at their driveway . Entering between the hedges , he turned off the car lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carport . His father 's Bentley S3 was already in its accustomed slot , and he eased his own car in beside it . Only when he had left the carport and started for the house entrance did he become aware that behind the drapes the living room was illuminated . His mother , an invalid , would be asleep , but his father might be having some friends in . More likely it was Maggie up late reading . He would have to be prepared for anyone . He would have to be controlled and normal . The pictures had left his mind , and he felt safer , more assured . Reaching the front door , he dropped his car keys into his coat pocket and dug down into his trouser pocket for the key ring , the fancy silver one with the shiny disk engraved with his name that Maggie had given him on his last birthday . He kept his car and house keys separate because Maggie and he shared the Rover and she was always misplacing her car keys and borrowing his . Standing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key ring . It was n't there . He tried the other pocket . Not there . Worriedly , he went through the pockets of his sport jacket . No key ring . A chill of apprehension swept his chest , and in that moment he felt panic . He heard a rustle from the hedgerow to his left , and suddenly the bright beam of a flashlight hit his face , and a rangy uniformed police officer loomed over him . In his free hand , the officer was holding up a gleaming silver disk from which dangled a chain , a metal ring , and a set of keys . " You looking for these , son ? " the officer asked . The beam of his flashlight dropped down to the disk and the ring , now lying in the palm of his hand . Jerry blinked at his name etched in scroll on the disk . " You 're Jerry Griffith , are n't you , young man ? " " Yes . " He began to shake uncontrollably , and he reached for the keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jerry looked up . " Where  --  where 'd you get them ? " " We found them , Jerry . We found them a couple hours ago . We found them on the floor of the bedroom on Doheny , right  | near the body of the young girl you 're suspected of having raped tonight . That was a rough one , Jerry . " " I did n't rape anyone ! " " No ? Well , her roommate , she found Miss Moore , and after she phoned for an ambulance , Miss Moore recovered consciousness for a half minute and she told her roommate that she 'd been raped , forcibly violated . She was in a coma when they took her to Ill 1 the hospital . Fractured skull . She 's in bad shape , Jerry . " " It was an accident , " Jerry blurted . " She slipped , and fell , and hit her head ? " i , " Or maybe somebody hit her head when she was resisting , eh , Jerry ? That 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until your attorney gets here . " The police officer looked past Jerry , and then Jerry heard the tread of someone else on the cement nearby . " Nat , " the officer called out , " this is the kid . Better frisk him . " He heard someone directly behind him , and then a pair of hands was expertly going through his pockets . The beam of the flashlight was again full on his face . " You alone in this ? " the police officer asked . " I ... I ... Yes , I was alone . Listen , let me ? " The police officer was looking past him once more . " What did you find , Nat ? " " Wallet . Small change . Another set of keys . Jackknife . " The police officer with the flashlight nodded . " Knife . Yeah , I expected something like that . They 've always got to have something like that when they try to rape a woman alone . " Jerry felt flushed and weak . " Listen  --  no  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  It 's got gadgets  --  scissors and ? " " And blades ? " finished the officer . " What 's the other set of keys for ? " " For the . . . for  --  for the car , my car . " " Hear that , Nat ? You better go through his vehicle with a finetooth comb . I 'll take him in the house now . Nat , meet us inside when you 've finished with his car . " He took Jerry by the arm . " We 're going inside , Jerry . " " No ! " " Do n't make any more trouble , young man . You 're in enough trouble for a lifetime already . Your family 's together in there wait-  | ing for you and waiting for the family attorney . You come along . When the charge is forcible rape , with injuries inflicted , you 're going to need all the help you can get . So let 's get moving , Jerry . In you go . " LUTHER YERKES UNSNAPPED the catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the watch over his dainty hand , and held it up before his tinted glasses . " Twelve-thirty , " he said . " I had no idea it was this late . I think we 've done as much as we can do in one meeting . " Elmo Duncan stood up , stretching , yawning . " I 'm bushed . " Underwood had returned his papers to his leather portfolio . " Well , I hope we accomplished something . " " Why do n't we meet again in a few days ? " said Irwin Blair , rising briskly . " We 've got a long enough list of new ideas we can kick around . " " I 'm too foggy to know whether we came up with anything constructive , " said Duncan . " But I appreciate it , the way you 're all pitching in . " Yerkes downed the last of his third armagnac . " We 're not going to give up , Elmo . " He suddenly cocked his head . " Is that the telephone at this hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , and then the muffled sound of the butler 's voice . " Probably my wife , " said Duncan with a short laugh . " Well , gentlemen , I 'd better be ? " The Scottish butler had materialized in the archway . " It is a telephone call for you , Mr. Duncan . " " See ? I told you , " said Duncan . " Chief of Police Patterson wishes to speak to you , Mr. Duncan , " the butler added . Duncan groaned . " That 's worse . That 's business . " " If you want to save yourself a walk , Elmo , you can take the call in here . Unless it might be private . We 've installed a microphone and loudspeaker  --  it 's called a Speakerphone  --  for conference calls here . " Yerkes pointed to two small green boxes , with the usual perforations over microphone and amplifier , that rested on the table between the armchairs .  | " It should n't be anything private . Turn it on and we 'll see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button on the microphone . Duncan nodded his thanks and then called out to the telephone microphone , " Hi , Tim . This is Elmo . What 's up ? " The reply crackled through the speaker . " Hate to bother you , Elmo . Nothing unusual , actually . Forcible rape on Doheny in West Hollywood . Victim sustained a head injury , is in a coma , got her over to Mount Sinai . Mostly routine , except some big game involved , so when the officers reported it I thought you might want to be notified . " " Who 's the big game , Tim ? " " Well , this twenty-one-year-old kid who did it  --  he 's confessed to the whole thing , that 's sewed up  --  but he 's the son of ? His father is Frank Griffith . " " The Griffith who has the advertising agencies ? " Duncan asked . " That 's the one . " Luther Yerkes had sprung to his feet , waving a hand at Duncan . " Elmo , ask the Chief if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of billing for me . I know Frank Griffith . I 'm sure it ca n't be the same ? " Duncan turned back to the microphone . " That was Mr. Yerkes , Tim . Did you hear him ? " The loudspeaker crackled . " I heard . Yes , it 's the Frank Griffith whose son ? " " I ca n't believe it , " said Yerkes . " Do you know who Frank Griffith is ? He 's up there with Benton and Bowles , Young and Rubicam , Doyle Dane Bernbach . He 's got one of the best reputations in the world . You remember , he was an Olympic hero  --  decathlon ? years ago . Today he 's one of the most respected men in the community . How could his son  --  it ca n't be his son . " Duncan bent toward the microphone . " You heard that , Tim . Are you positive this is Griffith 's boy ? " The Chief 's voice came on again . " My men apprehended the boy as he was returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph Polk , his attorney . And , as I said , the boy confessed to forcible rape . "  | Duncan glanced at Yerkes , then at the amplifier . " He confessed , fine . Any corroborating evidence ? " " The victim was a Miss Sheri Moore , eighteen . Her roommate was out and returned and found her semiconscious , and she said she 'd been raped , and the roommate called the police . Jerry Griffith  --  that 's the boy 's name  --  his keys , with a name disk , were found near the victim . He said he did it alone . We found a knife on him , so that 's probably true . We 've had a report from the hospital . The tests show she was entered , no question . The boy 's car was searched after he was apprehended . There was a cigarette butt with a trace of lipstick  --  the lab will test it in the morning  --  and , let me see  --  oh , yes , four books in the rear trunk , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the spare tire ? a dirty book  --  believe it or not , the book that made us haul in that bookseller in Oakwood this morning  --  what the devil was the title ? ? yes , The Seven Minutes  --  that was there , and then there was ? " " Tim , you mean you found that book in the Griffith boy 's car ? " " Yup . Hidden away under the spare . Anyway , I thought ? " Darting forward , Yerkes reached up and grabbed Duncan 's shoulder . " Elmo , tell him goodbye , tell him you 'll speak to him later , " he whispered urgently . " Let me shut that damn machine off . " Obeying , Duncan called out , " That covers it , Tim . Thanks for checking in . I 'll be in touch . Thanks a lot . " He freed himself from Yerkes ' grasp and pushed down the OFF button on the microphone . Yerkes , who was behaving as if he had St. Vitus ' dance , was pulling Underwood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he looked at Duncan with a strange excitement . " Elmo , Elmo , do n't you see it ? " Yerkes demanded . " I think so . The book  --  the boy  --  but I 'm not sure if we can ? " " I 'm sure ! I 'm positive ! " Yerkes shouted . " Griffith 's son , that poor kid , he did n't commit forcible rape and grave injury . He did n't do it and he 's not responsible for it . You know who is responsible ? You know the real criminal out there ? It 's that filthy , slimy book , The Seven Minutes . There 's your true criminal , the one that incited a decent boy from a good family to commit rape . There 's your clear-cut evidence of what sort of thing is driving youngsters berserk , sending them out into the streets like hordes  | of beasts to perpetrate the worst kind of criminal attacks . That vicious book , Elmo  --  there is your rapist ! " Underwood and Blair were bobbing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own assent with fervor . " By God , Luther , you 're right , you 're right , " gasped Duncan . " I think it 's possible to ? " Yerkes had whipped off his tinted glasses , and his eyes were fanatical dots . " Elmo , " he said , dropping his voice , " that little censorship arrest of yours this morning  --  it 's no longer the jewel theft  --  you know what it is ? ? it 's the irrevocable murder  --  the very act that can arouse millions in this state and country . Elmo , forget sleep and forget caution . You take yourself over to Frank Griffith 's place as fast as you can get there , and you take command personally . Because you know what  --  we 've finally got hold of the winner we 've been looking for  --  the big case , the big issue , the big image-maker , the biggest one possible . Pounce on it . Rip those rapemakers limb from limb . Protect the public from those lustprovoking books that lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made  --  we 've all got it made , Senator Elmo Duncan ! "  | HE HAD BEEN dreaming that he was basking in the Riviera sun on the deck of his white yacht anchored off Cannes , when a sudden explosion shredded the dream , dissolved it , and flung him back on his bed in West Los Angeles . Eyes closed , he could still hear the reverberations of the explosion , nearby but diminished in volume . His head cleared , and so the sound became clearer , and he realized that it was the ringing of his telephone . He opened his eyes , turned his head on the pillow , and saw that it was seven o'clock in the morning . He lifted himself on an elbow , and more to shut up the damn persistence of the telephone than to take a call , he reached for the receiver and brought it to his ear . If it was the wrong number , he would perform mayhem on someone . It was the right number . " Mr. Michael Barrett ? " The voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he croaked in his before-breakfast guttural . " Mr. Philip Sanford calling you from New York . One moment , please . " Clutching the receiver , he threw aside the blanket , sat up , and swung his legs off the bed . Philip Sanford came on . " Mike , sorry to wake you . I held off as long as I could . " He sounded agitated , and Barrett dimly wondered . " Never mind , Phil . Is anything ? ? "  | " Have you heard what happened last night out your way ? Have you seen this morning 's front pages ? " " No , not yet . " " Let me read you one of the headlines . It 's not the banner head , but it 's on the front page , which is bad enough . Here it is . " Sanford seemed to catch his breath , and then he read aloud , " Son of Prominent Ad Man Confesses to Rape ; Blames Allegedly Porno Book . ' Did you hear that ? It 's our book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's this all about ? " " Every newspaper is carrying it at length . And I 've had the television on . All the top news commentators are reporting it . You 'd think this is the first time rape had ever been committed . " " Phil , will you please tell me ? ? " " Sorry . I thought I was upset yesterday , but after this lousy break ! Some kid picked up an eighteen-year-old girl and gave her a ride to her apartment , and then he followed her in , and he held a knife over her and raped her . Apparently she tried to resist and he banged her head against something and she suffered a concussion and she 's in the hospital now , in a coma . Something dropped out of the boy 's pocket when he was trying to dress , and the police traced him and arrested him . Guess what was found hidden in the kid 's car ? You guessed . A copy of our edition of The Seven Minutes . Then the boy admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . In one of the wire stories  --  where is it ? ? anyway , he was quoted as saying , I read it and it got me all worked up . Then something sort of snapped in my head and I guess I went crazy . ' And later on he said , Yes , that novel , that 's what incited me to do what I did . " " Those last words , I 'm sure they 're not his own , " said Barrett . " The word incited , ' that 's not a boy 's word . That 's a police word or press agent 's language . It sounds to me like the boy is being coached . " " But he did it , he plainly did it , and there was our book in his car . " " I 'm not questioning that . I meant something else . I meant how the facts are being handled . Never mind . Anyway ? " " Mike , I think we 're in the soup . I 'm worried . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want it . But not this kind . It 'll turn everyone against us . Wesley R. has been trying to get me on the  | phone all morning . One of the few times my .. my . . . my father has ever acknowledged I 'm alive . I wo n't answer . I make them say I 'm out . " " The boy , the one who violated the girl , what 's his background ? " " Ideal background , the best kind of upbringing . Do you want me to read you the stories ? " " I think you 'd better . At least the wire stories . " For the next five minutes , in an unsteady voice , Sanford read the newspaper stories to Barrett . When he had finished he said , " There you have it . I do n't know why it 's getting such a play , except maybe because the boy is Frank Griffith 's son  --  prominent family . " " No , " said Barrett , " that 's not it . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookseller for purveying an obscene book . Each act , separate , isolated , would not be news . In juxtaposition , tied together , they appear to make real news and they appear to refute the well-known pronouncement once made by Mayor James J. Walker . " " What do you mean ? " " Jimmy Walker was supposed to have said , I never knew of a girl who was made pregnant by a book . ' Actually , I think the verbatim version is I never knew a girl who was ruined by a book . " " Yes , I 've heard that . ' " " Well , here there seems to be an actual situation that refutes that statement . The press has put a case together . Very neat . The cause  --  a book inciting a boy to attack a girl . The effect  --  a girl ruined by a book . That is news . " Sanford had become increasingly agitated . " All I care about is how this affects us . What does it do to that arrest of Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your District Attorney , did n't you ? " " I did , but one question at a time , " Barrett said calmly . He was trying to think it out . " First , as to how this affects our efforts on behalf of Ben Fremont and your book . I stated that the press was trying to couple two separate events and make them one . I stated that that is what made it news . True . It is news , but it is not evidence . One crime has nothing to do with the other , in a strictly legal sense . Forget the press . Let 's concern ourselves with the law . Ben Fremont was arrested for purveying obscene reading matter .  | That 's one thing . Jerry Griffith was arrested for forcibly violating and injuring a girl . That 's another thing . Under the law , Jerry Griffith 's reading habits have nothing to do with the charges against Fremont . The fact of Griffith 's reading The Seven Minutes is not relevant and is immaterial to the charge that The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 311 of the California Criminal Code . The Fremont case cerned . " " But we 're not up against the law alone , " protested Sanford . " What about public opinion ? " There was the big question , Barrett knew , and he had considered it and anticipated it . But it was too early to answer that one . Perhaps he would have the answer later , even later this day , but he did not have it yet . " We 'll cross that bridge when we get to it , " he said . " Right now let 's confine ourselves to the law , which is what we have to contend with . This brings me to your second question . Did I see District Attorney Elmo Duncan about the Fremont case ? I did , Phil . He was friendly and cooperative . He agreed that the whole censorship business and the arrest were a nuisance , and he made it clear he was no more interested in a costly , time-consuming trial than we were . He wanted to know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found our request acceptable . We were to have Ben Fre- I mont plead guilty , and then it would be arranged that Fremont be fined the twenty-four hundred dollars and be given a year 's sentence which would be suspended . Your book would not be sold in Oakwood , which is an unincorporated area in Los Angeles County , but you 'd be free to place the book on sale elsewhere in Los Angeles County . " " Was it settled , then ? " " No , not quite . That 's why I postponed calling you back . I wanted it all wrapped up . It 's virtually settled . When I left the District Attorney , he asked simply for time to discuss our compromise with his staff , as a gesture of courtesy . He told me to call him today and he 'd make his acceptance official . That is where we stand . " " Past tense , Mike , " said Sanford . " That is where we stood  --  yesterday . Maybe today 's another day . "  | will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law is con " Phil , I can only repeat , under the law nothing has changed since yesterday . Duncan 's certainly as smart an attorney as I am , and maybe smarter . He knows that a case of forcible rape is utterly immaterial to the 311 charge against Fremont . He will deal with the Fremont affair on its own merits . And if he does so , as I believe he will , he 'll stand by our agreement of yesterday . I 'm fairly confident about that . " There was a woosh of air in the telephone receiver . Sanford had obviously sighed with his relief . " Thanks , Mike . I feel much better ... Only one thing . My secretary keeps sticking memos under my nose . Our sales department is starting to get a steady stream of inquiries from booksellers around the country wanting to know what we 're going to do about this prosecution of the book . I 'd like to be able to tell them that there 's nothing to worry about , that we got Fremont off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book . The sooner we can say that , the better . Can you settle this whole business today ? " " I intend to , " said Barrett . " I was supposed to phone the District Attorney . I think it would be better if I drove downtown and saw him in person for a few minutes . Besides , it 's to my advantage , too , to get this out of the way as soon as possible . I told you yesterday that I left Thayer and Turner , and that I had something much bigger coming up . Well , it 's a vice-presidency with Osborn Enterprises . " " Why , that 's great , Mike ! Congratulations . " " Thanks . Anyway , I 'm settling that tonight , and part of the deal is that I start right in on the new job . So I want to get this censorship nuisance out of the way as quickly as you do . And I expect to . I 'll call you later today , the second it 's settled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home with the Griffiths , it had seemed to Maggie Russell that the world had somehow ceased revolving on its axis . It was as if all life had come to a standstill . One day succeeded another so quickly , smoothly , without change , each new day as uniform as the last , that one hardly felt the passage of a month or of a season . While it was not truly living , she suspected , it was a peaceful way of existence that she welcomed in this period of her youth . After the frenzy and insecurity of her earlier years , losing first her father and being  | uprooted from Minnesota , then losing her mother and being uprooted from Ohio , and then living with relatives in Alabama , and then trying to find jobs that would support her and still give her time for a college education in North Carolina and Massachusetts , it was wonderful to have one haven where there were routine and regularity and the days came and went in a soft blur and you could wake and sleep mindless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie reflected , as she sat unobtrusively on the bench in the bay window of the Griffith living room , observing all the activity and tension going on before her eyes . The sudden , unexpected change in the routine and life of the household was what had jolted her so . Not that it had always been so easy to adjust to others , even relatives , especially one as highly regarded and demanding as her Uncle Frank ( although her Aunt Ethel and cousin Jerry were paragons of kindness and for them she had an unshakable affection ) , but as households went , as far as she knew or had known , this one had been a comfortable cocoon with each bright day as predictable as the next . Yet overnight this world had been turned upside down and set spinning uncontrollably . Yesterday , at this hour , this room had been quiet and restful . Today it was a small madhouse overcharged with emotion and danger . Or , she wondered , had it always been this way , at least in its potential , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had wanted something perfect ? Besides herself , there were five of them in the living room , seated in a ragged circle , chattering incessantly . Beyond them , at the foot of the staircase and near the home elevator , which had been installed several years ago for Aunt Ethel after she was no longer ambulatory , was the empty wheelchair . Maggie was grateful that it was empty , and that her aunt had been put to bed by the doctor and heavily sedated . Her aunt would have been made more distraught by this scene  --  last night , with the police , later with the District Attorney , had been bad enough  --  as Maggie herself had been made distraught seeing Jerry , so troubled and frightened , amidst all those men , returning from the first arraignment fifteen minutes ago .  | Carefully Maggie Russell studied the men in the room . Two were strangers to her , although one bore a name that she had often seen in print and had heard her uncle mention . She had been introduced to them both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had seen either one in this house . One stranger , the one whose name she had known , was Luther Yerkes . She was fascinated by his weird physique and dress , and by his legend . She sensed , also , his importance to her uncle from the way Frank Griffith , usually brusque and authoritative and overwhelming , now showed deference to the industrialist . She tried to gauge the motives behind Griffith 's deference . Was it because Yerkes was one of Griffith Advertising 's major accounts ? Or was it because a man of such wealth and influence had come forward to assist a business friend in an hour of distress ? To Maggie , no Pollyanna , Luther Yerkes appeared a philanthropist with his money , but not the type who was also a philanthropist with his time . Yet she had heard him say , not ten minutes ago , that he was determined to do everything he could for Frank Griffith 's son and everything he could to prosecute the real criminal  --  namely , that polluted book . Seated beside Yerkes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black-covered notebook , was the one who had been introduced as Yerkes ' public-relations adviser . She had n't caught his first name  --  she thought it was Irving or Irvin or maybe Irwin ? but she remembered that the last name was Blair . His hair looked like a rummage sale . His voice was a trombone . He was the other stranger , and she could not discern his exact role here . In the center was one she had seen before from time to time , the family attorney , Ralph Polk , who always came with a Homburg ( in California ! ) and wore bow ties and starched collars and was restrained and archconservative . Then there was her Uncle Frank , usually a dynamo , now unnaturally quiet , steadily chewing the end of an unlighted cigar . Frank Griffith had cowed her from the first day of her arrival here . It was not merely his success . In the Russell family  --  her Aunt Ethel was a Russell , and was Maggie 's mother 's sister  --  it was known that Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bride 's well-invested savings . Her own mother 's savings , Maggie had long ago guessed , had been largely squandered  | by her father , and what remained had been unsuccessfully invested , and when Maggie had been orphaned the Griffith family i , had had to contribute to the cost of her mother 's funeral . But Frank Griffith had used his wife 's money well , parlaying that , and his athlete 's fame as an Olympic hero , to rise and to establish the advertising agency that now had headquarters on Madison Avenue and growing branch offices in Chicago and Los Angeles . Although Maggie 's job was mainly to serve as her aunt 's social secretary and companion , she occasionally did some late-night typing at home for her uncle , and she knew that his agency had billings of over eighty million dollars a year , of which seven million dollars came from the Yerkes account . It was not this part of Frank Griffith that had cowed Maggie from the start . It was his Herculean energy and his incredible selfassurance ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that he was wrong ) . In his personal gym , among the framed photographs and trophies attesting to his physical prowess , were sets of barbells , and to these he devoted himself religiously every morning . Then there was his golf and his tennis and his horses at the ranch near Victorville and his private Lear jet plane . And his constant movement : clubs and banquets and social dinners in Los Angeles , as well as constant commuting to Chicago , to New York , to London . It was enough to make any mere mortal , reflected Maggie , feel as small and inadequate as Toulouse-Lautrec . Physically , anyway . She watched him now , the freshly trimmed pompadour , the beefy florid yet firm face , the husky body in a lightweight charcoal flannel suit , the big hands with the gold signet ring dominating one . There he was , the stem , driving taskmaster in his business , the outgoing community-minded citizen in his city , Everyman 's vision of the perfect self-made success , perfect husband , perfect father . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an heir who had been aberrant and weak and had jeopardized not only himself but the entire family 's standing . Now Frank Griffith was all concern , and Maggie posed for herself some Socratic questions : Was his concern the result of a paternal confusion about V i , ll what had gone wrong with an only son so well brought up ? Was his concern pragmatic and concentrated on what this scandal  | would do to his business and his position in the country ? Or was it , finally , a concern that was fatherly and protective over the fate of his heir ? Maggie knew him well , but not intimately , and never had known him in crisis , so she could not know the answer for sure . And , finally , there was the one about whom she asked herself no questions . The heir . It was Jerry , the Griffith whom she knew the best and cared for the most , who held her attention now . He was seated on a ladder-back side chair , anxious and nervous , crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . She knew the numbers , but numbers lied . Jerry was twenty-one , and she was twenty-four , but to her he was always ten years younger and she was ten years older . To her he was a boy and she was a woman . He was bright but shy and withdrawn . He was a maze of uncertainties and problems ( like most of his contemporaries , she had always assumed ) . His mother was too devoted to her own illness and suffering , his father was too busy , his friends were too fickle , to provide him with the confidant he needed . Because Maggie was quiet , understanding , tolerant , sometimes wise , and always appreciative of his self-deprecating style and dry sense of humor , she had become his confidant and closest friend . Actually , not friend merely , but sort of mother-father and counselor and sounding board . She had thought that she knew Jerry inside out , better than anyone on earth knew him , yet she had been totally unprepared for his behavior last night . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his violently forcing himself upon a girl . It was not as if he were a freak or psychotic or unattractive to girls . He was five feet nine and on the skinny side  --  which made him seem smaller than he truly was when compared to the bronzed Brobdingnagian Southern California boys who were his college companions  --  but still he could be appealing . She continued to study him . His chestnut-brown hair was as neatly parted as ever . His pensive ascetic face now looked more sallow and consumptive than usual because anxiety had eaten into it . But he could be attractive , and he did date , usually doubledated , so it was not that . What evil spirit had possessed him to  | attack that nobody of a girl ? It was the book , his father had bell lowed last night . It was the book , the District Attorney had agreed last night . And Jerry had admitted , finally , the lewd fantasies that the book had provoked . It was difficult for her to believe that a book , any book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating such malevolence . But there was the fact of his having read the book and having admitted how it had overstimulated him , and only he could know the truth about that , and so she believed him . Furthermore , at some point in the night it had developed that because of the book 's influence upon him there might be more sympathy for Jerry and this would mitigate his punishment . For Maggie , this pushed all other possible motivations aside and suspended any disbelief . She was sorry for Jerry . Yet she was also sorry for the book that had betrayed them both . She stared at Jerry , and it was still impossible . Rapists looked like rapists , she had always believed from the newspaper accounts and grainy pictures . A rapist was supposed to look  --  what ? ? mean , deprived , sick , warped . Yet Jerry still resembled Jerry , the same boy with whom she had enjoyed so many secret jokes and with whom she had read and discussed Alice in Wonderland and Hermann Hesse and Vivekananda . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory Jerry had quoted , " If a man does not keep pace with his companions , perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer . " Yet , if not in their private talks , at least in his public behavior Jerry had never given indication of hearing a different drummer . Then what drummer had Jerry heard last night ? A drummer named J J Jadway , Jerry had said . That was the drummer . Poor Sheri whateverhername was , poor Sheri in the hospital . And poor Jerry , poor Jerry . This was a case without criminals . Only victims . She wondered what would happen to him , and then she realized she had wondered because she was hearing someone in the room speculate on that with a rhetorical question . It was Ralph Polk , the family lawyer , speaking . Maggie gave him her full attention . " Let me summarize the procedure once more , " Polk was saying . " Last night , when we went to the station , Jerry was booked , and I  | arranged the bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment under circumstances of extreme emotion , he is still innocent until proved guilty . What I am trying to say is that the law still gives us options , choices , and I intend to take advantage of these choices and go through all the necessary steps , until we are certain that Jerry really wants to plead guilty . " " You are saying he can still plead not guilty ? " asked Frank Griffith . " Absolutely . Let me explain . In a case like this there is a first arraignment . Thanks to the accommodation of our cooperative District Attorney , we were able to have that this morning . You saw what happened . The Deputy District Attorney read the charges against Jerry , and a date was set for the preliminary hearing . Now , the purpose of this next step , the preliminary hearing , is for the court to determine whether the prosecution has a sufficient case against the defendant to warrant bringing him to trial . Should we take this step , the District Attorney would present a portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibits , witnesses , and so forth . I would have the right to question these witnesses if I decided to do so . Now , at this hearing , if the judge is satisfied with the prosecution 's evidence , he would order Jerry bound over for trial . Step three would be a second arraignment . Jerry would be asked whether he pleads guilty or not guilty . If he pleaded guilty , he would be sentenced several weeks later . If he pleaded not guilty , the case would be placed on the court 's calendar for trial . As you know , if he pleads guilty , his sentence can be anywhere from three years to life in prison , in a state prison . The judge has considerable leeway here . Under certain circumstances , the sentence might be a minimum one . Under others , let us say if the young lady , Miss Moore , sustained permanent injuries , the sentence , the penalty , might be the maximum . Now , then ? " " I wo n't do it ! " Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? I already said I did what I did to her ! " Frank Griffith turned on his son angrily . " Be quiet , will you ? Do n't interrupt . " Maggie had leaped to her feet , an instinctive need to come between them , to protect Jerry , but then she saw Jerry looking  | breathlessly at his father , the others , and finally controlling himself . Polk half turned in his chair , and began to address himself to Jerry , but also seemed to include the frowning Luther Yerkes . " I was about to explain , and I shall now , why I had suggested we take advantage of every step that is open to us . I know the procedure is trying , Jerry , but there are reasons for doing this . I am your father 's attorney , and now I am your attorney , and I want to do the best I can for you . Allow me to elaborate on my strategy . First , as an attorney , I have been involved in too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stress immediately following a seemingly criminal act , behaving out of confusion and remorse , may confess to anything and insist he is guilty . After the cooling off period , the client will frequently be less sure , or even come to realize he was not guilty . Then we have a chance ? " " I am guilty and I said I 'm guilty , " Jerry persisted . " Jerry , I 'm warning you , if you do n't shut up ? " Frank Griffith began . " It 's all right , Frank , " said Polk patiently . " Let me try to make him understand . " He spoke directly to Jerry now . " Yes , much of this may seem foolish to you , like playing out a losing game . Jerry , I 'm not saying we are going to plead you not guilty and put you on trial . I was only trying to point out that the option exists and it is worth considering . The District Attorney does n't want a trial , either . He 's overloaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him and expense for the taxpayers . But we can play on this , make him believe we might welcome a trial , and it would put us in a better position to make a deal for a lighter sentence . Yes , I agree with you that , as things stand , a not-guilty plea not only would be dishonest but would be futile . A trial would be a wasted effort , and I would n't put you through such an ordeal if you did n't have a chance of winning . The truth is  --  and this is between us  --  I intend to plead you guilty at the second arraignment . Because my real reason for stretching this out , putting you through a hearing , is based on quite another strategy , one that developed out of a brief private conversation I had with District Attorney Duncan last night and one I had with Mr. Yerkes this morning . And this ? this is important . "  | Yerkes nodded . " This is for your benefit , Jerry . I suggest you listen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Behind closed doors , the District Attorney can have great influence upon the judge who will pass sentence after a guilty plea for rape . Now , District Attorney Duncan and Mr. Yerkes are of one mind  --  that you were victimized by the salacity of The Seven Minutes . They feel the true criminal is the book , its influence on young impressionable readers . They are prosecuting that book under California state law . They feel that the public will be able to see that if such books were not available to young people like yourself , many acts of violence , such as this rape , might never be committed . In short , you were temporarily inflamed , incited , by that book . Now , we need time to let this sink into the public mind . If it does , it will create an atmosphere much more favorable to you , and we can have hopes that this would influence the judge to pass a more moderate sentence in your case . That is why I want you to suffer through the preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " Jerry sat up and shook his head , and kept shaking it . " Mr. Polk ? Mr. Polk , I do n't care about the sentence or what happens to me . I do n't care any more . " Polk smiled sympathetically . " I understand , Jerry . You 've been through a good deal , and I would expect that to be your mood at the moment . " He turned to Frank Griffith . " Which brings up another point , Frank . Considering Jerry 's condition , I would recommend  --  oh , we can let Jerry help us decide about this , but I would recommend that we add one more aspect to the case , to mitigate any future sentence . I would like to claim that this criminal act was totally opposed to your son 's nature . Therefore , I would like to offer as a defense that Jerry was not legally sane when he allegedly committed the crime . This will require the services of a top psychiatrist  --  one like Dr. Roger Trimble . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Frank Griffith . " Do you think you can get Dr. Trimble to see him ? " " Dr. Trimble is a friend of mine and of Mr. Yerkes ' . I think ? " " No ! " It was Jerry , and this time he was on his feet , trembling . " Maybe I 'll do the other things , but I wo n't let any head-shrinker ? " Griffith stood up , towering over his son .  | Seeing this , Maggie felt herself recoil . But then , to her surprise , Griffith 's tone was conciliatory for the first time . " Jerry , we 're here to help you in every way humanly possible , " said Frank Griffith . " I 'm determined to take advantage of anything that can improve your position . " " Yes , I know , Father , but I ca n't ? " " Ralph Polk knows the law . If he says your seeing a psychiatrist can help you with the judge ... " Polk had also come to his feet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The judge will take into consideration the fact that you 've never before been involved in any crime whatsoever . So he 'll assign a probation officer to look into your background , obtain whatever information he can about you from your family , teachers . When the probation officer reports that Dr. Trimble is treating you  --  an analyst of his reputation  --  that could cut a great many corners and influence recommendations of the probation officer . " Jerry was shaking his head once more . Mr. Polk , no  --  I ca n't  --  I do n't want any psychoanalyst . No matter what you think , I 'm not crazy . It was just a  --  a temporary thing . Even the District Attorney said so last night . He agreed it was that book , that 's all . " Polk shrugged . " Of course , nobody can force you to see an analyst , Jerry . But I think it would be a smart move . " Frank Griffith stepped forward and placed an arm around his son while addressing Polk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be made to realize what 's best for him . You go ahead and contact Dr. Trimble and make any arrangements you can . Now , Jerry , I think you 've taken about enough . Why do n't you go upstairs and lie down a while ? Take one of those sedatives , and rest . We can handle what 's left to be done without putting you through any more . " Jerry stared up at his father , suddenly broke away , and without another word to anyone he went hastily out of the room and toward the staircase . Maggie 's eyes followed him . As the men in the room began to settle down in their places again and light their cigarettes and cigars , Maggie started to drift toward the hallway . Once out of their sight , she went as fast as she could'up the stairs . She caught Jerry on the second-floor landing .  | He waited , tried to smile , failed . " ? I 'm sorry they had to put you through that . " He remained silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful in their way , " she said . Jerry 's hands worked nervously at his sweater . " I do n't care about anyone being helpful . I did something wrong , crazy , and I deserve to be punished , so let them punish me . But I do n't want to go through extra torture besides . I do n't want to go in any courtrooms  --  this morning was enough , the last time  --  and have lawyers and judges picking my brains in front of the whole world , and I do n't want any psychiatrists picking the rest of my brains . I just want them all to leave me alone . " " All right , Jerry . " " Those things  --  it 's like making me open my fly in public . " " I know . " " I did wrong , so let them punish me and leave me alone . I just want to be left alone . I do n't mean you , Maggie , but all the rest of them . I just want to be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face , and then he said , " You understand . Can you make them understand , Maggie ? " " I  --  I can try . I will try . Maybe not today . But at the right time . " " Thanks . . . . I guess I am feeling lousy . Maybe I 'd better lie down . " " Rest , if you can . You need it . " " Oka " Y ? He turned away and started for his bedroom . When he was inside it , Maggie returned to the staircase . Slowly , thoughtfully , she descended . At the bottom , she could hear the conversation which was continuing in the living room . She was drawn toward the voices . She walked softly to the entrance of the room and stood watching and listening . They were too engrossed to note her presence . Ralph Polk was nodding agreement to something Luther Yerkes had said , and then Polk was saying , " Yes , Mr. Yerkes , there is no question about that , no question at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Jerry 's behalf . It is , as you say , the key factor in our case . For that reason alone , if there were not another , I would want the boy in therapy with Dr. Trimble .  | In a few sessions , I am almost certain , Dr. Trimble could learn about and evaluate the trauma that Jerry suffered during and after his reading of The Seven Minutes . This would be invaluable for us . " He offered Yerkes a brief smile . " And I am sure it would be invaluable for our District Attorney , should he prosecute the book . " Yerkes ' eyes were masked behind the tinted spectacles , and his rotund face remained bland . " I suppose that might be so , but I have no idea what Elmo Duncan plans to do . However ? " he rose to his feet , and immediately Blair stood up beside him ? " I can tell you what I plan to do , " said Yerkes . " Being here in this house , seeing firsthand what havoc and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent family , upon a community , by a piece of slime disguised as literature , has convinced me more than ever to dedicate myself to the proposition that unless we have censorship in this country we will have chaos and increasing violence . I have your pledge that you will join in this fight , not merely because it is beneficial to your own case , but because it is beneficial to the future of our society and to the cause of justice . " " You have my pledge , Mr. Yerkes , " said Griffith fervently . " And you have mine , " said Yerkes . " From this moment on , I am going to devote every energy and resource at my command to rid this community and our country of those mind-corrupting , soul-destroying smut peddlers . Do you know what we 're going to do together ? We are going to throw the book at them  --  their book at them  --  and drive the avaricious moneychangers and rapemakers out of the temple forever ! " SOMEHOW , MIRE BARRETT was not surprised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that their meeting would be short and simple . Elmo Duncan had clearly set the time limits a few seconds ago when he had buzzed his secretary and told her to hold off all calls for three or four minutes and to tell persons waiting for their appointments that he would be only a few minutes late . Driving to the Hall of Justice , Barrett had felt a small hope rekindle , justifying his optimism td Sanford on the long-distance telephone earlier . He had been confident that Duncan would deliver on yesterday 's promise , and that the new development con-  | cerning The Seven Minutes would not influence the prosecutor 's original soft attitude toward prosecution of the bookseller . Barrett had been led from the receptionist 's office , past the District Attorney 's private kitchen , to the room where Duncan 's personal secretary waited . She had shown him into Duncan 's spacious , light , modernistic office . Barrett had noted that the doorway to the District Attorney 's comfortable lounge was open , and wondered briefly whether Duncan would escort him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the two leather armchairs facing the broad , handsome Swedish desk . This meant business . No civilities . Barrett 's hope began to flicker and fade . Now Barrett could see plainly that this was not the same man who had received him so amiably yesterday . Duncan 's features were taut , as if repressing impatience . The American flag draped from a pole behind his high-backed swivel chair seemed to be growing straight out of his head . Nervously the District Attorney fiddled with some papers on his desk , glanced at the telephone and the water carafe at his elbow , then at the impressively bound books lining the shelves beyond , and finally , reluctantly , he gave his attention to Barrett . " I did n't expect you to drop by in person , " he said . " I understood you were going to phone me . I  --  I 'm afraid I 've got a rather crowded calendar . " Duncan offered nothing further . He waited . " I thought it would be easier this way , " said Barrett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle the Ben Fremont matter . " " Yes . " The District Attorney was giving him nothing , and Barrett realized he would have to recognize the new development and tackle it without subterfuge . " I 've seen the newspapers , of course . About the Griffith boy . And about the Jadway book . Are the stories accurate ? Is that what happened ? " " They are accurate . " " I see . From the tone taken by the press , one might conclude that the shade of J J Jadway had committed the rape . " Duncan found a Spanish-made letter opener on his desk and picked it up . He contemplated the opener . It was designed in the shape of a sword . Without looking up , Duncan said , " In this office  | we are handling the Fremont case as one case and the Griffith case as another and separate crime . The press is not trying these cases , Mr. Barrett . My office is trying them . " Barrett remained cautious . " Are you telling me , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , and you are as objective about the Fremont matter as you were yesterday ? " The Toledo blade of the letter opener glittered as it turned slowly in the District Attorney 's hand . " I 'm telling you no such thing , " said Duncan . " I am telling you that under the law we are treating each case separately and judging each on its own evi- dence . F We are perfectly aware that these are two cases . Conversely , we are also aware that in the court of public opinion they may become one case . " " Are you suggesting that public opinion can prejudice your handling of these cases as separate cases ? " Duncan leaned forward , resting his elbows on his desk blotter . His eyes narrowed . " Mr. Barrett , here we have charges against the seller of an obscene book . Here , also , we have charges against a youth who has committed forcible rape and inflicted grave injury and whose criminal act was incited by a reading of the very same book . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been instantaneous and passionate . While a lawenforcement agency need not be responsive to every public whim , it can be responsive when the public 's demands coincide with its own activities . You must never forget , Mr. Barrett , the law is an instrument of the public , created by the public to protect itself . And whatever else I am , Mr. Barrett , I am a public servant . " Barrett sat very still . The lecture , delivered to him as if he were a schoolboy , had been pretentious and even condescending . It camouflaged any possible motivation of politics . It was doubletalk. ' ll Barrett was no longer in a mood to be winning . " Yesterday , Mr. Duncan , performing as a public servant , you were prepared to serve the law and the public by treating the charge against Ben Fremont as a minor , an even debatable , infraction of the law . You practically assured me that if I would enter a plea of guilty for ' II Fremont you would see to it that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you 'd let it go at that . You wanted only the time to explain this to your staff , as a matter of courtesy . Now  | I am here for your official decision . A fine and a suspended sentence . Is that still your intention ? " The District Attorney threw down the sword-shaped opener . " I 'm afraid not , " he said . " I have consulted my staff . Since yesterday , we have acquired new evidence against The Seven Minutes . I 've looked into the book a little more closely , and into the specific charge , illuminated as it is by this new evidence , and I have become convinced that we are dealing not with a mere felony but with a crime that could have widespread effects in endangering public safety . " " Are you referring to a widespread rash of rape ? " said Barrett dryly . Duncan was not amused . " I am referring to the distribution of a menacing work of obscenity entitled The Seven Minutes . " He stared coldly across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you plead Ben Fremont not guilty we will prosecute the defendant to the very limit of our ability . We will go to trial and employ every resource at our command to prove the defendant , and the book , if you will , guilty as charged . However , if you prefer to enter a plea of guilty , then the defendant will receive the maximum punishment possible for his offense  --  the fine as well as twelve months in jail . No deals , no compromises , Mr. Barrett . " And no longer any fear of Barrett 's friendship with Willard Osborn II , thought Barrett . The District Attorney spoke from strength . Obviously , he had a richer , more influential , more powerful patron than Osbom . " And the two cases , " said Barrett , " you still intend to treat them separately ? " " They are separate cases , " said Duncan with a show of ingenuous innocence . " Of course , " he added , " if we go to trial over the book , we may be forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Material witness , Mr. Duncan ? " " When a young man in his impressionable years is , by his own admission , inspired to commit a heinous crime because of the contents of a book he has just read , I would suggest that this is relevant to our contention that the book is evil and should be banned and that purveying such a book is a criminal act . Oh , yes , I be-  | lieve anything Jerry Griffith might tell us about this book , about what it has done to him , is very material to our case . " Involuntarily Barrett shook his head . He wanted to voice his objection . But this was not a court of law . And the District Attorney had , by a circuitous route , arrived before him with two separate cases that now resembled one case . A public servant , Barrett thought bitterly , responding to the public 's command . Or , possibly , to Luther Yerkes ' command . No , Barrett thought , he would not give the District Attorney such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I gather , then , that this is your last word ? " said Barrett . " Yes , " said Duncan . But he made no move to rise . " And now I 'd like your last word , Mr. Barrett . What plea do you intend to enter  --  guilty or not guilty ? " " If the decision were mine alone , I could make it now . " Barrett stood up . " I 'll have to consult with my client in New York . " Rising , Duncan said evenly , " I am sure you 'll make it clear to him that there can be no compromise . If the plea is guilty , Fremont lands in jail for a year , and the book is guilty and will not be sold in Oakwood  --  as a starter . If the plea is not guilty , then that gives you the only chance to see that the seller and ? " he gave the last careful emphasis " ? the book  --  could possibly go free . But you 'll have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make it clear , " said Barrett . You bet your ass I 'll make it clear , he thought , I 'll make it damn clear to Phil Sanford that we 're not giving those bastards a chance for a Roman holiday and a publicity circus at our expense . He went to the door and opened it . " You 'll hear from me this afternoon . " Standing behind his desk , more relaxed now , Elmo Duncan smiled for the first time . " I 'll be waiting , " he said . BECAUSE THERE WAS no time to waste , and because Phil Sanford was standing by to hear from him , Mike Barrett had decided to telephone New York at once . Not willing to trust the telephones in the Hall of Justice building , he had gone swiftly up Temple Street to the magnificent Hall of Records and located an empty telephone booth inside . While there had been no delay in placing his long-distance call , and Sanford had been informed of it at once , it had taken  | the publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . Sanford 's dilatory treatment of a call he had earlier deemed so important at first confused and then irked Barrett . When at last Sanford had picked up the receiver at his end , absently apologizing for making his friend wait and explaining that his office had become busier than Grand Central Station , Barrett had cut him short and plunged into the business at hand . Hardly permitting Sanford to interrupt him with a question or comment , Barrett had launched into a monologue reporting the details of the exchange between the District Attorney and himself and the perfidy of Duncan 's complete turnabout . More explicitly than even Duncan might have hoped , Barrett had articulated the alternatives and then the legal consequences of both a guilty and a not-guilty plea . In the claustrophobic confines of the telephone booth , Barrett had been speaking nonstop to Sanford for several minutes now , and he was not yet through . " So what does this add up to ? " Barrett asked , posing the question almost as if to seek clarification for himself . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let me give you my firm advice . Duncan was practically drooling to have me tell him we 'd plead not guilty and go to trial . He wants the courtroom as a stage from which he can dramatize the issue and impress his crusading image on the public . And he 's got the script for it . One with great mass appeal . I 'm not saying he 's a phony and nothing more . I want to be fair about him . Evidently he is sincere in his feeling that a novel like The Seven Minutes can do incalculable harm . True , he did n't feel that strongly yesterday . But he feels the Griffith rape is a practical demonstration of the antisocial behavior that can be generated by a mere book . I 'm certain that he believes this . God knows , he 's righteous enough . At the same time , you know my cynicism about righteousness . Poke any saint deeply enough , and you touch self-interest . The fact remains that with the Griffith boy as his star witness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellectual and becomes an emotional carnival with wide public appeal . He can make his name nationally famous from that courtroom , if he can pull it off . And he is positive he can pull it off . And , quite frankly , I 'm inclined to agree with him . " " What are you saying , Mike ? You mean you think he can win ? "  | Barrett moved closer to the mouthpiece . " I 'll be blunt with you . Yes , based on the little we know now , the odds would heavily favor the prosecution . I know that I told you this morning we were dealing with one case , a censorship case , and the Griffith rape has nothing to do with it legally . That 's still correct . Duncan admits it . But this session I just had with him made me realize to what extent other forces are at work  --  public opinion and public pressure  --  the determination to introduce the Griffith boy into the case by the side door , as a witness  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that climate , they could probably succeed in making both cases seem one case . If they did , it would be almost impossible to obtain a not-guilty verdict from a judge or a jury . How in heaven 's name do you defend a case like this ? You say this book is a work of art and you invoke the Constitution and freedom of the press for a work of art . For their part , they merely point to that pathetic girl in a coma in the hospital who has just been raped by someone who says he was driven to it by your work of art . How would you judge those arguments ? Take my advice . You absolutely can not plead not guilty and risk a trial . The unfavorable publicity and the almost inevitable loss of the case will get your book banned in every major city in America . You 'll be through , Phil ? " " Hold it , Mike , listen , I ? " " Let me finish , " said Barrett sharply . " You do as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'll understand . He wo n't want to go through all the pretrial preparations with the accompanying agitation and notoriety . He 's ten times better off if he pleads guilty . His fine will be paid for him . And the year in jail , well , it 's not fun , but it 's not the guillotine either , and you can compensate him for it in some way . Once you 've had him plead guilty , you 've pulled the tent down on Duncan 's circus and you 've guaranteed some future to the book . The Fremont sentence will be kicked around for a while in the press , but with nothing new to keep it in the public eye it 'll sink out of sight forever . If there are other prosecutions elsewhere , at least they wo n't be linked to rape . When you 've dispensed with them , you can resume selling the book everywhere but in Oakwood . I 'm sure you agree with me . It 's got to be a guilty plea . Will you let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " Mike ... " " Will you ? " ' here was what seemed an interminable silence . Barrett listened . He could hear only Sanford 's labored breathing three thousand miles away . Sanford spoke at last . " It . . . it 's too late , Mike . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . It 's too late . " " What are you talking about ? " " I 've made a public announcement of what we are going to do . I announced we are pleading not guilty . I announced we are going to court to defend Ben Fremont and  --  and The Seven Minutes . That 's it . It 's done . " In an involuntary gesture of disbelief at what he had heard , Barrett took the receiver from his ear , glanced at it , and brought it back to his ear . " Did I hear you right ? You 're not kidding me , are you ? This is n't exactly a laughing matter . " " I made a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to court , Mike , and we need all the ? " " If you 're leveling with me , what you need is a strait jacket and a dozen psychoanalysts . " " Mike , you have n't given me a chance to talk . You do n't know what 's been happening here , or you 'd understand , " Sanford complained . " After I hung up on you this morning , I was deluged by wires and phone calls from every corner of the country . It 's been snowing telegrams . From everyone . From most of our major bookstore accounts . From some of the biggest wholesalers  --  Baker and Taylor , A. C. McClurg , American News , Raymar , Dimondstein , Bookazine , you name them  --  and every one adding up to the same question . What are we going to do about Ben Fremont ? Nobody pulled punches . If we backed down on Ben , then it meant we were backing down on The Seven Minutes . If we admitted that Ben was guilty and deserved to be jailed without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitting the book was obscene and did not deserve to be put on sale . In fact , our backing down on Ben Fremont meant we were exposing every bookseller , every bookman , to further arrests and yet offering nothing to support them . It was like the American Booksellers Association speaking to me in a single voice . Fight the censors here , and stop the censorship from spreading farther , or forget about the book . Because  | if Sanford House would n't fight here , no one would dare handle the book . " Look , we know what 's happened in a similar situation before , Mike . I 've been told that when Grove Press published Henry Miller 's Tropic of Cancer there were over sixty criminal and civil suits mounted against booksellers . And even though the publisher agreed to defend or assist in defending those booksellers , other booksellers were still sufficiently frightened to return  --  return , send back , you hear me ? ? three quarters of a million of the two million copies that had been published . When Putnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to booksellers . But once they novel unless it was defended . So they selected three key cities where the book had been attacked  --  Hackensack , Boston , New York ? and they fought the censors . As a result , their book , and the freedom to sell it and read it , survived . In a sense , we 're luckier , Mike . We have one instant censorship case mounted against our book , only one , to date , perhaps more difficult and sensational than the others , but one case which , if we fought and won it , would discourage any further criminal and civil actions . But not to try to fight it ? Why , wholesalers and bookstores would immediately dump thousands and thousands of copies back into my lap . Our book would be dead before it was born . That was made clear to me today . " What choice did I have , Mike ? I was desperate . I was so desperate that I finally returned Wesley R. ' s calls . You know what I got from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading the headlines ? It was just to tell me he 'd always known I was a fool , but now it was confirmed by others  --  I was not only a fool but a dunderhead for publishing the Jadway . And as for giving me any help , any paternal advice , you know what he gave me ? A recipe . Stew in your own juice , ' he said . And after I was cooked , he said , he hoped there would be enough left of the firm to sell off to someone who 'd know how to run it . So there I was , alone , in the pressure cooker , and with the entire book trade waiting for my answer . Well , I stalled and stalled , hoping you 'd make that compromise deal with the D.A. , but knowing that even if you had , it was too late for that , too late to plead our book guilty of rape . So  | finally I called in everybody , and we drafted a statement to be wired to our major book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We reaffirmed our belief in the honesty and literary value of The Seven Minutes . We pledged ourselves to defend the book against the forces of comstockery . We announced that we were supporting Ben Fremont and Jadway 's book , and we were pleading not guilty , and we were going to court to prove our contention to the people of Los Angeles , of the country , of the entire world . I gave my word  --  we will fight this with every resource at our command . " " That 's what the District Attorney just told me , the exact words he used . " " What ? " " He 'd fight you with every resource at his command . " " I  --  I expected that , " said Sanford haltingly . " You did n't mean that , before , about our not having a chance in court , did you , Mike ? " Barrett was suddenly sorry for his friend . " Perhaps I was exaggerating to make a point . What I should have said was , I hate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , costly , and they can become vicious . Sometimes , when they 're over , it 's hard to tell who won or who lost , because everyone looks like a loser . And this case is a particularly difficult one . The prosecution has got some big guns . Of course , between now and the trial date you may get some impressive weaponry , too . " Weariness was beginning to overtake Barrett . " Well , I 'd better phone the D.A . and let him know you want Fremont to plead not guilty . I hate to do it , but I guess you 've left us no choice in the matter . " " I had no choice , " Sanford persisted . " If I 'd turned my back on this case , that would have opened the floodgate . That would have been the end of freedom of speech in this country . " " That was your principal concern , Phil  --  freedom of speech ? " " All right , you bastard . And my own neck . That was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's more like it . Well , if it is your neck you are concerned about , let me give you one more piece of advice , and this time follow it . You 're on the firing line . You need the best shot there is . Meaning you need the best defense attorney in these United States . You see that you get him . "  | " I 've already got him . " " You have ? Good . Who ? " " You , Mike . I retained you yesterday . Remember ? " " Oh , no , no you do n't , Phil , " Barrett said levelly . " I was just a temporary fill-in for a publisher-in-distress . It was going to be a quick guilty plea and then run . A trial is another matter . It can take months weeks or and I 'm tied up . " " You said you quit Thayer and Turner . I would n't insist on this if you were n't free . " " Phil , I 'm not free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me tell you , not once but twice , that I quit them to take a new job with Osborn Enterprises ? The chance of a lifetime . And a condition of the new job is that I start on it immediately . I told you that this morning . " But then he saw that he would have to tell his friend about it again , and in greater , more convincing detail . Trying to hide his weariness , he recounted his entire adventure with Osborn and the opportunity that had been offered to him . " Now you know why I ca n't be your legal counsel , " he concluded . Sanford remained adamant . " You can go to Osborn and say ! i , , , l you 'll take his position after you 've finished with the trial . " " I ca n't see myself making any demands on Osborn . I 'm fortunate to have any position with him at all . Look , Phil , there are three hundred thousand lawyers in the United States , and there are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on your case and who 'd be better at it than I would . Hell , Phil , I 've never handled a censorship case . " " You handled plenty of cases supporting the guarantees of the First Amendment when you were with the Good Government Institute . Well , this is a First Amendment case , no more , no less . What 's the difference if the issue is political or literary ? What is still being defended is the right of freedom ... " He did know what was to be defended . He knew what was at stake . Fleetingly , the placard that had hung in his old office at the Institute , quoting a credo of the American Civil Liberties Union , passed before his eyes . It was a reminder that , in a living society , principles often come into conflict . About some things there could be no conflict . A man could not have the freedom to  | Injure other people , to slander , to incite mob action , to create the danger of illegal sexual conduct or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly , " Within those limits , people should be able to say what they please , however unpopular , however irresponsible . Otherwise there 's no telling when the majority , may decide that your ideas , too , are offensive . " This had been his standard when defending those voicing political opinions , and Sanford was right . It was also the standard to be applied to the freedom to write and speak as one pleased , and to read what one wished . He had taken the wrong tack with Sanford and had made himself vulnerable . " Admitted , Phil , " he said . " Let 's say I am qualified . The fact remains that I am not available . I repeat , I can find you an attorney , a battery of barristers , not only qualified but also available and eager to help . So be reasonable . Let me find you someone . " " No , " said Sanford flatly . " You are the only one I 'd gamble my whole future on . You alone know me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd defend me as you 'd defend your own life . You 'd devote yourself to me as a friend , not as a mere client . You know New York publishing as well as California law . And you know books . You 're the only attorney I 've ever met who loves literature as much as law . " There was a meaningful pause , and then Sanford added , " Mike , you owe this to yourself  --  and to me . " Barrett hesitated . His friend had injected the word " owe . " Barrett knew too well the definitions of the word " owe " " To be indebted . . . To have an obligation to someone . . . " He had always been burdened by his unpaid debt to Sanford . The years had passed , but the memory and the obligation had not faded with time . When he had been desperate to save his mother , only one person had volunteered to help . He had long ago repaid Sanford the money owed him . But he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency of friendship , a favor for a favor . No one on earth aided another out of pure altruism . Everyone on earth expected something back , be it love or loyalty ? or legal counsel . Still , Barrett could not bring himself to capitulate . Sanford had said he owed it to himself as well as to their friendship to take on the case . Meaning , perhaps , that he owed it to himself to fight a good fight . Or meaning , more likely , he owed it to himself to  | support a friend who was cornered , a linguistic effort to soften a harsh demand . But Barrett also knew what he owed himself . He owed himself the right to be his own man , once and forever , to shed all guilts and disown the gouging interest levied on repaid debts . He owed it to himself to reject Sanford , as he had yesterday r ! I rejected Zelkin , and to go along with Willard Osbom II . He dared I ! not jeopardize the position offered by Osborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least not at this moment , break with a friend . He realized that Sanford had been speaking to him , asking , " Are you still there , Mike ? " " I 'm here . I was trying to think . " The New York voice had become hurt and wheedling . " Mike , you ca n't let me down in a crisis like this . I need you . " " You 're putting me on the spot , Phil , " he said . " But let me see what I can do . Let it stand this way . I 'll try what you suggested . I 'm seeing Osborn tonight . I intend to tell him I 'm taking him up on his offer of a vice-presidency . At the same time , I 'll ask him for a delay . I 'll explain about you and our friendship and the necessity for a trial , and then , well , then I 'll hope for the best . But , Phil , one thing . If he refuses to give me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll try to find you a top attorney out here . If it has to be someone else , I know you 'll understand . " " I 'll understand only one thing , " said Sanford , invoking the tyranny of the weak . " That friendship comes ahead of anything else . If you were going under , and needed my helping hand , I would n't think twice . I 'd make any sacrifice to give you a hand . " This got under Barrett 's skin . He tried to contain the resentment that he felt . " You know perfectly well I 'd do anything to help you , within reason . I said I 'll try , and I shall , tonight . The only thing I ca n't do , if it comes down to it , is blow my whole future . If you do n't understand that , Phil , I 'm sorry . " " I 'll be waiting to hear from you , " said Sanford , and he hung up . Angrily Barrett returned the receiver to the hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entrapment . But he had one duty left . Depositing another coin , he dialed the District Attorney 's office . Apparently his call was expected . He was put through to Elmo Duncan almost immediately . He told Duncan that he had discussed the matter with his  | client in New York , and they had reached a decision on the plea , and he was about to drive over to Oakwood and inform the defendant . " We 're entering a plea of not guilty , " said Barrett . " Not guilty ? Good , very good , " said Duncan , singing it out as if it were a joyful Christmas carol . " See you in court . " Barrett wanted to reply that the District Attorney would see someone in court , but that it was not likely to be he . " In court , " he echoed . Leaving the booth , he almost hoped that Willard Osborn would not grant him a postponement to undertake the defense . For the defense , in a trial like this , the court was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent his life barely escaping from ambushes . He could not afford a Little Big Horn . BARRETT HAD BEEN invited to an early dinner at the Osborns ' , since he was taking Faye to the Music Center in downtown Los Angeles to see a visiting Bolshoi Ballet troupe perform Tchaikovsky 's Sleeping Beauty . The meal in the charming , almost rustic dining room , with its roughhewn wood beams above and its hexagonal floor tiles below , had been delicious . Now the last of the serving pieces was being removed from the hand-woven maroon Mexican tablecloth , until only the ancient wrought-iron candelabrum remained as the centerpiece . A servant entered with an open box of cigars . Willard Osborn accepted one , but Barrett declined , indicating his pipe , which he began to fill from his leather pouch . Across the table , Faye was inserting a fresh cigarette into her gold holder . Her blond hair was swept up high , accenting the strands of pearls around her milky neck . She met Barrett 's eyes and winked , inclining her head slightly toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment had come . Barrett turned his gaze toward Willard Osborn , at the head of the table . Osborn had clipped his cigar and was waiting for the servant to light it . At last the three of them were alone . Throughout dinner the conversation , guided by Faye , had been largely concerned with social gossip and the arts . No business . Barrett had rather expected the subject of his position to be brought up during dinner . But  | it had been studiously avoided by Willard Osborn . Barrett finally understood that , by Osborn 's code , dinner and business did not mix , such mixture being definitely bad manners . Now dinner was done , and in twenty minutes he and Faye would have to be off to the ballet . Willard Osborn had straightened his lank frame , and from beneath his heavy lids he was considering Barrett . " Well , now , " he said , " we 've covered ships and shoes and sealing wax , cabbages and kings , and now I should say there is nothing left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I assume you are prepared to tell me tonight , Michael , whether you 've made up your mind , and , should your decision be favorable , whether you 've been able to work the change out . Are you prepared to discuss it Barrett smiled . " I 've only been waiting for you to ask . Of course my decision is favorable . It was favorable the moment you made me the offer . The problem was Thayer and Turner . I 'm happy to say that 's worked out . I resigned yesterday . " " Wonderful , Mike ! " exclaimed Faye jubilantly . " The only thing ? " " I 'm perfectly delighted , " Willard Osborn interrupted . " I knew you 'd find a means of arranging everything . Very good . Now we can move ahead as I 'd planned . There will be offices for you on Monday . I want you to come in , familiarize yourself with the files , become acquainted with your colleagues , and in a week you can lead our small army into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unable to check Osborn 's enthusiasm , Barrett had heard him out with a sinking feeling . He had to speak up before Osborn went further . " There 's just one obstacle standing in my way , Willard . " " Standing in your way to what ? " " To going right to work for you . You see , a friend of mine , one of my closest friends , wants me to represent him in a trial soon to be held in Los Angeles . I ca n't persuade him to retain another attorney . He feels , in this kind of case , he needs someone who knows him , someone he can trust . I would n't consider undertaking this , except that the man is my friend , has always been loyal to me , and I owe him a good deal . " Osborn had set down his cigar and pulled himself closer to the  | table . " I 'm afraid you are confusing me , Michael . I ca n't see what li could be important enough to warrant the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so special about this case that it requires you and only you ? " " Well . . . " Barrett wriggled uncomfortably . " It 's the kind of case  --  well , my friend 's entire future career hangs on its outcome . Before I go into it , well , if you do n't mind , I think first I had better explain something of my relationship with my friend . " Fixing his eyes on the cold pipe in his hand , not once looking up , Barrett began to speak in hurried , brief sentences of when he had first known Philip Sanford , of their college years together , of Sanford 's assistance when Barrett 's mother had been gravely ill , of Sanford 's difficulties with his famous father , of his opportunity to take over Sanford House on a trial basis to prove his capabilities . Then , even more quickly , Barrett interjected The Seven Minutes into his account , describing Ben Fremont 's arrest and Phil Sanford 's determination to defend both the bookseller and the novel itself in court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perhaps necessary , " said Barrett . " I informed the District Attorney we were pleading not guilty . I told Phil that I would try , if it was humanly possible , to represent the defense . " He glanced up as he finished talking , and directed his eyes toward Faye , across from him . But he could see only her profile . Her worried face was pointed toward her father . Barrett forced his eyes to shift to her father . If a man 's countenance could be a synonym for a word , then Willard Osborn 's features were a synonym for " appalled . " The usually bloodless patrician countenance was amazed , dismayed , distressed , and faintly flushed . " That book , " said Osborn , mouthing " book " as if it were a scatological four-letter word . " You intend to defend that foul book ? Surely you 're not serious ? " Barrett felt himself bristle . " I have no idea whether the book is or is not foul . Only our District Attorney has said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from yet . I have n't read the book , but nevertheless it deserves ? " " It deserves nothing , " snapped Osborn . " It deserves to be ripped to shreds and stuffed into the garbage disposal . You have no idea  | whether the book is foul ? I am really surprised at a man of your intelligence making a remark like that , Michael . One does n't have to read a book to know that it is foul . One can smell it . I , for one , know what it is . There is sufficient evidence to make judgment . I am acquainted with our District Attorney . You yourself have met him in this house . He is an honest man and a decent man , and certainly no prude . If he 's seen fit to charge The Seven Minutes as obscenity , I would trust his judgment . If that were not enough , consider that book 's history . It was all over the newspapers this morning . With the exception of that one ratty underground press in Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that this book should be brought to light . And when your so-called friend , whose morality has plainly been warped by his psychotic resentment of his father  --  when your friend opportunistically determined to publish the book , what was the first thing to happen ? The book found its way into the hands of Frank Griffith 's young son , and it unleashed his normal inhibitions and provoked him into an act of violence . " " We only have the boy 's word for that , " said Barrett , shaken by Osborn 's vehemence . " His word is good enough for me , " said Osborn . " Michael , you must realize this . I am no stranger to the Griffith family . Certainly , I 've known Frank Griffith well for many years . He has bought endless hours of television time from me for his numerous clients . His clients are drawn from the top business executives in America , and he has them because he has earned their respect . He is an outstanding public citizen , and he has brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have corrupted the mind of a young man like that except a criminally pornographic work . You 've come to know me a little , Michael . You could hardly call me a puritan . You must know I am against those who would restrict our freedoms . I oppose their efforts daily in the never-ending battle in our world of television . But even freedom must have boundaries . Otherwise , the greedy , the vicious , will use our freedom against us and destroy that freedom , as well as destroy our young and innocent . I say open the door to the new candor and realism when it is honest and broadening , but I say shut the door in the ugly face of a monster like The Seven Minutes . For your own sake , Michael , let alone our future together , but mainly for  | your own sake , I trust you are not serious about defending that book . " Listening , Barrett had become frightened . His fear was not a fear of Willard Osborn , but a fear of the reckless anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this anger would overcome his rational self , dominate him , and make him give voice to long-forgotten feelings that would destroy his wondrous future . He did not know what to say , but , fortunately , in those seconds he needed to say nothing , for Faye was addressing her father . " Dad , I 'm not disagreeing with what you 've said , but I do think you are entirely missing the point that Mike is trying to make . Mike may or may not be serious about defending this book , but the point is that he has said from the start that if he defended it at all , it would be because of his loyalty to an old friend . He 's tried to tell you he is considering handling this case because of Mr. Sanford , not because of The Seven Minutes . " " Well , that may be , but the very thought of Michael here becoming involved . . . " Osborn had turned to Barrett once more . " As to friends , I understand loyalty to friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also know one must not permit friendship to become devouring . Most of us pay our dues to friendship . But we must never do so to the point where we bankrupt ourselves . Remember that , Michael . " He took up his cigar and brought a table lighter to it . " Now , then , your place in Osborn Enterprises . I said we must have you at once . Possibly we can reach a compromise . How much time would you have to give this ? this trial of yours ? " " It 's too early to tell , " said Barrett . " I 'd say maybe a month . Maybe a little longer . " Osborn shook his head . " Impossible . I 'm afraid that is asking too much . I could n't afford to keep the position unmanned for such a period of time . I 'd have to find someone else . Also , to be perfectly frank , there is another aspect of your involvement with Sanford that would be distasteful . This has the makings of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically rub off on you , and if you were to become one of our vicepresidents it would in turn rub off on Osborn Enterprises . It would place you and the company in a bad light with the more finicky conservatives who advertise on our stations . I would find it  | extremely difficult to justify your role in such a trial and , indeed , my having given you so responsible a position in a company involved with communications that influence young and old alike . " He suddenly ground out his cigar . " What the devil . You know what I 'm driving at . You 're smart enough . That 's why I want you with us . " Osborn came out of the chair and shoved it aside . He appeared at ease and benign once more . He offered his daughter a slight smile , and then he gave Barrett a broader one . " I know I can depend on your sense of values , Michael , " he said . " All things considered , that trial should have no place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more attractive , affairs to concern you . My advice is that you forget that courtroom diversion . You can tell your friend Sanford that you made a try on his behalf , but that I was absolutely immovable . You can say that I could not find any way of sparing you , and that you had to honor your earlier commitment to Osborn Enterprises . Once 11 , you 've told him that , and he realizes you mean it , he 'll make no further effort to use you . He 'll do what he should have done in the first place . He 'll find himself the kind of back-room attorney who specializes in defending the licentious and the lewd , he 'll find someone with less integrity than you have . As for you , Michael , I want you on our team , among men of stature , where you belong . I want you among men who are going places . I 'll expect to see you bright and early Monday morning . So , off you go , both of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot to celebrate . " THE RUSSIAN BALLET had ended to a dozen curtain calls twenty minutes before eleven o'clock . There had been the usual wait trying to leave the parking area , and the usual jam on the freeway , but once Barrett had made the off ramp he was able to make better time . Now , as his convertible moved along the Sunset Strip , it was a quarter after eleven . Once again Faye Osborn was chattering about Sleeping Beauty and extolling the marvels of the Bolshoi troupe . He realized that he could recall little of what she was describing . Throughout the ballet , he had been inattentive . While the corps de ballet lightly soared and pirouetted on the stage , Barrett 's mind had been filled  | with heavier , more disquieting , images that had pranced and skipped through his head . " That new ballerina , " Faye was saying , " the one who was Princess Aurora  --  I can never remember those ghastly Russian names ? do you remember her name , Mike ? " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen a more beautiful performance . The program said that 's the part that made Ulanova famous overnight . Well , I think this girl is going to be even more famous , do n't you , Mike ? " " Yes . " " It 's positively inspiring . It makes one want to float , or at least swing . . . . There 's Whisky a Go Go . Do you feel up to it , Mike ? " " What ? Up to what ? " " Dancing . You were n't even listening . I guess you 're not in the mood . " " No , not tonight , darling . We 'll do it next time . " They had entered Beverly Hills , and he lapsed into silence . Her hand had reached out , and he felt it touch his arm . " Mike , dear ... " He glanced at her . Faye 's flawless brow was marked with concern , strange , like a delicate porcelain plate with a crack in it . " Mike , what is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's troubling you ? Is it Dad ? Did he upset you ? " She was her father 's daughter , and he was always careful about Dad . Not that he 'd had much reason to be critical of her father before . Willard Osborn had always treated him graciously . But , on a personal level , he had known Osborn only as father of the fiancee , as host , as career patron . The rest of Osborn , the human Osborn , he had divined only through the conductor that was Faye . Sometimes  --  rarely , but sometimes  --  he wondered . For maybe that was n't Osborn , but Faye alone . It was difficult to strain a bloodline and separate it into two identities . That was why , on the few occasions when Faye had made remarks or shown prejudices that annoyed him , providing no evidence as to whether the biases were her own or parentally derived , he had always been careful . But tonight he had lived with Osborn throughout the evening , and his resentment had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid it of Osborn , and he determined to do so now . He  | would not be careless . He would simply be forthright . After all , there was an intimacy between Faye and himself , even if they were not yet close . Intimacy counted for something . " Well , did he ? " Faye asked . " Is that what 's on your mind ? " " Yes , I guess it is , " he said . " I guess I 've been thinking of what he said after dinner . And that made me think of other things . So it 's not just your father . " " Well , what about my father ? " " I do n't think I expected an ultimatum from him . Either or else . ' When I spilled out my whole dilemma , my friendship and debt to Phil Sanford , I thought he would understand my position . But he did n't . Or at least he chose not to . " " Be fair , Mike . I was there . Despite his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow for Frank Griffith , Dad was sympathetic to your own problem . He was ready to relax his terms , give in a little . That 's because he does like you and wants to see you achieve the success you deserve . Mike , he did ask you how much time you wanted for the trial . " " Exactly the point , " said Barrett . " He was ready to give me only the time that he thought I required . Had the trial been over some other matter , I 'm sure he would have been more flexible . Because it was this trial , about this book , he placed a limit on his magnanimity . He made the gesture . Yet he made the terms as impossible as they had been from the start . He knew very well one ca n't prepare for a trial and go to court and get it over with in a few days or a week . He knew I 'd need a month or more . When I said so , he pulled back and said no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in Chicago a week later , he would n't have been prepared to release me from the negotiation at all . But he knew , and I know , that you do n't make a man a vice-president simply because of one immediate project . If a man is really valuable , then he is valuable to you for years , for a lifetime , and you take the longer view . That 's why I say , if I 'd asked him for time off to help a friend over some civil matter , a tax case , a corporation suit , some clean , businesslike , red-blooded , Waspish American litigation , he 'd have been considerate and given me a break . What he disliked was the issue I wanted to become involved in . So he made it impossible for me to contest that issue  --  unless I was prepared to give up the position he 's offered me. "  | Faye had heard him out , biting her lower lip , and when he was rough she spoke immediately . " Mike , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making you distort the whole thing . No one knows Dad the way I know him . You can believe me , he was n't trying to bludgeon you into standing for what he stands for . He was looking out for you , for your future . He knows how people use people , and he could be more objective than you can and see more clearly how Sanford was manipulating you . He did n't want your reputation hurt by his allowing you to associate yourself with a dirty book . " " Well , I 'm not ? " Careful , Barrett , careful , he told himself , you 've spoken your piece . Now easy does it . " Well , maybe you 're right , Faye . It 's not fair to guess at someone else 's motives . Let 's say what disturbed me was his strong prejudgment of a book he 's never read , knows nothing about , except what a publicity-minded District Attorney sees fit to release in the press . " " Mike , what about you ? You admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also making a prejudgment of it , are n't you ? You 're making a prejudgment in its favor . " He doffed an imaginary hat to her . " Right you are , my dear . I eat my words , although only some of them . Anyway , your father knows nothing about the book , and through Phil Sanford I 'm at least familiar with ? " " Mike , reading it or not reading it should n't be the issue . I 'm surprised at you . We 're warned off certain things by the reputation that precedes them , or because people we trust tell us they 're bad . If people who know label a bottle Poison , ' is n't that enough ? Does everyone have to sample the poison to be convinced he should stay away from it ? " " Not the same thing , " said Barrett . " Poison can be scientifically tested and classified as dangerous beforehand . A work of literature can not , at least not so simply . " " Oh , please , Mike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very noses . A human guinea pig was used in the experiment . Jerry Griffith . And he was poisoned . " " You say Jerry Griffith . Let 's look at Jerry Griffith more closely . I 'm an attorney , Faye . I 've been taught not to take people and their actions at face value . You probe , you question , and more often than not you find motives that are quite different from those that  | first appeared on the surface . Maybe The Seven Minutes was solely responsible for Jerry 's crime . Again , maybe there were other reasons for his behavior , and the book was only the final thing that tripped the trigger . If it had n't come along , there ere would ha vc ! ill been something else to trip the trigger . How do we know , how does even Jerry know , unless we look deeper ? I 'm not prepared to judge the book , condemn it , because of this one piece of evidence . And what surprises me , and upsets me , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thousands of others around town , are ready to curb freedom of speech without conclusive evidence . " Faye took her gold holder and a cigarette from her purse . " Well , you 're surprised at us , and frankly , Mike , I 'm surprised at you . I 1 Ill thought your main motive in wanting to defend that dirty little book was to do a favor for an old friend . That was something I could comprehend . Now , all at once , it 's not friendship but freedom of speech . " " I guess I was turned on tonight . I 'd long since forgotten I was once an idealist . I did n't believe I had those feelings any more . " " Well , I wish you 'd have them over something more deserving , something worthwhile . Not over a piece of incendiary trash . " She held up her cigarette holder . " I know , I know , I 'm not supposed to say that until I taste the poison . " He tried to contain his pique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faye dear , that the bottle has n't been mislabeled . " An acid tone i l was creeping into his voice , and he hastened to sweeten it with reasonableness . " Faye , one thing for sure , as you 've pointed out , none of us has read the book . You have n't . Your father has n't . I have n't . So none of us knows first hand work of whether it is a wo 0 hard-core pornography or a work of erotic art . So how can we discuss it further ? " " A work of art . Ha . You can read it , not me . You read it and tell me . Subject closed . The ballet was more fun . " She sat back low , smoking . Then , as Barrett turned the car off Sunset Boulevard , she suddenly craned her neck and sat upright . " Hey , where are you taking me , Mike ? " " Home . " She swung around . " Is n't this something new ? Were n't we going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're peeved with me because I disagreed with you ? " " Of course not . You know me better than that , Faye . " " Then why are n't we going to be together longer ? " " Because tonight I 'm going to have other company . Tonight I 'm going to bed  --  with a book . " He guided the car into the Osborn driveway . " I 'm going to practice what I 've been preaching . I 'm going to find out whether the poison was mislabeled or not . " " Well , if that 's all . " She seemed relieved , and suddenly cheerful . " Just remember , if it overstimulates you , you do n't have to go galloping out to waylay and rape some poor child . I 'm ready , willing and available . " " I 'll keep that in mind . " He drew up before the impressive Spanish structure , set the shift in " Park , " stepped on the emergency brake , but allowed the engine to idle . He was starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she stopped him with a question . " Mike , are you even considering turning down Dad 's position to take on Sanford 's case ? " " I do n't know what I 'm considering . No , the odds are I wo n't sacrifice your father 's job . I probably would n't have the guts any more . Besides , I would n't want to lose the chance to keep you in the manner to which you 're accustomed . " " But you have n't turned down Sanford yet , either . And you are going to read the book . " " That 's right , darling , " he admitted . " Because I do n't want to grow rich and fat and old always carrying the niggling and perhaps romantic regret that I once did n't do something important that I should have done . A sage long ago said  --  there is nothing as futile as regret . Another sage , namely me , said  --  there is no burden heavier than regret . I want to anticipate and put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vigorous . " " Silly , " she laughed , and then she sobered . " No , seriously , Mike ? " " Very well , seriously . I 'm afraid I do n't have much choice about what I can do . Still , there 's a little bit of my conscience , frightened at an early age by Clarence Darrow , that demands explanations of me for certain moves I make . It 's not vociferous , that little bit , but it is there , and it niggles . Before I turn down Phil Sanford tomor-  | row , before I close the book on that book , I feel it deserves one hearing , one chance to speak for itself , one opportunity to be fairly judged . Then my bit of conscience will be satisfied that I 've awarded the defendant due process . When I 've read The Seven Minutes tonight , and convinced myself that it is indeed pornographic , written merely for the purpose of exploiting obscenity , and for no other reason  --  when I 've decided that , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What if you read it and believe it to be something more than pornography ? " " I wo n't let that happen . " He smiled . " If it does happen , I 'll have to wrestle with my bit of conscience and try to see if I can make it shut up . " He left the car , briskly went around to the other side , and helped Faye out . She took his hand , and they walked silently to the imposing oak door . She sought her key , opened the door partially , and then let go of it and turned back to him . " Mike , I 'm sure you wo n't do anything foolish about that book . But if . . . if for some irrational reason  --  if you ca n't overcome your guilt about not helping Sanford , if you find yourself wrestling your bit of conscience and losing  --  well , I thought I 'd better tell you , I 'll stick with you . " Her arms had gone around him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always force Dad to do anything I want . If I have to , I can force him to hold that vice-presidency open for you  --  until you 've had your day in court . " He kissed her , and heard her heart , and felt his own desire rising . Quickly he disengaged himself , whispering , " Thanks , darling . " Then he pointed her toward the doorway and started her inside . After her door had closed , and he was alone , he lingered , peering up at the night 's blue sky , illuminated by an infinity of stars , shining gemlike , as dazzling as the pure crystal prisms of a priceless chandelier . Up there , somewhere , was where all bits of conscience were born . Their journey downward to this habitat of man made them fragile , and the protective armor they assumed was so fleshly weak and frail , and they were so susceptible to extinction , that it was a miracle any bit of human conscience survived on earth . It had shocked him this night to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand equal time along-  | side his lustier , more dominating ambition . And it had shocked him that he had given in to the demands of that squeaky fragment of conscience . He had promised it a hearing , and now the hearing must be held . Barrett started for his car . He would read the goddam book and get that over with , once and for all . Tm ELECTRIC CLOCK on the lamp table beside his bed showed the time to be four o'clock in the morning , and Mike Barrett was almost done . In his pajamas and flannel robe , propped up by the two large pillows behind him , Barrett turned the last page of The Seven Minutes , read the final paragraph , and slowly closed the book . He stared down at it incredulously for a few moments and then reluctantly placed it on the blanket . He was shaken to the very core of his being . Only once before could he remember having been affected in this way by a book , and then it had been a work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had read A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis , by Sigmund Freud . While he had not comprehended every word in the Freud book , he had understood enough to know that he had experienced a revelation . Until the Freud book , Barrett had accepted the attitude of Freud 's more conservative contemporaries that there was something faintly shameful and indecent about sex . In a single stroke , by giving him a new understanding , Freud had almost succeeded in liberating him from neurotic feelings about sex . At the time , he had been unable to define precisely what he had learned . Only later , in a study of social anthropologists by H. R. Hays , had his youthful revelation been clarified : " A society that modestly draped the legs of pianos was to learn from Freud that the innocence of childhood and the purity of women , two of its favorite illusions , were pure myth . This concept was as shocking as Darwin 's assault upon the Garden of Eden . " Now , in these morning hours , for the second time in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrett 's feelings about sex .  | He remained unmoving against his pillows , trying to assess his emotions . One emotion predominated . He was bursting with de- 111 His desire was to rush into the streets of the city and to search out the first female he could find . His need for her was not carnal , not to satisfy lust , but to confess and expiate the sinful insensitivity most men carried into their relationships with all women . He wanted to cry out to her that he had read a book and seen a light that illuminated completely the true minds and hearts of women , a light that might give him , and other men , a new perception of the opposite sex . In the glare of this pitiless cleans- 1 ing light , the maggots of shame and fear , guilt and unawareness , would scurry back into primeval darkness , no longer able to gnaw away at the exposed roots of human relationships . Oh , his thoughts , his hopes were grand tonight . 111 And all of this desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these last hours with this remarkable book . It was not the book 's style , its characters , its story that had moved him to a reaction of evangelistic fervor . It was the book 's insight into the deepest womb where human behavior is born , and the book 's naked honesty in exposing every aspect in the evolution of human behavior . He tried to contain himself , bring his critical faculties to bear on what had moved him so . It was , to be sure , only a novel that he had read . It was no deep study , philosophical or psychological , of humankind . It was simply a brief work of fiction written by a heart , not a head . And if it was considered not as a whole , but piece by piece , if it could be picked apart , it was not without numerous flaws . Certainly , for the brave white hunters , the hunters of the obscene , there was abundant game  --  the four-letter words , the coarse phrases , the passages of abnormal and sacrilegious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not pornography . It was beauty , the beauty of truth that makes possible self-discovery and self-knowledge . In total , The Seven Minutes was  --  and please forgive me , Faye ? a work of art . With respect and affection , Mike Barrett picked up the book once more . To the hand , it felt more substantial than its size would suggest . It consisted of only 171 printed pages . He opened the book and studied the end papers . The inside of  | the hardcover board and the page opposite were illustrated with a photographic reproduction of the title page of the original Paris edition . He had not read this before , but he read it now : THE SEVEN MINUTES BY J J JADWAY The Rtoile Press 18 , rue de Berri Paris Copyright by The Etolie Press Paris 1935 Printed in France All Rights Reserved Turning to the more attractive title page of the American edition , Barrett saw that only the typeface and the publishing information were different . Same title , same author , except now the imprint was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year of publication was the present year . The card page listed no previous published writings by J J Jadway . Then Barrett remembered that the back of the book jacket had explained that this remarkable tour de force had been the author 's first and last novel , and that a potentially great career had been brought to an abrupt end by the author 's untimely death in an accident outside Paris . Jadway had died at the age of twentyseven . There were no further clues to the novelist 's life . The dedication page proved even more enigmatic . It contained only two words : For Cassie The epigraph on the next page , Barrett knew , had provided the author with his structure for the novel . He reread the epigraph : While there was a great variety in response , the majority of females who had orgasms , whether brought on manu-  | ally , orally , or through intercourse , reached the climactic state in seven minutes . 111111 ? The Collingwood Study of ioo Women , Ages 18 to 45 ( London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been represented by seven chapters in Jadway 's book , each chapter in turn representing one minute in the mind of one woman who was lying on a bed having sexual intercourse with an unnamed , unseen man . The entire novel was told through the thoughts in this woman 's VIII head , her feelings , her memories , her dreams , during the seven minutes of copulation . That was the framework and method of The Seven Minutes . Suddenly Barrett wondered whether Jadway had known or had at least met James Joyce during Joyce 's last years in Paris . And whether Jadway had read the Odyssey Press edition of Ulysses that had been circulating in Paris in those years . Surely Jadway had read Joyce 's novel , or at least the last 25,000-word section of it , 1 the sad and happy and so-called salacious section which was Molly Bloom 's brilliant interior monologue . The descriptions in the seven sensuous and revealing minutes in the mind of Jadway 's Cathleen bore some resemblance to the stream-of-consciousness reverie in the mind of Joyce 's Molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Joyce ? Immediately Barrett was curious . He swung off the bed and padded on bare feet to his bookshelves , scanned the titles , and in seconds he held Ulysses in his hands . He flipped the pages until he found Joyce 's Molly in bed , lying there " fulfilled , recumbent , big with seed . " He read on , joined Molly as she lay in her bed thinking of Blazes Boylan , of young Stephen Dedalus , of her husband , Leopold Bloom , of lovers possessed and lovers desired , of past and future . Molly 's mind : Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his  | spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it in front of me serve him rights its all his own fault if Im an adultress .. . But in the end , Molly 's joyous mind : when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I say yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes . Absently , Barrett returned Molly Bloom to the bookshelf and started back to his bed . He was less certain now that Jadway 's heroine , Cathleen , had been derived in any way from Joyce 's Molly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was absolutely certain about was that Jadway had derived next to nothing from Joyce 's actual writing . This refresher had reminded Barrett of Joyce 's " stream of consciousness with its ever-shifting kaleidoscopic impressions , " as the jurist Woolsey had put it , of Joyce 's loaded if unpunctuated sentences , of Joyce 's compound words and opaque use of English , of Joyce 's poetry and parody and ear for the comic . Jadway 's The Seven Minutes reflected little of these innovations and flairs . Yet , in a sense , Jadway had undertaken a task as difficult . For , while his entire novel was an inner monologue , while occasionally there were effective passages of free word association , for the most the book was controlled and formal in its use of conventional sentence structure , word order , punctuation , and it built chronologically to a dramatic story revelation . Where Joyce had sought the point of view of the character and sought to reproduce the formless meanderings of a person 's mind , Jadway had sought the point of view of the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional word acrobatics of the  | character 's mind into the more understandable language of conventional speech . Barrett sat down on the bed , and reaching over to the table , he took up the bottle of cognac and poured himself a nightcap . Sipin the brandyBarrett tried to sort out his reason for troubling to compare J JJadway to James Joyce . At once he knew his reason . It had not been a literary exercise after all . It had been a legal exercise . Joyce 's work had been published in Paris in 1922 , and had been consistently banned thereafter in the United States as an obscene book until it was brought to trial in the District Court in New York before Judge John Woolsey . In 1933 Woolsey announced that , in spite of the book 's " unusual frankness , I do not detect anywhere the leer of the sensualist . I hold , therefore , that it is not pornographic . " And in 1934 Judge Augustus Hand of the Circuit Court of Appeals concurred in this opinion . Now The Seven Minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial . Would a judge or a jury hold that it was not pornographic ? Or would it be condemned as an utter obscenity ? He tried to capsulize the story for himself , posing in the role of " the average person , applying contemporary community standards . " He reviewed its outlines quickly . It began inside the mind of this young woman , Cathleen , who was lying on her back , naked , on a bed in a place unknown . It began with her thoughts and feelings as her male bed partner , also naked , made his entry into her and slowly started making love to her . As the sex act progressed , Cathleen 's mind reacted to the coupling on two levels . On the first , she recorded her immediate physical sensations . On the second , inspired by her gradually mounting passion , she recollected fragments of sensual experiences from her youthful past and then she projected these memories into wildly erotic fancies of loves that she had not experienced but tried to imagine . Her imagination acted out scenes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare , with Chopin , with Galileo , with Byron , with Washington , with Parnell . Mixed through these fancies she imagined fornicating with a black African , an Asiatic , ail American Indian . Conjuring up these vivid mental pictures , she also relived moments of carnality with three actual men in her life who had been  | her lovers . The three men varied widely in their physical endowments and prowess , as well as in their attitudes toward women and love . Each of the three had offered her something , taught her something , and the experiences with all three had fused into making her an entire woman . And such story as there was in the novel was drawn out of Cathleen 's decision to accept one of these men as her lifetime mate , the one she had taken to her bed this night , the very one who was inside her these seven minutes . Not until the last page , while gasping her love for him in the final paroxysms of her orgasm , would she call out and reveal the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barest outline of the book that Barrett had read . Still in the role of " the average reader , " and " applying contemporary community standards , " Barrett felt assured that the outline in itself would not be considered legally obscene , since the sex act by itself was not legally obscene . But then Barrett realized that he had not reviewed the book with an entirely honest eye . He had substituted euphemisms for the realistic bed language that Jadway had employed . In outlining the essential story line of The Seven Minutes , he had been dishonest to Jadway 's spirit of truth . In his mind , Cathleen had been indulging in sexual intercourse , copulation , coupling , fornication , lovemaking . In the mind of Jadway 's Cathleen , she had simply been fucking . The old Saxon word , on its own , might no longer prejudice a judge or a jury against a work of art . Its appearance in modem literature had been frequent and constant . The word no longer automatically made a literary work pornographic . It had won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ulysses trial . Barrett remembered . The language of James Joyce 's novel had been under discussion . And part of the discussion was Joyce 's use of the word " fucking . " Joyce 's attorney had said to Judge Woolsey , " Judge , as to the word fuck , ' one etymological dictionary gives its derivation as from facere  --  to make  --  the farmer fucked the seed into the soil . This , Your Honor , has more integrity than a euphemism used every day in every modem novel to describe precisely the same event . "  | " Oh  --  They slept together , " said Joyce 's attorney . " It means the same thing . " Judge Woolsey had smiled . " But , Counselor , that is n't even usually the truth ! " In that exchange , " fucking " had been admitted to the printed page . No , it was not the language of The Seven Minutes that might cause difficulty before a jury of average citizens . It was the context within which the language was used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boylan was one thing . For Jadway 's Cathleen to " For example ? " Judge Woolsey had asked . imagine being fucked by the Father of His Country or the Son of God  --  that might be something else again . Then there was another problem : the problem of explicit sex , of scenes which went " substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters ... matter which is utterly without redeeming social importance . " He had placed a copy of Lady Chatterley 's Lover and the English edition of The Trial of Lady Chatterley on his bedside table earlier , hoping to skim them again after he had finished reading the Jadway novel . It was late now , but he could not resist picking up Lady Chatterley 's Lover and leafing through it . He sought certain passages , until his eyes held on one . Mellors was making love to the lady . Forgive me , Mr. Joyce . Mellors was fucking the lady . He read the passage : ... and the butting of his haunches seemed ridiculous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to its little evacuating crisis seemed farcical . Yes , this was love , this ridiculous bouncing of the buttocks , and the wilting Barrett went on through the novel , and here " softly he stroked the silky slope of her loins , down , down between her soft warm buttocks , " and there " Tenderness , really  --  cunt tenderness , " and again , " she held the penis soft in her hand . " Barrett closed the novel , set it on the night table , and took up the report of the London trial . Opening it , he came upon a Cambridge lecturer and biographer of D. H. Lawrence who was telling of the poor insignificant , moist little penis . This was the divine love !  | the court , " The sexual passages to which objection is taken I think can not occupy more than thirty pages of the whole book . The book is some three hundred pages in length . . . . No man in his senses is going to write a book of three hundred pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Only thirty pages of sexual matter , and 27o-odd pages of other matter , and yet Lawrence 's Lady had caused years of furor . Had the other matter been of enough social importance to redeem the explicit sexual scenes ? Barrett turned back the pages to the opening statement of the defense : " The author has again , it is clear from the book , had in mind certain things in our society  --  that is to say , our society as it was then in the twenties , in the years of the depression  --  of which he wholly disapproved . . . . He thought . . . that the ills from which society was suffering were not going to be cured by political action ; and that the remedy lay in the restoration of right relations between human beings , and particularly in unions between men and women . One of the greatest things in life , he thought , was the relationship of a man and a woman in love , and their physical union formed an essential part of a relationship that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something to be discussed openly and frankly . " Redeeming social importance . And only one page in ten devoted to explicit sex . Yet here was Jadway 's The Seven Minutes , a book in which not merely one page in ten , but , rather , every single page , 171 out of 171 printed pages , was given over to sexual intercourse . But , dammit , that was n't what it was all about , just animal fucking , or else why had he felt so purified as a person , and so enlightened about women , when he had finished the book ? The protracted sexual intercourse had been beautiful , and a device through which to speak of understanding between the sexes , and of love and pity and tenderness and dreams and the meaning of life and death . Cathleen 's behavior needed no redemption , but if the law demanded that Jadway 's portrait of her passion required redeeming social importance , why , it was there , it was there in page after page . Still , Barrett could see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author 's motive and intent . How he wished  | that Jadway had lived , to explain not only why he had written the book , but to solve many mysteries in its pages . But there was only Jadway 's legacy , the book , to speak for him at its trial . Yes , there were serious problems , but whether the novel was obscenity or literature was not one of them , at least not to Barrett . If the book was not obscene , there should be someone to stand up and protect it . Just as there should be someone to stand up and protect the Constitution and the Bill of Rights against those who would make a mockery of its guarantees . He remembered Zelkin 's obsession and Chief Justice Warren 's concern that the Bill of Rights  --  including the portion of the First Amendment , " Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press " ? might not be passed as a law today . Then he remembered that another lawyer , Edward Bennett Williams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Williams had felt that not only would the Bill of Rights fail to be passed as a law today , but that it would not even get out of committee and onto the floor of Congress for a vote . " We have allowed an erosion of individual liberty and freedom to take place in the last three decades , " Williams had stated , " not as the result of the overreaching of big government , nor as the result of the calculated assaults made upon liberties and freedom in the last decade , but rather because of collective lethargy and a cavalier attitude of unconcern . I think we have made a substitution in our national ranking of values  --  an evolutionary substitution that is only now reaching its culmination . We have placed security in a position of primacy and subordinated individual liberty to it . " If a man could not speak out on sex today , then one day he , i might not be able to speak out on religion , on politics , on public institutions , on poverty , on racial equality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who embodied all men , would be mute . The Bill of Rights would be suppressed , banned , held seditious. 11 It could begin with a book . I 'll Shaken , Barrett stared down at The Seven Minutes . His mind was made up . He looked at his bedside clock . It Was three hours later in New York . It was seven-thirty in the Philip Sanford household . Phil Sanford would be awake , and he might be waiting .  | Barrett took the receiver off the telephone , then dialed Sanford 's area code number and then his home number . Sanford was wide awake , but his voice had been made almost inaudible by his anxiety . " I do n't know how I 'll make out with Osborn , " Barrett said , " but I do know how I feel about The Seven Minutes . I 've just read it , Phil , and it deserves to be defended . I have no idea what 'll happen to it or to us , but we 've got to stand up and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white flag to the censors , then freedom of speech has no future . They 'll overrun us . We 'll be silenced forever . This is the moment , and whatever the consequences , I 'm ready to go all the way . " " Mike , I love you ! " " From here on in , we hang together , or we hang separately ? so pack your bags . I expect you out here in a week . From now on , it 's war . " Hanging up , he had no regrets . Perhaps it had cost him his big opportunity with Osborn . Most likely not , since Faye was on his side and had promised to take care of her father . So probably this was n't much of a sacrifice and he was n't much of a courageous advocate . But he was doing what he wanted to do . And it felt good for a change . He took up the clock and set the alarm . He would sleep fast tonight , he knew , and he would awaken rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rise early , because he must make another call . He would call Abe Zelkin to tell him that he had himself a partner , even if only for one landmark case . Figuratively , briefly , there would be a shingle : Barrett and Zelkin , Counselors-at-Law and Do-Gooding.  | WHEN Mike Barrett returned to the Beverly Hills Hotel with Abe Zelkin in tow , Philip Sanford was waiting for them in the cool lobby . Since Zelkin and Sanford had spoken to each other many times on the long-distance telephone in the past ten days , Barrett had no need to introduce them formally . They had shaken hands warmly , and were immediately on a first-name basis . " Leo Kimura called from ' Westwood , " Barrett explained to the publisher . " He 'll be a few minutes late . I told him he 'd find us at the pool . " Then , as the three of them started for the hotel 's swimming pool , Barrett added , " Abe and I feel more secure when Leo is late . It means he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pretrial preparation in so short a time without a man like Leo Kimura . " " Having him on our side is like having a bevy of bloodhounds , only they still would n't add up to one Leo Kimura , " said Zelkin with satisfaction . " And I thought most Japanese in California were gardeners or restaurant proprietors , " said Sanford . " Their fathers were , " said Zelkin . " Their fathers were also among the one hundred and ten thousand American citizens interned behind barbed wire after Pearl Harbor . Our own little experiment with concentration camps . Kimura 's father was stuck in the Tule Lake Relocation Center . Speak of justice , eh ? Well , our generation of Nisei has n't forgotten it . Anyway , Leo Kimura never forgot it , and he wanted to see that no injustice like that ever happened again , so he worked his way through college and the University of Southern California Law School . The minute I  | began to interview him , just after I opened my office , I saw he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law cases that come to trial are won or lost in a law library or out in the city where legwork is being done . For you , I 'm taking care of the library , and Kimura is taking care of the legwork . And Mike here does something of everything , including saving his vocal cords for the trial . " They filed down to the hotel swimming pool . It was a balmy , windless day , and many of the obviously prosperous guests were seated around the pool in lounge wear or swim suits , and of the half-dozen people in the water three were pretty girls in bikinis . Although Barrett was wearing his summer seersucker , he felt overdressed . But then , he reminded himself , he would not be here long . This day , like every one in the past week and a half , would be a crowded business day . He realized that Sanford and Zelkin were being led to their reserved table , which was set back from the pool and protected by a yellow sun umbrella . Side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Zelkin was Zelkin  --  the animated pumpkin head , below which was draped an oversized greenish sport jacket and uncreased slacks . Philip Sanford was a tailor 's delight , and even the resort clothes he had changed into since arriving from the airport  --  a canvas beach jacket , Bermuda shorts , woven Italian moccasins  --  were sartorially impeccable . Sanford was Barrett 's height , but trimmer , strictly athletic club , yet all this seeming strength was reduced to weakness by his slicked-down rust hair and a chalky complexion which seemed to wash away the individuality of his features , except for his permanent expression of anxiety . Barrett caught up with his companions and joined them at the table in time to order his drink . The captain was told that they would wait to order lunch until the fourth member of their party had arrived . This reference to the tardy Kimura again provoked a series of nervous questions from Sanford about the progress that had been made in the ten days since Ben Fremont had entered a not-guilty plea and Barrett , together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial date set . With enthusiasm , Zelkin began outlining some of the preparations for the defense . Barrett slipped on his sunglasses and stared moodily out at the swimming pool . Briefly his attention was attracted to a slim , ribby  | California-type girl , maybe twenty , who was pulling herself up out of the water . A strip of bikini bra only partially contained her abundant breasts , and Barrett was sure they would pop free any * He had reached International Airport a half hour before Phil Sanford 's scheduled morning arrival from New York City . This had been fortunate , since Sanford 's jet liner landed fourteen minutes early . Barrett had wasted not a minute posing the problem , actually posing it because Abe Zelkin had implored him to do so . The skycap had deposited Sanford 's luggage next to them on the cement walk before the terminal , and they were waiting for the airport 's valet parking service to deliver Barrett 's automobile , when Barrett had brought the subject up . " Phil , we 're going into this big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big trial  --  it 's becoming a carnival like the Scopes trial or the Bruno Hauptmann trial , " Barrett had begun . " Incredible the way this has caught on , " said Sanford with unconcealed pleasure . " Not only in the East , not only with every newspaper in America , but abroad , in England , France , Germany , Italy , everywhere . We retain a clipping service , and ? " " I know what 's happening , and that 's another thing that bothers me , " said Barrett . " It 's bad enough to have a complicated case , but it 's infinitely worse when most of the newspapers , television , and radio media turn it into a spectacular . So , what I started to say is that we 're going into this with little more than  | two weeks of preparation . The only thing that makes a defense possible is that we 've been working double time . So maybe we 'll have the equivalent of four weeks ' preparation before we go into court . Considering what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen weeks . " " Your District Attorney wo n't have any more time than you 've had , " protested Sanford , " and he seems eager to get into court . " " The prosecution is almost always more eager to get into court than the defense . The state is the aggressor . In this case , the D.A . ' s Office was at work , preparing an attack on the book , before we knew there would be an arrest . And they already have a star witness . It is to their advantage to stage their show now , while public opinion is on their side , while hysteria keeps mounting about the rape and that book . Every morning we 're greeted by a bedside bulletin from Mount Sinai telling us of Sheri Moore 's critical condition , her prolonged coma , and every bulletin is accompanied by a reiteration of what put her in the hospital  --  not Jerry Griffith but J J Jadway . But as Zelkin keeps reminding me , it is the defense that traditionally fights for more time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change , but to gain time for a thorough preparation . As the defense , we 're a step behind . We 're counterpunching , and we need time to catch up and then take the initiative . If there were less internal pressure , we could ask for one continuance after another , throw up a screen of pretrial motions and writs , delay the confrontation by as much as six months to a year . Abe begged me to bring it up with you once more . Ca n't we convince you to let us try to delay the trial ? " " Impossible , " said Sanford . " Any long delay would be as disastrous for me as losing the trial itself . All those copies of the book are out . What could the stores do with them ? They 'd be afraid to display them . They would n't have room to stock them if the outcome of the trial were long in doubt and made that necessary . Most of the store owners would probably panic and return their shipments to us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be able to revive a corpse . No , in spite of the risk , we 've got to plunge right into it . " Barrett 's car had arrived then , and as Sanford 's bags were placed in the trunk , Barrett had wondered how truthful were the reasons Sanford had given for wanting a speedy trial . It occurred to him  | that Sanford , as much as Elmo Duncan , wanted to take advantage of the publicity that the book and the case were receiving . Then , as he had settled into the driver 's seat , Barrett had realized that part of the fault was his own . He had been paying lip service to Zelkin 's wish for a postponement . He had not been more persuasive about a delay because of private and selfish reasons . Faye had indeed succeeded in cajoling her father to hold the vice-presidency open for him another month . Barrett had one more option on a successful future . He dared not let it expire . Yet , as he drove toward the freeway , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to defending a book in which he believed . At the same time , he was as responsible as his client , Phil Sanford , for not giving his side the days and weeks necessary to build an impregnable and well-armed defense . Their position was not merely risky , but downright perilous . It was as if Phil Sanford had read his mind . Sanford had been silently brooding , and when they were on the San Diego Freeway he had given voice to his concern . " Mike , you made me a little nervous back there with your talk . You almost sounded defeatist . " " I 'm anything but defeatist , " Barrett had replied . " I 'm determined to win this one . We all are . It just worries me going into battle with a rifle when , if there 'd been time , I might have had a rocket launcher . " " Whenever I called you or Abe , you sounded busy enough , like you were getting some big guns on our side . " " We are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're big enough and the very best . In fact , before we sit down to lunch , I 'd better J ! P bring you up to date . " As they careened over the freeway , Barrett had recited the names of the defense witnesses that had already been lined up . They had Sir Esmond Ingram , the elderly , cranky , and celebrated onetime Oxford don , who had years ago hailed The Seven Minutes as being " one of the most honest , sensitive , and distinguished works of art created in modern Western literature , " a blurb which Sanford House had used extensively in promoting the novel . In his retirement , Sir Esmond had devoted himself to three marriages and divorces , to English girls half his age . He had given his energies to foundations supporting a world calendar , a uni-  | versal language , and a crusade for vegetarianism . He had been twice jailed , briefly , for lying down before No. to Downing Street in protest against nuclear armament . Because of Sir Esmond 's growing reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Esmond 's championship of the Jadway book might be weakened . But Zelkin had pointed out that elderly Englishmen were understood by Americans to be consistently eccentric , and that an English accent from the witness stand always carried authority and was effective and tended to intimidate a jury , and , besides , who in the hell else was there of such a reputation who had ever praised the book ? Sir Esmond had been reached by transatlantic telephone in his Sussex cottage , and his enthusiasm for the book ( although Barrett had a vague suspicion that the English don thought they were talking about Lady Chatterley 's Lover ) had been as great as ever . Yes , he would be delighted to cooperate against " the book burners , " provided his sponsors could convince the United States immigration people that he was not an anarchist . Zelkin had been able to so convince immigration , and Sir Esmond Ingram would be one of their chief witnesses . And , Barrett had reassured Sanford , there were others being assembled for different purposes . Guy Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often written about how much he had been favorably influenced by Jadway 's book , had agreed to be a defense witness . Efforts were being made to obtain the support of two or three other literary experts who admired The Seven Minutes . Then , anticipating the District Attorney 's effort to prove , through Jerry Griffith and additional witnesses , that the book 's prurient appeal endangered the youth of America and general community security , both Barrett and Zelkin had sought witnesses to counteract such a contention . For the defense , they had acquired the services of Dr. Yale Finegood , a psychiatric authority on juvenile violence and delinquency , and of Dr. Rolf Lagergren , a Swedish specialist in sex surveys whose findings had earned him international renown and a visiting professorship at Reardon College in Wisconsin . Both Finegood and Lagergren attributed juvenile crime to causes other than obscene literature and motion pictures , and their enlistment on the side of the defense had been a reason for some optimism .  | " But make no mistake about one thing , " Barrett had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The real defendant in this trial will not be Ben Fremont , but J J Jadway . In every y major case of this kind , a central issue has always been the jj author 's motivation and purpose in writing the book , because this would help to establish that his work had some social importance . Now , this is thin ice , and we have to determine whether we dare face crossing it or should detour . We have a choice . So has the District Attorney . Each side has to determine how it intends to proceed before the fireworks begin . " " Exactly what do you mean , Mike ? " " If we do n't have sufficient proof that Jadway 's intent was bedlll yond reproach in his writing The Seven Minutes , we 'd be better off asserting that an author 's intent has nothing to do with obscenity , which has been done successfully before . We have Justice Douglas ' dissent in the Ginzburg case to hide behind . Douglas argued , A book should stand on its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the wiles used in selling it . ' Even if we hold to this , we still might be pushed out on that thin ice by the prosecution . If that happened , we could always fall back on the argument Charles Rembar used in one Fanny Hill appeal . You see , when Rembar defended Lady Chatterley earlier , he had had no trouble proving that Lawrence 's intentions in writing the book were of the best . But in defending Fanny Hill there was rough sledding , because the only evidence about the author 's motives showed that he had written the book cynically , for crassly commercial reasons . Remember ? John Cleland was in debtor 's prison . He needed money to get out . A publisher approached him and offered him twenty guineas , enough to get him out of jail , if he wrote a salacious novel to order , one that might sell . So , presumably , Cleland wrote Fanny Hill for that reason , for the money to be freed , and he was released , and the publisher made ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right , " said Sanford . " How did the defense lawyer explain that ? " " Rembar explained it sensibly . Cleland 's motives , he insisted , were a question of literary history , not of law . As Rembar put it , The courts simply could not decide , two and a quarter centuries Iil later , what had gone on inside Cleland 's head . ' What mattered  | was the end result , the book , its ideas , its view of life , not the personal reasons that had made an author write his book . Besides , argued Rembar , It would be both futile and unbecoming . . . for . Courts to inquire into the diverse springs of artistic endeavor . The miserable record made by artists as critics of their own work  --  the ludicrous verbalizations that we sometimes hear from talented people in the nonverbal arts  --  shows that their stated plans are of little consequence ; what they create is of the greatest consequence : " " What was the final verdict of the judges ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , " said Barrett sourly . " The judges voted three to two for suppression , because they did n't accept Rembar 's arguments generally . " " But you indicated that we have another choice ? " " We do . The other choice is to face up to what is ahead of us . The preponderance of legal opinion holds that an author 's motivation and intent is one of the important issues in holding a book to be obscene or not . Take Judge Woolsey in the Ulysses trial . He observed , In any case where a book is claimed to be obscene it must first be determined whether the intent with which it was written was what is called , according to the usual phrase , pornographic  --  that is , written for the purpose of exploiting obscenity . ' Later , Judge van Pelt Bryan , in one of the Lady Chatterley cases , added , The sincerity and honesty of purpose of an author as expressed in a manner in which a book is written and in which his theme and ideas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of literary and intellectual merit . Here , as in the Ulysses case , there is no question about Lawrence 's honesty and sincerity of purposes , artistic integrity and lack of intention to appeal to prurient interest : " Barrett had paused and glanced at Sanford 's troubled profile . " That 's our issue , Phil . Did Jadway write his book honestly , sincerely , with artistic integrity ? That 's the question we have to answer affirmatively and without reservation . It is a question that will be in every juror 's mind . Either we pussyfoot and back away or we set out to prove , beyond a shadow of a doubt , that Jadway did not write this book for commercial reasons but wrote it for artistic and moral reasons , so that it has that necessary social im-  | portance . Anyway , Abe and I have made our choice . We 've decided to attempt to prove Jadway 's good intentions . " Sanford had groaned . " How are you ever going to prove that ? Jadway 's been dead a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was practically unknown when he died . Nothing remains to prove his good intentions . You know how hard I 've dug on my end . I could n't turn up a thing . He left nothing , and he can tell us nothing . Dead men tell no tales , to coin an expression . " " But ghosts can be very impressive , " Barrett had said calmly . He had pointed off to his right . " By the way , there 's the UCLA campus . Jerry Griffith 's school . I think we may be doing a little research there . " Sanford had showed no interest in the Los Angeles campus of the University of California . " What do you mean about Jadway 's ghost ? " " Few people die without leaving some heritage behind . Maybe it 's only something of themselves they revealed or bequeathed to friends or acquaintances . We 've been making use of the budget you gave us for European investigators . We have several scurrying around Paris , and now other points as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've learned there was an Italian artist , da Vecchi by name , who used to frequent the cafes in Paris where Jadway hung out in the thirties . We 've learned that da Vecchi is alive , and that he once painted a portrait of Jadway . If so , that 'll be the first pictorial representation of him to come to light . Anyway , we 're trying to locate the painter . Then we 're on the trail of a Contessa Daphne Orsoni . She 's a Dallas woman who married a rich Italian count . Shortly after Jadway published his book , he was vacationing in Venice , and the Contessa had heard of Jadway 's ' naughty ' novel and she invited him to a masked ball at her palazzo . We 've traced her to Spain . Apparently she has a place on the Costa Brava . But to invoke the good ghost , our main hope is still centered on the Frenchman who published the underground version of The Seven Minutes ? " " Christian Leroux , " interrupted Sanford . " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news I gave you a. few days ago . Etoile Press has expired , but Leroux is very much among the living . As long as Leroux is alive , we can resurrect Jadway 's shade . If we can get our  | ands on the French publisher , we 'll have our own star witness , the one we need to offset the Griffith boy 's testimony . After all , Leroux did bring out The Seven Minutes . He must have believed in and he must have known a good deal about the book 's author . tic 's our man . We 're on his trail and getting warm . Kimura hoped to have some word on this today . " " We 've absolutely got to get Leroux , " said Sanford . Barrett snorted . " You 're telling me ? " A few minutes later he had dropped Phil Sanford off at the Beverly Hills Hotel , where Sanford had reserved a bungalow , and then Barrett had gone on to the office on Wilshire Boulevard . He had spent two hours conferring with Zelkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the secretary he shared with Zelkin . He enjoyed working with Donna . She was an eyesore , henna hair , narrow eyes , overly powdered bloated face , frumpy clothes on a shapeless body , but she was a delight because she was as trustworthy as a madonna , fiercely devoted and loyal , and had such astonishing skills at the stenotyper , the electric typewriter , and the calculator that Barrett sometimes thought she was plugged into an electrical outlet herself . After Kimura had telephoned that he would be late , Barrett had buzzed Zelkin , and together they had gone to meet Philip Sanford for lunch . And here they were now . Barrett realized that his forehead was ablaze from the sun and that the glass in his hand was empty and that Zelkin was introducing Sanford to Leo Kimura . Pulling his chair in under the umbrella , Barrett gave Kimura a mock bow , and Kimura bowed back seriously , then settled down in the place left for him . Balancing his bulging briefcase on his knees , he was al- i ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you famished ? " asked Barrett . " Famished , " said Kimura . " I feel like the whole Donner Party in one . " But then he was at once apologetic , like a servant who had considered his own comfort before his employer 's . " I can wait , if you prefer to talk first . " Barrett had great affection for the Nisei attorney . Kimura had a crew cut , a saffron-complected face with features that seemed impassive , and the steely , springy appearance of the kind of person they shoot out of cannons.  | " We prefer to eat and talk , " said Barrett . Zelkin was already signaling for menus , and after the menus came they ordered sparingly . The moment that the captain had gone , they all concentrated on Kimura . " Well , " Zelkin inquired , " what 's the latest , Leo ? " Kimura had finished extracting papers from his briefcase . Closing the briefcase , propping it against his chair , he laid his papers on the table before him and looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the best for the last . First , Norman C. Quandt . " He addressed himself to their new client . " Mr. Sanford , I have here the information you dictated on how you purchased the rights to The Seven Minutes from Mr. Quandt . Now that you are here in person before me , I would like the opportunity to learn whether anything was omitted . Could you review the facts of the acquisition once more ? " Sanford shrugged . " I doubt if there 's anything I can add . However , I 'll be glad to run through it again . Two years ago my father sent me to represent him at the Frankfurt Book Fair . I was taken to dinner one night by an old friend of my father 's , Herr Karl Graeber , who owns a solid and well-known publishing house in Munich . We got to discussing the new freedom in writing and publishing , and Graeber said it was a good thing , because soon many works that had long deserved publication might find their way to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he admired first and foremost was something called The Seven Minutes . He had hoped to publish it himself , in the period just as Hitler was coming to power , but that had been impossible and he 'd been lucky to flee with his life . Since he was re-established in Germany , I asked him why he did n't undertake it once more . He said that by now he was too old to begin a fight against the Bonn conservatives , and , besides , he was now specializing in textbooks and religious books , and a book such as Jadway 's in his catalogue might harm the rest of his list . Graeber felt that there was far more freedom in America , and hence the book was more likely to have its first accepted public appearance in our country . He felt also that my father 's imprint might give the book a certain protection . I asked who owned the rights to The Seven Minutes . Graeber said he had heard that Leroux had sold the rights to some small borderline publisher in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1toile edition and asked me to show it to Wesley R. , my father . I was already bringing a number of new books back from the Frankfurt Fair , and so I added the jaclway book to the rest of them . I took a ship home , and since there was plenty of time to read , and what Graeber had told me about the Jadway novel titillated me , I read it . Before I even finished it , I knew that it was nothing I could show my father . It just was n't his type of literature . So I showed him the other books I 'd found , but not this one . Then last year , as you know , my father fell ill , and I was temporarily put in charge of Sanford House . I was eager to find something unusual and provocative , and I remembered the Jadway book . I thought the timing was right . So I looked up Norman C. Quandt . " " He was in New York ? " asked Kimura , brandishing a ballpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw him there . Quandt was nothing more than a mail-order publisher of hardcore pornography , original paperbacks that specialized in sadism and masochism . And he was in trouble . He had just been tried in a United States district court on charges brought by the Postmaster General that he was mailing obscene matter . He had been found guilty . He was appealing the lower-court decision and hoping to bring the matter before the United States Supreme Court . He was pressed for money to fight his case , and he was more than happy to sell off his rights to The Seven Minutes . Within three days the contracts were drawn and signed , and I had the Jadway book for five thousand dollars . That 's all I can tell you , Leo . I 'm afraid I 've given you nothing new . " Kimura had been checking Sanford 's recital with the pages before him . " And after that you never saw Quandt again ? " " Never , " said Sanford . " I followed his appeal to the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court , purely on a technicality , reversed the decision of the lower court by a five-tofour vote . Quandt was acquitted . Of course , he took an awful beating in the appeals . It was clear he 'd been running a shoddy operation , pandering to the most perverted tastes , and I suppose he knew better than to tangle with the postal authorities again . Anyway , when I was getting ready to publish The Seven Minutes , and we needed more jacket copy on Jadway , I thought Quandt  | might be able to help . You know , I figured he might have heard something from Leroux . So I did call Quandt . He was no longer at the old stand . That 's when I learned he 'd given up publishing and moved to Pittsburgh ? " " It says Philadelphia here , " said Kimura . " I 'm sorry . Yes , Philadelphia . I could n't locate him there either , and I had no idea what business he was in by then . " " He is in the motion-picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Kimura . Barrett sat up . " No kidding , Leo ? When did you find that out ? " " Today . But unfortunately there is no Quandt listed in our telephone directories . " " If he 's in the movie business , he should n't be hard to find , " said Zelkin . For the first time , Kimura smiled faintly . " Mr. Zelkin , there are movies and there are movies . Anyway , I have some leads , and I expect one should eventually bring us to Mr. Quandt . " Sanford had turned worriedly to Barrett . " Mike , you 're not thinking of putting that Quandt on the witness stand if you find him , are you ? " " Heaven forbid , " said Barrett . " No . But he might provide us with some vital information on Jadway 's life . In fact , the very information you 'd hoped to get from him before , something he might have heard from Leroux . " Barrett directed himself to Kimura once more . " Which brings us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Leroux ? " " Christian Leroux , " said Kimura , savoring the name . " I was keeping him for last . " He shuffled his notes , until he had found what he wanted . " Christian Leroux . Most hopeful . I have just heard from our man in Paris . He tracked Leroux to an apartment on the Left Bank . A hundred-franc tip to the concierge produced the information that Leroux had just gone off to the Riviera and had made a reservation at the Hotel Balmoral in Monte Carlo . He should be there any  --  well , he should have arrived already . Our Paris man hired a private detective in Nice , a Monsieur Dubois , and fully instructed him . This Dubois drove up to Monte Carlo . He will be in the Hotel Balmoral waiting for Leroux to check in . " " Very thorough , " said Barrett . " And most hopeful , Leo , as you put it . "  | " Wonderful , wonderful , " said Sanford , plucking a cigarette from a patch pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheaf of notes from the other papers . " As to the Griffith family , I have not been able to add substantially to the dossier we have assembled . A few more facts on the backgrounds of Frank Griffith , his wife , Ethel Griffith . No further data on the niece who lives with them , Margaret or Maggie Russell . No chinks in the family armor  --  yet . " " What about the boy ? " inquired Zelkin . " I was coming to him , " said Kimura , flipping the pages . " I am afraid we will have to press our investigation harder . I have a start ? " " A start ? " wailed Zelkin . " We 'll be selecting a jury in a couple of days . The minute the jury is impaneled , sworn in , the trial begins . " " Unless one has a start , there can never be a finish , " said Kimura . " Forgive me , but there is a difficulty in researching one who is still of college age . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are acquainted with certain facts . Jerry Griffith was an honor student in prep school . He is now in his third year of college , and he is not doing so well academically . I visited UCLA today . I remembered there are counselors for the students . I was able to find Jerry Griffith 's counselor . She said she could n't discuss Jerry  --  there 's a rule against giving out information on any student unless there 's clearance from on high . So I went through the required procedure and finally got this clearance from the Dean of the College of Letters and Science . The counselor was notified that she could discuss Jerry with any person from our office . That was a start . " Kimura 's painstaking , detailed account was making Barrett restless . " What did the counselor have to say , Leo ? " " Once the clearance came , she was eager to be entirely cooperative . It turned out she has had several meetings with Jerry and is most disturbed by what he has done . Because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I felt that she was too important for me to interrogate . I felt it would be better if you or Mr. Zelkin saw her . She is a Mrs. Henrietta Lott . I have arranged an appointment for either one of you this afternoon . Mrs. Lott will be extremely busy later in the week , so I thought I must take advantage of her readiness to discuss Jerry today . " He pulled free  | a slip of paper and held it out tentatively . " Her name , office number  --  the academic counselors ' offices are in the Administration Building  --  and the time of the appointment . I hope one of you ? " Barrett reached for the slip . " I 'll take it , " he said to Zelkin . " I intended to drop by UCLA later in the afternoon , anyway . They 've got a sharp English department , and I want to learn whether any member of the faculty understands the book well enough to talk about it sympathetically in court . Before that , I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be out pounding the pavements , too , " said Zelkin . " Leo , " said Barrett to Kimura , " you 'd better stick close to the office , or let Donna know where she can find you if you go out , so we do n't miss that call from Monte Carlo . Once we 've got that French publisher , we 've got a real chance . Here comes the food now . . . . Well , Phil , old boy , how does it feel to be where the action is ? " Sanford stretched and beamed . " It 's beginning to feel good , now that I can see what 's being done . I tell you , if that District Attorney  --  Duncan  --  if Duncan knew half of what we 're doing , he 'd throw in the towel . " Barrett removed his sunglasses and made a wry face . " Do n't be too sure of that . If we knew half of what he is doing , we might want to kill ourselves . One thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . " FoR ELMO DUNCAN , the telephone call and the summons early this morning had been unexpected , and his presence here this early afternoon , in this renowned prelate 's office , had about it an air of the strange and the mysterious . Waiting now in the Chancery office for the appearance of His Eminence , Cardinal MacManus , the District Attorney was again conscious of the empty velour armchair facing the portrait of the Pope that hung on an otherwise barren wall . When the Cardinal 's secretary had escorted him into this room , Duncan had been told that every prince of the Church had such a chair facing a portrait of the Pope , a chair kept ready should His Holiness ever pay an unexpected visit in person . Tradition . Elmo Duncan continued his survey of the Chancery office . Every decoration gave the impression of venerable age and con-  | tinuity . Again , tradition . Rich damask draperies framed the windows . The fireplace hearth was charred , blackened by years of providing warmth . On the old desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drooping carved figure of the Saviour , a crucifix which might have been carried by Junipero Serra in his trampings through California . Only one inharmonious object intruded . This on the prince 's desk also . A flashy late-model dictating machine . The same model that Duncan had in his very own office . Although somewhat reassured that he and the prince of the Church might have more in common than he had feared , Duncan still felt uneasy . He yearned for a cigarette . But as a Protestant in the inner headquarters of the Los Angeles diocese of the Catholic Church , he had no idea of the restrictions or , indeed , of the Cardinal 's personal quirks . Duncan decided not to smoke . Once more Duncan speculated on the early-morning summons . The telephone call had come from the Very Reverend Monsignor Voorhes . " District Attorney Duncan ? " Monsignor Voorhes had introduced himself briskly . " I am secretary to His Eminence , Cardinal MacManus , Archbishop of Los Angeles . I am telephoning at the personal request of Cardinal MacManus . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable interest . " " Yes ? " " I refer to the forthcoming legal trial regarding the book The Seven Minutes , and your prosecution of this work . The Cardinal feels that your civic office and his church office may have a common goal in this affair and may benefit by mutually cooperating . " " Well , I  --  I 'd certainly welcome cooperation from any source . But it 's not clear to me what you , or rather His Eminence has in mind . " " It would gratify the Church to have this work obliterated . The Cardinal feels he can achieve this end by being useful to your cause . " " Do you have anything specific in mind ? " " Yes . That is the purpose of my call , Mr. Duncan . His Eminence would like to meet with you at your earliest convenience to explain . " " I 'd be glad to see him today . "  | " Excellent . Perhaps it would be wisest if the meeting were to take place in Cardinal MacManus ' Chancery office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near downtown Los Angeles . Would two o'clock this afternoon be satisfactory ? " " I 'll see that it is . You can tell His Eminence that I 'll be there at two . And be sure to let him know how much I appreciate his ? his interest in this case . " Later , when he had joined Luther Yerkes , Harvey Underwood , and Irwin Blair for a business lunch on the patio of Yerkes ' BelAir palace , Duncan had brought up the curious call and wondered what it could mean . Yerkes had warned Duncan immediately not to expect any concrete evidence from Cardinal MacManus . " The Church has a continuing stake in censorship , " Yerkes had said , " so he 'll probably assure you that you 'll have the Lord in your corner . Do n't expect more than that . " Then the subject of Duncan 's appointment with Cardinal MacManus had been dismissed , because there was im portant work to be done . This very evening a fund-raising affair sponsored by the Strength Through Decency League was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The principal speaker , as arranged by Irwin Blair , would be District Attorney Elmo Duncan . The title of his speech would be " The Freedom to Corrupt . " It was to the revising and strengthening of this prepared speech that the four of them had devoted the rest of the lunch hour . And now Elmo Duncan stood in the Chancery office of the Los Angeles diocese , waiting to learn what the Cardinal would offer that might be " useful " to his case . Would the offer be , as Yerkes had so cynically suggested , the blessings of the Lord ? Or would it be something more substantial ? " Mr. Duncan , I am sorry to have kept you . How very kind of you to come . " The voice had issued from the far corner of the office , and Duncan whirled around to see Cardinal MacManus shutting a door behind him as he lifted a welcoming hand . Duncan had seen the Cardinal 's picture in the newspapers frequently , and in these photographs he had always looked his age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Roman collar and a black suit instead of his elaborate ceremonial vestments , he resembled the face and  | nc in the photographs  --  the same cottony white hair , baggy s , wrinkled skin , hunched back . What was not the same , what MAas evident when seen in person , was the Cardinal 's alertness . Although limping , he advanced across the room rapidly , his Itunken eyes lively , one bony hand vigorously brushing lint off his black jacket and the other hand extended . Duncan took the prelate 's hand . " Cardinal MacManus , this is s pleasure . " " My pleasure , sir , and your kindness to accommodate me by coming such a distance . It was not my age or infirmities that kept ate from going to you . It was , in fact , my knowledge that it would serve neither of us  --  might , indeed , be misrepresented in certain circles  --  if church and state were not kept separate in the public view , despite the truism that the religious and the secular may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Eminence , " said Duncan . " Make yourself comfortable , " said the Cardinal , steering Duncan toward the long brown sofa . Courteously Duncan waited for the prelate to settle himself on the sofa , and then Duncan sat down a few feet from him . " I shall not mince words , " the Cardinal said . His voice was dry and brittle , and sounded like wrapping paper being crumpled and balled in a fist . " When one is as old as I am , or as young as you are , one has learned not to waste words or time with interminable social amenities . My secretary informed you of my interest in the trial you are about to undertake and the Church 's desire to assist you as best it can . " " He did tell me that , and nothing more . So I am not quite certain what . . . " " What to expect , eh ? You may be doubtful of what aid I can give you , and if so , that is understandable . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your crusade and to promise you my prayers . Well , indeed , I do bless your enterprise and I do pledge you my prayers . We have a rather good one on behalf of decent literature , one which received the imprimatur of the Archbishop of Cincinnati . " At once , eyes cast upward , jowls shaking , he began to recite in a deep , crackling voice . " 0 God , Who hast said , " Suffer the Little Children to come unto Me , " assist and bless us in our efforts to arouse public opinion , so that we may  | eliminate obscene and indecent literature from bookracks and newsstands . With Your Divine Guidance , may the laws be en forced so that this type of literature may no longer exist in our country and throughout the world . " He caught his breath . wheezed asthmatically , then resumed , " ' Virgin Mary , whose life is an inspiration to all , watch over us and intercede for us so that our efforts may be successful , through Jesus Christ , Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you , Your Eminence . " Cardinal MacManus ' hairy nostrils sniffed . " If that were all l had to offer you , you would have no reason to thank me . It is not all that I have to offer you . I have much , much more to offer . " 1 He scratched inside his stiff Roman collar , and the great jewel set in the heavy ring on one finger glittered , as he sat lost in thought for several moments . Then he crossed his arms , stared at the ceiling , and began to speak quietly . " I have said we have a common cause . And we do . Our enemies would like to believe that the Church 's only interest is in morality and religion at the sacrifice of freedom of speech . This is not true . We dwell in an ordered society . To keep it ordered and civilized , we must have authority and we must have certain restricWithout restrictions , we would have no democratic freedoms left after a time . We would have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made right . The Church wants freedom of speech . We wish to restrict only those who would abuse this freedom . As a Catholic editor has remarked , we do not ask for prudery , we ask only for prudence . We are not , as this editor went on , attempting to be arbiters of the national taste where an adult 's freedom of choice is concerned . We are interested only in curbing obvious obscenity and preventing its corruption of youth . We are defenders of real literature , even vulgar literature if it has social value and is sincere . We are the opponents only of pornography , of pornography that disguises itself as literature but has no purpose other than to drive the young into lives of sin . This the Church stands against . I can not believe that your law-enforcement office of the state thinks differently from us . It was not a priest delivering a church sermon , but a spokesman of the Chicago Police Department , who made the statement , Obscene literature is wanton , depraved , nauseat-  | ing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind at any age . Obscene publications mock the marriage vow , scorn chastity and fidelity , and glorify adultery , fornication , prostitution and unnatural sex relations . ' I assume , then , Mr. Duncan , we are of one mind about books like The Seven Minutes ? " " We are of the same mind , " said Duncan with conviction . " We do n't want to weaken freedom , but rather reinforce it by eliminating those who would corrupt it . " " Very well . Now , in 1938 the Catholic bishops of the United States , also enlisting the leaders of many other faiths , established NODL  --  the National Organization for Decent Literature  --  and they did this , as they stated , to set in motion the moral forces of the entire country . . . against the lascivious type of literature which threatens moral , social and national life . ' Normally , in a local community action , it would be from NODL 's successor , CDL  --  Citizens for Decent Literature  --  that you might expect to receive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Seven Minutes as an extraordinarily destructive force , because your case against it exceeds national boundaries and takes on international importance , and because the Church is uniquely equipped to give you special support in this trial , the Church has seen fit to extend cooperation from its very highest level . " " The very highest ? ? " Duncan repeated , bewildered . " From the Vatican itself . I have received instructions from the Cardinal in charge of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in the Vatican . Mr. Duncan , it is at the personal request of His Holiness the Pope that the Sacred Congregation is volunteering its entire resources to be used on behalf of your case . " Duncan 's confusion was complete . " You mean the Pope  --  His Holiness  --  he knows about our trial ? I 'm surprised  --  delighted , that he is interested , of course  --  but I ca n't understand why he . . . " " I will enlighten you , " said Cardinal MacManus . " And then I will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To enlighten you , to explain when the seed of our interest in a case such as yours was planted , I must start at the very beginning . Soon after Gutenberg made it possible for books to appear in great quantities in Western Europe  --  that is to say , after 1454 ? the Vatican realized that it must adjust itself to this new phe-  | nomenon . Until then the pulpit had been the primary means by which the priest disseminated knowledge and faith . Now books offered to become a greater transmission agent for good . At the same time , the Vatican became aware of the power of books to spread evil , to subvert men 's minds and hearts and cause them to behave in ways harmful to society and religion . In 1557 , under the guidance of Pope Paul IV , the Church acted . It drew up a list of books condemned for reasons of sensuality , mysticism , or heretical ideas and it published this condemned list as the first Index Librorum Expurgatorius . During the four centuries since its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date and reissued from time to time . Have you ever seen a copy ? " " No , " said Duncan . " Let me show you a recent edition . " The Cardinal rose , hobbled to his desk , picked up a small gray paperbound volume , and returned to the sofa with it . " Here it is , five hundred and ten pages , listing approximately five thousand condemned books , each title listed in the language in which it was originally written . " He Il , opened the Index . " Allow me to translate a few remarks from a preface prepared for the 1929 edition , a preface included in this more recent edition which appeared in 1946 . It begins , " the Cardinal translated slowly , " ' Throughout its life the Church had alwaYs to endure tremendous persecutions of all kinds while the number of its heroes and martyrs grew steadily . But today there is a much more dangerous threat coming from hell : the immoral press . There is no worse danger than that and therefore the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinal MacManus halted , read silently to himself , and then he resumed . " Three or four paragraphs later , the preface clarifies the Church 's position . It would be wrong to say that condemnation of bad books is a violation of human freedom , for it is clear above everything that the Church teaches that Man is endowed with freedom by his Creator and that the Church has always upheld this doctrine against whoever dared to deny it . Only those suffering from that plague called liberalism can say that these restrictions put by a legitimate power to libertinism are limitations of Man 's free will : as if Man , being free of his will , were therefore authorized always to do what he wants . ' Then the next paragraph . It is clear , therefore , that Church authorities , by preventing  | through laws the diffusion of errors , by trying to take out of Circulation those books apt to corrupt morals and Faith , do nothing but save frail human nature from those sins that by its very Weakness it can easily incur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1917 , the authority for handling the prohibition of books belonged to the Congregation of the Index . After that , the functions of the Index were taken over by the Curia office known as the Section for the Censure of Books , under the authority of the Supreme Congregation of the Holy Office . But because the Holy Office was long associated in the minds of many with the Inquisition , and to appease our Protestant brethren , the Holy Office was abolished in 1965 by Pope Paul VI . The work of the Index was then taken over by the less conservative Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , and it is this office with which we are concerned . Is what I have explained perfectly clear to you ? " " Absolutely , Your Eminence . " " Mr. Duncan , there are two principal reasons why a book may be condemned by the Church and thus listed in the Index . As far back as 1399 , a manuscript was forbidden if it taught or told stories sensual or related to matters of flesh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion ' or attacked or ridiculed Catholic dogma or the Catholic hierarchy . ' In short , to this very day , a book may be condemned on the grounds of immorality on the one hand or heresy on the other hand . Because of immorality , you will find in the pages of the Index such authors as Casanova for his Memoirs and Gustave Flaubert for Madame Bovary , as well as Balzac , D'Annunzio , Dumas Ore and fils for their sensual novels , and as recently as 1952 , Alberto Moravia for his obscene books . Because of their anticlericalism , unsound theology , outright heresy , you will find in the Index such authors as Laurence Sterne for A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy , Edward Gibbon for The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , Bergson , Croce , Spinoza , Kant , Zola , and more lately , Jean-Paul Sartre , for their irreligious commentaries , histories , philosophies . But very few authors have been condemned for both immorality and heresy . One of the few thus doubly condemned was Andre Gide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Index .  | " And one of the others doubly condemned in the Index was a novelist whose work was originally published in the English language . He was the second English-speaking novelist to appear in the Index  --  the first , incidentally , was Samuel Richardson for Pamela , proscribed by the Vatican in 1744 ? but the second English-speaking novelist to be condemned by inclusion in the Index , and he was condemned for both immorality and heresy , was  --  well , here , have a look for yourself . " Duncan accepted the Index and followed the Cardinal 's finger down page 239 , and there , between " Ittigius , Thomas , " and " Juenin , Gaspar , " stood the name " Jadway , J J , " and after his name the following : " The Seven Minutes . Decr . S. Off . 19 apr. 1937 . " Duncan looked up with surprise . " Jadway 's actually in here . " Cardinal MacManus nodded . " Yes indeed . Had you not known that he was in the Index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief about the author there was some mention , I 'm sure  --  but I did n't give it too much attention at the time . I had little knowledge of the Index , although I did assign my assistant to research it further , and I was n't sure this would have much relevancy in a courtroom . I thought I 'd make a passing reference to it , once I was certain that the Index still existed . " " Now you know it does , " said the Cardinal . " And let me emphasize why The Seven Minutes is condemned in these pages . I have said it was a forbidden book because of its immorality and its heretical attitude toward the Christian faith . True . But by the 1930s obscenity alone would not have made the Church condemn The Seven Minutes , especially since its obscure imprint , its appearance in a country not the author 's own , and its immediate banning gave it only a limited circulation . If you look through those pages you will find no mention of the Obelisk Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by James Joyce , Henry Miller , William Burroughs . No , it has taken more than a charge of obscenity to earn the condemnation of the Index in recent times . Just as Boccaccio 's Decameron was not placed in the Index for its indecency , its immorality , alone . On those grounds , The Decameron might have escaped censorship . It was Boccaccio 's blasphemy , his attack on the clergy , this coupled with obscenity ,  | that earned him a place in the Index . Indeed , when The DeCameron was reissued with the sinning monks and nuns replaced by sinning noblemen and ladies , the Council of Trent was satisfied that the blasphemy had been expurgated . His Holiness then saw fit to remove Boccaccio 's work from the Index . So , you see , Mr. Duncan , it is not immorality alone , but a compounding of immorality with blasphemy , that most surely brings the Church 's condemnation . It is this compounding of salacity with heresy that forced the Holy Office to proscribe The Seven Minutes . Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring myself to repeat my feelings about the passage where the author has his sinful heroine  --  heroine ! atheistic prostitute , I would call her  --  dream of Our Lord and martyred saints of the Church and take His name and their names in vain . A work inspired by the Devil , no less . " Breathing nasally , the Cardinal tried to regain his composure . " But , foul though it was , The Seven Minutes might have remained a relic in the lists of the Index , out of print and forgotten , and of no further concern to the Church . In its time , as a result of the Index , it was banned in all Catholic countries , and , because of its obscene content , in other nations as well . It had enjoyed its one moment of evil and it was no more . However , when a heretofore reputable New York publishing house determined to revive it , the Church hierarchy was alarmed . I can not say whether the Church would have acted against it alone . Perhaps we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old resentments in many quarters about our alleged repressiveness in earlier centuries . Fortunately , one man , an instrument of the state , and outside our faith , had the courage to rise above fear and strike at the horrendous beast loosed by the New York commercialists . You were and are that man , Mr. Duncan , and we are proud to support your brave crusade . " Duncan glowed . " Thank you , Your Eminence . I am moved by your words . " " I promised you more than words , " said Cardinal MacManus . " I promised you help . " " Anything you can offer I shall appreciate . " " The Holy Father has authorized me to offer you the services of Father Sarfatti  --  one of the two priests in the Vatican directly in  | charge of the Index  --  as a leading witness for your prosecution Before proscribing The Seven Minutes , the members of the Hol Order carefully investigated the author , J Jadway , while he wa , , still alive . The findings of three and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am authorized to inform you that Father Sarfatti is prepared to make public , for the benefit of you ; prosecution , not only his own experience with Jadway , but all of the classified information the Church has on the infamous book and its equally infamous author . " " About this information , " said Duncan eagerly , " I 'm curious to learn if you can give me any idea of its ? " " Did you know that the author , J J Jadway , was a Catholic when he wrote the book ? Did you know that he was excommunicated before his death for producing this work ? Did you know that his death , following his excommunication , was not accidental , as the newspaper reports have been saying , but that he died by his own hand , as a suicide ? " Duncan 's jaw fell open , and he sat dazed on the sofa . " Jadway killed himself ? " " After his book appeared he committed suicide , and his remains were cremated . " Duncan was on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fumbled for a cigarette . " No  --  I did n't know any of that . Outside of this room , no one in the United States knows that . But they should know . Everyone should know . " With a grunt , Cardinal MacManus rose from the sofa . " It is the truth . There is more . Do you wish Father Sarfatti as a witness for the prosecution ? " " Do I wish him ? Yes , a thousand times yes , I must have him . " " When do you want him in Los Angeles ? " " Within three days , four at the most , if possible . " " It is possible . I will notify the Vatican . Father Sarfatti will be here . And the Lord will bless our cause . We are ever mindful of St. Augustine 's instruction , He who created us without our help will not save us without our consent . ' We want America to be saved , and you will help us get the consent of our citizens . Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | LEAVING BEN FREMONT 's Book Emporium , Mike Barrett decided to walk the three blocks to the Oakwood Branch Library . After depositing another dime in the parking meter , he left his car and set out on foot . Since Oakwood was nearer the beach than Beverly Hills , where he had finished lunch less than an hour ago , the air was cleaner , less muggy , more invigorating , and he inhaled deeply as he strode through the shopping district . Barrett reviewed the conversation he had just concluded with Ben Fremont . It amused Barrett that the thin , nearsighted bookseller was now less unprepossessing than when they had first met on the afternoon of Fremont 's arrest . On that afternoon , Fremont had been shriveled by fright and his speech reduced to a gurgle . But the subsequent attention he had received had inflated his ego . He enjoyed receiving the sympathies of that minority of customers , friends , fellow bookmen , who considered him a heroic martyr . He reveled even more in his sudden role as notorious pawn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the press and television . In his tone of voice Barrett had detected the faintest resentment that J J Jadway and The Seven Minutes were getting more recognition than he himself . At one point , Fremont had shyly admitted that his wife was keeping a scrapbook . Further , his bearing was straighter , his speech more authoritative , and the old whining and cringing had all but disappeared . Barrett understood , and liked him . Most men , the very ones who live lives of quiet desperation , receive public recognition only twice in their lives , with their birth notice and their obituary , neither of which can they read . Life had given this obscure bookseller an unexpected bonus . He was , incredibly , fleetingly , a public figure . But whenever Barrett talked to him , Fremont would eventually become realistic about his status . He was the defendant , under criminal indictment . Incarceration in a jail was a possibility . And so , when Barrett appeared , Fremont was cooperative and before long realistic , as he had been for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The police had confiscated eighty copies of The Seven Minutes , and Sanford House 's sales-department accounts showed that an advance order of one hundred copies had been shipped to Fremont 's Book Emporium . Were those figures correct ? " Yes , sir , Mr. Barrett . " Did that mean  | that Fremont had sold twenty copies before his arrest ? " Yes , sir , except , wait , no , I had one copy at home which my wife was reading . So that means I sold nineteen , two of them to the police officers who arrested me . " Did Fremont have any record of the other seventeen customers who had purchased the book ? " Only those who charged it , and that would take some looking up . Most of my customers pay cash . " Would Fremont mind going through his charge-account records covering the short period between his receiving the shipment and his arrest , and keep an eye open for Jerry Griffith 's name ? " I can answer that right off , Mr. Barrett . None of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps Jerry had come in and paid cash for the book ? " I doubt it . I 've got a good memory for names and faces . The boy 's picture has been in all the papers , and I do n't remember ever seeing him in this store . Of course , there 's a hundred bookstores around L.A. where he might have got a copy . " Barrett realized that , and he already had Kimura and several aides canvassing other stores with photographs of Jerry Griffith in hand . " I sure envy those other stores , Mr. Barrett . They must be selling copies like hotcakes , and all because of me . " Barrett had doubted that many stores outside Oakwood dared to display the book . Most were awaiting the outcome of the trial . " Not all of them , Mr. Barrett , " Fremont had said knowingly . This had given Barrett pause . He had eyed the bookseller closely . Did Fremont mean that some of his colleagues were selling the book from under the counter ? " A few , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice ? " What was that ? Oh , yeah , I remember , you mean about me not trying to sell from under the counter ? Do n't worry . No chance . Besides , where would I get the copies ? God knows , I wish I could sell the book . You have no idea how many phone calls I get every day asking if I have it for sale . Why , you know who called this morning ? Rachel Hoyt . Great gal . You do n't know her ? You should . She 's the head branch librarian for the Oakwood Library . Speak of guts . She 's stood up against Mrs. St. Clair and the STDL for two years . She 's absolutely indignant about my arrest and this attempt to ban The Seven Minutes . She thinks that 's the real crime . She 's so sore that she 's not even waiting to order the book through the county acquisitions department . She wants to buy one herself and put it right out on  | the open shelves and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , trying to get a copy . I was afraid to let her have the one my wife is reading . But that Rachel , she 'll find a copy somewhere . " And now Mike Barrett had reached the modern one-story structure that was the Oakwood Branch Library , and was entering it , determined to speak to Rachel Hoyt , librarian . It had been a long time since Barrett had been inside a public library , and the physical appearance of the interior of the building , as well as the atmosphere there , took him by surprise . His youthful memories of libraries were associated with words like " darkened , " " musty , " " staid , " " hushed . " The Oakwood Branch Library was bright , light , airy , and the scene was one of restrained liveliness . Several college-age boys and girls were gathered along the table of Periodical Guides , talking in lowered but animated voices and trying to repress their laughter . Other visitors were comfortably seated at long tables , leisurely reading or studiously note-taking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free arm around her , and her arms loaded with books . Near the entrance , there was a rack bearing a sign , NEW ARRIVALS , as well as a cork board carrying dust jackets of the latest acquisitions . Barrett hastily examined the fiction titles . The Seven Minutes was not yet among them . At the checkout counter , Barrett asked for Miss Rachel Hoyt and gave his name and his business , and the tiny clerk stared at him with wide eyes and then darted through a doorway behind her . ' When she returned , Rachel Hoyt was right at her heels , and Barrett enjoyed his second surprise since his arrival . Like most adults , Barrett 's remembrance of librarians who had populated his school years had merged with time into one stereotyped librarian . This stereotype had bunned hair , rimless spectacles , a pointed disapproving nose , and invisible compressed lips . The stereotype was a loveless priss , efficient , mousy , humorless , juiceless . And here was Rachel Hoyt , branch librarian , as pretty as a Marie Laurencin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her hair was pulled back softly and held at the nape of her neck by an enameled barrette . There was bright lipstick on her moist lips , and a pink blouse was joined by a wide belt to a short gray wool dirndl.  | 11She was smallish , compact , neat , with an impudent expression and a kind of bursting vitality . She was probably nearer forty than thirty , but she looked thirty . Barrett had no doubt that she had one hell of an intellect . He also had no doubt that she did not allow it to interfere with her social life . " You are the head librarian ? " he asked . " None other , " said Rachel Hoyt , shoving a collection of bangle bracelets high on her slender forearm . She cocked an amused eye at him . " What were you expecting  --  Minnie Mouse or a Bloomer Girl ? They threw away that cookie cutter years ago . But then , Mr. Barrett , you do n't look like those criminal attorneys we read about or see portrayed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a wonderful drunken mumbler defending underdogs . You do n't look like Darrow or Rogers  --  or Howe or Hummel , for that matter . " " I do n't ? " Barrett complained with mock hurt . " Why not ? " " Too clean-cut and too much jaw . Your eyes are n't even slightly bloodshot . Your tie is expensive . Charles Darnay , maybe . Sydney Carton , no . " " If you knew what I was sacrificing to take on this case , you 'd say Sydney Carton , and how . " Rachel Hoyt laughed . " Okay , Sydney , come on in . " He went around the checkout counter and followed her into an office as neat and open as her own person , except for the table in the center that served her as a desk . It was piled high with new books , and stacks of the Library Journal , the Top of the News , and the Wilson Library Bulletin . There were also on the table clutches of three-by-five slips of paper held together by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percolator bubbling , a paper plate containing part of a sandwich . " Mind if I finish my ham and cheese and have coffee ? " she asked , going behind the table and pouring coffee into a paper cup . " Will you have some ? " " No , thanks . " " Then pull up and make yourself at home . " He started for a chair , but was distracted by a large framed placard on the wall . It bore the heading : LIBRARY BILL OF RIGHTS . It had been prepared by the Council of the American Library Association .  | " Our six commandments , " called out Rachel Hoyt . " Look at number three and number four . " He looked at number three . It read : " Censorship of books , urged or practiced by volunteer arbiters of morals or political opinion or by organizations that would establish a coercive concept of Americanism , must be challenged by libraries in maintenance of their responsibility to provide public information and enlightenment through the printed word . " His eyes moved down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlist the cooperation of allied groups in the fields of science , of education , and of book publishing in resisting all abridgment of the free access to ideas and full freedom of expression that are the tradition and heritage of Americans . " He turned back and brought the chair to a position across the table from her . " I guess that about says it all , " he said . She finished the last bite of her sandwich . " Not quite , " she said . " I 'd say almost every librarian subscribes to those two policies , in fact to all six . Where we come apart is on interpretation of what is or is not enlightenment through the printed word . ' Whether he knew it or not , President Eisenhower once underlined our problem in a fine speech he gave at Dartmouth College many years ago . Do n't join the book burners , ' he told his audience . He felt that you ca n't conceal faults by concealing the evidence that they exist . We should n't be afraid to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our own ideas of decency are not offended . That should be the only censorship , ' said Eisenhower . " She gulped down her coffee . " Three cheers for Ike . But , indeed , what should be the only censorship ? Why , that which offends our ideas of decency , of course . Still , whose ideas exactly ? Take a given book . Maybe an Eisenhower says it 's indecent , a Justice Warren says it is decent . Take another book . An American Communist says that politically it 's decent , a member of the John Birch So1 ciety says indecent . Take The Seven Minutes . You and I say decent , but Elmo Duncan and Frank Griffith shout indecent . Yes , take this same Jadway book . I say it has social value and literary merit , and I intend to buy it and display it on the shelves of the Oakwood Branch Library . At the same time , the librarians at the book-selection meeting of the Free Library of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , may decide that the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing style , and they may refuse to buy and circulate it . The head of some Alabama public library may feel the book has social importance , but , because of fear of some organization like the DAR , he will precensor the novel and not allow his librarians to buy it . Which brings us back to the same question  --  whose idea of decency should we follow ? Being a librarian today is about as noncontroversial a job as being a politician . It 's one of the most hazardous occupations on earth . No more room for mice . Oh , there are plenty of mice in the profession . But there are more tigers in these hallowed reading rooms , far more , believe me . And yours truly is one of them . I 'll growl and stalk and fight to the death to protect my brood , my book collection , my free and open shelves . And now , Mr. Barrett , what in the devil are you doing here ? " " Miss Hoyt , I 'm here to ask a favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her you ? HeaYebrows shot up . This from You . You 're kidding ? " " I 'm serious as can be . " I want this book made available for people who wish to read it . " " No , not yet . " " Why not ? " Barrett fiddled with his pipe . " Ie11 tell you why not . ' We 've algot one person who 's challenging the law over his freedom to display The Seven Minutes . We have our one martyr . Two martyrs would be a crowd . It 's as if , well , say two different Christs had been tried by Pilate , and there had been two Messiahs crucified that day on the Hill of Golgotha . Could Christians have been inspired by two martyrdoms ? Would Christianity have sprung from that ? " " An improper analogy , " said Rachel Hoyt . " When you are defending a beleaguered bastion of freedom , you want all the volunteers you can get . I should think the more the merrier . " " An equally bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jew is persecuted and sent to Devil 's Island , and you can cry out J'accuse ! ' perand rouse the entire world over a single injustice . The world can identify with one helpless martyr . But six million Jews were persecuted and murdered in Germany and the world is intellectually disturbed but emotionally unmoved and tries to go about its own  | business , because who in the hell can identify with six million dead ? " Miss Hoyt toyed with her paper cup . Then she crushed it . " Yes , I see , " she said . " Exactly what am I supposed to do ? " " You 're supposed to tell me you are willing to be an expert literary witness for the defense . Will you ? " " You could n't keep me off the stand with a machine gun . " " Okay , you 're enlisted . I gather you have read the Jadway book ? " " Three times . Would you believe it ? The first time a half-dozen years ago . I was on one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go by rubber bands  --  we librarians do n't have jet-set salaries , you know . It was a kind of art-museum tour , and after three days in the Louvre I had a free day . I went browsing among the bookstalls along the Seine , and there was this worn old copy of the toile edition of The Seven Minutes . I 'd often heard about it , and I was curious . I sat in a cafe and spent the morning reading it . For the first time I realized how beautiful it was to be a female . Then , when I learned in Publishers ' Weekly that Sanford House was publishing the book here , I was thrilled . I thought , My God , this of corn-pone country has come of age . When I got home , I reread my old Paris edition . The story was as beautiful as the first time . Then , when Ben Fremont was arrested , I knew I had to make a decision as a responsible librarian . So I read it a third time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what did your objective librarian 's eye tell you ? " " Unblinkingly , it told me my first two reactions had been right . The book belonged on the open shelves , but immediately , if only to show the witch hunters that Ben Fremont was not alone . Now you 've persuaded me to defer that gesture . But at least I 'll have an opportunity to tell the world where an intelligent librarian stands . " " Have you thought of the consequences ? " " Mr. Barrett , if I worried about consequences , I would n't have taken this damn job in the first place . When I look at myself in the mirror each night , I do n't want to be ashamed of what I see . So to hell with the consequences . Do you have any idea of what the average librarian is up against every day , not once a month or once a year  --  not the big whooping issues , but the petty problems  | she contends with every day of every year ? I 'm not speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our only hope for saving this old mudball we live on from total extinction . It 's their parents and relatives . The wise ones , the elders , who claim they have the answer to what 's right and what 's wrong and they call it ' common sense . ' And what is common sense ? A conglomeration of folklore and fables and prejudices handed down from their parents and grandparents , and a pack of half-digested limited experiences and observations and thoughts . The parents are the ones who come into libraries  --  public libraries and school libraries  --  to protest how we 're destroying their young with this book or that , little realizing that they 're the ones who are subverting their offspring because they 've gone through parenthood with crusts around their brains . Those people are simply afraid of anything new . " " I 'm very well acquainted with them , " said Barrett . " Of course you are . Yet we must live with them , deal with them , and you and I know the stifling limitation that results when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the truly great books became great because they once defied or exceeded formula , banality , community tradition . These were the books that dared say something new or say it in a new way . These were the writings by Copernicus , Newton , Paine , Freud , Darwin , Boas , Spengler , in nonfiction , and by Aristophanes , Rabelais , Voltaire , Heine , Whitman , Shaw , Joyce , in fiction . These were the writings filled with fresh , sometimes shocking , ideas . And we absolutely must support similar writings today . But how ? One library dean thought we should stand for selection as opposed to censorship  --  selection of the best books , based mainly on the presumed intent of the author and his sincerity of purpose . Selection , he said , begins with a presumption in favor of liberty of thought ; censorship , with a presumption in favor of thought control . " Rachel Hoyt paused , as if to restrain her indignation , and then she resumed more levelly . " Do you think any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We fight for selection , and they fight for censorship . You should hear the day-in , day-out complaints . They come from shame mongers and bigots of every stripe . " " Like what kind of complaints ? "  | " Like I 've been asked to remove Hawthorne 's Scarlet Letter horn circulation because it showed licentious behavior , and Pearl Buck 's The Good Earth because it described childbirth , and Dostocvski 's Crime and Punishment because it contained profanity , slid even Mitchell 's Gone with the Wind because Scarlett behaved immorally . I 've read somewhere that one parent-teacher association wanted Classic Myths barred from the shelves because it dealt with incest  --  incest among the gods . Ye gods ! In Cleveland they objected to Apuleius ' The Golden Ass because of the depraved title , and somewhere else they objected to Henry James 's ' Turn of the Screw because you know why . But the height of absurdity was about reached in Downey , California , when some literary vigilantes attempted to have Edgar Rice Burroughs ' Tarzan series removed from library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married and were living in sin . Can you imagine anything like that ? " Barrett shook his head . " Oh , no . " " Oh , yes . And do n't think for a minute it 's only the illiterates and eccentrics and bigots who give us trouble . Most people  --  supposedly normal people , I mean  --  instinctively want everybody else to conform to their own ideas of right and wrong . And since more people  --  how did Freud put it ? ? are upset by anything that reminds them unequivocally of their animal nature , they are upset by candor in literature and try to impose their upset upon the rest of us . So we get our share of certified normal people in here giving us trouble . Some perfectly respectable people get involved . Take our community leaders  --  a man like Frank Griffith , who 's now telling the press it was J J Jadway and not Jerry who raped that poor girl . It was neither Jadway nor Jerry who was responsible for the crime . It was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Griffith ? What makes you say that ? Do you know him ? " " No , thank you , " said Rachel Hoyt . " I had one encounter with him and that was enough . His son , Jerry , used to come in here to check out books or use our reference section . I got to know the boy slightly . A bright , quiet , lovely boy , but reduced to a kind of walking stutter by his overwhelming and know-it-all father . The last time I ever saw Jerry , maybe a year or more ago , he 'd come in to do some reference work on a paper he was preparing for an  | American Lit class . He was having trouble finding what he wanted , and he approached me , and I knew just the book that might help him . It was the Dictionary of American Slang , the one published by Crowell , and since it was late and Jerry did n't have time to look up what he needed , I permitted him to take the reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , it was the following morning , and there was Frank Griffith on the phone giving me hell . " " Frank Griffith called you ? " dl'II " You bet he did . " " What did he say ? " " He was apoplectic . How dare I recommend such a book to his son ? I said there was nothing wrong with the book  --  it was a standand reference dictionary that had been used for years . Well , not for Frank Griffith , no sirree . Griffith said he recognized the dirty book . It was one that , in 1963 , a San Diego Assemblyman had called filthy ' and our State Superintendent of Public Instruction had labeled a practicing handbook of sexual perversion , ' probably because it contained definitions of several lusty Anglo-Saxon words . Griffith wanted that dictionary removed from the shelves , and I refused , saying I could n't deprive students of a reputable and scholarly reference tool . Griffith told me that if he had the time he 'd go to the mat with me over that book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was just warning me not to recommend anything questionable to his son again . If I did , he promised he 'd have my job . Unfortunately , I never had an opportunity to recommend anything to Jerry again , because he never showed up again . He sent his boy friend over to return the book for him with thanks and apologies for any trouble he 'd caused me . I suppose he was too embarrassed to return the dictionary himself , or to come in here again . No doubt he 's used the library facilities at UCLA ever since . How do you like that ? " " Jerry 's boy friend , " said Barrett , suddenly alerted . " Do you remember his name ? " " His boy friend ? I 'm not sure . You see , Jerry was pretty much of a loner , perhaps a few casual friends , but this bearded boy was the only one I saw him with more than , once . " She paused . " Is this important , Mr. Barrett ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She leaped to her feet . " Let me see what I can find out . " She hastened out the door , calling , " Mary . . . " Barrett rose , and had barely filled his pipe with tobacco before Rachel Hoyt returned . " Any luck ? " he asked . " Yes , one of my clerks remembered Jerry 's friend . His name is George Perkins . He 's also a student at UCLA . " Barrett made a note of this and returned his memorandum pad to his pocket . " Thanks . This may be useful . And thanks for enlisting as a defense witness . I 'll speak to you before it 's your turn to go on the stand . You wo n't mind repeating that little anecdote about Frank Griffith in court , will you ? " " Nothing would please me more . " " Miss Hoyt , on behalf of Sydney Carton ? " " Let 's not be formal . Me Jane . You Tarzan . " He grinned . " Okay . Me Tarzan thanks You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the Administration Building on the UCLA campus . It was no more than a cubicle , barren except for a swivel chair , a neat steel desk holding a file folder , a telephone , and a green plant , and two straight chairs for visitors . For Mike Barrett it was as cheerless as a doctor 's examination room . He had been interviewing Mrs. Henrietta Lott for fifteen minutes , and his surroundings were becoming increasingly claustrophobic and oppressive . He supposed this was so because the session with Mrs. Lott had been , until now , unprofitable . Henrietta Lott was a kind , dumpy , overworked middle-aged woman , who seemed easiest when she was rattling off information about the curriculum in the College of Letters and Science . Her perception about her students , as best Barrett could make out , was shallow . Her major virtue was probably a lack of any sense of vice . That or her earnestness . She was assigned to advise undergraduates with family names classified in the letter group from G to J. Griffith was G , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with him four times . Except for what was on the college card in her hand , she had no in-depth knowledge of Jerry nor any immediate clear picture of him ( in itself a commentary , Barrett realized ) . She was apologetic about this , but there were so many ,  | so very many students , fifteen thousand in the College of Letters and Science alone . She had seen Jerry on this date , on that day , then again , and once more . These interviews had been devoted entirely to academic discussions , about a change in classes , about instructors , about grades , about ROTC . Once , when Jerry had wanted to discuss his units in relation to the draft , she had referred him to the Office of Special Services . " I wish there was more I could tell you , " said Mrs. Lott unhappily , " but I 'm afraid I ca n't think of anything else . " Barrett decided to reframe a question he had posed twice before . " Do you have any impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , only that he was very serious and rather withdrawn . " She stared vaguely at the college card in her hand , and then at the open student 's folder on the desk . " And . . . I suppose I can say he seemed to me rather unmotivated , like most of the youngsters today . Compared to the many students I see daily , I might say Jerry was more square or straight , to use the campus vernacular , than his peer group . " " Did you ever hear him speak of his family , Mrs. Lott ? " " No , not really . Well , wait , there was one occasion . " She seemed happier now . " Once he inquired about the intramural sports program . Yes , I recall . His father had been some kind of Olympic star  --  or maybe I just read about that in the papers ? ? anyway , his father wanted him to go in for sports , felt it would be good for him to get fresh air and exercise and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt he should make some inquiries . He said he was n't much good at sports , but I think he said he 'd had tennis lessons in prep school . As for clubs , he belonged to some kind of bridge  --  or was it chess ? ? no , I 'm sure it was bridge  --  some kind of bridge club in Westwood . " " I was told that Jerry took an American Literature course about a year ago . Can you provide me with any details ? " Mrs. Lott bent to her folder . " As a matter of fact , " she said , " I have a note here that he has taken seven literature courses ? rather , had taken five and is taking two now , or was , before he ... when he dropped out of the university . Would you like the names of the classes and the instructors ? "  | She read them off slowly , as Barrett jotted down the details in his notebook . When she was done , Barrett looked up . " That last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being taught by Dr. Hugo Knight . That sounds promising . What 's it about ? " Mrs. Lott was in her element now , and suddenly more selfassured . " It 's a popular course , and Dr. Knight teaches it with great enthusiasm . Yes , Jerry had signed up for it , was taking it , until his trouble . It 's a shame he could n't see it through to the final exam and get credit for the course . " " What does Dr. Knight cover in this course ? " " The approach is clever . In his lectures Dr. Knight tries to show how the expatriate experience , the feeling of alienation as well as the absorption of foreign mores and backgrounds , the experience of living and creating abroad , has affected the mainstream of American literature , from Nathaniel Hawthorne to Henry James to Ernest Hemingway . The youngsters seem to like it , I gather from my meetings with them , because Dr. Knight rather fearlessly touches on the history and influences of those authors who were avant-garde and too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were published in Paris by Jack Kahane 's Obelisk Press , between 1931 and 1939 , and by the Olympia Press which his son , Maurice Girodias , established in 1953 . Between them , they published Frank Harris , Radclyffe Hall , Henry Miller , Lawrence Durrell , James Hanley , Jean Genet , William Burroughs , all at a time when no one else dared publish such authors . Of course , Dr. Knight stresses the American authors . " " Do you happen to know whether the professor includes Bditions Ftoile , founded by Christian Leroux , and the book I represent , The Seven Minutes , by J J Jadway , in his lectures ? " " I do n't see how he could have helped but refer to Jadway , at least in passing . You really should ask Dr. Knight that question personally . I 'm sure you 'd find him cooperative . I could set up an appointment for you during his office hours . " " Like maybe today , Mrs. Lott , this afternoon while I 'm on the campus ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent witness . " Almost with relief , Mrs. Lott started to reach for her telephone , then thought better of it . " I should keep my line open for a call  | I 'm expecting . " She left her executive chair and hastened to the door . " I 'll be only a minute . Let me call Dr. Knight 's office . " Barrett stood up and massaged his back , and waited . In less than a minute , Mrs. Lott had returned . " You 're in luck , Mr. Barrett . His next office period is a half hour from now . I told him who you were and what it is you wanted to know , and he said he 'd be happy to make time for you . Here , let me jot down his location on the campus , and I 'll diagram the shortest way you can get there . " Ji I As she wrote and drew her diagram , something else occurred to Barrett . He waited until she had handed him the piece of paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " There is someone else I 'd like to see , if possible  --  an undergraduate , a close friend of Jerry Griffith 's . If he 's on campus , and if I could find out where , I 'd like to talk to him in the half hour before seeing Dr. Knight or right afterward . The young man 's name is George Perkins . I hate to bother you further , but ? " " No bother at all , " said Henrietta Lott . " Let me see what I can find out . " What she found out was that George Perkins , like Jerry , was a junior , a geology major , and he had a class at this very time . If he was attending his lecture , he could be reached . Mrs. Lott wrote a note to the class instructor , requesting that he ask George Perkins to remain behind after the class was dismissed , and she suggested sending the note with an office secretary , who would bring him to meet Barrett . Fifteen minutes later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quad west of the old UCLA library building , overlooking the seemingly endless pitch of brick steps leading down toward the gymnasiums , and he tried to remain undistracted by the scrubbed , healthy girls swinging by as he watched for the return of his guide and hopefully the sight of George Perkins . Suddenly he made out the secretary coming up the patterned walk before Royce Hall , and slouching along beside her was a big ungainly young man with tangled sandy hair and a shrub of beard , dressed in a turtleneck sweater , corduroy trousers , army fatigue boots . The girl halted , and Barrett realized that she was pointing him out to the young man , and the young man nodded , and then she waved at Barrett and he waved back as she hurried away .  | The young man was clumping across the quad , making his way toward Barrett . He shifted his textbooks from one arm to the other , and as he came nearer , Barrett could see that his beefy face was puzzled . " Hiya , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody wanted to see me . They did n't tell me what about . " " I 'm Michael Barrett . I 'll be glad to tell you what about . " At the mention of Barrett 's name , George 's brow puckered , as if trying to place it . " You may have read my name in the papers , " Barrett went on . " I 'm the attorney for Ben Fremont , the bookseller who was arrested for selling The Seven Minutes . " " That 's right , " muttered George Perkins . " Well , well ? " But something had crossed his mind , and his expression became wary . " What do you want with me ? " " Answers to a few questions , nothing more . I thought you might be able to help me out on something . I 'm trying to get a fill-in on Jerry Griffith 's background . I was told you 're a friend of Jerry 's . " V " No more than lots of others , " said George , his manner guarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him around here once in a while . A couple of times he gave me a lift to my apartment . And that 's it . " " I was told you were close friends . " " Mister , you were told wrong . Naw , nothing like that . Sorry . " He squinted off . " Look , mister , if you 'll excuse me now , I 've got a chance to get a ride to my place . I better get down there . " George Perkins started for the brick steps that brought one to the private street along the athletic fields , but Barrett caught up with him and then kept in stride with him . " Mind if I keep you company to your ride ? " said Barrett . " Maybe you can give me some leads . " " You 're wasting your time . " " Well , it 's my time , so let me waste it , " said Barrett cheerfully , as he began descending the stairway alongside George Perkins . " So at least you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family ? " " Naw . " " Did you ever hear Jerry discuss his father ? " " Nope . "  | " What did you hear Jerry talk about ? Any favorite topic or subject ? " " Nothing special . He 's a listener . We 're all listeners . Haven 's you heard , mister ? We 're the generation that 's soaking it all in , so 's we know what not to do . " He cast a mocking sidelong glance at Barrett . " We let others do the yakking . " Barrett nodded good-naturedly . " Bully for You . Maybe listeners are also readers . I was told Jerry Griffith read a lot . " " Everybody reads a lot if they want to stick in school . " " Did you ever see Jerry reading or hear him discuss The Seven Minutes ? " " Maybe . I do n't remember . He was big on Hesse the Hermann . But that Jadway thing , that just came out , did n't it ? I probably have n't seen Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he discussed it ? The paper says he read it , so you know as much as I mIknow . " " When did you last see Jerry Griffith ? " George Perkins went down the remaining flight of stairs silently . Then he said , " Maybe about a week before he hopped that broad . " " Have you seen him since , George ? " " No , and I would n't want to very much , either . " " Why not ? " " Because he 's given sex a bad name . What kind of guy is it ? with all the pussy around  --  who tries to get it that way ? Imagine getting it that way today ? " " That 's what mystifies many of us . " " Well , I got ta go along with Jerry on what he says . He says that book of yours sent him off into orbit . Well , they 're always yakking about the power of the press , so here we see the power . Sounds like that book of yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They had reached the bottom of the stairs . Barrett saw that any further talk would be useless . " I guess that does it , George . I ap- preciate your help . " " You 're putting me on . What help ? " I " At least I 've learned Jerry has n't got any friends  --  now . " " Oh , yeah . " " Maybe one of his professors can tell ? me a little more . I understand he had a class with Dr. Hugo Knight . Know anything about Knight ? "  | " Fagsville . And a horse 's ass besides . " " I low do I get to his office from here ? " George Perkins jerked a thumb over his shoulder . " The same gay you came down , Only this time up . I hope you had a cardiogram lately . " " Do n't worry . Thanks for your time , George . " " Mister , one second ... " Barrett hesitated . " Yes ? " " You 've been asking questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who told you that me and Jerry Griffith were buddybuddy ? Did Jerry himself tell you that ? " " No . I 've never met or seen Jerry . I got it from an employee of the Oakwood Library who saw you with Jerry several times . " George seemed at once relieved and for the first time amiable . " Oh , that 's who . Well , that explains it . But she was wrong . Well , sorry I could n't make your day , but good luck anyway . " Barrett watched him go slouching off past the men 's gym , and he decided he would not be learning much about Jerry Griffith from his contemporaries . For one like himself , the Union of the Young would remain a closed shop . Ruefully he peered up at the Everest of stairs soaring skyward before him . Was a fag named Dr. Hugo Knight worth it ? Well , he had come to UCLA in search of higher education , so it was worth at least one more college try . Laboring , he started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOUR and a half before Mike Barrett returned to his temporary office in the suite Abe Zelkin had leased . Their rooms were on the fifth floor of a recently constructed high-rise building , which was located between Robertson Boulevard and La Cienega Boulevard just before Wilshire Boulevard 's Miracle Mile . Barrett 's deeply carpeted corner office had an enlivening , unused feel  --  one could still smell the fresh pale-green paint on the walls  --  and Barrett liked its oversized oak desk placed near the large scenic window , the new leather-covered occasional chairs , and , somewhat apart , the cushioned sofa and the two classic lounge chairs surrounding the huge disk of a coffee table . There were not yet any framed college diplomas , civic citations , Impressionist reproductions , or celebrity photographs on the walls . But , hanging on the wall near his desk , he had four small framed quota-  | tions which he had paid an art student to reproduce in cursive script . These were among his long-time favorites . The first was to remind him of the enemy without : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands. ? STANIsLAus LEc . " The next two were amulets against vanity . One read : " Forbear to judge , for we are sinners all. ? SHAKESPEARE . " The other read : " Perhaps in time the so-called Dark Ages will be thought of as including our own. ? GEORG C. LICHTENBERG . " The last , recently penned , was to remind him of the unsolvable problem basic to all censorship : " Who shall stand guard to the guards themselves ? ? JuvENAL . " Three doors broke the monochrome green of the walls . One door opened onto the corridor that brought visitors to him from Donna Novik 's spacious reception room . Another door led to a communal area that included a bathroom and shower , a small dining area , and a kitchenette . The third door led to the conference room , which also opened into Zelkin 's office , beyond which were Kimura 's quarters , Zelkin 's law library , and a spare office used as a storeroom . In Barrett 's office only his desk gave evidence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . It was piled high with file folders filled with the typed notes and findings concerning the Ben Fremont case , representing the defense 's paper arsenal against the assault being prepared by the prosecution . But what also gave Barrett 's desk the appearance of a craggy mountain landscape were the bound court reporters ' transcripts of previous English and American censorship cases . Among these , all filled with a forest of paper markers , were Regina v. Hicklin , London , 1868 ; the Crown 's prosecution of The Well of Loneliness , London , 1928 ; the United States government 's trial of One Book Entitled Ulysses , 1934 ; the trial of the Grove Press against Postmaster General Christenberry over Lady Chatterley 's Lover , 1959 ; the trial of the State of California against bookseller Bradley Reed Smith over Tropic of Cancer , 1962 ; the Massachusetts trial of Fanny Hill , 1964 . Then there were full decisions and opinions of the United States Supreme Court : Roth v. U.S. , 1957 ; Jacobellis v. Ohio , 1964 ; Ginzburg v. U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk landscape was the record of Hearings on Control of Obscene Material garnered by a Senate subcommittee investigating juvenile delinquency in 196o.  | Upon his return from UCLA , Barrett found added to this mass of material on his desk several memorandums from Leo Kimura , and one was important . A cable had arrived from Monte Carlo requesting Kimura to telephone the private detective , Dubois , at the Hotel Gardiole in Antibes at five o'clock . This was enigmatic , since Dubois was supposed to have intercepted Jadway 's French publisher , Leroux , at the Hotel Balmoral in Monte Carlo much earlier . In his memorandum Kimura did not attempt to speculate on the meaning of the cable . He stated only that he was on his way to Philip Sanford 's suite to interrogate Sanford further , but he would be making the overseas call from there and the moment that he had any word , good or bad , he would be in touch with Barrett . Now it was five o'clock , and Barrett determined to ignore the clock and his suspense about the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish his verbal report to Abe Zelkin . For the last fifteen minutes , seated behind his desk , puffing his pipe , Barrett had been summarizing his afternoon interviews for Zelkin , who had been pacing back and forth before him . Barrett had reviewed his meetings with Ben Fremont , Rachel Hoyt , Henrietta Lott , George Perkins , and now he was giving an account of his interview with Dr. Hugo Knight , of the UCLA English department . " Then I was a little surprised when Dr. Knight told me that Rodriguez , of the District Attorney 's Office , had already been by to see him . I think it was some time yesterday . " " No kidding ? " said Zelkin . " Well , those boys are n't missing a thing . I suppose Duncan wanted the professor for a witness ? " " Well , they wanted to find out his attitude toward the book , " said Barrett . " Rodriguez wanted to know whether the professor had read the novel , what he thought of it , if he encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , had read the copy kept in the UCLA library 's department of special collections . He 'd never encouraged students to read it , because , until Sanford decided to publish , there were no circulating copies available . As for the book itself , Dr. Knight loved it . So that ended any interest Rodriguez had in the professor as a witness . There was one more thing . Dr. Knight said that Rodriguez kept bugging him to find out whether Jerry Griffith had shown special interest in The Seven Minutes . Dr. Knight explained that his classes were so large  | ? a hundred or more in a lecture room  --  that he often did n't know an individual student by name . Only after Jerry 's picture appeared in the newspapers did he half remember him as one of his stu dents . Also , as far as he could recall , Jerry had never expressed any special interest in that book or any other book mentioned in the lectures . At least , he 'd never raised a hand or come forward to discuss one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney 's Office had no further interest in him . " Abe Zelkin , hands in his hip pockets , stood over Barrett . " What about us ? Do we have any interest in Dr. Knight ? He sounds like he can be helpful . " Barrett grimaced . " I do n't know . That kid , George Perkins , was right . Dr. Hugo Knight is a bit of a horse 's ass . I wanted to find out what he says about The Seven Minutes in his lectures . Apparently he says very little . He just touches upon it as one more example of the great writings produced by American expatriate authors . Still , he seemed to be personally well informed about Jadway and the novel . So I asked him , Do you know anything about Jadway that has not been in the newspapers lately ? ' He answered , Very few people know Jadway as I know him . I know everything about him . ' Well , I tell you , Abe , my hopes rocketed . But in a few seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jadway simply from interpreting the novel . Our professor saw the book as a masterpiece of allegory . Maybe it is , although I find it hard to believe that the characters in that book were really allegorical portrayals of the Seven Deadly Sins . " " He said that ? " " That and more . I think Leda and the Swan got into it somewhere , too . " Zelkin laughed . " I can see twelve good men and true on a jury buying that . " " That was n't the worst of it . When I challenged the symbolism , tried to make the professor consider the book as a piece of realism , he regarded me as if I were an absolute cretin . He got very supercilious and condescending about the inability of unlettered laymen to comprehend symbology , to comprehend the artistic inventions used to reveal intangible truths . Well , I stopped being contentious , because I realized that so many of those academic  | double-domes require their little private preserve of superiority and that there was nothing to gain by challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him ? " " Abe , beggars do n't choose . We need witnesses who think The Seven Minutes is a literary marvel . I decided that , whatever Dr. Hugo Knight 's shortcomings  --  a manner that might prove offensive , a predilection for speaking a gobbledygook  --  he was one man with proper credentials who had enthusiasm for The Seven Minutes . I asked him whether he would appear as a defense witness . He was thrilled . " " I 'm not surprised , " said Zelkin . " At the universities it used to he publish or perish  --  now it 's appear as a witness or wither . " " My hope is we can have a few sessions with him pretrial and persuade him that the symbolism angle wo n't pay off in a public ? " The telephone buzzer sounded , and Barrett shrugged at Zelkin and picked up the receiver . It was Donna on the intercom . She announced that Philip Sanford was on line one . Barrett pressed down on the lighted button . " Hi , Phil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got our star witness , Jadway 's old publisher , got him locked up ! Is n't that great ? " " We 've got Christian Leroux for a witness ? " repeated Barrett , beaming at Zelkin . " That 's wonderful . Now what did he ? " " Here , let me put Leo on . He 'll give you the details . I just had to let you know first . Here 's our genius investigator . " Kimura 's voice came on . " Mr. Barrett ? " " I 'm here with Abe . He 's picking up the extension across the room . Okay , do n't skip anything , give us every detail . " " There is not much detail , " said Kimura in his precise enunciation . " What there is to tell is highly favorable . I have just finished speaking to Dubois in Antibes . He was waiting in the lobby of the Hotel Balmoral in Monte Carlo when Christian Leroux arrived from Paris to check in . Our man immediately accosted Monsieur Leroux and explained why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Monsieur Leroux indicated at once that it might be possible for him to cooperate if he had even more information . But it fast became apparent to Dubois that what our French publisher desired was not information about our case but information about what we were prepared to pay him as a witness . Leroux was put out of business several years ago when por-  | nographic or banned books , his speciality , began to be published openly by the bigger and more legitimate houses throughout the world . Ever since then Leroux has been trying to make a comeback , raise sufficient money to start a new publishing firm in Paris , one featuring a line of annotated bawdy classics . Dubois presented him our initial offer , as agreed  --  transportation plus living expenses to and from Los Angeles plus three thousand dollars . Leroux balked at this , mumbling about his time 's being worth more than that . Immediately Dubois upped the offer to our top price , transportation and expenses plus five thousand dollars . That was more like it , and Leroux agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big one , " said Zelkin . " One thing , " said Barrett . " Did Leroux indicate what he might say that would be favorable to us ? " " Not exactly . However , he left no doubt in Dubois 's mind that he understood what he was being paid for . He wanted to know what was expected of him . After all , he told Dubois , there are facts and there are facts , and truth has many sides . His implication was that he could put in or leave out facts to suit our case . So Dubois told him , from his own limited knowledge , what we were after . He told Leroux that we hoped to prove that J J Jadway had not written The Seven Minutes merely as a commercial enterprise , as a pornographer out after quick money , but , rather , as an artist writing with honesty and integrity . To this Leroux replied , Voila , then I can give you what you require , for I was his only publisher , was I not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book , was I not ? I will provide your defense with whatever it needs .. " " Jadway , " said Barrett , " did he speak of Jadway at all ? " " Only that he had been close to Jadway ? " " Great ! " exclaimed Zelkin. " ? and that he will tell us everything once he arrives in Los Angeles and has been paid , " said Kimura . " Dubois said that our witness was as shrewd as a French fishwife . " " What 's next ? " asked Barrett . " Being a detective , Dubois is most cautious , perhaps more than necessary . Anyway , since some people , friends , knew that Leroux would be staying in Monte Carlo , Dubois decided to remove him from there and secrete him elsewhere , in some place not known  | to anyone . So Dubois talked Leroux into moving to a small hotel , the Gardiole , in Antibes , and had him register overnight under the name of Sabroux . There Leroux agreed to confine himself to his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round-trip tickets and a down payment , and puts him on the Carawile at Nice for Paris and the changeover to Los Angeles . Dubois will cable the exact time we are to meet him at International Airport . So we shall have our star witness the day after tomorrow . I should say that we are fortunate . " After hanging up , Barrett jumped to his feet and pummeled Zelkin jubilantly . " Easy , easy , there , " Zelkin protested , smiling broadly , " or you wo n't have a partner to help you win the case . " " By God , Abe , " said Barrett , " this is absolutely the first time that I 've really felt we had a chance . " " Yes , now we have a chance . We also have our first excuse to celebrate something . Why do n't I call Sarah and tell her to toss two extra steaks on the broiler and chill some California champagne for two guests tonight  --  Phil and yourself ? " " That would be ? " Barrett began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no can do . I 've got a date with Faye . She agreed to join me tonight . I want to look in on the fund-raising bash the STDL is giving at the Hilton . Main speaker of the evening , our esteemed foe , Elmo Duncan . His subject , The Freedom to Corrupt . ' I thought I 'd try to get in and out without being conspicuous . I thought it might be a good idea to scout the enemy . This could give us a preview of the tenor of his opening statement at the trial and an idea of his oratorical style . " " Okay , the steaks stay in the freezer until Leroux arrives . " " Meanwhile , " said Barrett , returning to his desk , " I 'm going to devote the next hour to some creative composition . " " Namely ? " " We 've got our star , " said Barrett . " Now I 'd better write him an unforgettable part . " THEY WERE LATE , and Mike Barrett was dismayed . The fund-raising rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for eight-thirty that evening , and it was ten minutes to nine when they arrived at the Beverly  | Hilton Hotel . Barrett had been on time at the Osboms ' , but Faye , as usual , was still dressing . At the Beverly Hilton , leaving his car with the parking attendants , Barrett had propelled Faye hastily through the automatic doors into the huge lobby . His hurrying had made her stumble , and now , as he caught hold of her , she was momentarily cross . " Why this damn rush ? " she demanded . " It 's not exactly as if you 're the guest of honor or anything . Must you always be so prompt ? " " It 's not that ? " he started to say , but did not finish , because she would n't understand , and , besides , it was n't important . Being on time tonight had nothing to do with ordinary promptness . He had wanted to arrive when everyone else arrived , so that he might be lost in the crowd and his entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was hostile territory , and to the STDL he was the loathsome adversary . His one hope now was that the members of the audience would be too absorbed in the speechmaking to pay any attention to latecomers . They resumed their journey through the lobby , walking rapidly , with Faye a half step ahead and leading the way , as if to let him know that she did understand and now regretted her outburst . They went through the wide corridor , past the lower-level pharmacy , and finally reached the foyer and barroom that stood before the Grand Ballroom . " We 're not the last , " said Faye . With relief , he saw that she was right . At least a half-dozen persons were filing slowly by the two card tables behind which several portly women were seated . ' When it was Barrett 's turn , he quickly explained that he 'd had no time to send in his check for tickets , and said he hoped there was still seating available . There was indeed , and his ten-dollar bill was accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballroom entrance , a number of other guests converged upon the doorway from the direction of the bar . Faye waved to one of these . " There 's someone I know . " She pulled away from Barrett . " Hello , Maggie . It 's so nice to see you again . " She was speaking to a strikingly attractive brunette , who was carrying a drink the color of a sloe-gin flip . " Good to see you , Faye , " said the brunette . Self-consciously  | she held up her glass . " I 'm really not a lone drinker . It 's just that I need something at lectures . Lectures tend to dehydrate me . " " I meant to phone you , " said Faye . " I wanted to tell you how I sorry we were about the trouble over Jerry . I think Dad called your uncle . Anyway , we are sorry . Oh , forgive me ? " She groped for Barrett 's arm and drew him forward . " I do n't know if you 've met my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm pleased to meet you , Miss Russell , " said Barrett . " How do you do , " said Maggie Russell , coolly appraising him . " I thought I recognized you . " " You mean those terrible newspaper pictures do me justice ? " said Barrett . " I mean there have been a lot of them , " she said without a smile . " And I happen to have a special interest in your case . " Before he could reply , she turned to Faye . " You 're looking wonderful , Faye . " " Every reason to , " said Faye gaily , reaching over to take Barrett 's hand . Somehow he did not want a flag planted on him at this moment . He accepted Faye 's hand , squeezed it quickly , and dropped it . Faye and Maggie Russell were moving slowly ahead , conversing in undertones , but Barrett remained where he was , keeping his eyes on the attractive brunette . Inexplicably , he wanted to be alone with her , to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused . Make her understand what ? Understand why he was defending a book that had helped destroy her relatives ? Or I was it  --  understand why he was with Faye Osbom ? He continued to stare at Maggie Russell . She was Faye 's diametric opposite . Faye was taller , thinner , perhaps more classically beautiful , very blond and angular and cool perfection . But Maggie Russell was somehow , indefinably , more appealing . His eyes held on her head , then moved down her body , trying to discover the source of her attraction . As she turned her head , he noticed that she had a tousled , casual look , perhaps because her shining dark hair was coiffured with the ends  --  how did the ladies ' fashion magazines put it ? Yes  --  with the ends puckishly curling along her cheeks . Her wide-set eyes were gray-green and direct , her nose was small and broad , her mouth moist and partially open , and there was a full lower lip . The contours of both face and  | figure were soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts and the fullness of her thighs were her slender waist and slim legs . With Faye , she had now turned sideways in the doorway , and he became aware of the short silk jersey dress that seemed molded to her body so that the lines of her Pantio briefs beneath were faintly visible . He realized that she had suddenly glanced over her shoulder and caught him staring , and now she quickly looked away and straight ahead . Embarrassed , he guiltily diverted his gaze to Faye , who had just twisted around to beckon him . " Mike , I thought you were in a hurry ? " Striding forward , he caught up with Faye and took her arm , and together they entered the Grand Ballroom behind Maggie Russell . The vast hall had been darkened , he was pleased to see , and it was filled with an audience that probably added up to one thousand persons . There were a number of vacant folding chairs at the rear , and as he and Faye trailed after Maggie Russell he wondered whether they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie found one empty chair at the end of a filled row . Disappointed , Barrett led Faye across the aisle to where a number of unoccupied chairs were clustered , and firmly he directed her to the second seat in from the aisle , while he took the outside place for himself . Faye leaned toward him , cupping her mouth to his ear . " I apologize , " she whispered . I should n't have introduced you to her , but I was n't thinking . It did n't embarrass you , did it ? " " Why should it embarrass me ? " he said . " She is Frank Griffith 's niece and very close to the boy . " " So much the better , " he whispered . " It might be useful to know someone close to the boy . " Faye removed her gloves . " Forget it , " she said . " You 're lucky she did n't spit in your eye . " With that , Faye settled back and concentrated on the stage , and for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speaker . The speaker was the evening 's ' main attraction , District Attorney Elmo Duncan , straight and imposing on the platform as his hands held the sides of the lectern and he bent toward the  | microphone to emphasize a point . Barrett sat fully upright in his chair and listened . " So let us make no mistake about the word pornography ' itself , " Elmo Duncan was saying . " Let us not forget the derivation of the word . It came from the Greek word pornographos , which meant the writing of harlots . ' It meant any writing or description of the sexual lives of harlots or prostitutes , a special kind of writing that was meant to be aphrodisiac in content . Or , as a modern-day . commentator put it , the original pornography was the writing of and about whores with the intention of arousing a man 's lust so that he would go to a whore . ' Centuries have passed , but the word pornography ' has not changed its meaning . This I affirm although our higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law to believe that all pornographic books are not equally criminal . We have been told that a pornographic book that possesses some nonerotic narrative , some passages with so-called social value , must be treated with more tolerance and favor than another book in which the erotic content is unrelieved by any moral digressions . From my personal point of view , this is legal nonsense , this is nit-picking , and this is precisely what has slowed down enforcement of obscenity laws . The diluting of the defini4 lion of pornography is what has had law enforcers , to quote Justice Black , hopelessly struggling in a quagmire . " But , my friends and neighbors , I assure you that I am trapped in no quagmire . To me , a filthy book , even though it pretends to express a social idea or a message , is no less disgusting than a book of total hard-core obscenity . In fact , many jurists contend that literary quality in a written work makes an obscene book all the more destructive . To me , dirt is dirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Greeks had a word for it , the right word for it , the word that meant writings that excited lascivious thoughts and lustful actions . As a special deputy district attorney and expert in the field of obscenity once stated it , The sole purpose of pornographic books is to stimulate erotic response . Pornography encourages people to luxuriate in morbid , sexual-sadist fantasies . . . ' And we possess evidence , real evidence , that pornographic books stimulate more than fantasies . We know now that they stimulate crimes of violence . " The men who are closest to the problem know the truth . Let  | me quote to you from Dr. Fredric Wertham , formerly senior psychiatrist at Bellevue Hospital in New York and psychiatric consultant to a Senate subcommittee for the study of organized crime . According to Dr. Wertham , Children 's attitudes and consequent actions are definitely affected by the reading of literature suggestive of a combination of sex and violence . I am convinced that this combination is creating in the minds of children the ego ideal of the brute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , makes his own rules , and solves all his problems by force . ' To support this statement , we have the statistics of our Federal Bureau of Investigation covering a recent ten-year period in our history , a period of the greatest production of pornographic books , a period during which forcible rape increased thirty-seven per cent in the United States , and the age bracket of rapists that increased the most was that of late-teen-agers . " Yet there is more to fear . From the time of that great English jurist of the eighteenth century , Sir William Blackstone , to the present day , we have been on notice that our society may suffer a death of the soul if pornographers are given unlimited license . Blackstone told us that to punish dangerous or offensive writings is necessary for the preservation of peace and good order , of government and religion , the only solid foundations of civil liberty . ' Now , after two hundred years , we continue to be reminded of our duty . The anthropologist Margaret Mead has told us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censorship over behavior , especially over sexual behavior . From England , Sir Patrick Devlin has admonished us that we dare not tolerate complete openness about sexual freedom . No society , ' he said , can do without intolerance , indignation , and disgust ; they are the forces behind the moral law . ' Our own Judge Thurman Arnold has concurred . He has gone so far as to state , The fact that laws against obscenity do not have a rational or scientific basis , but rather symbolize a moral taboo , does not make them any the less necessary . They are important because men feel that without them the state would be lacking in moral standards . ' In short , whether there is a scientific basis for our obscenity laws or not  --  and I happen to believe there is such a basis  --  the laws must be observed and enforced if our society is to survive the eroding effects of immorality . " My friends , let us not be afraid of being branded censors , and  | let us not be afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as old as history itself , has long been known to be a necessity for the common good and civilized man 's survival . Far back before Christ 's birth , the philosopher Plato asked the question , Shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons , and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up ? ' And to this Plato gave civilization 's answer , Then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of fiction , and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good , and reject the bad ; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorized ones only . ' " My friends , the time has come when each and every one of us must face the fact that pornography , no matter what disguise it wears , still remains outright obscenity and a threat to our families , to our future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must say to ourselves , to each other , to the entire country , that the time has come to resist and stop the black plague of pornography . The time has come , the time is now , and , as a fellow citizen as well as your district attorney , I pledge every energy and resource at my command to lead this crusade ! " Elmo Duncan had paused , awaiting the expected response , and it came in a thunderclap of applause . As the applause continued , Barrett looked at Faye beside him . Her eyes were bright , fixed upon the figure on the stage , and she was clapping her hands . Troubled , Barrett turned his head and looked across the aisle . Maggie Russell , her face pensive and pale , sat unmoving . Her hands lay still in her lap . Curious , Barrett thought , but then the speaker 's deep voice intruded , and Barrett returned his attention to the stage . " Since the year 1821 , " Duncan was saying , " when the United States had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holmes was found guilty of publishing Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure ? none other than Fanny Hill  --  various publishers , in recent years a legion of them , have taken advantage of our liberties and freedoms , and made a mockery of our Constitution and instruments of justice . As a result , today the publishing of smut has become a **25;176;TOOLONG business .  | " I blame these publishers for supporting , sometimes encouraging , the production of filth , and I blame them for promoting its GPI sale throughout the land in ' the name of literature when their only fidelity is to their profit ledgers . I blame the booksellers equally , for lacking the moral fiber to reject this trash , for thinking of private gain rather than public welfare . And I blame the writers of this filth , too . Let no one escape , of all the creators those debasers of freedom of expression who hide behind the skirt of the very Muse whom they would soil and defile. ? On the platform , Elmo Duncan had paused , shaking his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " who betray not only themselves but one another for Mammon , their true god . Let me quote you the words of a celebrated writer . But even I would censor genuine PornograPhYrigorouslY , ' he wrote . ' Pornography is the attempt to insult sex , to do dirt on it . This is unpardonable . ' Unpardonable indeed . And who spoke those glorious words ? Let me tell you . D. H. Lawrence , the author of that paean to purity , Lady Chatterley 's Lover ! " There was laughter and applause , and Elmo Duncan acknowledged it with a smile and held up his hand . " I 'm not through , " he said . " Listen to this . When James Joyce published Ulysses in Paris , who was among the first to call it obscene and demand that it be suppressed ? You guessed it . D. H. Lawrence , author of Lady Chatterley 's Lover and would-be protector of public morals  --  protecting them from other people 's pornography , that is ! " A raucous burst of laughter greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have mentioned Joyce 's Ulysses , which brings to mind something I 've long wanted to say . For years we have had dinned in our ears the bravery of Judge John M. Woolsey for admitting that pornographic work into our land , and for years we have had dinned in our ears the courage of Circuit Judges Augustus and Learned Hand , who sustained Woolsey 's lower-court verdict in their appeal court against one dissenting judge . But , friends , and forgive me for this , no Woolseys have been pulled over my eyes , no Hands have ever covered my r ears , to prevent my recognizing and listening to the one person who deserved to be heard before all others  --  for the real bravery and courage in the Ulysses case was that of the one arbiter who  | dissented with the Hands ' verdict in that appeal case . I refer to the long-forgotten Circuit Judge Martin Manton , and to his dissent which each of us should carry writ on our banners in this crusade against the corrupters of freedom . Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our people , ' wrote Judge Manton , adding that it is only the unusual person who thinks he can protect himself . Then Judge Manton went on , The people do not exist for the sake of literature , to give the author fame , the publisher wealth , and the book a market . On the contrary , literature exists for the sake of the people , to refresh the weary , to console the sad , to hearten the dull and downcast , to increase man 's interest in the world , his joy of living , and his sympathy in all sorts and conditions of men . Art for art 's sake is heartless and soon grows artless ; art for the public market is not art at all , but commerce ; art for the people 's service is a noble , vital and permanent element of human life . . . Masterpieces have never been produced by men given to obscenity or lustful thoughts  --  men who have no Master . . . Good work in literature has its permanent mark ; it is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human aim  --  to cheer , console , purify , or ennoble the life of people . With this aim , literature had never sent an arrow close to the mark . It is by good work only that men of letters can justify their right to a place in the world . ' These are the words I pray the STDL will continue to support , and the community will begin to heed ? " These words by Circuit Judge Manton . Hearing them , Barrett 's gray cells had begun groping , and at last they snared Judge Manton in memory and impaled him . The moral Judge Manton , short years after airing his noble words , had been arrested for his part in a conspiracy to block justice and had wound up in a federal prison for nineteen months . Barrett wondered whether he should offer this postscript to the enthralled Faye . He decided against it . She was too engrossed in the District Attorney 's forensics . Barrett settled back to listen further . give heed to these sentiments by Judge Manton , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the standard by which a book publisher and seller had made their judgment in recent weeks , I assure you that our city would have known less violence and our neighbors would have suffered less grief . "  | Elmo Duncan halted , and the swelling of applause was instantaneous in response to his first oblique reference to The Seven Minutes and the Jerry Griffith rape case . Once more Barrett could see that Faye was fervently clapping her hands , and once more he turned to observe Maggie Russell . As before , and like himself , she had not joined in the applause . Instead , picking up the empty glass and her purse , she abruptly rose , met his eyes , then started up the aisle and toward the exit . Her sudden departure bewildered Barrett . Obviously she had come to this rally because her sympathies were for the STDL and Elmo Duncan , who were hying to punish the book that had , in their view , driven Jerry Griffith to crime . And Jerry was Maggie Russell 's close relative . Then why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave before the District Attorney 's speech had ended ? A remote possibility passed through Barrett 's mind . Unaccountably , this girl had turned her back on the prosecution . Perhaps , given a chance , she might not turn her back on the defense . It was worth finding out . On the stage , Duncan had resumed speaking , and , beside Barrett , Faye was listening intently . Barrett leaned toward her . " Excuse me a minute , darling . I 'll be right back . " " Mike , where are you ? ? " " Men 's room , " he whispered . " Remember to tell me what I missed . " Sliding off his chair , he went up the aisle , around the back row of chairs , and out the exit . In the foyer , he saw Maggie Russell place her empty glass on the bar . As she was starting for the lobby corridor Barrett hastened to intercept her . " Miss Russell ? " he called out . She stopped and waited , without surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance , I wanted a few words with you . " She remained silent , still waiting . v , ii " It 's about your relatives , the Griffiths . I understand you live with them . " " I 'm Mrs. Griffith 's secretary and companion . " " Faye mentioned your relationship with Jerry . "  | " What did she say ? " " She said you were very close to the boy . " " We 're not only relatives , we 're friends . " She stared up at Barrett , and then she added pointedly , " And I 'm prepared to defend him against anyone who wishes to hurt him . " Barrett frowned . " If that was meant for me , you 've picked the wrong target . I have no reason to try to hurt Jerry Griffith . Quite the contrary . I 'm sorry for him and I sympathize with all of you . My only interest in Jerry is professional . I 'm charged with defending a man who sold a book that Jerry claims incited him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juvenile delinquency , I am not convinced that reading matter alone  --  if in any way  --  can be held responsible for antisocial acts . There are many other factors that might be more seriously considered , among them a young man 's upbringing and family . I was hoping we could talk about this . " Her gray-green eyes were unblinking . She considered him without emotion . " I 'm surprised at myself for listening to you . What made you think even for a moment that I 'd talk to you about my family 's private affairs ? " " For one thing , your behavior in the ballroom , " said Barrett . " Your attending this event seemed perfectly natural . But when you were the only person beside myself not to applaud Duncan 's pack of nonsense , and when you got up and walked out on him , it occurred to me that you might not be fully sympathetic with his point of view . Perhaps I misread your actions , but that 's what occurred to me . For a second thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look honest and forthright and intelligent , the kind of person who might see that cooperating with me could not harm Jerry at all , might in some ways be useful to him . " Calmly she folded both hands over her purse before her , and she replied , " Mr. Barrett , to take the last first , I am honest and forthright , and so I can tell you I am intelligent enough to know any further discussion with you would be an act of disloyalty to those who have given me so much . As for Mr. Duncan , I have no interest in his views on censorship in general . My sole interest in life right now is to protect Jerry . I came here tonight to see and hear how the District Attorney performed in public , since by attacking your book in court he will be attacking the source of Jerry 's problem . In that sense , Mr. Duncan will be supporting  | and explaining Jerry , and helping mitigate my cousin 's guilt . I walked out because I had seen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , her tone more earnest than ever . " Mr. Barrett , I have no idea to what degree pornography alone contributes to juvenile delinquency . I only know that someone dear to me has confessed it did him harm . Beyond that , I abhor censorship of any kind , especially as it was being advocated this evening . Nor do I care for the kind of people censorship attracts or the atmosphere it creates . But I am in favor of limited restrictions on what young people may be permitted to read , especially restrictions on prurient books written and manufactured to sell or titillate . I deplore any censorship of honest works , enlightening works , no matter how many four-letter words they contain , no matter how explicit they may be about sex . Those books ca n't harm young people . Perhaps the other books can . There you have it . " Barrett was sufficiently impressed by her , and encouraged , to ask his next question . " Okay , Miss Russell , reasonable enough . Then can you tell me  --  assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven Minutes as an honest book or a prurient one ? " About to reply , she hesitated , and then she said , " I have no desire to discuss my reading tastes with you right now . " " But I am sure you will allow that even if Jerry feels the book influenced his behavior , there may have been other , stronger influences , ones he was unaware of , that disturbed him . Will you allow for that ? " " Mr. Barrett , I 'm not a psychoanalyst . I do n't know . I do know I 've already told you I have no intention of discussing my relatives with you or with anyone . " " Well , perhaps there are some people close to Jerry who would feel that uncovering the whole truth about him , for his sake , for all of us , could be a service to him in the end . I suppose it would be foolish to ask whether Frank Griffith would see me ? " " I think Mr. Griffith would consider you like something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sure he 'd stamp you out . " " I 've heard Mrs. Griffith is more pacific . " " Obviously she is . But in this matter it seems that way only because she 's invalided . You are being foolish , Mr. Barrett . We  | are n't a house divided . We 're together in this . I do n't know what you 're after . " " I 'm after Jerry . I 'd like to see him , because I think he can help me , and in so doing help himself . " " You 're wasting your time and my time . Jerry would n't see you in a million years , and even if he would , none of us would permit it . I must say , Mr. Barrett , your persistence is becoming annoying . " Barrett smiled apologetically . " I 'm sorry , I truly am . But you could have snubbed me , you know . Yet you did n't . You suffered my interrogation . Why ? Good manners , Miss Russell ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Barrett . I wanted to see if you were really the kind of son of a bitch everyone said you were . " " And  --  am I ? " " I 'm not sure what you are , but from what I 've seen tonight I suspect you 're heartless and ambitious , with less concern for human feelings than for winning a trial for yourself . Well , I want no part of you or your trial , Mr. Barrett . I do n't give a damn about your case , except as it pertains to Jerry . So if you 're not what people say you are , you can prove it by not bothering me again . End of interrogation , Mr. Barrett . Good night . " With that , she turned on her heel and went rapidly toward the lobby . He watched her leave , and when he started back to the ballroom he felt only one emotion toward her . Not anger . Not hurt . Only regret . He felt regret that she was so lovely  --  he had never met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not in exactly the same sense  --  and that life had cast them in opposite camps . Unhappily he returned to the ballroom and his seat beside Faye . He began an apology to Faye , but she held her forefinger to her lips and then poked it toward the stage . He looked toward the stage , and realized that Elmo Duncan was concluding his address . " And so , my friends , " said the District Attorney , removing the pages of his speech from the lectern , " we know what we must fight , and why we must fight , and we know that we can succeed only by working hand in hand together . As we strive toward our  | common goal , let us remember the words de Tocqueville spoke long ago of our beloved country . America is great , ' he said , ' because she is good and when America ceases to be good she will cease to be great . ' Let us rededicate ourselves to America 's goodness , so that her greatness never , ever diminishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience seemed to rise to their feet in unison , like some giant eruption , beating their palms together , cheering , shouting their enthusiasm . It disturbed Barrett to observe the numbers , the solidity , the passion of the opposition . He thought , If a like number of people , multiplied by every community in America , were as united and determined to eradicate cancer or poverty or racial inequality or even war , instead of to prevent open discussions about sex , the land of the free would be truly free and good . But fighting other causes is less warped fun , and less therapeutic to the old Calvinistic sickness , than fighting sex . Crazy people . Damn them . The hurrahing and applause were continuing , and Barrett realized that he alone had remained seated . Lest he be conspicuous , and wind up lynched , he hastily stood up with Faye and the others . Seeing him watching her , Faye ceased applauding . " I 'm afraid I get carried away by oratory , " she apologized . " You must agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective , even if he is a rabble-rouser . But most politicians have to be , do n't they ? Do n't look so upset , Mike . You 're twice as smart as he is , and you 'll make mincemeat of him in court . I just meant that he surprised me , the way he handled himself before an audience . " " It was his audience before he opened his mouth , " said Barrett . " Even if he were tongue-tied they 'd have hailed him as Demosthenes . Come on , let 's get out of here . " Faye pointed to the stage . " Wait a second , I think there 's going to be something more . " Elmo Duncan had not left the platform . Standing to one side of the lectern , he was listening to a swarthy man who had materialized from somewhere and whom Barrett recognized to be Victor Rodriguez , the Assistant District Attorney . With them also was a tall , horsy woman in an expensive but unbecoming mauvecolored suit who Barrett supposed was Mrs. Olivia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed Duncan a sheet of  | rper , and seemed to be explaining something on it . Then the rsy woman appeared to be asking Duncan a question , to which he responded by nodding vigorously as he handed the paper to her . The noise had begun to subside , but as Elmo Duncan started to leave the stage , followed by Rodriguez , the applause swelled again , and Duncan beamed gratefully and waved and came down off the stage to be swallowed up in a mass of admirers . Meanwhile , the horsy woman had made her way to the microphone above the lectern . She raised both hands for silence , the piece of paper still clutched in one gloved fist . To still the audience , the woman screamed shrilly into the microphone , " Your attention , please  --  your attention for one more minute  --  because some exciting news has just come to us  --  something that concerns everyone here ! " Immediately the ballroom was hushed , and some quality of triumph in the piercing voice of the STDL 's leader gave Barrett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news possible ! " the woman shrieked into the microphone , flying the sheet of paper from the one hand that had stayed aloft . " Before announcing it , ladies and gentlemen , fellow members of the Strength Through Decency League , I want to speak as your president , and for all of you ? " This was indeed the formidable Mrs. St. Clair , as Barrett has guessed . She had been the instigator of the events that had led to the indictment of Ben Fremont and The Seven Minutes , and Barrett wondered what other woes she was preparing to bring down on him now . " ? in thanking our distinguished and eminent District Attorney for his edifying and inspiring speech here this evening , " Mrs. St. Clair continued . " With public servants like Mr. Duncan to implement our work , we know that we shall see victory in the near future . And now ? " She held the sheet of paper up to the microphone . " ? now new evidence has been brought to light , most dramatically , that supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter and gives our District Attorney the final ammunition he needs to defeat the forces of pornography. "  | She brought the sheet of paper before her , studied it , then lifted her head . " Properly this is an announcement that deserves to come from our District Attorney . However , since it directly concerns and affects his prosecution of The Seven Minutes , I am advised that it would be unethical for Mr. Duncan to make any public comment on the trial until it is over . While Mr. Duncan has referred , and may continue to refer , to the pending trial itself , he feels he can not discuss facts that might be considered part of the evidence in that trial . On the other hand , since the STDL has the same concerns as the District Attorney 's Office about pornography generally , and The Seven Minutes specifically , I have the obligation , as president of the STDL , to keep you informed about the most recent developments related to the prosecution of The Seven Minutes . " The audience in the ballroom remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement with restraint intermingled with curiosity . Barrett felt his heart begin to pound , and he waited , too . Mrs. St. Clair looked up from the paper in her hand . " Ladies and gentlemen , fellow members , as many of us know , the original underground publisher of The Seven Minutes was a Frenchman , Christian Leroux , who knew the late J J Jadway personally and who was the only man on earth who could possibly shed light on many questions that have continued to stand unanswered concerning this book and its author . All of us have asked ourselves ? what manner of a man could write a book such as this ? What were his motives in writing the book ? What happened to him afterward ? What brought about his early death ? Tonight we finally have the answers , and we have them directly from the lips of Christian Leroux , Jadway 's French publisher . " Barrett 's heart was hammering harder , and he exchanged a wordless glance with Faye , then gave his full concentration to the stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Christian Leroux , after deep soul-searching , emerged from hiding to offer his services to the people of California , America , the world , in the prosecution of The Seven Minutes . Christian Leroux confessed his original sin , which was in publishing the vile book . It was , he stated , an error  | compounded of youth , immaturity , and avarice . But now , rather than see his sin repeated by others who would corrupt mankind with this evil work , he has determined to expiate his sin and work for us in attempting to suppress The Seven Minutes . " A spattering of applause had begun , but Olivia St. Clair gestured for it to stop so that she might be heard . " The unanswered questions are now answered , and they are answered by the only person on earth who can speak for J J Jadway . According to the French publisher , Jadway wrote the book because he was desperate to have money . Jadway lived a dissolute and immoral life on the Left Bank of Paris , dissipating his savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mistress he had taken , and whom he was able to keep happy only by lavishing gifts upon her . According to Leroux , the pornographer repaid her for her devotion , repaid her by using her as the model for his lascivious , lewd , shameless heroine in The Seven Minutes . This poor creature 's real name was Cassie McGraw , and she was made to perform as the Cathleen of that filthy novel . When Jadway had no more money , he dashed off this narrative of unremitting salaciousness for the underground press to get his hands on quick and easy cash . But Jadway had come from a religious background , and after his book had been published he saw the harm that the book was doing to innocent people . At last he realized the depths of his depravity and the extent of his mortal sin . And tonight Christian Leroux has confirmed what our District Attorney had already learned from another reliable source  --  that in his final moments of sanity j J Jadway understood the horrendous crime he had perpetrated on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be saved only if he renounced the disgusting and dangerous book . And so , out of remorse for what he had done , J J Jadway committed suicidel " There were gaspings and mutterings throughout the ballroom . Mrs. St. Clair pitched her voice higher . " If the author of the book could kill himself out of shame for having written it , he deserves to have us unite our energies in order to kill this monstrous work for him so that he can know salvation . To help us do this , to help our District Attorney do this , Christian Leroux is on his way to Los Angeles to appear as a witness for the prosecution . His courage and his appearance assure us of a historic victory in a  | court of law , and we will honor Mr. Leroux as our guest speaker at our very next victory rally . Thank you , friends and members ! " The ballroom had become a bedlam of shouts and cheers . Mike Barrett had heard the announcement in stunned silence . Every word and sentence from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , all but beaten , he found his instinct for survival shoring up his resistance to the announcement , suggesting the impossibility of its being true . But he had to know for certain . He gripped Faye 's arm . " Come on , " he said harshly . They broke through the milling crowd into the foyer . " Where are we going ? " Faye wanted to know . " I ca n't believe what she was saying , " said Barrett , marching Faye with him toward the lobby . " This ca n't be . Six hours ago we had Christian Leroux locked up as our witness and ready to defend Jadway 's motives and his book , and suddenly Duncan claims to have him and to have him vilifying Jadway and the book . I 've got to find out the truth . " They had reached the middle of the lobby . " Look , Faye , " he said , " you wait here , have a cigarette . I wo n't be long . I 've got to call Abe Zelkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Barrett hurried off in search of a phone booth , and when he found one he enclosed himself in it , deposited the necessary coins , and dialed Abe Zelkin . " I was staying up , waiting for you to get home , " said Zelkin in a voice as overwrought as Barrett 's own . " I had to speak to you . We just heard from that detective , Dubois , in France . He just rang us . Do you know what ? Our star witness , our Christian Leroux , he 's disappeared . No one knows where in the devil he is . " Barrett closed his eyes and slumped back against the side of the booth . Then it was true . " Abe , I know where that bastard is . He 's on his way to Elmo Duncan . " " You 're kidding ? Oh , no , do n't say it . " " Abe , I 'm saying it . I 'm still at the Hilton . You know what I just heard announced ? " Painfully he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he was through , Barrett added wearily , " I do n't know how it could have happened . We had him hidden , and under another name , and he was agreeable to our terms . Only one possibility occurs to me . Our offer made Leroux realize his own value  | in the marketplace . The minute our man left him alone , Leroux probably got in touch with Duncan and offered to sell out for a higher bid . " " No , Mike . Dubois was clever enough to think of that . Dubois checked with the hotel concierge , telephone operator , manager . From the moment Dubois checked him into that hotel in Antibes , Leroux never left his room , sent no letters , messages , cables , made no outgoing calls and received no calls . All the hotel could report was that a few hours before Dubois went by to pick him up for us a Frenchman asked to see Leroux in his room . Shortly after , Leroux checked out of the hotel , leaving with his visitor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's only one explanation , then . Dubois . Our private detective . He knew he had hot goods . He could have sold us out . " " Absolutely not , Mike , " said Zelkin . " I brought that up with Phil Sanford and Leo just before you called . They both said no . Sanford had given us the name of his father 's French representative , and it was he who recommended Dubois to us . He vouched for Dubois . A man of long-standing integrity . Incorruptible . No , I doubt if it was Dubois . " " It was someone , something , " protested Barrett . " One minute he 's here . Presto . The next minute he 's melted away . One minute we have him , the next minute they have him . There 's got to be an explanation . I do n't mind dealing with events I can see and handle  --  win , lose , or draw  --  but I 'm helpless when I have to deal with the supernatural . " " No use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not interested in what happened after the fact . It happened . We lost a round . " " That was round fifteen , Abe . " " No , it was n't . Let 's get some sleep and see what we can salvage tomorrow . " When Barrett wearily returned to the lobby , Faye tamped out her cigarette and got up from the sofa to meet him . She looked at him worriedly . " Was Mrs. St. Clair 's announcement true , Mike ? " " It was true . " " I 'm sorry , Mike . Is this real bad for you ? "  | " Disastrous . " " Does this make your case hopeless ? " " As things stand now  --  yes  --  yes  --  I 'm afraid so . " Faye linked her arm in his . " Then , Mike , will you listen to me ? I 'm the one person who can help you . Please , listen . " " What ? " " Just two little words . " She paused . " Get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Get out ? You mean quit ? " " I mean get out of it while you can . I can admire a man more for having the sense to abandon a sinking ship than for blindly insisting it is n't sinking and then going down with it . You knew from the start that both Dad and I felt you were on the wrong side , mixed up with all that dirty publicity and all kinds of slimy , unprincipled people . You do n't belong in that kind of case . But I wanted you to pay your debt , be satisfied , so I went along . Now I think you 've done everything you can do . You 've discharged your debt to Sanford . There 's a limit to what you owe him . You do n't have to commit suicide for him . You 've said it 's become a hopeless cause . So for my sake , for Dad 's , show that you 're a man , big enough to know when to reject a lost cause . Promise me you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He looked at her a moment longer , and then he said , " No , Faye . " " You 're being unreasonably stubborn . Were n't you listening to me ? I said you 've paid your debt to Sanford ? " " It 's not Sanford that I give a damn about . It 's Jadway . You see , I 've read his book . I know Jadway could n't have been all those things Leroux says he was . I 'm convinced Leroux is a fake and a liar . There 's only one problem , my dear . How in the hell am I going to prove it ? "  | MIKE BARRETT steered his convertible into the entrance of the parking lot behind Mount Sinai Hospital , stopped the car to drop a quarter into the meter , waited for the striped gate to creak upward , and then drove into the lot . It was the afternoon visiting hour , and the lot was almost filled to capacity . In the far lane Barrett saw a car backing out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it . The dashboard clock told him that it was ten minutes after three o'clock . He was in no hurry . There would be time enough to learn what more he could of Sheri Moore , the victim of rape , who still lay in a coma on a hospital bed on the fifth floor . Barrett wanted an interlude in which to gather his wits about him . He sought his shell pipe , packed it , passed a flame over it , and remained seated behind the wheel , smoking , thinking , seeking some degree of optimism . As his mind returned to last night , his feeling of gloom remained unrelieved . The loss of Christian Leroux had been a terrible blow , and he had not yet recovered from it . None of them had . Usually the morning of a new day held out the promise of some bright and buoyant expectation . But had he been awakened at dawn by Dr. Pangloss and Mr. Micawber together , plying him with pep pills , he knew that his mood could not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was overcast and gray . The morning paper had done little to lift his spirits . There had been a front-page story reporting Duncan 's speech and Mrs. St. Clair 's sensational announcement , as well as later news that Leroux  | would be arriving from France tomorrow to await his appearance as a witness for the State . In the office there had been no fresh breaks or leads . Continuing in the effort to turn up something helpful about the author of The Seven Minutes , Kimura had reported that he was still on the trail of Norman C. Quandt , the pornography specialist who had acquired publication rights to the novel from Leroux and resold them to Phil Sanford . Despite the knowledge that Quandt had relocated himself in Southern California , Kimura had been unable to find out more about him . Lunch had been better . For Barrett , it had given the day , if not hope , then direction at least . He had dined at the bustling , celebrity-filled Bistro restaurant in Beverly Hills with Dr. Yale Finegood , a lively young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center , but who was now on his own . Finegood , a specialist in the problems of disturbed adolescents , felt that there was no connection between reading a book or viewing a motion picture and committing an act of violence . In fact , he pointed out , many of his colleagues credited pornographic books with keeping down the crime rate , since reading provided an outlet in the form of fantasies of sexual craving which might otherwise be acted out . Dr. s Finegood quoted a study that had been made by a pair of research criminologists , Eleanor and Sheldon Glueck , a study of one thousand delinquent boys in and around Boston . What the Gluecks had learned was that the real factors contributing to their sub-jects ' delinquency were unhappy family relationships , lack of education , conflict with the prevailing culture , inherent psychological problems , and bad social habits such as drug addiction , the use of alcohol , sexual promiscuity . The reading of pornography was no significant factor . " What specifically might provoke a quiet , shy twenty-one-yearold boy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Finegood , echoing Barrett 's question . " Every individual case varies , but sexual violence is usually a reflection of sexual incompetence . Rape removes the rapist 's feeling of constant inferiority . A boy coming out of a middle- or upper-class environment who commits rape may simply be rebeling against years of repressed resentment toward his mother or father . Most likely the  | rapist may have had a domineering parent or parents , or , conversely , he may have had an indifferent or inadequate parent or parents . Show me a boy made submissive by a father he fears , and you will be showing me a young man with the potential to assert himself one day by an act of violence in which he can degrade his victim . " When their lunch had ended , and they were leaving the Bistro , Dr. Finegood gave Barrett one last piece of advice . " The importance of information on Jadway to your case I can understand . At the same time , do n't overlook the importance of the actors in that rape case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn more about Jerry Griffith , his family , his friends . Nevertheless , I would suggest you redouble your efforts to obtain more information . If you do , I feel certain you 'll unearth other reasons for Jerry 's behavior  --  and then , perhaps , you can convince a jury that Jadway 's book was not the motivating force behind the young man 's criminal outburst . And if I were you , I would go even further . I 'd lose no time in trying to find out something about the victim , that eighteen-year-old girl whom Jerry raped . You 'd be surprised what an investigation of both the rapist and the raped can bring to light . I 'm not predicting that this will lead to anything . I 'm merely advising you to leave no stone unturned . Well , good luck . Do keep me fully informed . I look forward to taking the stand in this trial , even though the prosecution , I hear , will have a psychiatrist no less prominent than Dr. Roger Trimble to contradict me . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch , Barrett had decided to take Dr. Finegood 's advice . He would have a brief look at the life and times of eighteen-year-old Sheri Moore . He doubted whether anything would come of it , but he must turn this stone also . The newspaper file in the office had supplied only sketchy information on the victim . Sheri Moore was the youngest of five children . Her parents were long divorced . Her father , Howard Moore , was an engineer at North American Rockwell Corporation , and he lived in Santa Monica . Sheri was a freshman at Santa Monica College . She shared an apartment with a girl friend , Darlene Nelson , on Doheny Drive in West Hollywood . The last two facts alone puzzled Barrett . Why would anyone live in West Hollywood if she was attending school in Santa Monica ? It was a long  | commuting trip to make daily , especially for a girl who owned no automobile . The solution to this , as well as more detailed bioraPhical information , might best be found at Sheri 's school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College . There had been only one surprise , and this had come from the records in the administration department . Despite the press stories , Sheri Moore was no longer a student in good standing at the college . After receiving passing grades during the first semester of her freshman year , she had become increasingly erratic about attending classes regularly and handing in papers , and during her second term her tests had consequently been poor . One month before becoming the victim of rape , she had dropped out of Santa Monica College . Barrett had been introduced to a dozen of Sheri 's former classmates , young men and women who were either gathered in raucous conversational groups before the college cafeteria and bookstore or basking in the sun on the grassy slopes of the campus . None of Barrett 's questions had elicited an objective or detailed response . One girl , an honor student , recalled that Sheri After locking the door of the convertible , Barrett crossed the yl Dill parking lot , went up the steps quickly , and entered the rear corthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He caught an elevator to the fifth floor and went directly to the nurses ' counter .  | had become bored with school and had spoken of a career as a model or actress , and that then she had quit school to move to West Hollywood , where she hoped to find a part-time job that would support future acting lessons . A football player had mumbled something about Sheri 's being " a fun kid , a swinger . " But listening to the other students , any visitor would have thought that they were speaking of Joan of Arc . The fact that one of their own had become tho victim of a crime , was seriously injured and still lay in critical condition , seemed to have the effect of making most of them speak of her with reverence , extolling her virtues . Perhaps , Barrett had told himself as he had left the campus , he was being unfairly cynical . Perhaps Sheri Moore had indeed been virtue personified . Now , on the final lap of his inquiry into the life and times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Negro registered nurse greeted him from her desk . " I 'd like to inquire about Sheri Moore , " said Barrett . " I 'm a blend . " " She 's doing just about as well as can be expected , " said the purse . " She 's still in a coma . " Momentarily she searched for the chart , then gave up . " She had a comfortable night . Do you want to see her ? Because if you do , I must tell you visitors are restricted to the names on a list the doctor left . If you want me to check it for your name ? " " No , never mind . I only wanted to find out how she 's doing . " He hesitated . " Are there many people on that visitors ' list ? " Now it was the nurse 's turn to be hesitant . " You 're not from the press are you ? " " The press ? God , no , I 'm a friend who ? " " We ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . Well , I suppose there 's nothing wrong in telling you that Sheri 's relatives and her one closest girl friend are allowed to see her . In fact , her father and her girl friend , the one she was rooming with , Darlene Nelson , they 're in her room right now . " " Thanks , " said Barrett . " I wonder whether you could let me know when Miss Nelson leaves . I 'll be in the waiting room . " " Well , no need your having to wait for that . Darlene 's just sitting there . I 'd be glad to fetch her for you , Mr. . . . " She drew out the " Mister , " turning it into a question . " Barrett , " he said . " Mr. Barrett . Thank you ever so much . " He walked down the hall and turned into the visitors ' waiting room , a small alcove furnished with chintz and wicker and a television set . The waiting room was unoccupied . Barrett halted before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and circled the room , smoking , going over Darlene Nelson 's connection with the rape case . It was Darlene , he remembered , who had returned to their apartment on Doheny Drive , to discover Sheri Moore sprawled on the bedroom floor , bloodied and only half conscious . It was then that Darlene had heard Sheri murmur that she had been raped , and after that Sheri had lost consciousness . It was Darlene who had summoned the ambulance and the police . From the recess of the waiting room , Barrett heard two women 's voices growing louder . He pivoted around in time to see the nurse and a girl with a boyish haircut and the shirttails of her  | blouse hanging out over her dungarees come into view . The two were absorbed in conversation . The nurse was saying , " I sure envy you , Darlene . The Under ground Railroad , that 's my favorite fun place whenever I can gel the time . I 'd give anything to be there at that opening . " " It 'll be jumping this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as tonight . It 's just a pity poor Sheri is n't well enough . They 're having her favorite group there . She 's got all their albums . " " She 'll get well . " " Fingers crossed . " The nurse had gone , and Darlene Nelson was approaching Bar rett with a quizzical expression . " I 'm Darlene Nelson , " she said . " Are you the one who wanted to see me ? " " That 's correct . I ? " " Do I know you ? " She had a nervous habit , a flick of her hand as if brushing her hair off her shoulder , but she touched nothing , because her hair was cut short . Perhaps the haircut was a recent idea , thought Barrett . " I 'm Michael Barrett , " he said . This brought no recognition .. " The lawyer representing Ben Fremont , the owner of the bookstore , who ? " Recognition came . " The dirty book , " she said . Suspicion followed . " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of questions , " said Barrett " Would you like to sit down ? " She made no move to sit . Her hand brushed past her ear . " What questions ? " " Well , for one thing , had Miss Moore or yourself , either of you , had any acquaintance with Jerry Griffith before the night he ? ? " " No , " she said . " All right , " Barrett said . " What about any of Jerry 's friends ? Did you know any of them ? " " How would I know who his friends are ? Even if I 'd met one by accident , I would n't know it . " " Well , Miss Nelson , I 'm thinking of one in particular . He 's a student at UCLA and lives in Westwood . His name is George Perkins . Did you ever hear Miss Moore  --  Sheri  --  mention him ? " " No. "  | " What about yourself ? Do you know George Perkins ? " " No . No , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could tell me . On the night you found Sheri ? " " Mr. Barrett , I do n't think I should be talking to you . I ca n't tell you a thing . Besides , there 's nothing to tell . I told it all to the police , and it 's been hashed over in the papers . I better go now . Excuse me . " Darlene Nelson had been backing off , and now she rushed out of the room . Barrett shrugged , emptied and pocketed his pipe , and headed for the elevator . A few minutes later he descended the rear staircase of the hospital and went out into the parking lot . Starting toward his car , he heard someone running behind him . He wheeled around to find a stocky , brawny man , older than himself , with a large head and almost no neck , coming toward him . The man was upon him , gasping for breath , face livid , hands knotted into fists . " Are you the guy named Barrett ? " the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Recoiling before the other 's fury , momentarily stupefied , Barrett nodded . " Yes , I ? " " You listen to me , then ! " the man bellowed , shooting both hands forward and clutching the lapels of Barrett 's jacket angrily . " You listen to me , you rotten bastard , because I 'm going to tell you something ? " He wrenched Barrett toward him , and in self-defense Barrett struck at the man 's arms to free himself . For a moment they were apart , and then the wild man lunged at him again . Barrett threw out his hands to fend him off as the man swung a powerful righthand hook at his face . Barrett tried to duck backward , but the arcing fist grazed his chin , rattling his teeth , and , off balance , he went reeling backward , falling , landing on his haunches . The suddenness of the assault , more than the force of it , had dazed Barrett , and he sat on the tarred surface of the lot , holding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above him loomed the distended face of his assailant . " You listen to me , you bastard , " the man panted , hands still  | clenched . " I 'm Sheri 's father , see  --  I 'm Howard Moore  --  and I 'm telling you there 's more where that came from , see  --  there 's lots more . And I , m warning you to keep your goddam nose out of our private affairs . My poor girl 's on the critical list , and all because some little prick was made crazy by your goddam dirty book  --  and anybody standing up for that kind of book is going to get it from me . So you remember this , mister  --  you keep your snotty nose out of my affairs  --  or next time Ill beat you up until you 're in worse shape than my poor girl is in now . You just remember that ! Howard Moore whirled around and went stalking off . His head clearing , Mike Barrett struggled to his feet . Anger at this attack , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and ill his immediate instinct was to go after Moore and give him back some of the same . But then , watching the pathetic figure slow down at the door of the hospital , watching the older man open the glass door and for an instant hang his head and press it against the door , Barrett s anger gave way to a surge of pity and reason . The man was a father , helpless , and up there five stories was the daughter he had spawned , his little girl , violated , unconscious . And , what the hell , he had to strike out at something , someone . Barrett reached for his handkerchief and touched it to his mouth . A faint bloodstain showed on the white linen . The inside of his lower lip had been cut . Well , so be it . Going slowly , dusting himself off , he returned to his car . Not until an hour later , when he was once more secure in his office and Donna had returned with disinfectant from the pharmacy downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been waiting to ask . He had remembered hearing Darlene Nelson and the nurse as they talked in the hallway of the hospital , and here was Donna , the office secretary who always read the entertainment Pages and gossip columns and who tried to keep young by reading about the young . " Donna , my pretty , ii seems to m just e I 've heard of it , but I just ca n't remember exactly  --  forgetting the Civil War , meaning right now , today  --  what 's a place called The Underground Railroad ? " " Boy , are you the straight one . That 's the leading hangout for all the youngsters . It 's out on Melrose . Strictly rock groups , dancing , near beer and nothing stronger . "  | " I understand there 's a group opening there tonight ? " " Well , now , maybe you 're not so straight . Yup . Gregorian Chant . " " Gregorian what ? I 'm not talking about medieval ecclesiastical music or choirs . I 'm ? " " Straight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss . Gregorian Chant . They used to be called Chauncey and the Snow Shoes until they merged with the L.A. Heat . They 're the hottest rock group in the country right now . And they 're opening at The Underground Railroad at seven tonight . What have you got in mind ? " " Closing the generation gap . What 's the opposite of straight , Donna ? Curved ? " A " Groovy . " " That 'll be me at seven-thirty tonight . " EVEN IN the darkness of the parking area behind the gigantic hardware store that had been converted into a rock haven , Mike Barrett could hear the incessant , cacophonous music blaring through every window and wall of The Underground Railroad . When he paused under the street light on Melrose Avenue , he could make out the time on his wristwatch . It was twenty minutes after seven in the evening . Across the street there were two other teen-age water holes , one called The Limbo and the other The Raga-Rock , but tonight they were nearly deserted . The real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two orderly lines of bizarrely costumed youngsters were moving steadily into The Underground Railroad . Barrett made his way to the end of one line and fell in , and he was relieved that he had followed Donna 's advice and not worn a suit and a tie . Actually , his crew-neck cotton pullover and corduroys were still conservative enough to label him , if not exactly an octagon or a rub  --  oh , he had done some homework  --  then at least a partial square . But then it was n't his attire that made him self-conscious , he knew , but his age , and for the first time he believed that half of America 's entire population was under the age of twenty-five . Following the swaying line of youngsters toward the roughhewn log-cabin entrance , he was satisfied that he had not told  | Faye where he was going . She would have wanted to come along , as one goes to the zoo , and , man , that would have been too much . This was one of his standing-date nights with Faye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , and he had n't had the courage to cancel or postpone it . Instead , he had telephoned Faye to explain that they 'd have to skip their regular dinner , because a research lead had turned up . He had promised to meet her at his apartment at eleven o'clock . There was no research lead , of course . There was only his knowledge that this was a happening night at The Underground Railroad , and that Darlene Nelson would be here , and perhaps one of the happenings would be George Perkins . A hunch , no more . If George appeared , he would have friends , and they might also be Jerry Griffith 's friends . A fuller roster of Jerry 's friends was what Barrett wanted . " Let 's have some green , man , " he heard someone say above him , and he realized that the speaker  --  who resembled Lincoln , assuming Lincoln had been black  --  was in the doorway collecting the entrance fee . He paid the man the two dollars and proceeded inside . At once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers who were seeking tables , he was lost . He tried to orient himself to the scene and adjust himself to the sound . Before him lay a madhouse of tables around which were packed the music lovers . Then he could see the dance floor , as animated as a bucketful of writhing worms , and , facing the dance floor , the bandstand , over which a giant kaleidoscope kept turning and turning , and , beyond , more tables . The lighting that came from the rotating stroboscope produced a spinning rainbow of psychedelic colors . On the dance floor , boys and girls of white , black , brown , yellow skin in micro-skirts , capes , hussar uniforms , relating not to one another but to the dissonant music , were going through their highly individual frenetic dance undulations . Yet there was a single movement to the tribal dance : every male native gyrated his pelvis and torso , every female native thrust forward her bust and wiggled her butt , as they paid homage to the howling voices and pinging electric guitars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandstand . It consisted  | of four boys dressed like cotton-picking slaves , and presumably the Gregorian part consisted of the three shaggy-haired whites loosely chained together , strumming away , occasionally joining the Chant , a fat young Negro , in his solo . Hemmed in on all sides , Barrett began to feel faint . And his cars rang . And his heart yearned for the sweet security of Dave Brubeck and Gerry Mulligan and Davey Pell . He needed a more isolated lookout post , and then he saw , to his left , past the aisle , the long oak bar . A portion of it was relatively free of humanity . Turning , pushing , excusing himself , pushing , going sideways , he made slow progress toward the bar , and after several minutes he reached it . " Scotch and water , " he gasped . " Sorry , sir , " said the moustached young bartender . " We 've got only near beer  --  and of course any soft drink you can think of . " Barrett had forgotten they had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As the beer foamed into the stein , Barrett scanned the scene . The performing group had segued into a new number . This one was less discordant , less onomatopoeic , less thwacking , less jarring . The number seemed to owe its ancestry to the ethnic music of Bessie Smith , sort of Negro blues and gospel mildly crossed with hillbilly . It was sad and it was message , and it echoed a generation 's disillusionment , skepticism , protest , and it called for love of man for Man . And at once Barrett welcomed and enjoyed the sounds and sights and the lost love children on the floor . Somewhere he 'd read Bob Dylan 's explanation : The only beauty 's ugly , man . Yes . But it was beauty nevertheless , its own beauty . He reached for his near beer , sipped it slowly , looked up at the big posters above the bar  --  Harriet Beecher Stowe , John Brown and his body , Dred Scott  --  and he listened to the music . After a short respite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room once more , determined to search it for his quarry . In a few moments he realized that he had undertaken an impossible assignment . There were simply too many young men , and too many of these who looked like the bearded George Perkins , and not one of them could he distinguish as being George himself . He decided to scan the club a final time , from the entrance doorway to the farthest reach of the room . His eyes shifted to the  | entrance , and , to his surprise , standing there inside it was a newcomer whom he recognized instantly . The newcomer was a slim , haggard boy , neatly combed hair , sallow complexion and pinched features , sport jacket and sport shirt and pressed slacks . He was the one Barrett had never met , yet he was as familiar now as the countless pictures of him that had appeared in the press . Filled with amazement , overlaid by confusion , Barrett stared at the newcomer . Here , within distance of his voice , was Jerry Griffith , searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrett wondered , ' What in the devil was this boy , even though free on bail , doing in this public place ? He could n't imagine Maggie Russell , let alone Frank Griffith , permit ting Jerry to leave the house and come to this place . Or did n't they know ? Had Jerry slipped out ? This was a perfect opportunity to confront him , to speak sympathetically to him , question him , yet Barrett did not move . As a person he was kept in his place by some sense of decency. and as an attorney he was kept back by some instinct that detected possible good fortune . He maintained his watch over Jerry Griffith and he waited with undefined expectancy . Barrett tried to read Jerry 's eyes . At first they were furtive and afraid , like those of a wanted man on the run who was fearful of being recognized . Then , as if he had realized that the very numbers gave him safety , melted him into the mass , Jerry 's eyes lost their fear and became those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy was looking for someone , some specific person .. He was on tiptoes , examining the occupants of each table , when his head gave a short jerk of recognition and he started to wave and then apparently thought better of it . At once his entire expression had become purposeful . He had found the one he wanted . Jerry Griffith started toward Barrett , abruptly veered between two tables , and then nimbly threaded his way between more of the seated patrons toward his objective . Picking his way forward , he slowed , and at a table of three young men and two girls he halted . He reached out toward the broad-shouldered young man who had his back to him , and he tapped the boy on the shoulder . The young man 's head swiveled around , and the bearded profile revealed itself to be George Perkins .  | Squinting in the ever-changing light , Barrett tried to catch George 's reaction . In all , there were three reactions , one following the other with amazing rapidity . First , surprise . Second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bar , Barrett continued to follow the silent drama . Jerry was trying to speak to George Perkins . And George wanted nothing to do with him . Jerry gripped George 's shoulder several times , whispering to him , and each time George shrugged him off . At last Jerry 's persistence appeared to win , for George came heatedly to his feet and , hulking over his friend , shook his head , refusing to listen to him further . Still , Jerry continued speaking against the din . Finally , as if in exasperated agreement , George nodded , and looked around . Just as the music stopped and a member of the performing group announced an intermission , George pointed off , and his finger was directed at a couple who had left the dance floor and were making their way to a table set on an aisle . Automatically Barrett 's attention shifted to the couple . For a moment , the boy blocked the view of his female partner . The boy was clean-shaven except for his long sideburns , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was Darlene Nelson , none other , still wearing the dungarees and loose shirttails she had worn earlier , during her hospital visit . Now a third figure crossed swiftly into view . It was that of Jerry Griffith again , almost bowling over customers as he fought his way through the returning dancers to catch Darlene Nelson . Just as Darlene approached her empty chair , Jerry Griffith intercepted her . Once more , for Barrett , dumb show . Jerry was blocking the girl from her seat , seeming to introduce himself , trying to address her . Darlene 's displeasure was even more clearly visible than George Perkins ' had been moments before . She tried to ignore Jerry , push past him to reach her chair , but still he tried to impede her progress long enough to get her to listen to him . With a final effort , she slipped past him . He had begun to follow her , still speaking , when she stopped and did an about-face . She appeared to be speaking sharply , curtly , in an undertone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry had  | the effect of a slap in the face . Jerry recoiled , looking stricken , then he tried to say something to her as she sat down , but nt words seemed to come . Instead , there was only a kind of breathless . mouthing and gesturing in place of the missing words . Suddenly Jerry seemed to petrify , features livid , and he stared down at her as she gaily resumed conversation with her comPan ions . For a second , Barrett wondered whether Jerry might strike her or attempt to o strangle her , r , but he did neither . His arms went slowly down to his sides . His face went slack . His body appeared to wilt . Dazed , he backed away , turned away , wandered into the passage between the tables , until he seemed to remember where he was and who he was . Then , as if galvanized , in a spurt , he charged past new arrivals and dashed to the entrance and was gone . Observing Jerry 's frantic exit , Barrett remained rooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident . Jerry 's friend George knew Darlene , or at least knew what she looked like . Jerry , on the other hand , plainly had not known Sheri 's friend Darlene before . But what had he said to her , and what had she said to him , that had so infuriated him , finally crushed him and made him flee ? That instant , Barrett decided that he t must find out . A confronts tion with Jerry was not only in order but essential . Barrett pushed himself from the bar , but before taking three steps he was brought to a standstill by a noisy bevy of teen-age girls who had just entered the club . Trapped in their midst , he found it difficult to escape . And now one little Kewpie-doll blonde in sweat shirt and shorts had discovered him . She reached up to bring him closer . " Girls , " she shrieked , " look what I found  --  the genuine thousand-year-old man , the missing link ! Ai n't he the cutest ? " She planted a kiss on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , link , come on , let 's dance . " Her arms were wrapped tightly around him and she shimmied in semblance of a dance . " Honey , I was just on my way to the men 's room , " Barrett protested . " Give a guy a break . " She grinned up at him . " That 's more fun than girls ? " She released him . " At your age , I guess it is : " IBarrett broke away . By the time he had reached the sidewalk , breathless , he knew that he had lost five minutes . He looked up  | end down Melrose , but no one resembling Jerry Griffith was in Piet . There were more youngsters in line , waiting to get inside the club . Barrett approached them . He explained to the ones at the head of the line that he was searching for someone who 'd left the club a few minutes earlier . He tried to describe Jerry Griffith . He found he could not do so effectively . The only outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combed hair . Even that brought no recognition . " Well , he came out of the club on the run , " added Barrett . " Does that ring a bell ? " " He was running ? " chirped a long-tressed girl . " Yeah , there was one kid who came out fast , ' cause I remember saying , Maybe the Chant scared him . " The others in line laughed , and then the girl said to Barrett , " I think he went thataway . " She pointed west , and there was more laughter . Barrett thanked her and started up Melrose toward La Cienega Boulevard . He walked and walked , poking into open stores , crossing and recrossing the street , but nowhere was Jerry Griffith to be seen . After fifteen minutes , he was back where he had started . Disconsolately , Barrett acknowledged defeat . He headed into the darkened dirt parking area . Nearing his convertible , he realized that in his frustration and haste he had overlooked the most obvious lead to Jerry 's whereabouts . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rush , his car would have still been parked here when Barrett had come out . He could have waited by the lot entrance until Jerry came by to get the car and drive home . By now he had probably long since taken his car and left . Yet , small hope , maybe the boy 's car was still here . Barrett tried to recall the make of the vehicle . He had seen it noted in his office file folder on the Griffith boy . It was a British automobile . Definitely . At once it came back to him . A recent-model white Rover sedan . He halted , and glanced about . There was a gray Thunderbird , and there was an old dirty white Jaguar , and there was a recentmodel white Rover sedan . His hope quickened . Probably dozens of newish white Rover sedans were out tonight in Los Angeles . Nevertheless , this might be Jerry 's own . Barrett moved toward the Rover . As he came up behind it , even in this poorly lit corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone in the front seat . He circled the car cautiously , in case the person were two persons and they were making out . Arriving at the rolled-up window of the front door , he could see that it was one person . It was a young man , and he was slumped over the steering wheel , very still , as if in sleep . The hair , the side of the face  --  enough to tell him that it was Jerry Griffith . Barrett hesitated , then a terrible thought entered his head , and he hesitated no longer . He rapped on the glass . The figure draped over the wheel did not move . Hastily Barrett tried the front door . It opened , and as it opened , Jerry Griffith 's limp form slid off the wheel and began to fall sideways . Barrett caught him and with an effort shoved him upright . The boy was unconscious , his eyes closed , his face as ashen as a mask of death . " Jerry , " Barrett whispered to him , " Jerry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The inert form remained lifeless . Barrett bent into the car , trying to determine whether the boy was breathing and whether any pulse beat could be detected in the wrist . Doing so , he realized that the open door had lighted the car 's interior , and for the first time he could see what lay on the front seat beside Jerry . There was an empty pill container . On the car floor , an empty soda bottle , the chaser . Jerry Griffith had attempted suicide . Had he succeeded ? Still not sure , Barrett pressed his ear against Jerry 's chest and listened for a heartbeat . He could hear none over the sounds of Dylan 's " Mr. Tambourine Man " seeping out of the rear of The Underground Railroad . Barrett concentrated on the pulse again . At first his fingers felt nothing , but then there was a tiny jump , and he could n't be certain whether it was from the boy 's pulse or was due to his own fingers ' nerve ends . Instantly Barrett 's brain received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could summon the Fire Department 's emergency squad or he could try to resuscitate the boy himself by getting him on his feet and inducing him to vomit or he could speed him to a private doctor . Each possibility provided a risk . The Fire Department offered the most expeditious help  --  and the guarantee of a second scandal  | visited upon the boy , a second death without dying , presuming he was still alive . An attempt to resuscitate the boy by himself was the fastest kind of first aid , but it was also the most amateurish and inadequate . A private doctor was the slowest but the safest course  --  and immediately Barrett 's mind was made up , for he had thought of a physician who was near and would help . Doc Quigley , his own physician ever since he had made his home in 1 , os Angeles , had his residence on North Arden Drive , in Beverly IIills , just a quick , short drive away . He had called Doc Quigley only last week and set up a dinner date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about the pathology of rape . Quigley had made the date , busy though he was , working long evenings at home on a professional paper he was soon to deliver . More likely than not , he would be at home . And , no matter what happened , he would be discreet . Quickly Barrett went through the inert boy 's jacket pockets , until at last he located the ignition key . With haste he forced Jerry 's body away from the wheel toward the passenger side of the front seat . Once the body lay slumped against the opposite door , Barrett settled himself behind the wheel and started the Rover . Only when he had swung the car out of the dirt parking area , and onto Melrose , did Barrett wonder whether he was bringing a corpse to Dr. Quigley  --  or a resurrected star witness to District Attorney Duncan . FORTY MINUTES had passed since Barrett and Dr. Quigley had carried the body of Jerry Griffith into the physician 's house on North Arden Drive . Barrett had explained how he had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After leaving the boy on the daybed in the physician 's study , Barrett had handed the doctor the empty prescription bottle . Dr. Quigley had glanced at it . " Nembutals , " he 'd murmured . He had taken up his black bag from beside his desk and pulled a chair up beside the boy . " Is he alive , Doc ? " Barrett had asked . Dr. Quigley had not looked up . " We 'll see . You can wait in the living room , Mike . " That had been forty minutes ago , and Barrett , tensely seated  | lion the sofa , leafing through the same magazine he had unsuccessfully been trying to read all this time , reasoned that the length of time was a good sign . Had Jerry been dead on arrival , Barrett felt , he would have been so informed before now . The length of time meant that the doctor was working to save his patient . Barrett had again tried to concentrate on the magazine , when he heard Dr. Quigley 's cough . He stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came tiredly into the room , removing his spectacles and rubbing his eyes . " He 's all right , Mike , " Dr. Quigley announced . " Thank God  --  and you . " " He took enough sleeping tablets to kill an army . You must have caught him just as he lost consciousness . Lucky you brought him right over . Another five minutes and he 'd have been gone . I administered some strong antidotes . He responded , and he 's cleaned out now . " " Is he conscious ? " " Fully . But weak , very weak . However , hospitalization wo n't be necessary . Especially considering his general situation . I think he can be taken home in about an hour . A sound night 's sleep , and some rest tomorrow , and he 'll be fully recovered . These youngsters have remarkable recuperative powers . " Dr. Quigley felt inside his robe pocket and extracted a prescription slip . " Here 's a number you 're to call . He says that the only person he wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on here  --  Maggie Russell . " Dr. Quigley gave the slip to Barrett , adding , " That 's her telephone number , the private number of a phone she has in her bedroom . Jerry says keep trying it until you get her . He says she 'll come by for him . " " I 'll take care of it . " " Very well . I 'd better get back to my patient . " He hesitated . " Frank Griffith owes you a lot , Mike . You should have his gratitude . " " He 'll never know , " said Barrett . " Anyway , my only interest is in the boy . " " Have it your way . " The physician coughed into the palm of his hand . " There 's an extension phone in the dining room . " Dr. Quigley left . Barrett went into the dining room , flipped on the overhead light , took the telephone off the marble-topped sideboard and brought it to the dining table . He placed the pre-  | scription slip beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's private number . The telephone rang and rang , without answer . He would give it a few more seconds , he decided , and then try again in a little while . Sooner or later she would return to her room . As he listened to the continuing ring , it suddenly ceased and a breathless feminine voice came on . " Hello ? " " Miss Russell ? " " This is she . " " Mike Barrett . Sorry to disturb you , but ? " " I thought I told you I did n't want to hear from you again . " " Hold on . I 'm not calling for myself . I 'm calling for Jerry . " " Jerry ? " " Your cousin . I 'm with him now . I ? " " I do n't understand . You ca n't be . He 's not allowed to leave the house . " " He left it early this evening , no matter what his orders were . Without wasting words , let me tell you what happened . But first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen in on this line ? " t " No  --  no , it 's my own . " Her voice had become anxious . " What happened ? Is anything wrong ? " " Jerry 's fine now , but it was nip and tuck for a while . Let me make it brief . Sometime after seven , I had reason to drop in on a teen-age hangout on Melrose Avenue . . . " He quickly described Jerry 's arrival at The Underground Railroad , what he had witnessed of Jerry 's confrontations with George Perkins and Darlene Nelson , and his discovery of Jerry 's unconscious body in the Rover . Then he gave her Dr. Quigley 's good news . " Jerry wanted someone to get in touch with you . He did n't want anyone else to know . " " No one must know , " she said urgently . " But he is all right ? The doctor said that , did n't he ? " " Absolutely . By the time you get here , Jerry will be able to go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Let me give you the address . " He gave it to her , and then she hung up . Returning the telephone to the sideboard , Barrett wondered  | whether he should stay until Maggie Russell arrived . There wa no reason to remain , except to see her once more and to ingratiatc himself with her . He did n't like that . He also did n't wish to em barrass her with his presence . Despite what he had done for the Griffiths tonight , he was still the enemy . This brought his mind back to the impending trial . There was so much to do , and there was so little time left . Faye Osborn would not be at his apartment until eleven o'clock . There remained a stretch of several useful hours during which he could research the legal precedents in previous censorship trials . He would tell Dr. Quigley that Maggie Russell would be along shortly , and let him know that he could be reached at the office should he be needed further , and then , after summoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would be on his way . IN rH1 NIGHT quiet of his office , Mike Barrett had devoted himself not to a study of legal precedents in earlier censorship trials but to a folder that contained both popular and scholarly writings on censorship that had appeared in American and British maga zines during the last dozen years . These were largely articles by authors , critics , publishers , scholars , clipped by Leo Kimura , to give Zelkin and himself an up-to-date background on censorship arguments in the literary field . He had read nine or ten of these articles and was skimming one written by Maurice Girodias for the London publication Encounter , when a single paragraph arrested his attention . Girodias had been saying that most human beings were born from an act of unromantic lust , and that the species was still being propagated through lust , and that most human beings were as preoccupied with sex as they were with food and sleep ; yet , even though sex was basic to each person 's life , its practice had been complicated and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , Girodias went on , every man and every woman were involved daily in acts of rape . It was this paragraph that Barrett reread carefully . " Rape , " Girodias had written , " is held to be the most uncivilised form of assault on anyone 's privacy . And yet the colourless family man , the sedate and faithful husband whose only memorable feminine conquest was performed through marriage , usually  | I I rnpcs dozens of girls a day . The possession , of course , is only visual ; a quick appreciative glance is all there is to that microrape , which is always furtive and often even unconscious . But the action is there and it does yield a tiny dose of sexual satisfaction . ... As to the faithful wife of the same man , does she resort to fashion , jewels , perfumes in order to seduce her own husband ? Not at all : she uses all those classical artifacts because she wants to offer herself to the whole race of males , to seduce and be raped by all  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man are still at work . " How true , Barrett thought . His own feelings testified to it . He possessed one woman all but legally . He had Faye . Yet yesterday the inner barbarian hiding beneath the civilized veneer had forced him to commit rape at least twice  --  first the rape of a young girl in a bikini emerging from the Beverly Hills Hotel swimming pool , later the rape of an attractive young woman named Maggie Russell whom he had followed into the bar of the Beverly Hilton Hotel . The only difference between Jerry Griffith and himself , between Jerry and most other men , was that Jerry had forcibly violated another with his penis , while Barrett and most men violated women with their eyes . Jerry 's act was criminal , and his own was harmless , true enough . But both kinds of rape were inspired by the same savage and natural drive . The difference was merely that Jerry had been too ill to control his impulse , whereas the vast majority of men were rational enough to channel this impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , no man should hold himself as being better than his fellow men in his attitude toward sex , or believe he was wholly without blame . How many visual rapes did Elmo Duncan , protector of public morals , commit every day of every week ? Shaking his head , Barrett resumed his reading . Having finished the article , he was about to pick up the next one , when the telephone at his elbow rang out . He snatched at the receiver . The voice he heard belonged to Maggie Russell . " I had expected you to be at Dr. Quigley 's when I got there , " she said . " He told me you went on to your office . " " Is everything taken care of ? " " Jerry 's fine now . I got him into the house unnoticed . He 's  | asleep . I . . . I wondered if I might see you for just a moment ? " " Of course , " said Barrett with genuine enthusiasm . " But there 's no need for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a matter of fact , I was going back to my apartment in a little while , and I thought I 'd stop off in Westwood for a sandwich and a cup of coffee . Think you could join me ? " " Anywhere you say . I wo n't take much of your time . " " Let me see . I know  --  just off Westwood Boulevard there 's a little coffee shop , sandwich place called Ell 's . It 's ? " " I know it . " " Let 's say fifteen minutes . " Exactly sixteen minutes later , Mike Barrett drove into the filling station next to Ell 's , left instructions for a tank of gas and a quart of oil if required , and hastened to the restaurant . Entering , he saw that she had arrived before him . She was seated at a table in the rear , thoughtfully smoking , unaware of his entrance . He moved past the counter and the stools toward her , keeping his eyes on her . Her shining dark hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive as he had remembered . she was saying , " and to thank you , which I neglected to do on the phone , to thank you for what you did for Jerry and . . . and for me . I do n't know how we can ever repay you . " " Miss Russell , I did what any other person in my place would have done . "  | All that he could make out of her attire above the table top was the diaphanous white silk blouse she was wearing , which clung provocatively to her pointed breasts , and the outline of the lace half-bra beneath was visible . Another rape , he thought , and could not help but smile . But then , nearing the table , he could see how serious she was , and , remembering what had occurred earlier in the evening , and how it must have affected her , he became serious , too . Coming here , he had not speculated at length on her motive for wishing to meet hi after although he had guessed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair across from her , and ordered melted-cheese sandwiches and coffee for each of them , she confirmed his guess . " I had to see ou to apologize for being so rude on the Y phone , " " Not any other person , and certainly not every lawyer , " she insisted . " I 'm sure there are plenty of shyster lawyers who would look in another direction and let an opposition witness die in a similar situation , just because it would strengthen their position in court . There are plenty of those , I 'd wager . " " Miss Russell , you 're speaking of subhumans . I was speaking of people . " " Yes , " she said . She waited for the waitress to pour the coffee , then she went on . " Anyway , forgive my behavior on the telephone . I took a cab to Dr. Quigley 's , and on the way I realized how cold I 'd been to you , but then I expected you to be there so I could ask your forgiveness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me you 'd gone to your office . So , once I 'd sneaked Jerry up to bed , I got up the courage , and it took some , to phone you . " " I 'm glad you did . I 've already told you what I saw at The Underground Railroad . I still do n't know what sent him rushing out of there the way he did . I wonder if he spoke of that ? " " No . He was too ill and exhausted to speak of anything much . I doubt if he 'll tell me about that . I know I wo n't ask him . " " I did n't mean that you should . But this is a very serious matter . When a boy tries to kill himself , I think it 's a good thing to know why . I suppose he said nothing about that either ? " " Nothing . Nor would he explain why he had those pills on him . " " It could have been that his troubles and problems had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what set it off . The way George Perkins treated him ? Something Darlene Nelson said to him ? Or something that happened during the day , this morning , this afternoon ? " " I do n't know , " she said . Her eyes met his briefly , and then she looked down at the table . " Or maybe I know one thing , something that happened today . Perhaps I should tell you . You 've involved yourself enough with Jerry to  --  to save him , so I suppose you 've earned the right to know something . But before I do tell you , I  --  I have one question , one thing I wanted to ask you . " " Go ahead . " " I wondered what you were doing at that club , of all places , while Jerry was there . Were you following  --  shadowing him , as  | they say ? I suppose that 's one of the things lawyers have to do to get evidence . " " Do n't believe everything you see on television , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , as a matter of fact , I was not following Jerry . I did n't think there was one chance in a million that Jerry would dare leave his home while out on bail . I was following someone else . Or , rather , trying to find someone else . I knew Jerry had a friend named George Perkins . I 've even met Perkins . I hoped to see him with some of his friends , who I hoped would also be some of Jerry 's friends . I learned that The Underground Railroad was the favorite hangout for many of the kids . Tonight was a big opening . I thought it might attract George Perkins . It did . I did n't for one moment imagine it would also attract Jerry Griffith . ' When he appeared , I  --  I never went near Jerry  --  decided not to bother him ? until that crazy little scene with Darlene , when he seemed to come apart , before he ran out . Then I decided I 'd better find him and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him . " " Thank the Lord , " she whispered . " Satisfactory explanation , Miss Russell ? " " I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to put you on like that . You must think I suspect every move you make . I did last night . Believe me , Mr. Barrett , I do n't tonight , not any more . " " I appreciate that . " The sandwiches were served , and once the waitress had left , Barrett began to eat . Looking up , he realized that Maggie Russell had not touched anything in front of her . She stared at him worriedly . " I promised to tell you something that happened today that might have  --  well , might have unduly agitated Jerry . " " It 's not necessary that you tell me anything , Miss Russell . " " I do n't feel disloyal telling you this . It will all come out , anyway , and it may offer some explanation of what led to Jerry 's behavior this evening . Mr. Yerkes , Luther Yerkes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our affairs , except he is one of my uncle 's major accounts , and I suspect he has some political interest in backing the District Attorney for a higher office , so he wants Mr. Duncan to make a great showing against you , and he feels that Jerry can be an important witness against The Seven Minutes  | well , he 's been over several times , and early this afternoon he came over and brought with him the psychoanalyst that my uncle 's lawyer , Mr. Polk , had suggested . He brought with him Dr. Roger Trimble . " " Luther Yerkes at the Griffiths ' . " Barrett clucked his tongue . " Well , I should n't be surprised . It fits . Until now I 'd heard only unconfirmed rumors about Yerkes ' backing Duncan for the Senate . This would seem to confirm it . It also explains the rash of trial publicity Duncan has been getting . Sorry to interrupt . Please go on . " " Jerry was to go into therapy with Dr. Trimble , against his will . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Trimble and Jerry alone . After about an hour , Dr. Trimble came down and gave a kind of assessment of Jerry 's condition . Without going into detail , I do n't mind repeating this much . He told us that Jerry was extremely disturbed . He said Jerry was completely ambivalent about the rape . On the one hand , he hated to discuss it . On the other , when he did discuss it , he revealed a certain amount of pride in the act . He said Jerry had a wish for selfdestruction , possibly real , more likely fantasy . He felt that Jerry should be subjected to as few pressures as possible . Then Mr. Yerkes wanted to know how Jerry might stand up if he were called as a prosecution witness against the book . Dr. Trimble hedged his answer . He said it was too early to tell . It was true that Jerry felt he had been a victim of the book , and if he maintained this attitude he might be a forceful and articulate witness . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out publicly , and if he withdrew more deeply into himself he might be useless as a witness . Then Dr. Trimble promised Mr. Yerkes and Uncle Frank that he would try to visit Jerry an hour daily up to and during the trial . None of them seemed to understand , as I do , how upset Jerry is about being made to talk to an analyst . Jerry wants only to be left alone  --  despite his crazy foray into public tonight  --  and he resents any doctor 's poking into the privacy of his psyche . I 'm objective enough to recognize that he does need therapy . This just seems to be the wrong time for it . " " I 'm sure Dr. Trimble realizes that , " said Barrett . " I think his help will be mainly supportive , to prop Jerry up and see him through the trial . "  | Maggie Russell nibbled at her sandwich , then put it down and shoved the plate aside . " Yes , I suppose that 's it . If it were Dr. Trimble alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all the pressure Mr. Yerkes and Uncle Frank are exerting on Jerry . You should have seen what happened after Dr. Trimble left . No sooner was he gone than Mr. Yerkes announced that we were fortunate enough to have the press and television people so interested in Jerry . Mr. Yerkes felt they should be accommodated , because it would give the public a chance to see and hear first hand and read about how a pornographic book had damaged an adolescent , and this would create sympathy for Jerry . Mr. Yerkes said he 'd taken the liberty of inviting Merle Reid to interview Jerry . In fact , Merle Reid was waiting outside . " " Reid ? " said Barrett . He had been drinking his coffee . Now he set down his cup . " You mean that television commentator ? " " The one who goes on every night coast to coast . " " He 's sickening . A one-man soap opera . I saw him interview a prisoner in Death Row one night . You 'd have thought he was chatting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to hear that from you . Because that insensitive idiot sickened me . Mr. Yerkes brought him in , along with two tech nicians , one carrying a hand camera and the other carrying lights . Uncle Frank asked me to bring Jerry down . I refused . And Aunt Ethel was on my side . But Uncle Frank insisted it was all for Jerry 's sake , and he went and brought him down . Do I have to tell you more ? Jerry was like some poor scared cornered puppy . And when Merle Reid , with that television camera whirring , asked Jerry exactly what section of The Seven Minutes drove him to run out and violate a girl  --  God , it was horrible . Jerry just broke down , began sobbing , and I did n't care what anyone would say to me afterward , I just took him out of that room . No one tried to stop me . But Luther Yerkes was celebrating what had happened as if it were a triumph . He kept saying to Reid , You see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngster ? ' And that stupid Reid was saying , That footage on his cracking up was great , simply marvelous . ' Going on like that as if they were dealing with an automaton . Anyway , Mr. Barrett , that gives you an idea of Jerry 's emotional condition before he slipped out of the house . "  | She seemed relieved to have unburdened herself of this , and pow she finished her coffee with more composure . Barrett eyed her thoughtfully for several seconds . Finally he spoke . " You know , Miss Russell , I do get the impression that everyone in that household is afraid of Frank Griffith . Am I correct ? " She knitted her brow , and contemplated her coffee cup . " I  --  I really ca n't say . Even if I could , I would n't . Perhaps I 've told you more than I should have already . But anything less would have been unfair . " " Very well . It just surprises me that Mr. Griffith , knowing his son 's precarious condition , makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no harm , I 'm sure of that . I think he 's really trying to help Jerry  --  but strictly in his own way . " Barrett nodded . " Perhaps you 're right . And I promise you , no more questions about the Griffiths . However , I do have one more question , a personal one , about you yourself , if you do n't mind . " " It all depends . " " You 're attractive , young , intelligent , the kind of person who could accomplish anything she might wish to attempt . Yet you 've confined yourself to the Griffith household , and to a job that ca n't be very demanding . It seems rather self-limiting for a girl of your endowments , I 've asked myself why . Now I 've gotten up the nerve to ask you . Why , Miss Russell ? " " No mysteries . It 's very simple . I 'm doing what I want to do . " " I ca n't believe it 's that simple . " She offered him a tentative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being suspicious . " Then she was serious again . " Yes , I suppose it is more complicated than that . Let me see . To begin with , I 've always needed family , someone close . My parents died when I was quite young . There were plenty of relatives , and I was passed around among them , but I was always rather a stranger . When I was old enough , I escaped and tried to make a life of my own . First I went to the University of North Carolina for a year . Then three years at Boston University . I graduated from there . " " What was your major ? " " My major was psychology , my minor English literature . That 's inconsequential . All girls have the same major  --  they major in getting married . "  | " Have you been married ? " " No . I 've been too busy finding myself to worry about finding someone else . " " Does that still hold true ? " " More or less . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the odyssey that landed me in Los Angeles . My mother had always been closest to her older sister , Ethel  --  Ethel Griffith ? and Aunt Ethel loved my mother and consequently felt a certain responsibility toward me . She used to send me money , to help me through school . Without her I 'd probably never have made it . " Barrett 's mind went back to his own relationship with Phil Sanford , and his theorem that had evolved from it : Everyone owes somebody something . Everyone is indebted . Everyone must pay back his debt sooner or later . No free men exist anywhere . The line of everyone 's life was not infinite , but a circle , a full caging circle . He looked at Maggie Russell . " So you felt you had to repay her ? " " It was n't that alone . It was still my need to experience a sense of family . I wanted to know Aunt Ethel and find out what it would be like to be part of her family . So when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion , I took her up on it eagerly . Also , I was excited about seeing Los Angeles . Actually , I never meant to stay with my uncle and aunt more than a year . That was understood . But I did become part of the family , and when I saw how much Aunt Ethel needed me and how much Jerry depended upon me , well , I just stayed on . Which brings me to the second and main reason why I 'm with the Griffiths . It 's Jerry , as I told you yesterday . I 'm fond of him . He 's devoted to me . He admires my shaky independence . And in his transitional growing-up period I think I 've meant a lot to him . And now , of course , now he trusts me more than anyone . Does this make sense to you ? " " Yes , I can understand why you 're there . And let me reiterate one thing . Yerkes , Duncan , Frank Griffith , they 've all cast me in the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . But I want to tell you again , I 've been miscast . I 'm sorry for Jerry . I ca n't tell you how deeply I felt for him a few hours ago . It was as if he were my own son or younger brother .  | I would n't do a thing in the world to harm him . You can believe me when I say I would n't be defending The Seven Minutes if I felt it had been responsible for Jerry 's disintegration . I do n't believe that for a minute . I believe it 's a good and beautiful book . " She met his eyes , and then she said quietly , " I believe it 's a good and beautiful book , too . " " You mean you 've read it ? " " Yes . " " And you like it ? " " I loved it . Every word moved me . Do n't look so bewildered . There 's no inconsistency . Individuals have different neurotic structures . We can be faced by a specific object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others will find it ugly . I found the novel beautiful . Jerry found it ugly , and , because he is what he is , it moved him in a terrible way . But that does n't influence my literary judgment of the book . It just tells me people are different and react to the same thing in different ways . I want to believe that what you 've been saying is true , that The Seven Minutes was not responsible for Jerry 's crime . Because I feel as you do about the book and about censorship in general . At the same time , what you say has not been proved . And the only evidence I have is Jerry 's word that the book upset him . If that 's true , then what I feel about the book becomes unimportant . If it hurt Jerry , and , through him , Sheri Moore , if it can hurt others , someone , anyone else , then it should be condemned and suppressed . I know this is confusing , Mr. Barrett , but how else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another way . I 'm for the book , but I 'm against anything or anyone who can harm Jerry . If the book harmed him , then I must suspend my aesthetic belief in it . Then I want it suppressed , at once . " Leaning forward , Barrett said earnestly , " Miss Russell , if a book can lead an individual to violence , I want it suppressed , too . This was the one criterion for censorship that Judge Curtis Bok set forth in the Roth case . A book might constitutionally be condemned as obscene only where there is a reasonable and demonstrable cause to believe that a crime . . . has been committed . . . as the perceptible result of the publication and distribution of the writing in question . ' The American Civil Liberties Union set the same standard . Any governmental restriction or punish-  | ment of any form of expression on the ground of obscenity must require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that such an expression would directly cause in a normal adult behavior which has validly been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The question is , can a pornographic book drive a person to commit a sex crime ? Most psychiatrists say no . They say sex offenders are sick from other causes before they ever pick up a pornographic book .. Dr. Wardell Pomeroy , Kinsey 's heir at the Institute for Sex Research , made a study of sex offenders , and he concluded , There is not any evidence that pornography instigates antisocial activities . ' " Forgive me for sounding like a lawyer , but I am one . And I must point out that Mrs. St. Clair , of the STDL , read The Seven Minutes . It did n't corrupt her . Elmo Duncan read the book . It did n't deprave him . You read it , Miss Russell , and I do n't see you committing any antisocial acts . So why must it be true that Jerry alone was affected ? No , Miss Russell , nothing can persuade me , not even Jerry himself , that this book incited him to commit a criminal act . And understand this  --  I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm after the truth about Jerry , after the true causes of his behavior . I want to know the other factors in his life that contributed to sending this quiet , decent boy raging into the streets to violate the first girl he could find . I want the truth about the deeper motivations that drive young people to violence . We know there are countless causes . One of them is family , the family relationship , or lack of relationship . Those are the facts I 'm after . If I can find them , I 'll not only prove the book innocent of this crime , but I 'll perform a service to Jerry and every kid like him by exposing the real culprits responsible for their outbursts of violence . " She was silent a moment . Then she said , " Have you found anything yet ? " " In Jerry 's background ? Maybe a few clues . No evidence . Nothing that would be useful in a court of law . " " But if you did find something  --  I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's behavior , would n't that hurt Jerry 's own case ? " " Miss Russell , it would help his case . When he comes up for sentencing , it can provide mitigating circumstances more human  | and understandable than the evil influence of the printed page . I think it would then behoove the judge to mete out a lighter sentence . " " You really believe that ? " " I honestly do . " " Well . . . " she said , and paused , studying his face . " Maybe I 'm beginning to believe what you say . Or maybe I 'm a fool and being taken in . But . . . " She hesitated . " While I feel that I ca n't give you any personal information directly , there might be others who would be willing to speak more freely . You want to know about Jerry 's background ? " " Yes . " " You know , before I came here my Aunt Ethel had another companion who was with her for a year or two . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not involved in any secretarial work the way I am . After she quit or was fired or whatever happened , that 's when my aunt offered me the job . Maybe that woman could give you a little help . " " What 's her name ? " " Mrs. Isabel Vogler . I think she lived out in Van Nuys . That 's the most I can offer by way of appreciation for what you did tonight . " " Thank you . " She took up her purse . " You 've been asking me questions , Mr. Barrett . You know , I have some personal ones to ask of you , also . " " I wish you would . I enjoy talking about myself . " " No , on second thought , I think not . Besides , it 's too late now . I 'd better get some sleep , if I expect to cope with Jerry . " " Not even one question ? " " I was going to ask you about Faye Osborn . I know her casually . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " About what she sees in me , or vice versa ? " " That was your question , Mr. Barrett , not mine . About the vice versa , I 'm curious , not catty . No , I was just curious about how you met and all that . But that can wait . " She stood up . " Now I 've got to run . " Barrett came to his feet . " You said your question or questions can wait . I take that to mean you would be willing to see me again ? "  | " Oh , I did n't mean ? " " Then I mean what I 'm saying . I would like to see you again . No prying , I promise you . Strictly social . " " It 's tempting , Mr. Barrett . But I 'm afraid not . If I were seen with you in public , and the family learned I was seeing you , they 'd misunderstand . No , let 's leave things the way they are . But if .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I mean in a way that does n't jeopardize my relationship with the family , well , you have my private number . " " I 'll remember that . " She started to leave the table , and when he stood up to accompany her she held up her hand . " No , I think it would be wiser if I left alone . Good night , and thanks for the treat . " " Good night , Miss Russell . " He watched her until she had left , and then as he picked up the check he saw beside it the napkin on which he had scrawled the name of the former Griffith employee , Mrs. Isabel Vogler , of Van Nuys . A possible peephole into the Griffith past . Maggie Russell 's gift out of gratitude . It was a real lead , and despite the lateness of the hour he determined to pursue it at once . Leaving a tip , he went to the cash register , paid his bill , and then went back to the gas station . He gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telephone booth . The attendant pointed off . Once inside the booth , Barrett dialed information , and was relieved to learn there was still a Mrs. Isabel Vogler listed in Van Nuys . Immediately he sorted out his change , deposited the required coins , and dialed the number he had been given . The receiver bumped noisily off the phone cradle in Van Nuys . A little boy 's sleepy voice piped , " Hello ? " " Does Mrs. Isabel Vogler live there ? " " Yes . But Mom is n't home . She went next door . She said for me to take any messages . She said to take names and anything else . Are you calling about a job for Mom ? " What he was calling Mrs. Vogler about would be too complicated to explain to a child . He decided to make the message an easy one . " Yes , it 's about a job . Do you have a pencil and paper ?  | Tell her a gentleman by the name of Mike Barrett called . " He spelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrett . " " Yes , sir . " " Tell your Mom I 'd like to interview her for a job tomorrow morning at ten o'clock . I 'll give you my address , and in case she ca n't make it at that time I 'll give you my telephone number . " He dictated his address , apartment number , and telephone number with care . " Tell your Mom I hope she can be there . And tell her I 'll pay her for her bus fare . " " I 'll tell her , Mr. Barridd . " " Barrett . Two t 's . " He spelled his name again . " Got it now ? " " Yes , sir , I 'll tell her . " Leaving the booth , Barrett stopped to sign the charge slip and pick up his credit card . Continuing to the convertible , he found Maggie Russell reclining in his mind . He savored the sight of what his mind 's eye focused upon : the parting of her moist lips when she listened , the movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the motion of her supple thighs when she walked . Yes , visual rape . It left him weakened . Standing beside his car , he wondered what questions she had really meant to ask him about Faye . Faye . Christ , he 'd almost forgotten . He brought up his wristwatch . It was eighteen minutes after eleven o'clock . Faye would have been waiting a half hour before he got to the apartment . She was not used to being kept waiting , and she would be difficult . He would have to make up a plausible story to explain his tardiness . Scratch Maggie Russell for sure . A witness , a male witness , that he 'd chased down and interviewed . That might do it . But perhaps no story would be needed immediately . For , in her irritation , Faye might have slammed out of his apartment and gone home . Then he knew this was not likely . This was the night of the week she called her geisha night . She would never let it pass unconsummated . She loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , except tonight he was worn out . He 'd already had one woman . He was in no mood for two . Yet two it must be . He got into the car . Coming , Faye . He sped away to join in geisha night .  | SHE HAD ACCEPTED his story , and not been difficult after all . During their first half hour together she had made him two drinks , and two for herself , and she had lain back in his arm on the sofa , gossiping lazily and teasing him with kisses and wanting him to be happy . And soon she had become impatient to go to bed . Now , a little after midnight , he stood barefoot next to his bed , removing his shirt and his trousers . He was down to his jock shorts when he heard her emerge from the bathroom . Faye Osborn went to the portable record player , found her favorite bedroom music , Manuel de Falla 's " Ritual Fire Dance . " She placed the platter on the turntable , started the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she listened , undulating , then gliding toward the opposite side of the bed , Barrett was conscious once more of how much softer and more appealing was her person when divested of outer garments . As usual , she wore only a transparent negligee , pink this time , tied loosely at the neck . Her blond hair was loose , making her angular facial features seem rounder , and the filmy negligee revealed the brown nipples of her moon breasts and her deep navel set in the flat stomach and the triangular pelvic bone that pointed downward to the narrow vaginal area . His desire mounted , and he began to pull off his jock shorts before he sat down on the edge of the bed . " Mike , do you always keep this next to your bed like the Bible ? " she asked lightly . He glanced over his shoulder . " What ? " She held up a copy of The Seven Minutes . " This . It was right here by your lamp . " " I keep it handy . I continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , as a matter of fact , I never get tired of it . " He tossed his shorts on a chair , and swung around onto the bed . " Darling , I still say you ought to read the copy I gave you . " She dropped the book on the table , then lowered herself on the bed , pulling the negligee around her as she settled back against the pillow . She turned her head on the pillow , and said sweetly , " I have read it , Mike . I finished reading it last night . " " Well , why did n't you say so ? " He rolled over beside her and propped himself up on one elbow . " Well , now that you 've read it , do n't you agree I 'm right ? "  | She reached out and touched his naked chest . " Mike , lying here like this , it 's one time we should be perfectly honest with each other , is n't it ? " " Honest about what ? Are you referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sweetie , ca n't that wait ? We can talk afterward . Right now ... " With one arm he started to embrace her , but she raised a hand to stop him . " No , please , Mike . Right now , just for a little bit , I want to talk . Because the book , it 's tied up with  --  with everything else about us . Do you mind ? " His desire had fled . Pique had begun to replace passion . " Mind ? Why should I mind ? " He tried to keep the irritation out of his tone of voice . " You want to talk first , so let 's talk . The chair recognizes Faye Osborn , the gorgeous , irresistible ? " " Mike , what I have to say is serious . " He nodded solemnly . " I 'll listen serious . " " And you agree we can be absolutely honest . " " Absolutely honest . " " Very well , then , Mike , I 'm going to tell you about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are right about it . I think you are wrong . " She took his shoulder . " Mike , let 's level , let 's be truthful . I read the book . I hated it . It 's a vulgar , dirty little piece of trash , indescribably filthy and thoroughly dishonest . And I know in your heart of hearts you agree with me . Now nobody 's listening . Forget your involvement in the case . That 's the truth , is n't it , Mike ? " He sat up , flushing . " No , dammit , it 's not the truth . It 's the beauty of the book that made me take on the case , and not the other way around , as you 'd have it . What are you talking about , Faye ? I ca n't believe my ears . I really ca n't . What did you call it ? " " I read it , and afterward I wanted to soap and wash myself all over . I called it vulgar , dirty , filthy , dishonest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never have permitted you to make a public spectacle of yourself by defending such obscenity . You agreed we could be honest , Mike . I 'm being honest . " " Okay , you 're being honest . But I 'm trying to figure you out . How 's what you read about in The Seven Minutes any different  | from what we 've been doing every week and were about to do tonight ? Is what we 're doing vulgar and dirty ? " She sat straight up . " Mike , how dare you compare the two ! What we do is decent . Our language is decent . Our love is honest . But , even then , I do n't think what we do in privacy should be paraded in public Sex should be a private matter " " Maybe it 's been kept too private for too many years and that 's what 's ailing so many people , " he said . " And as for our love being honest , yes  --  but why is the love in the book any less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Faye persisted . " The heroine , Cathleen all those thoughts she has during intercourse , they 're contrived only to titillate . They have nothing to do with reality . When a real woman is being made love to , that 's not how she thinks and feels . That 's only the way the author , a man , thought a woman feels or should feel . Even Dr. Kinsey would support me in what I say . You 're always throwing experts at me . Let me throw Dr. Kinsey at you . He says that females in those pornographic books always extoll the male 's genital size and copulatory capacity , and those books always exaggerate the female 's response and her insatiability for sex . Yet that kind of heroine portrays only the kind of female which most males wish all women to be . But in real life  --  and now I 'm quoting me , Mike  --  women do n't think and feel that way ever . Only the Jadways do . It 's ridiculous and degrading . Mike , believe me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind had gone to Maggie , a woman who also knew . He said , " You 're one kind of woman , Faye , and you know how you feel when you 're being made love to , but many women may feel differently , far differently . " " Like that whore in the book ? " " Like that decent woman in the book who has memories , wishes , thoughts , feelings which probably come close to representing what the majority of women think and feel inside themselves , but they are afraid to admit it . " " No respectable woman on earth ever let that kind of garbage fill her head . And no woman on earth , except maybe a streetwould imagine or express herself in such language . " " What language ? What language are you talking about ? " " Language is words . All those words . Like the word she uses for  | feeling sexy or bitchy or whatever , the word she uses for that and for her  --  her private parts . " " What word ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Please , Mike , you know I ca n't use a word like that . I hate it ? it 's filthy . " " Do you mean when Cathleen says she feels like a cunt all over ? " " Mike ! " " That 's it , is n't it ? The word cunt ' ? " " Mike , stop it . " " Honey , listen to me . That word has been in use since the Middle Ages . It 's a Teutonic word that corresponds with the Latin word cuneus , which means wedge . Jadway was n't the first to use it . Geoffrey Chaucer used its Middle English equivalent . Laurence Sterne used it . John Fletcher used it . D. H. Lawrence used it . Certainly it 's a vulgarism , but it 's a word countless men use in their speech and plenty of women have in their heads . What 's wrong with a writer 's having the courage to describe what really goes on inside a woman 's mind ? " He tried to calm down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Faye , that word is in Canterbury Tales . The Wife of Bath says , For certainly , old dotard , by your leave , /You shall have cunt all right enough at eve . ' Except that Chaucer used queynte , ' which is thought to have the same connotation as cunt ' Would you ban Chaucer from schools and libraries because he used it ? " Faye 's indignation had not abated . " Mike , I 'm not a child . Do n't lecture me , or try to put me off with pedagoguery . I 'm simply telling you I 'm a woman , and I 'm like most women , and I know what offends me . I do n't care who 's used the word  --  Chaucer , Lawrence , any of them  --  it 's still a vomitous word . It 's dishonest , and any writer who uses it knows nothing about women , is hostile toward women , wants to degrade them , and is preaching disrespect of women to every male reader , young or old . Do n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I 'm right and you 're wrong . I abhor language like that , and I do n't want you having any part of that filth . More and more I see how right Dad was in wanting to keep you away from this kind of case . He knew it could corrupt and warp anyone involved in it . And it 's already making you say things and do things that I know are contrary to your real nature . "  | Her mention of her father had unnerved him again . The last remnants of his wrath were in retreat , and only a small part of resentment remained . " Well , I 'm in the case , and I 'm staying in , " he said , his voice strained . " As for Jadway 's judgment , or my own , of what takes place secretly in women 's minds , perhaps we are both mistaken . Maybe we can never know . And maybe women themselves do n't know . But at the very least , whether we 're accurate or inaccurate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the mysteries of stream of consciousness may be sufficient defense of such vulgarisms . " All through the last , her head had been cocked sideways as she listened and observed him  --  trying to assess his annoyance , he guessed  --  and now she was smiling , softening , ready to reach out for a compromise . Her hand had touched and then covered his hand . " I 'm glad you see my side of it a little , and I 'll try to understand yours . I only know I 'm a woman , and I 'm against anything that degrades me . I 'm a woman and I want respect and love . You know that , Mike . " " Certainly . " Her hand had gone up his arm , and as she slowly sank back against the pillow she gently pulled him down until he lay beside her . She ran her fingers through his hair . " I 'm sorry , Mike , " she said softly . " I do n't want to fight about all that silliness . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her head against his chest . " And I know what 's been inside my head these last minutes , and there was n't one dirty word , there was only one word , and that 's love : I kept thinking how I want you and need you , and how I want only what 's best for you and for us . " " Yes , " he said . Corneille was offering him his next line : " 0 heaven , what a lot of virtues you make me hate . " He kept it to himself . " Do n't be cold , Mike , do n't punish me , " she said in a muffled voice , " not when I want you so much . " His arm tightened around her body and his hand reached toward her breast and caressed it beneath the gown . " I want you , too . " " Then forget books and make-believe , " she whispered , " and let 's love each other . "  | But while he continued to caress her , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her righteousness , hung between them like a thin curtain , separating her from him , and he could not bring himself to push aside the curtain and find desire . He felt her cool long fingers trace their way across his ribs and move down his hip and he felt them move between his legs and touch what still lay flaccid , and her fingers curled around it and massaged it and her breath and throaty words penetrated the thin curtain . " I love you down there , Mike , I love him  --  make him love me  --  do n't hold him back  --  let him get big , I like to feel him get big . " He meant to resist , but resistance weakened and faded as he grew large in her hand . " All right , " he groaned , " all right . " And the curtain was gone . She had pulled loose the ribbon that held her negligee together , and now the garment fell away , and her breasts trembled and her torso wriggled as he came over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardening nipples and then his mouth kissed one nipple and then the other . He could feel her left leg slipping under him , and one cool hand pushing his head away from the breasts , and he could hear her saying , " Come on , darling , now , right now . " For the brief moment that they were apart , he rising to his knees , she bending her long legs and holding them wide apart , he remembered how she always resisted the heat of prolonged foreplay and always led him to enter her the moment that she saw he was ready . For an instant , he determined to change that , to extend the prelude to love , to bring her to a passion matching his own , to make her commitment and animal-want rise to his own , but the instant eluded him and once more he was subject to her will . Her firm hands were behind his back , her fingers pressing into his flesh , forcing him down toward her , bringing him down between her legs . He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nipples , and his hips were enclosed by the inner part of her thighs , and his rigid hardness , guided by her hand again , slowly sank into the folds of the soft , warm , moist wedge  --  the warmest part of her , the thought came and went , the warmest , warmest . And he was deeper in her now , and almost out , and deeper again , and back and forth and around and around . And he felt her lips  | on his ear , and her quickening breath , and he wanted her to moan and give , and open wider and shake , but she remained still and unmoving except below , where her buttocks responded to the rhythm of his motions , not wildly , not totally , but nicely and properly as in a dance on a dance floor , that much , that answering motion that was part of a form and no more . If she could n't , then maybe he could , maybe he finally could bring her passion to his pitch . He thrust harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into one , and her pelvis lifted and fell with him , and rotated with him , and no more . Gradually he began to moderate his movement , and he heard her whispering , " Darling , what is it ? " " I want it to go longer . I want to give you a chance to ? " She clutched him . " No . . . no . . . do n't hold back . Come now , come right now . " And she dug her fingers into his shoulders and closed her thighs more tightly around him and pressed herself against him , and instantly he was restimulated and no longer in control . He heard her faintly once more . " That 's better , darling , better . " And then , " Does it make you happy , darling , are you happy , do you like it ? " And then he heard no more , because he was telling her inside how it was , he was bursting inside her , shuddering , bursting , letting go and suffocating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was still inside her , but sanity was returning and soon he would be ready for reality . He opened his eyes and looked at her . She was unmussed and poised and smiling coolly at him , as if pleased at his pleasure and pleased with herself for what she had done for him . The curl of her mouth told him that she was proud to have been able to serve and yet humble him by still maintaining an attitude above and beyond all this mean coupling , above this necessary act that could be described in books only by using dirty words . And suddenly the curtain he had put down , tried to put aside earlier , was there once more . Through it he saw her more clearly , more honestly . And what he saw was what she held on to with unwavering self-pride , in a secret recess of her mind : that for her , lovemaking was a thing you did because it was a biological measuring stick of your health and normality , and lovemaking was a thing  | you offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had made love , and behind the invisible curtain she had emerged from the fornication as untouched and unsullied as if she had been a spectator at a sex circus , the bystander , the observer , someone superior to the ridiculous , helpless , uncontrolled , panting male member who required indulgence in this function . As ever , she had survived the filth and the beast to retain on her brow the tiara of civilized decency and ladyship . And that was not all that Barrett perceived of her secret mind in these fleeting moments . There was not only the moral side of her triumph , but the business side as well . She had invested little in their performance , and yet she had profited so much . There had been no thought of fair trading . It was the way her father did business . You learned where others were weak or susceptible , and you took them over , absorbed them , offering little , only enough to hold them through their need , and then you came out of the partnership as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short , Father 's daughter . And he , he would become Father 's daughter 's necessary mate . He had never read her secret mind so clearly . But he read it now , with a new insight , because he had read The Seven Minutes , and she had read it , and that had become the litmus paper that showed truth in its real color . Yet , despite this discovery of her , he felt helpless . He became conscious of his exposed flesh and her own , and it was unbeautiful and unromantic this night . He had played stud for royalty . His reward would be a tiny slice of empire . And this reward was the most intriguing and satisfying seduction of all . " How was it , Mike ? " she was saying . " Did you really enjoy it ? " " You know I did . " " I always like it when you love me . Do you love me ? " " I showed you what I felt , did n't I ? That was n't push-ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Are you through ? My legs are beginning to ache . Do you mind ? " He withdrew from her , and in the moment of disengagement her legs were wide apart and what could be seen was all of her that was soft and warm and honest and natural . Quickly her lowered legs closed the best of her from view , and quickly the  | blanket was drawn over it and up to her breasts . The best was hidden , stored from sight for another week , and what was left was the detached genteel head and the smiling glacial outsider 's face . 1111 The lips set in the face of the detached head were moving . There , you see , Mike , love can be decent and clean . You see that , 1111 do n't you ? " He saw that , yes , he did . He saw her in sharpest focus . His memory evoked pictures projected by J J Jadway and Geoffrey Chaucer , and the pictures revealed Faye Osborn , the simple essence of her , plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all over , cunt , no more , no less . The clarity of the pictures , their precise exposure , frightened him . This was royalty , and his thoughts were seditious . He fell back on his pillow . Banish sedition . Yet Faye 's whore , Cathleen , Jadway 's Cathleen , was there also , appreciating him , and her face was strangely the face of a girl named Maggie . Banish sedition , banish it . And he did . He managed by force to conjure up different pietures , pictures of the safe good years ahead , glimpses of the imposing house in Bel-Air , the staff of servants , the chauffeured Bentley , the private Lear jet , the villa on Cap Ferrat , the celebrities , the social seasons , Faye so stately , so beautiful , so complementary beside him . The life cauterized of meanness and devoid of commonness . The good life . The best . What more could a man want ? He turned his head on the pillow and smiled back at Faye . " I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOLLOWING MORNING , promptly at ten o'clock , the doorbell rang , and Mike Barrett answered it and ushered Mrs. Isabel Vogler into his apartment . She proved to be a corpulent woman , probably in her middle forties , and on her graying head she wore a Sunday hat braided with limp artificial flowers . Her eyes were creased above two puffs of cheeks , and there was down on her upper lip , and a massive double chin or goiter , but her dark dress was fresh and neat and she moved with remarkable agility for one so obese . She planted herself in the center of Barrett 's living room , surveyed it briefly , and said , " Well , this is n't much of a job to take care of . Looks no problem to me . Like I said in the ad I put in the paper , I 'm a real experienced housekeeper . How many rooms have you got ? " " Besides this , there 's the bedroom , a bathroom , the kitchenette , " said Barrett . " Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gesturing her to a chair . Mrs. Vogler settled down with a grunt . " Do n't mind sitting whenever I can , " she said . " When you 're in my line of work , and on your feet all day , sitting is a real vacation . " Barrett found a place on the sofa across from her , took his pipe from the ashtray , and held it up . " Do you mind ? " " Not at all . Mr. Vogler , rest his soul , was a pipe smoker , but even his awful-smelling corncob was better than those men smoking cigars . You go ahead and smoke your pipe , Mr. Barrett , and  | take no mind of me . It becomes a man , a pipe , even though it 's sure to mean plenty of holes in the furniture . " Barrett lit his pipe . Through the partially open bedroom door he could see the still unmade bed that Faye had left at two in the morning , after extracting the promise from him that they would dine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was not sure how it was best to proceed with this possible witness whom Maggie Russell had suggested , since he had lured Mrs. Vogler to this meeting under false pretenses . " Was it difficult to make connections from Van Nuys to West Los Angeles ? " he inquired . " No problem at all . I have my own jalopy  --  did n't my boy tell you ? Kids , once they got their heads in the television set , they do n't remember anything . " " Well , your youngster did very well with my call . Now , about the ad you placed , Mrs. Vogler . Can you elaborate upon it a little more ? " " You mean ? ? " " I mean can you let me know a little more about what you 're after and about your background ? " " Like I told you , I have plenty of experience and I 'm dependable , if that 's what you mean , " said Isabel Vogler . " Since Mr. Vogler left me widowed and penniless eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been working more or less steady . As a housekeeper , but I can cook too , if nothing fancy is required . When the child was younger , I took live-in positions and boarded him out , but since my last live-in employment , what with the child growing up , I figured he should at least know he 's got his own home , so I 've been doing only day work . But that 's not so good , because it 's not regular enough . I want a position where I know I can come in three , four days a week , or , even better , all week , nine to five , and have some income I can depend upon . I 'm doing everything I can to save up some money . " " You need money , then ? " " I have a small savings account , but I want a bit more to make the future easier . Because maybe next year , or the year after , I want to have enough to go back to my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some relatives and can be better situated for my boy and me . That 's Topeka  --  Topeka ,  | Kansas  --  I 'm talking about going back to , and if I 'm ever going to do it properly I 'll need the money for clothes and transportation and the time it takes getting settled . So that 's what I 'm wanting , Mr. Barrett , regular employment . " " What I have in mind might offer you a fair sum of money for that savings account , " said Barrett . " Tell me , you spoke of your last steady live-in job . When was that ? " " A year and a half ago , I 'd say . " " Who was your employer at that time ? " Her face seemed to sink into her double chin or goiter . " He was Mr. Griffith  --  Mr. Frank Griffith . " " The name 's familiar , " said Barrett . " He 's pretty well known . He has these advertising agencies , and ? " " Yes , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in his employment , Mrs. Vogler ? " " Near on two years . " " That speaks well for you . Do you have a reference from him , or do you think he 'd give you one ? " Mrs. Vogler 's countenance had become a sorrowful pudding . She kneaded one fat hand with the other . " No , I 've got no reference from him and I ca n't get one . That 's been my trouble ever since , and that 's what 's so unfair . Whenever I tell my prospective employers that  --  well , they look at me like I 'm a liar , like how can anyone take a poor domestic 's word over the word of an important man like Mr. Griffith . But believe me , swearing on my only child 's head , I 'm not lying at all , Mr. Barrett . " " Lying about what ? " " About Mr. Griffith being unfair in firing me and refusing to give me a reference or any good word . It 's not fair . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrett lit his pipe again . He was coming closer now , and nearer the end of his subterfuge . " I assure you , Mrs. Vogler , your being fired and refused a reference does not prejudice me . However , it does make me curious to know what happened . I 'm certainly prepared to hear your side of it . " He paused . " Sa-ay , the name just struck a chord . Frank Griffith . Is that the same one whose son 's been talked about on television and mentioned in all the news-papers ? "  | Mrs. Vogler 's porker features shook like jelly as she confirmed Barrett 's identification . " They 're one and the same , " she said , " and the boy , that 's Jerry Griffith . It 's something I 'll never understand in a hundred years . Never . Because I know this boy like he 's my own . Or I knew him then , but that was n't so long ago , and nothing can tell me human nature changes in a year and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person in the whole house , more like his mother , although she was a little creepy . It was his old man that was impossible . That 's what never comes out . If people only knew . . . " " Knew what , Mrs. Vogler ? " " Mr. Barrett , do n't get no idea I 'm the type that goes around gossiping and saying ill things about my former employers , but that Mr. Griffith , that man , he was almost the death of me . The way he went lording it around the house , not that he was home all that much , but lording it over his wife when he was there until you like wanted to crawl into the wallpaper , and lording it over his son , and over me , treating me like I was some kind of alley cat or something . But it was the way he squashed down the boy that riled me more than the way he treated me . I kept it stewing up inside myself all the time , remembering my place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand it no more and I just spoke my piece like any person has to , and you can bet Mr. Griffith was n't used to that kind of backtalk , and so then he spoke his piece and in an hour I was out of there and gone like I 'd never been there so long . And reference , well , how was I supposed to get a reference ? " " Could n't you get one from Mrs. Griffith ? " " She would n't dare . She 's agreeable to whatever her husband does , like it or not . " Barrett sat silently a moment , puffing on his pipe . What came next would be crucial . He had to cue her properly . " Uh , Mrs. Vogler , up to this point I 'll be glad to take your word that you may have been unfairly treated . Yet , to be perfectly frank with you , it does come down to Frank Griffith 's public reputation ? which is of the best , absolutely impeccable  --  against your own complaint against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't misunderstand me . I 'm prepared to accept your word against his , but I 'm afraid I 'll have to know a trifle more . " He paused , then  | resumed with emphasis . " Here , on the one hand , we have a famous Olympic hero , a nationally known advertising man , a leading civic figure . On the other hand , we have you with your statement that this man is not all he 's supposed to be . Now , which ? ? " " He is n't what he looks to bet " Mrs. Vogler exclaimed , almost overturning her chair as she agitatedly shifted her weight . " Mr. Barrett , if you want to know what somebody is really like , you should work intimately inside their house for them . That 's where you find out what nobody on the outside ever sees . That Frank Griffith , he is n't what you might think . He drinks , he drinks a lot at night , and there 's no man nastier than a mean drunk . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen him cuff the boy , too , cuff a grown boy . And I 've seen him pretty severe with his wife , too , considering she 's a permanently suffering invalid from rheumatoid arthritis , and him rough and mistreating of her , and worse  --  always humiliating her in the most shameful way . If you want to know the truth , he 's got no relationship with his wife , did n't have one even before she was sick , because he had some chippy secretary in his office , if you know what I mean . I could tell you more , plenty , but you get the idea , and I 'm not making these things up , I could prove them to you if I had to . " She was out of breath , and she sat back , adjusting her floral hat on her head . " I 'm no gossip , Mr. Barrett , but you wanted to know about taking my word against his , so that wound me up . I do n't talk this much ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a right to speak up for me . I hope you do n't think I was wrong doing that , and I hope I have n't spoiled my chance for your job ? " Barrett stared at her . She was pure gold . She was what the impoverished defense needed . She was a winner , an underdog a jury could sympathize with . He must take care to handle her right . He could not afford to lose her . Yet the truth must come out . " The job , " he said . " Mrs. Vogler , there is no job I can offer you , in the sense you had expected . But there is something else I can offer you . I can offer you money . " He stood up . " I know . You 're perplexed . You think I 've gone off my rocker . But I can explain . I can tell you how you can be of help to me , and how I can be of help to you . First off , I 'm the attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Griffith blame for Jerry 's trouble . Now , then . . . "  | For five minutes , standing over her , Barrett related to the at first bewildered , then fascinated Mrs. Vogler the background of the pending court battle and the means by which the District Attorney hoped to use the Jerry Griffith crime as an indictment of The Seven Minutes . Simplifying the patter of psychiatry and sociology as much as possible , trying to translate it into Voglerese , Barrett attempted to explain how Jerry 's life in the Griffith household , as well as other outside factors , might have been what influenced Jerry and drove him to an antisocial act rather than any reading he had done . Barrett tried hard , because unless this idea was understood by Mrs. Vogler she would have no comprehension of what he was after and the use she could be to him in the trial . When he was done , he searched her porcine face for some sign of understanding . Suddenly she smiled broadly and bobbed her head . He knew then . She understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what I 'm after . I want your cooperation . I want you on the witness stand for the defense . I want nothing from you , at any time , but the truth about what you saw and heard first hand during your employment by the Griffiths . I want you in court not to seek revenge for yourself , but to help me seek justice by exposing the true facts . We 'll pay you for your time and information , of course . While not a fortune , certainly it will be as much as you could earn in three or four months of day work . Enough to get you a little closer to Topeka . What do you think ? Will you help me ? " " First , I better ask  --  will my appearing for you get me into any kind of trouble ? " " Not if you confine yourself to the truth . No , Mrs. Vogler , the worst I can see happening to you is that maybe Frank Griffith wo n't ever hire you again . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook . " That 's a good one , that is ! " She climbed to her feet , and her face was pink with excitement . " I like doing this , Mr. Barrett . I 'm sure on your side as a witness . I 'd almost be ready to do it for nothing , except that I need the money so . I ca n't wait to make my speech to the public about what that holier-than-thou Griffith has done to his son . That 'll be a great day for me. "  | " Excellent , Mrs. Vogler . You 'll never regret this . " He took her plump arm . " I 'll show you to the elevator . Meanwhile , as I told you , the trial is about to begin . So we 'd better have a meeting , plan on conferring for an hour or two , either tomorrow or the day after . I 'll call you first to be sure you 're home . You will be home , Mrs. Vogler ? " " I 'll be out only once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat for my first personal appearance in public . I 'm taking me to Ohrbach 's store and getting me the sincerest hat that 's ever been made . " IMMEDIATELY AFTER Isabel Vogler 's departure , Mike Barrett hastened back to his apartment and the living-room telephone . He felt like singing . For the first time in days , he had cause for optimism . Now he was eager to transmit the news of Mrs. Vogler 's enlistment to Abe Zelkin , whose own morale was sorely in need of a booster . He put through the call to the office , and when he asked urgently for Zelkin he could hear Donna 's astonishment . " Mr. Barrett , where 's your memory ? " she said . " Did you forget ? Mr. Zelkin is over at the Hall of Justice  --  Department ror of the Superior Court  --  Judge Nathaniel Upshaw 's courtroom . They 've been making the selection of the jury out of the pool of veniremen . Mr. Zelkin checked with the office during the last recess , and he said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thinks they 'll have a jury impaneled and sworn in by late tomorrow , and that means the trial will start Monday morning . " Barrett had forgotten , of course . He and Zelkin had spent a long session together debating the advantages of waiving a jury and letting their entire case ride on a hearing by and the decision of a judge . In the end , they had agreed that their chances were better if they argued their case before twelve dissimilar men and women rather than before a single individual , because this way an extra verdict was possible . From a judge there would be the possibility of only one of two verdicts , guilty or not guilty . From a jury of twelve citizens there was not only the possibility of those two verdicts , but an additional one , disagreement  --  a hung jury , which in a sense would be a victory for the defense . Attentive to Donna once more as she ticked off the telephone calls and mail and visitors of the morning , Barrett realized that his  | work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days he would have to fulfill his own duties and Abe Zelkin 's as well . Perhaps some of the work could be diverted to Kimura , but not much , since Kimura had enough to worry about already . Then Barrett heard Donna mention Kimura 's name . " He phoned to tell me to remind you that if you 're out of the office today , even for lunch , he wants to know where you 'll be so he can reach you if he has to . " " Is he on to something ? " " Sounded like it . He did n't say what . " " Well , I 'll be over pronto . I 'll have lunch in the office . " " One more thing , Mr. Barrett . Your lady friend called about fifteen minutes ago . Miss Osborn asked if you could phone her the moment you were free . " " All right . I 'll call her now . Then I 'll be in . " Hanging up , he wondered why Faye had telephoned him . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Zelkin occupied challenging potential jurors , with the trial looming immediately ahead , he 'd have to burn midnight oil tonight , tomorrow night , and over the weekend . He dialed the Osborn residence , and it was Faye who answered the phone . " I knew you were busy , but I just wanted to hear your voice , Mike . " " My voice ? Are you auditioning me for something ? " " No , truly , darling , I just wanted to know if you sounded angry . I mean , about those things I said last night about that book . " " Everyone has a right to say anything they want about any book . " " This is special , and this is us . Maybe my timing was bad and I came on too strong . Especially when you 're so emotionally involved in the damn thing . I was afraid I 'd upset you . But I made it up to you , did n't I , darling ? " " I was n't upset , " he lied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I ? You can see that how I feel about the book has nothing to do with how I feel about making love . " She lowered her voice . " Perhaps tonight I can prove it again . " He remembered why he had been going to phone her . " You 're  | sweet , Faye , but it 'll have to be a rain check , I 'm afraid . Abe is tied up in court picking a jury , and I feel like I 've been buried under a landslide . Paper work , interviews , phone calls . My libido 's going to be wholly diverted to Things Legal tonight and the next few nights . Will you forgive me ? I 'll try to catch up with you after the weekend . " The other end of the line was silent . Then Faye spoke . " I was just trying to make up my mind whether you 're ducking me tonight because of your work or because you 're still peeved about my critical judgment of Jadway . " " Honey , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work . I 'm happy to say everything 's looking up . This morning we got ourselves a devastating witness , a real dilly , someone who may be of real help in blunting Duncan 's contention that the book alone was responsible for the Griffith boy 's act of violence . " " I 'm pleased for you , Mike , but I do n't understand . What more can be said about why Jerry Griffith committed that rape ? He 's said it all himself . It was the book . " " That does n't necessarily make it true , Faye . Most men do n't fully understand the influences that drive them in one direction or another . They may think they know , but that 's merely surface causes . The real influences may be buried deep in the subconscious . Look , honey , I 'm too busy for Freuding in depth right now . Suffice it to say that someone came out of the woodwork  --  the Griffiths ' own woodwork , mind you  --  with firsthand evidence that Frank Griffith is anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man may have unwittingly done more harm to Jerry than a dozen pornographic books . I know Griffith is a friend of your father 's , but I guarantee you that neither your father nor anyone else has the faintest idea what Frank Griffith is like in private . " " It sounds dreadful . Who would have such thoughts and have the nerve to tattle about it ? It could only be that Maggie Russell . Is she your turncoat witness ? It must be . No one else lives full time in the house . " He was annoyed with her again . " What are you dragging Miss Russell into this for ? Of course it 's not Maggie Russell . Other women have lived in the house before she did . Like for instance Isabel Vogler. "  | " The fat one ? I remember seeing her there a couple of years ago . Now , is n't that finky of her ? " " Anyone who , for a change , has some truths to tell is n't a fink in my book . Believe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finkiness . Wait until you see the characters our upright Elmo Duncan parades before the public next week . " " Can you trust someone like that ? " " You mean Mrs. Vogler ? Why not ? As much as any witness . She knows she 'll be under oath . One lie and they 'd slap her with perjury . " " Not lies , but . . " " Exaggerations ? Do n't worry , Faye , our District Attorney is as much a seeker of truth , when it benefits him , as I am . And as you are right now , for that matter . Why this sudden concern about my witness , Faye ? Are you afraid the exposure of the real Frank Griffith will upset your father or rock the establishment ? " " Do n't be disagreeable , Mike . That 's not it at all , and you know it . Its you , the kind of nasty people you 're becoming more and more involved with over an unworthy piece of trash , There I go 61 again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  and about us . I ca n't stand seeing you , of all people , immersed in that muck and surrounded by those ratty dregs of humanity . " 9d He contained his temper . " Faye , there 's nothing to contaminate me . But I do appreciate your concern . " " There you go . I could feel the freeze . Oh , darling , please , let 's stop this bickering . Why ca n't it be like it used to be before that damn book came into our lives ? Mike , I do want to see you tonight . I know we 'll both feel better after being together . " " Faye , I really ca n't . I 've got to get to the office now . I 'll try to call you later . Tomorrow for sure . " His growing irritation with Faye tagged along with him throughout his drive to the office . It amazed him how the appearance of a single object in their lives  --  in this instance a mere book ? had so vividly laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had regarded Faye and himself as compatible and their relationship as harmonious . They had both paid lip sewice to the cliche that they were meant for each other . Recently , most definitely last night and this morning , he was less than certain .  | Driving , he continued to ruminate on the matter of Faye and himself . She loved him , or thought she did . More likely , she could love no man beyond her father , and after much trial and error , while experimenting among many men , she had settled upon Barrett as the one to whom she could offer affection ( the boiling point of her passion never exceeded affection ) and the one best qualified to join ( as husband ) the other necessities that decorated her life . As for Barrett , he loved her , or thought he did . More likely , since his past relationships with women had been shallow and unstable , he was capable of liking her more than he had liked other women and of loving those things Faye represented , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other crummy golden calves that he had genuflected before in his rise from rags toward riches . It was odd , he thought , how the Jadway book , to most at best only a bit of glimmering erotica , had become for him so powerful a searchlight aiding self-examination and self-revelation . Under its merciless glare no inner deception could hide truth . To Faye it must have exposed , for the first time , her inability to give love . Unable to face this truth , she had turned on the instrument of exposure and rejected it as defective and warped . For Barrett , it had exposed to him the ugly truth that in Faye he sought not love but success , and the uglier truth that his goals in life were empty and that by achieving them he would find nothing that could sustain a lifetime of remaining years . Unlike Faye , he had been able to face his truths , but he had not been able to act upon them . Damn that sonofabitching book , he thought , it can be destructive . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has license to ignore some truths , and live some lies , he can not have peace of mind . And most of all what Mike Barrett wanted this day was peace of mind . It was at least an hour after he had reached his office and settled behind his desk before he was finally absorbed enough in his work to exorcise the unsettling specters of Faye-love and self-hate . He was deep in a legal brief when Donna 's insistent buzzer brought him out of it and back into the workaday world of communication . The caller was Leo Kimura . The lack of precision in Kimura 's speech betrayed his unnatural excitement .  | " Good news , very good news , Mr. Barrett , " Kimura was saying . " I found him , I tracked down Norman C. Quandt . " " Quandt ? " repeated Barrett , his head still stuffed with the legal brief he had been studying . Then he remembered . Quandt had been the mail-order publisher of hard-core pornography , the one who had originally acquired the rights to The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Phil Sanford . After being tried and found guilty of mailing obscene matter , Quandt had escaped a jail sentence when the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower court . He had disappeared completely , until Kimura learned that he was now in the motionpicture business in Southern California . Their hope had been that Quandt might produce some valuable information about Jadway 's character and his writing of the novel . And now Quandt had been found . " Leo , " said Barrett , " you mean you know where he is ? " " I 've just come from seeing him , " said Kimura triumphantly . " I hurried over to the nearest gas station to call you . He operates an organization called the Arts and Sciences Cinema Company . Im-pressive ? " " I 'll say . " " Do not be fooled , " Kimura went on . " That grand euphemism disguises a factory that grinds out low-budget girlie  --  I should say nudie  --  films . Quandt 's name is n't publicly associated with it . I just happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building where the cinema company is located . He is , in fact , the company 's proprietor . I called on him , and I can not say my reception was warm . When I began to state my business , Quandt was decidedly uncooperative . It was obvious he wanted as little publicity for or public knowledge of his business , and his own connection with it , as possible . He admitted quite candidly that , should we bring up his name in court , the District Attorney would have men watching his every move from that day on . He wanted nothing to do with our trial . Nevertheless I kept right on talking , and suddenly Quandt became more interested . " " What were you saying to him , Leo ? " " I told him we did not intend to involve him in any way , neither through reference to him nor by asking him to appear in person . When Quandt realized that we did not want him for a  | witness , and that we had no intention of bandying his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out he hated that St. Clair woman and the whole STDL , as well as Elmo Duncan and his office , and be was willing to assist anyone who was ready to take them on . He agreed to meet with you , Mr. Barrett , but briefly and in complete secrecy . He kept protesting to me that he was conducting a legitimate operation , his nudie films were proper enough to be exhibited in two hundred public theaters located throughout the country , and yet he had to be wary because the law and the Grundys liked to persecute men like himself who had once gone to the Supreme Court to overcome his censors . Between us , I have a hunch he 's a fanatic about maintaining his secrecy for another reason . Those nudie films of his are legitimate , even if borderline , but I do not think they are what afford him his real profits . I have a hunch they camouflage another operation he may have going on behind closed doors . " " Meaning what ? " TmE ADDRESS of the Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment building located on Vermont Avenue between Olympic and Pico Boulevards . Puzzled , Barrett stood beside the peeling " No Vacancy " sign near the entrance and examined the stucco front . The name of the " Like maybe stag films . I do not know . I said hunch . " " Savory our Mr. Quandt ai n't , " said Barrett . " Still , savior our Mr. Quandt may be , " said Kimura , who enjoyed these semantic games with Barrett . " Because he is ready to inform you of all that he knows about Leroux and about the Jadway book . I have no idea how useful his information will be . I only know he is one person you have wanted to see , and now you can see him . " " When ? " " Did I not tell you , Mr. Barrett ? Now , right now . You must leave this instant if you want to catch him . After today he will be outside the country for five weeks . So it must be now . Mr. Quandt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrett shoved aside his work and took up a pencil and pad . " Okay , Leo , give me his address . If nothing else comes of it , at least I 'll have a chance to see where nudies are born . "  | firm was nowhere in evidence , nor was there any clue to Quandt 's cinema-business headquarters . Barrett wondered whether he had taken the correct address from Kimura . He stepped back to find out whether the business could be located to one side of the building . To the right was a cottage that housed a dancing school , and to the left was a driveway that apparently led to a garage in the rear where the apartment building 's tenants kept their cars . On the far side of the driveway was a vacant store that had recently been a realtor 's office . Barrett decided that he had better telephone Kimura and check out the address once more , but then it occurred to him that one of the tenants in the building might know of the Arts and Sciences Cinema Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cardboard sign nailed to the railing of the stairway leading to the second floor . The cardboard sign had lettered on it MAKE INQUIRIES HERE , with an arrow pointing to a plain door next to the stairs . He crossed to the door and rapped . A man 's voice called out , " Come on in ! " Barrett opened the door and found himself in a cubbyhole of an office , windowless and dark except for a small lamp that threw a beam upon a young man with a pallid face who was busily typing a letter , using the hunt-and-peck system , on an ancient manual typewriter . The table near the typewriter stand was covered with what appeared to be mail-order catalogues . The young man did not look up until he had finished the last line of the letter he was typing . As he withdrew the letter from the machine , he acknowledged his visitor with a display of serrated teeth . " Sony , " he said . Rising , dropping the letter on the table , he inspected Barrett carefully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm looking for a firm called the Arts and Sciences Cinema Company . A friend gave me this address , but I 'm afraid it 's the wrong one . I thought maybe someone in here could help me . " " All depends . Can you state your business ? " I have an appointment with the head of the company I mend tioned  --  a Mr. Norman C. Quandt . My name is Michael Barrett . The serrated teeth were in evidence again . " Maybe I can help . Got any identification ? "  | Curiouser and curiouser , Barrett thought . " Sure . " He brought out his wallet and opened it to his driver 's license . The young man peered down at it , rubbing his jaw , and then he nodded . " Guess you 're cleared . Ca n't be too careful . " He went to the telephone . " I 'll tell Mr. Quandt you 're here . " And then Barrett understood completely . There are movies and movies , Kimura had once said . There are legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word  --  art movies . For certain movies , made on a shoestring , sexually erotic , the contents verging on the borderline of the law , no studio or advertisement was wanted . The stucco apartment building was Norman C. Quandt 's Potemkin facade . " Yeah , that 's right . Right , " the young man was saying into the telephone . " I 'll bring him . " He hung up and started for the door . " Mr. Quandt 'll see you now . He 's on the set . He said he 'll see you there . Want to follow me ? " They went into the hall , then bypassed the stairs and walked the length of a poorly illuminated corridor . At the rear of the building the back hall door stood open , and the young man pushed the screen and pointed down . " Watch yourself . " There were three wooden steps , and the middle one was cracked . Barrett descended carefully . There was a patch of a back yard , with two orange trees , circled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide had brushed past him and was heading toward what seemed to be a long four-car garage , but no cars were visible because the garage doors were all down . The young man held open a padded side door . " I 'll leave you here . Go right in . Mr. Quandt 's the one with the cigar . " " Thanks . " Barrett entered , and the padded door shut behind him . At first the sudden change from sunlight to darkness made him blink , and he tried to accustom his eyes to the change . In a moment he got his bearings and saw that the interior of the garage had been remodeled into a cheap semblance of a motion-picture sound stage . The windows and walls were draped with canvas-covered padding and sheets of perforated soundproofing materials . Almost lost in the shadows were domestic props and stacks of stage scenery . Diagonally across from him , in the most distant corner ,
