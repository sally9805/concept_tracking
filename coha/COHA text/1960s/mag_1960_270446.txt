Six Satellite Rulers Descend on New York <P> TO applaud his speeches , second his motions and demonstrate " the unity of the Socialist camp , " Nikita Khrushchev brings to New York this week six captive chieftains from the Bleak Lands of Double Think . The men Khrushchev chose to accompany him to the U.N . are the ones who wield real power in Russia 's European satellites-though only two hold formal government offices . Of the satellite bosses , only East Germany 's Walter Ulbricht is missing : he had to be left behind because his nation does not belong to the U.N . For the West , their arrival is a rare opportunity for firsthand inspection of the ruthless survival experts who rule 79,633 million enslaved Eastern Europeans . The roll call : <P> Albania . Premier Mehmet Shehu ( pronounced Shay-who ) is a 47-year-old soldier who won his military spurs in the Red-led Garibaldi Brigade during the Spanish Civil War , got his final polishing at Moscow 's Voroshilov Military Academy . The son of a mullah , Shehu is the only satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies at Tirana 's American Vocational School . Despite his soft speech and crisp good grooming , Shehu is known as the " Butcher of Albania " for his bloody suppression of anti-Communists as boss of Albania 's secret police ; at a 1950 meeting of the Albanian Cabinet , he reportedly shot an argumentative colleague dead over the conference table . His chief political stock in trade is his implacable hatred of Yugoslavia . Since Moscow 's latest falling-out with Tito , this has apparently led Khrushchev to favor Shehu over Albania 's First Party Secretary Enver Hoxha . <P> Bulgaria . Though he holds no official government job , Todor Zkivkov , First Secretary of Bulgaria 's Communist Party , considers himself the Bulgarian Khrushchev and , like his hero , is fond of making trips into the countryside to pose as the peasants ' folksy friend . In Zhivkov 's case , the effect is diminished by monotone oratory and a repugnant personality . A onetime printer and World War II partisan leader , chunky Todor Zhivkov , 49. is cold , humorless and conceited . Under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has successfully herded virtually all its peasants onto collective farms ; it is also one of the few countries in the world that possesses fewer cattle now than in 1935 . But in Khrushchev 's eyes , Zhivkov 's unquestioning loyalty to Moscow apparently makes up for his notorious lack of intelligence .
