A change in command at a college can sometimes be as rough as a switch of leaders in a banana republic . Last week two campuses were in turmoil because trustees named new presidents over the heads of favorite local candidates , and on a third campus a departing president philosophized about the perils of prolonged leadership . <P> Slippery Rock State College is a thriving school in western Pennsylvania noted mainly for the chuckles it draws when radio announcers toss its football scores in among those of such giants as Notre Dame and Michigan . Yet Slippery Rock 's 2,300 students were dead serious about supporting easygoing Acting President John Edwards , 47 , for the empty top job ; 1,300 kids signed a petition favoring him . Instead , the trustees chose Dr. Robert S. Carter , the businesslike chairman of the education department at Denison University in Granville , Ohio . <P> Edwards and Carter quickly got into a fuss over when Edwards should give up the 18-room , three-story presidential mansion-a key fringe benefit to augment the post 's $16,000 salary . One morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that the water had been shut off-on Carter 's orders , it developed . Electricity and heat also faded . Edwards ' 17-year-old daughter had to dress at a neighbor 's house for her high school graduation . Edwards called the cutoff " an outrage . " Carter called Edwards " rude and obstinate . " Furious , students hanged Carter in effigy . After a week in the dark , Edwards moved out . <P> Dr. Lloyd H. Elliott , president of the University of Maine , bumped into similar resentment after being named president of George Washington University . <P> On the G.W. campus , 13 deans and 32 department chairmen had recommended that Vice President John Anthony Brown be promoted to the job ; the trustees ignored them . The Faculty Assembly thereupon refused to extend greetings to Elliott or assure him that they would cooperate . Elliott remained stoically optimistic , said he hopes to meet with " all segments of the university " to work things out . <P> No such acrimony had ever enveloped Dr. Barnaby C. Keeney in his ten productive years as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled a commencement audience with the announcement that he was resigning though he is only 50 , Keeney offered some thoughts about presidential tenure . " I have long felt that something on the order of ten years is an appropriate term for the president of a university , " he explained . " One can not arrange his pace so that he will last indefinitely , if he wishes to be effective . I set mine , have followed it , and find that the results have been about what I had expected . " His plans , he said , are indefinite except for one thing : he will not accept the presidency of any other university .
