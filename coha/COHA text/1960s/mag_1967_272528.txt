Secretive as a salesman of obscene postcards , the visitor from Moscow scuttled from one London publisher to another showing his wares . But publisher after publisher turned him down-and with good reason . Not that his price was too high . Indeed , he was asking for no money at all . And his manuscript was certainly topical : it was a copy in Russian of Svetlana Stalina 's memoirs . Reason for the publishers ' turndown : they all knew that the legal rights to the book had already been sold for a record $3,200,000 to other U.S. and British publishers , who plan to bring it out in October under the title Twenty Letters to a Friend . <P> What made the publishers even more wary was that they recognized the peddler . He was Victor Louis , a Soviet citizen who is married to a British wom an , works as a part-time correspondent in Moscow for the London Evening News , lives auspiciously well , and sometimes does unofficial chores for the Kremlin . Eventually , Louis was forced to turn to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alex Flegon , a Rumanian refugee who operates a small press in London and specializes in smuggling dubious literary material in and out of the Soviet Union . <P> <P> Soviet Scheme . Louis ' mission to London was a sure sign that the Soviet Union has given up its high-pressure , but unsuccessful , campaign to persuade the U.S. and other Western countries to postpone publication of Svetlana 's book until after this November 's 50thanniversary celebration of the Bolshevik Revolution . By circulating a copy of the manuscript that Svetlana left behind with friends last year when she went to India , they hoped to force premature publication of the book in the West , thus diluting its impact before the November festivities . <P> <P> For a little while , the move seemed to pay off . No sooner had Flegon announced that he would publish his version in Russian and English than Svetlana and Hutchinson &; Co. , her British publisher , won a London court ruling temporarily stopping Flegon 's plan . In order to protect their copyright under British law , Hutchinson then rushed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on sale in obscure London bookshops . London newspapers scooped up the copies , put Russian-reading reviewers to work , and last week the gist of the memoirs was out . <P> " Loving Father . " Readers may well wonder what the Soviets were worried about . Svetlana remembers Daddy as a " loving father who gave out tobacco-smelling kisses " and wrote kind letters promising his daughter pomegranates from the Black Sea coast . She tries to dispose of the old rumor that Stalin murdered her mother , who was his second wife . They had a little quarrel at a Kremlin banquet in honor of the 15th anniversary of the November revolution , Svetlana concedes , but she insists that her mother shot herself that evening . " The fact is , " says Svetlana , " that Stalin himself never killed anything in his life except hawks and hares , and did not know how to . " <P>
