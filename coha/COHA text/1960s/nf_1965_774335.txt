txt  | individual competition in a completely unorganized market or by some governmental wage-fixing authority . There are many other possible institutional variations . Thus , in one economy practically all real property may be owned by the State ; in another economy it may all be owned by private persons ; and in yet a third economy private persons may own not only all the real property of the community but also in addition a large volume of paper debt owed to them by the State ( the so-called National debt ' ) . Or , to take another example , in one economy social attitudes and educational arrangements may be such as to make the movement of men from one job to another easy and frequent , whereas in another society occupational and geographical movement may be rare and difficult . Finally , in one community the State may be under the necessity of raising a large proportion of the national income in governmental revenue to finance a heavy expenditure on armaments , whereas in another community expenditure on armaments and , as a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearly some of these differences in institutions may themselves be considered as being the results of conscious acts of economic policy ; for example , the setting of a legal maximum price in a market is likely to be an act which can be decided on economic grounds by the government itself . But not all the differences in economic institutions are of this nature ; for example , the level of expenditure on armaments can not be considered to be solely or even primarily an economic decision . And it is difficult to know where to draw the line between institutions which can and those which can not be altered by the government on economic grounds ; for example , to make employers and workers compete for labour in a fully competitive labour market by making trade unions and employers ' federations illegal may be a theoretically possible line of economic policy , but in fact it may well be totally impossible politically . In many choices between different economic policies a large range of relevant institutional arrangements must be taken for granted ; and the effect of any given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within which it has to operate . Finally , societies may differ very much in the behaviour and motivation of their citizens . In one society the main motive in life may be to make as large an income as possible ; in another it may be to acquire as much power over others as possible ; and in a third it may be to carry on with life as before in a traditional manner . One example of this sort of difference might be that in one society businessmen aimed at maximizing the profits which they could earn ; in another society they might try , even at the sacrifice of profit , to expand their commercial empires to the greatest possible size ; and  | in a third community they might prefer simply to continue making the products and earning the income which their fathers had done before them . Clearly the effect of any given change in an economic policy is likely to be very greatly affected by the way in which the individual citizens react to a change in their economic environment . The possible relevant variations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , we shall confine ourselves to one or two examples . In deciding how much of their income to save and how much to spend on present enjoyments , are the citizens in the economy under study mainly affected by ( i ) the size of their current incomes relatively to their needs , ( ii ) past habits regarding the level of their consumption , ( iii ) what their neighbours the Jones 's are spending on consumption , or ( iv ) the rate of interest which they could earn on their savings ? Within a family budget of any given size do housewives and other consumers ( i ) have rather fixed habits about what they will buy , ( ii ) shift quickly and frequently from goods which have become more expensive to goods which have become less expensive , or ( iii ) determine their purchases from time to time according to changes in outside advertisement campaigns ? Do a particular group of wage-earners demand higher pay mainly ( i ) because their employers have large profits out of which to pay them , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , ( iii ) because the cost of living has gone up , or ( iv ) simply because there is a high demand for their particular work ? Clearly it will be important in discussing the choice of an economic policy to consider the individual 's behavioural patterns in the particular economy in question . The study of the principles of economic policy is further complicated in the real world because there is more than one independent government determining the choice of policies . Because of differences in their final objectives , in the basic resources of their communities , in their institutional arrangements , and in the behavioural patterns of their citizens , different sovereign governments are likely to adopt different economic policies for their independent communities . But no economy is unaffected by what is happening in the other economies , though some will be more dependent than others upon what is happening elsewhere . Each government in choosing its own economic policy must take into account what is happening elsewhere . Moreover , in various ways it may through its own choice of policy be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus indirectly make the outside conditions more or less favourable for the achievement of its own objectives . Such effects may be achieved by the direct exercise of economic pressure by one government upon another or by the threat of such pressure or by the conclusion of a  | mutually advantageous bargain or treaty between two or more governments or even by the institution of a super-government endowed with the power to enforce ( within certain specified limits ) the adoption of particular policies by the subsidiary governments . In any case in the choice of an economic policy any one government must always take into account the facts ( i ) that it is not operating in a closed ' vacuum but in an open ' system in which the results of its policy will in any case be greatly affected by what is going on elsewhere and ( ii ) that its own choice of policy may directly or indirectly affect the choice of policies by other governments in ways which are of great importance to itself . It should by now be clear to the reader that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are a very large number of variables . Incomes , prices , outputs , levels of employment , savings , consumptions of various goods , additions to various forms of capital equipment , imports , exports , wage-rates , rates of interest , the amount of money , and many other quantities are all simultaneously affected by the independent decisions of individuals , business corporations , and governmental bodies . Thus a change in economic policy will set up a whole series of interrelated reactions . Not only are there a large number of variables and of interconnections between them ; but there are a very large number of combinations of possible assumptions about policy objectives , endowments in basic resources , institutional arrangements , and behavioural patterns within an economy . It is this complexity which above all constitutes the essential difficulty for economic analysis . How then can one proceed ? The author of this work can think of only one method . One must construct a simple model which isolates one or two features of a possible real world ; one must study their implications in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by making the assumptions less and less restrictive . But on each occasion there will soon come a point at which further elaboration will make the model too complicated for it to be of any more use than the real world itself in helping one to comprehend the forces actually at work . Then one must begin again with another simple model which isolates another set of relevant features of the real world and start the whole process of gradual elaborations over again . In this procedure one should be extremely frank about the assumptions which are being made at each stage for each model . This will unfortunately make many students despair of a discipline which appears so unrealistic . But this risk must be taken . Any other course means that the economist bamboozles himself as well as his  | students . One should always avoid the risk of claiming more for one 's analysis than one can in fact rightfully claim . The art of political economy is to choose models which combine simplicity with relevance to certain important features of the real world . The economist can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he has built a large number of models which between them incorporate in various ingenious combinations all the main features of the real world which he thinks are likely to be relevant to the issue which he is examining , and if each of these models passes the same verdict upon a given economic policy , then he may have some confidence that this verdict is more likely to be right than wrong . The author of this work is convinced from his own personal experience that , employed in this careful manner , economic analysis can help greatly to illuminate problems of policy in the real world .  | We shall start our model-building by considering the operations of an extremely simple economy in which the two original factors of production , land and labour , are used directly to produce various goods for individual consumption and in which the underlying conditions are unchanging so that a stationary self-perpetuating equilibrium state is reached . The present volume is devoted to the examination of such a society . Such a society is , of course , horribly unrealistic . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counts . First , it enables one to isolate and thus examine precisely and carefully certain relationships of first-rate importance of a kind which are at work in the real world . Second , it provides a training in certain tools of analysis which will prove of great use when the strict assumptions of this volume are relaxed and models are made more realistic . Third , the model can provide an example of the basic clash between what is desirable in society on efficiency grounds and what is desirable on distributional grounds ; and it provides , therefore , a good introduction to a wide range of problems concerned with the choice of economic policy . It would be possible to examine this basic model on either of two extreme assumptions about the institutional framework of the economy . One could assume that the economy was a perfectly free competitive laissez-faire market system in which any individual citizen was free to buy , sell , and produce anything he wished and in which the organization of production and consumption was carried out by the free play of competition between indivduals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum advantage . Alternatively , one could assume that all production was socialized and that the State alone was allowed to decide what should be produced and consumed , so that the organization of production and consumption was the result of a central plan . One of the important purposes of this volume is in fact to consider the similarities and the contrasts between these two methods of determining how the scarce resources of the community ( land and labour ) will be used to produce goods and services for the best satisfaction of the citizens ' needs . Our procedure in this volume will be first to discuss the issues at length on the strict assumptions of a perfectly competitive laissez-faire  | market economy and then to conclude the volume by considering how the same problems might be tackled in a completely socialist economy . It would be possible to proceed in exactly the opposite order ? to consider at length all the issues in the context of a socialist economy and then on the basis of that discussion to explain how a laissez-faire market economy would cope with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy first and the Socialist economy second simply because that follows the historical sequence of the development of thought on these problems . We shall accordingly start with the following ten strict and farreaching assumptions . ( 1 ) We assume that we are dealing with a closed economy in the sense that there are no other economies with which the citizens of our economy have any economic relations . ( 2 ) Second , we shall be assuming that there is no Government expenditure and no Government taxation . This complete absence of a Government budget and of problems of Public Finance involves among other things the assumption that there are no goods and services ( such as defence , justice , law and order ) which our citizens must consume in common . All goods and services are assumed in this volume to be capable of private individual consumption . ( 3 ) We shall assume at first that all production and consumption takes place in freely competitive markets . Any citizen is permitted to undertake on his own private enterprise the production of any product . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purchase for his own consumption any commodity or service available on the market . ( 4 ) The only factors of production with which we shall be concerned in this volume fall into the two categories of land and labour . By land we mean all forms of original natural resource , but we assume in this volume that these natural resources are indestructible . In other words , we neglect problems connected with the use of wasting assets such as the mining of minerals or the depletion of forests . By labour we mean all forms of human work . We shall similarly assume in this volume that the quality of human effort is given ; that is to say , we shall be neglecting problems connected with the investment of capital in the further education and improvement of human abilities . In our model there may be many different forms of labour ( some men specially fitted for brain work , some for heavy physical work , some for delicate manipulation , and so on ) and many different forms of land ( some fertile , some infertile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . In other words there may be many more than two distinct factors of production ; but all these factors are assumed to fall into  | either of the two broad categories of land or labour . We assume that there are large , but given and unchanging , amounts of each type of land and of labour in our economy . ( 5 ) In this volume we shall neglect entirely the factor capital ' . We shall assume simply that the various forms of labour and land combine together to produce , instantaneously and without delay , certain outputs of goods and services ready for immediate final consumption by the citizens of our economy . There is no stock of real capital in the form of plant and machinery , or of stocks of raw materials , goods in process , or of finished products . Moreover , it is assumed that all citizens spend on consumption all of the incomes which they earn in the form of wages of labour or rent of land . No part of income is saved and no real capital is accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no continuing technical progress . There is a certain state of technical knowledge available to all the citizens in the economy . ( 7 ) There are no indivisibilities in the economy and there are in consequence constant returns to scale . This means that if given amounts of land and labour are being used , in the most efficient known way , to produce a given amount of a particular product , then an x per cent increase ( or decrease ) in the amounts of land and of labour available for the production would cause an x per cent increase ( or decrease ) in the level of the output of the product . The factors land and labour and the products themselves are all assumed to be infinitely divisible so that a change of x per cent ( however large or small x may be ) could not give rise to awkward absolute sizes for the productive activity . The absolute scale of production itself makes no difference to the amount of output per unit of input . ( 8 ) There are no external economies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive markets work in such a way that , when a private citizen produces something , he in fact pays for all , but for not more than all , the real resources which he uses up in the production , and that he is in fact paid ( or himself pays ) for all , but for not more than all , the useful products ( or the indirect disadvantages to others ) to which his productive activity gives rise . It implies similarly that , when a private consumer consumes something , he in fact pays for all , but not for more than all , the real resources which his consumption uses up and that he is paid ( or himself pays ) for any accompanying benefits ( or costs ) which his act of private consumption may involve for other citizens . ' One  | example must suffice at this stage . If a producer causes a smoke nuisance which increases the laundry bills of those in his neighbourhood , but does not himself have to meet those bills , then his production is imposing an external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We assume away all such externalities . ( 9 ) We assume in this volume that there is a large number of individual citizens and that each citizen has a given consistent and independent set of preferences . For example , if citizen A were given the choice between ( a ) working 2000 hours a year and having 300 loaves of bread and 5 shirts a year or ( b ) working 2200 hours a year and having 250 loaves of bread and 10 shirts a year , he would know whether he preferred ( a ) to ( h ) or ( b ) to ( a ) or was indifferent between them . Moreover , his set of choices is assumed to be consistent in the sense that if he prefers ( a ) to ( b ) and ( b ) to ( c ) , then he prefers ( a ) to ( c ) . His set of preferences is assumed to be independent in the sense that it is unaffected by what is going on around him ( and in particular by what his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense that it remains the same over time . ( 10 ) Finally , in order to ease the exposition we shall make a very simple monetary assumption , namely that our citizens use a simple form of money ? let us call it $1 notes ? and that they spend on consumption goods each working day the whole of the money income which they earned from wages and rents on the previous working day . Since the amount earned on any working day in wages and rents must be equal to the amount received that day for the sale of that day 's output of the products of labour and land , the money national income with our simple assumption will be constant . Suppose on day 1 $100 million has been earned . Then on day 2 $100 million will be spent , so that on day 2 $100 million will be earned . Then on day 3 $100 million will be spent . . . and so on . By this means we are able to consider what will determine the money prices of the various products that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labour , and the money rents for various sorts of land on the simple assumption that the total money income of the community is constant at $100 million a day . It may help with the analysis of the rest of this volume to have in mind the simple schematic representation of our economy which is shown in Figure I. Every working morning in our competitive economy the workers and property owners ( Mr A , Mr 13 , Mr C , Mr D ) go off from their  | Homes to the Firms and Farms where they provide the services of Labour ( L ) and of the land or Natural resources ( N ) which they own . These resources produce an immediate output of goods and services for final consumption ( XYZ ) which find their way almost instantaneously to the Shops where they are bought on the same day by the housewives ( Mrs A , Mrs B , Mrs C , Mrs D ) . This explains the day 's circular clockwise flow of real goods and services shown by the unbroken line in Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housewives have spent in the shops the whole of the $100 millions of money income which they received on the previous day . This money has been received in the firms and farms and paid , in wages of labour and rents of land , to the workers and property owners who , that same evening , take these receipts of income home to their housewives for expenditure in the shops on the following day . This explains the day 's circular anticlockwise flow of money shown by the broken line in Figure 1 . There are thus in our present simplified economic system two markets : ( i ) the market for consumption goods as sold in the Shops to the final consumers ; and ( ii ) the market for the productive factors , labour and land , as hired by the various Firms and Farms for the production of the goods supplied to the Shops . In this volume we shall be assuming that in both these markets conditions of perfect competition or of perfect potential competition prevail . Before we go further it is necessary to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and perfect potential competition ' . A perfect market for any one of the products in the Shops ( or for any one of the factors of production in the Firms or Farms ) implies :  | ( i ) That there are a large number of individual competing sellers of each product ( or factor ) ; ( ii ) that there are a large number of individual competing purchasers of each product ( or hirers and employers of each factor ) ; ( iii ) that each product ( or factor ) is a standardized homogeneous entity so that there is no difference between one unit and another unit of the same product ( or factor ) ; ( iv ) that there is perfect knowledge by each buyer and seller of the product ( or factor ) of the prices currently asked and offered by the other buyers and sellers in the same market ; and ( v ) that there are no transport or similar market costs which differentiate one buyer 's position from that of another buyer or one seller 's position from that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there could not be more than one price ruling in the market for any one product ( or factor ) . For if there were a difference of price , the buyer who was being charged a higher price would attempt to obtain his requirements at a lower cost from the seller who was charging a lower price ; and this seller in turn would be seeking a somewhat higher price from the buyer who was paying the higher price . As a result the high-priced seller would have to lower his price and the low-priced buyer would have to raise his price . Only when all bargains were at the same price would no buyer or seller seek to transfer his business . There is a second and fundamental result of perfect competition . Each individual buyer or seller will take the market price of the product ( or factor ) at which he can buy or sell as given and on that basis will decide how much he wishes to buy or sell . No single buyer or seller alone by buying or selling more or less could hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for the amount which any individual buyer takes off the market or any individual seller puts on to the market is but a drop in the ocean of the total market . Of course , if all or a large proportion of the buyers ( or of the sellers ) decided simultaneously to buy ( or sell ) more or less of the product or factor , their combined decisions would affect the market price . This is known as the parametric ' role of prices in a perfectly competitive market : the price of the product or factor is taken as a given constant by each individual decision-making unit ( i.e. by each individual competing buyer or seller ) but the level of each price is in fact the outcome of the sum of all the independently reached decisions of all the individual decision-making units . What is important for our subsequent analysis are these two results of perfect competition , namely that only one price can rule in the market for a given product or factor and that each individual  | buyer or seller will take this ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action is concerned . But for these results to occur it is not in fact necessary that perfect competition ' , as we have just defined it , should prevail . It will be sufficient if conditions of what we may call perfect potential competition ' prevail . The distinction is of great importance for our subsequent analysis of the productive process . We can explain it in the following way . In what follows we shall assume that there are a large number of citizens and thus a large number of competing housewives purchasing the consumption goods in the Shops and a large number of competing workers and landlords selling the services of labour and of land to the producers in the Firms and Farms . But we shall not assume that there are necessarily a large number of competing Firms and Farms in any industry purchasing the services of labour and land and selling the consumption goods . With our two assumptions of freedom to compete ( assumption 3 ) and of constant returns to scale ( assumption 7 ) it is not necessary to assume that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one industry in order to reach the conclusion that the individual firm can not itself influence the prices of the factors which it buys or of the products which it sells . The reason for this can be seen by starting from the extreme assumption that in any one industry ( for example , the industry producing bread ) there is one giant monopolistic firm . It would seem at first sight that this firm by restricting its output could create a scarcity of bread and thus drive the price of bread up above its cost of production and reap a monopoly profit . But if it did so , a small competitor would immediately come into the market and undercut the monopolist . For we are assuming that anyone is free to come in and compete ( assumption 3 ) and that there is no disadvantage from the point of view of cost it producing on a very small scale ( assumption 7 ) . The monopolist producer would in fact be faced with perfect potential competition ' . Although at the moment he is faced with no actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being set at a level not higher than the cost of production of the myriads of small competitors that could at any moment come in and compete with him . In fact the combination of assumptions 3 and 7 means that the size of the individual Firm or Farm is of trivial importance for our present analysis . We can conduct our analysis on the assumption that each industry is represented by only one single Firm or Farm ( subject to perfect potential competition ) or by a large number of small Firms or Farms ( in actual perfect competition with each other ) or by any intermediate number of Firms or Farms . In what follows  | it will often be most convenient to talk of an industry as if it were made up of only one single firm ( subject to perfect potential competition ) ; for then everything which we have to say about the firm can apply to the industry and vice versa . The size of the individual Firm or Farm becomes a matter of real importance only when we come on to consider economies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The grossly oversimplified economic system with which we are now dealing will , of course , tell us little about many of the basic economic objectives discussed in the Introduction ( pp. 14-17 ) . Since we assume a given state of technical knowledge , it will tell us nothing about the promotion of technical progress ( p. 15 ) . Since we assume no savings , it will tell us nothing about the optimum level of savings ( p. 16 ) . Since we assume a given population , it will tell us nothing about the economic problems of achieving an optimum population ( p. 16 ) . Since there is no change taking place in our stationary state , it will have little relevance to problems of economic security ( p. 17 ) . Since our economy is a completely laissez-faire system , there will be complete freedom of choice of consumers among products and of workers among jobs , so that complete economic freedom will exist ( p. 16 ) . It will also be true that there will be full employment of the resources of land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equilibrium state . For if any resource were unemployed , the owner of that resource would , in competition with the other competing owners of the same resource , be lowering the money price at which he would offer it in the market . So long as there was unemployed labour , the money wage rate would be falling in our perfectly competitive labour market . Or so long as there was unemployed land , the money rent per acre would be falling in our perfectly competitive real estate market . Conversely , so long as there was an excess of demand for , over the available supply of , labour ( or land ) , the money wage rate ( or the money rate of rent ) would be being raised in our competitive factor markets . Prices of the factors of production would thus never be constant unless there were full employment . With a constant level of money expenditure on all factors taken together ( assumption 10 on p. 28 ) a point could be reached at which the money wage rate and the money rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available labour and land . ' It should in passing be carefully noted that we are not arguing that the competitive factor markets will necessarily lead to a  | stationary equilibrium position . There is in fact much to be said about the dynamic processes whereby market adjustments are made and whether these are stable or not ; but these matters are not covered in this volume . All that we are asserting here is that if a stationary equilibrium is achieved there will be full employment of resources ; for if there were not full employment of any factor , the price of that factor would not be constant and the economy would not , therefore , be in a stationary equilibrium . There remain two of our economic objectives ? namely those of an economically efficient allocation of resources ( p. 15 ) and of an equitable distribution of income and property ( p. 16 ) ? about which quite a lot can be learnt even in the grossly over-simplified economy of this volume . A major function of our analysis in this volume will be to explain what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now assumed an equilibrium based on the free operation of the price mechanism will achieve an economically efficient use of resources . But it will also be a major function of our analysis in this volume to point out that this efficient ' equilibrium may also be a very inequitable ' one . It will become apparent that a price situation which ensures an efficient use of resources may well involve an undesirable distribution of income . This volume will serve well to illustrate possible clashes between economic efficiency and distributional equity ( cf. Chapter XII below ) .  | In this chapter we shall consider the basic logic lying behind the choice of our consumers ( Mrs A , Mrs B , Mrs C , Mrs D ) as they select among the products available to them in the Shops . Let us start with the simplest possible situation ? Mrs A choosing between two products X and Y. In Figure 2 we measure along the horizontal axis the amount of X and up the vertical axis the amount of Y which Mrs A may be acquiring each week for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at the moment receiving 01 of X and OJ of Y per week , a combination of consumption of X and Y which can be represented by the point E. We now offer Mrs A alternative combinations of X and Y per week to consume , such as the combination at H which consists of OK of X and OL of Y per week . We ask Mrs A whether she prefers the new to the old combination and she can answer Yes ' , No ' , or Do n't Know ' . We mark in Figure 2 with a cross those new combinations which she prefers to the old , with a circle those new combinations which she  | likes less than the old , and with a dot those combinations between which and the old she is indifferent . Her choice map will look something like that in Figure 2 . Any new combination which leaves her neither better nor worse off than before will probably have to contain more Y if it contains less X ( or more X if it contains less Y ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South-East of E. The combinations like G which Mrs A prefers to the dots in the band of indifference must lie to the North and the East of this band ; for they must contain either more X or more Y or more of both X and Y than some dot in the band of indifference . Similarly the combinations like H to which Mrs A prefers her existing position will lie to the South and West of the band of indifference . If Mrs A always prefers a combination which has more X and more Y to one which has less X and less Y , however small the difference may be , and if she is strictly consistent in her set of preferences , the band of indifference will shrink to a line separating the crosses from the circles . Consider the two points F and F ' in the band of indifference . F ' contains more X and more Y than F. Mrs A will , therefore , prefer F ' to F. But if she is indifferent between E and F , she must , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' should , therefore , be marked with a cross . If all points to the North-East of points like F are marked with a cross and all points to the SouthWest of points like F with a circle , then the band of indifference will be reduced to a line running North-West and South-East from E.  | We can in this case represent Mrs A 's preference map by a series of indifference lines as is done in Figure 3 . All combinations such as E and F which lie on the indifference curve It are of the same importance as each other ; and all points such as H and G on I2 are of the same importance as each other . There are three properties of these indifference curves which we must note . ( 1 ) We have already explained why these lines must slope downwards from North-West to South-East . ( 2 ) We can now see that they can not cut ? or indeed touch ? each other . For , supposing that I2 were cut by I ; . E ' is indifferent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ; H is preferred to E ' since H contains more of both X and Y than does E ' ; and G is indifferent to H since both lie on I2 . It follows that G is preferred to F , since G is indifferent to H which is preferred to E ' which is indifferent to F. But this is absurd since F contains more of both X and Y than does G. Indifference curves which cut would represent an inconsistent set of consumer 's preferences . If choice is rational and consistent , the curve Il will lie always to the North and East of I2 and any point on It will be preferred to any point on I2. ( 3 ) The slope of any I-curve at any point measures how much more of the one product Mrs A would have to have to make up for the loss of a little of the other product . For example , Mrs A would be equally well off as at G if on the loss of JG of X she obtained JK more of Y. We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marginal rate of substitution ' between X and Y. We shall assume that each I-curve is convex from below , i.e. has a slope which becomes gentler and gentler as one moves down it from North-West to South-East . This is a probable commonsensical assumption . At G Mrs A has a lot of X and little Y. If she has less of the plentiful X she would not feel the loss too much , but a little more of the scarce Y would be important to her . At G , therefore , a small increase in Y makes up for a given loss of X. But at H Mrs A has much Y and little X. The same loss of the now scarce X ( LH = JG ) must be offset by a much greater gain of the now already plentiful Y. The slope of I2 is less steep at G than at H. We will call this phenomenon the diminishing marginal rate of substitution ' between X and Y. Figure 3 can be taken as a statement of Mrs A 's needs and tastes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her purse and the state of the market to determine what she will buy . Figure 4 represents the size of her purse and the state of the market . Again we measure along the horizontal axis the amount of X per week and up the vertical axis the amount of Y per week available to Mrs A for her family 's consumption . On this Figure we can draw the  | straight line AB sloping down from left to right , which we will call the budget-constraint line and which represents all the combinations of X and Y which Mrs A can purchase in the market . The budget-constraint line is constructed in the following way . Suppose Mrs A has $50 a week to spend ; and suppose that the price of a unit of X is $1 and of Y is $2 . Then if Mrs A spent all her income on X she could purchase 50 units of X a week . We measure along OX a distance OB equal to 50 . On the other hand if she spent all her income on Y she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure up 0 Y a distance OA equal to 25 . Join the points AB with a straight line . Any point within the triangle OAB represents a combination of X and Y which is within Mrs A 's purse . But since she would always like to have more of both products if it were possible , she will never be content with a combination like E but will always move as far North-East as possible , i.e. on to the line AB . At A she is spending all her money on Y. Suppose now she buys 5 units less of Y ( AC = 5 ) . She will then have $10 free to spend on X. With this she can purchase 10 units of X ( CD = 10 ) . She will have moved from A to D. Suppose now she reduces her purchases of Y by another 5 units ( DE = 5 ) . Once more she has $10 more to spend on X and can buy another 10 units of X ( EF = 10 ) . She has moved on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D to F. And so on , till she reaches B. By then she will have five times reduced her purchases of Y by 5 units in order to increase her purchases of X by five times 10 units . She will now be spending all her income on X.  | Changes in Mrs A 's income and changes in market prices can be represented by shifts in the budget constraint line AB . Suppose that Mrs A 's weekly money income goes up by 20 per cent while the money prices of X and Y remain unchanged . Then Mrs A can purchase 20 per cent more Y if she buys only Y so that OA ' is 20 per cent greater than OA . Similarly OB ' is 20 per cent longer than OB . A'B ' is parallel to AB , but is 20 per cent above ( or to the right ) of AB . The slope of A'B ' is the same as the slope of AB which marks the fact that the price of X relatively to the price of Y is unchanged . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain 10 more units of X. But the shift from AB to A'B ' could represent not a rise in Mrs A 's money income by 20 per cent with the money prices of X and Y unchanged , but a fall in the prices of both X and Y by 16 ; per cent the money income of Mrs A being unchanged . For if all prices fall by 16i per cent Mrs A 's real purchasing power has gone up by 20 per cent . ' The shift from AB to A'B ' represents a 20 per cent increase in Mrs A 's real income with the relative prices of X and Y unchanged ; but it does not make any difference to Mrs A whether this occurs through a 20 per cent rise in her money income or through a uniform fall in the money price of every product by a corresponding percentage ( 16 per cent ) . On the other hand a change in the money price of X relative to the money price of Y will cause a change in the slope of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of X were to rise by 20 per cent with Mrs A 's money income and the price of Y unchanged . If she spent all her $50 on Y she could purchase 25 units of Y as before ( OA remains the same at 25 units ) . But if she spent all her $50 on X at a price of $1.20 instead of $1.00 she could purchase only 413 units instead of 50 . OB " is 41 ; units in place of OB at 50 units . The line AB " represents her new budget-constraint line . The steeper slope of AB " represents the fact that for every 5 units of Y given up ( i.e. for every $10 released from expenditure on Y ) she can now purchase only $lo = 83 instead of 10 units of X. By putting Figures 3 and 4 together we can confront Mrs A 's needs and tastes with the size of her purse and the market situation . This is done in Figure 5 . Mrs A has an income which , if all of it were spent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending less on Y and more on X she can obtain a combination of products which  | she prefers . The highest indifference curve which she can reach is I2 , which she can just attain by purchasing the combination of OC units of Y and OD units of X. At this point the slope of the budgetconstraint curve AB is equal to the slope of the indifference curve . The relative market prices of A ' and Y are equal to the marginal rate of substitution between X and Y on her indifference-curve map . If she moves along her budget-constraint curve I2 a little either to the North-West or the South-East of Q , she will be pulled away from the indifference curve I2 towards a lower one such as 13 . On the other hand , there is no possible point on her budget-constraint curve which will bring her into contact with a higher indifference curve such as II . We can put the same point the other way round . Suppose Mrs A is purchasing a combination of X and Y such that the relative prices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitution between A ' and Y on her indifference map ( as at Q ' or Q " ) . It is clear from Figure 5 that in such a case she can always move along her budget-constraint line in such a way as to reach a higher indifference curve . We can now see how a change in her money income and a change in market prices would affect Mrs A 's purchases . Let us start with a change in her money income which is represented in Figure 6 . Mrs A starts with a money income and a set of market prices which  | put her on the budget constraint line AB , on which she chooses the point Q which is tangential to her highest attainable indifference curve . She then enjoys successive increases in her money income , market prices remaining unchanged , so that her budget constraint line rises to A'B ' , to A " B " , and finally to A " ' B " ' . As her income increases in this way she moves along a path Q ' ? Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that combination of X and Y at which her new budget constraint line is tangential to her highest attainable indifference curve . The path Q ? Q ' ? Q " ? Q " ' we may call her income-consumption curve ' . The position of the path Q ? Q ' ? Q " ? Q " ' depends upon the nature of her needs and tastes , i.e. upon the shape of her indifference curves . One possible set of indifference curves might bring her along the path Q ? Qi ? Qi ? Q2 " ' . Figure 6 shows a set of indifference curves which would bring this result . In this case as her income increases she buys a lot more X and a little more Y. But if Y instead of X were the commodity which she most wanted when her income went up , then her indifference curves would be differently shaped and she would move along a path like Q ? Q4 " . Figure 6 shows five different possible paths all relating to the same relative prices of X and Y , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs for the two products X and Y. We can now give certain definitions which will help to describe these different reactions . We define the income elasticity of demand for X ' as the percentage change in the amount of X bought as a result of a one per cent increase in spendable income , the prices of X and Y being constant . Suppose Mrs A 's income-consumption curve was on the straight line passing through 0 and Q , i.e. the line Q ? Q ' 3 " . In this case the ratio of Y to X in Mrs A 's purchases would remain unchanged as her income rose . Y and X would increase in the same percentage as each other and , therefore , in the same percentage as total spendable income . In this case her income elasticity of demand for X and her income elasticity of demand for Y would both be one ; for a one per cent increase in spendable income would cause her to purchase one per cent more X and one per cent more Y. On the path Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , so the ratio of the amount of Y bought to the amount of X bought falls . The slope of the lines joining 0 and Q , 0 and Q2 , 0 and Q2 , and 0 and Q ' 2 " measure at each point the ratio of the amount of Y to the amount of X bought and these slopes become gentler and gentler as Mrs A 's income increases . In this case when her income goes up by one per cent her expenditure on X goes up by more than one per cent and her expenditure on Y by less than one per cent , so that on the line  | Q ? Q ' the income elasticity of demand for X is greater than one and for Y is less than one . The path Q ? Q ' I " represents an exaggerated form of a high income elasticity of demand for X and a low income elasticity of demand for Y. In this case when Mrs A 's income goes up she purchases a great deal more X and actually less Y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich person 's good and Y a poor person 's good . When the standard of living goes up , people may consume more meat and less bread . In this case Y is said to be an inferior good ' . The income elasticity of demand for X is a high positive figure but the income elasticity of demand for Y is a negative figure because when Mrs A 's income goes up by one per cent the amount of Y which she buys goes down by a certain percentage . By a similar process of reasoning it can be seen that on the path Q ? Q ' 4 " the income elasticities of demand for X and Y are both positive , but that for X it is less than one and for Y it is greater than one . And along the path Q ? QS ' the amount of X bought actually goes down . X is now an inferior good ; and the income elasticity of demand for X is a negative figure while that for Y is a large positive figure . So much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A may react to a change in her income . Let us now give a similar description of the way in which she may react to a change in the price of one of the products , her income and the price of the other product remaining unchanged . In Figure 7 we suppose that Mrs A 's income and the price of Y both remain constant , so that the amount of Y which she could purchase with all her income remains fixed at OA . But the price of X falls . It starts at a high level so that OB measures the amount of X which she could buy with all her income ; but as the price of X falls she could purchase larger amounts of X ( OB ' , OB " , and finally OB " ' ) with the whole of her income . Her budget constraint line swings round from AB to AB ' to AB " to AB " ' as the price of X falls . The ever-diminishing downward slope of this line represents the fact that as the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increments of X for every unit of Y which she gives up . Mrs A 's combination of purchases of X and Y will move along a path Q ? Q ' Q " ? Q " ' , each combination being that at which the ruling budget constraint line is tangential to her highest indifference curve . We will call the line Q ? Q ' ? Q " ? Q " ' Mrs A 's price-consumption curve ' . Once again , according to her tastes and needs , i.e. according to the configuration of her indifference curves , there are different courses which this price-consumption curve may take . Just as in the former case we needed the idea of an income elasticity of demand  | for X to describe Mrs A 's reaction to a change in income , so we now need the idea of a price elasticity of demand for X ' to describe Mrs. A 's reaction to a change in the price of X. We define Mrs A 's price elasticity of demand for X as the percentage change in the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one per cent increase in the price of X , her income and other prices remaining unchanged . Table II gives numerical examples of price elasticities  | of demand for X. We suppose that the price of X is initially $1.01 and that at this price Mrs A purchases 100 units a week . The price then falls by 1 per cent to $1.00 . We then trace four different reactions by Mrs A. In case ( a ) her purchases rise by 5 per cent from 100 to 105 . This represents a price elasticity of demand of -5 . For the percentage change in the price is -1 and the percentage change in the amount bought is +5 . A change of +1 per cent in the price would , therefore , presumably cause a change of -5 per cent in the amount bought . In case ( b ) the -1 per cent change in price causes a +1 per cent change in the amount bought and the price elasticity of demand is -1 . In case ( c ) the -1 per cent change in price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the price elasticity is - 1-  . In case ( d ) the -1 per cent change in price has caused a -1 per cent change in amount bought and ( we will consider later whether this is a possible case ) the price elasticity of demand is +1 . In the four columns on the right of Table II we show the total amounts of money which Mrs A will be spending on X on these various assumptions . Initially she is buying 100 units at $1.01 a unit , i.e. spending $101 on her purchases of X. In case ( a ) this goes up to $105 ; in case ( b ) it stays unchanged at $101 ; in case ( c ) it goes down to $100.5 ; and in case ( d ) to $99 . Case ( b ) marks a clear dividing line . In this case of a price elasticity equal to -1 , the 1 per cent fall in price is just counterbalanced by the 1 per cent rise in the amount purchased so that the amount spent remains unchanged . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall in price and total expenditure goes up . In case ( c ) the increase in the amount bought is outweighed by the fall in price and total expenditure falls . A fortiori total expenditure falls in case ( d ) where both price and quantity fall . Where the price elasticity of demand is -1 , total expenditure on A ' remains unaffected by a change in the price of A. Where the price elasticity of demand for X is a larger negative figure ( e.g. -5 ) , a fall in price and expenditure move in opposite directions . Where the price elasticity of demand for X is a smaller negative figure or actually a positive figure ( e.g. - or +1 ) , price and expenditure move in the same direction . These relationships are illustrated in Figure 7 . The price of Y is constant . Let us choose units of Y such that 1 unit of Y has a price of $1 . Then OA measures Mrs A 's total money income , because it is the number of dollar 's worth of Y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact in the initial position at Q she is purchasing only OC2 units of Y , i.e. she is spending OC2 dollars on Y and is using the remainder of her income ? namely AC2 dollars ? to purchase C2Q units of X. At the final low price of X represented by the budget-constraint line AB " ' she is spending OC1 on Y and  | AC ' on X. Her expenditure on X has risen when the price of X has fallen . Her price elasticity of demand for X is ( numerically ) larger than one . ' The downward falling curve Q ? Q'I " represents an example of case ( a ) of Table II where the expenditure on X and the price of X move in different directions . The path Q ? Q ' 2 " on the horizontal line C2Q illustrates case ( b ) of Table II where the total expenditure on Y ( namely AC2 ) remains unchanged as the price of X falls from AB to AB " ' . The price elasticity of demand for Xis . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Table II . The fall in the price of X leads to a larger purchase of X ( Q ' 3 " is to the East of Q ) but to a smaller expenditure on X ( Q3 " is to the North of Q ) . The path Q ? Q4 ' represents case ( d ) of Table II . The fall in price has caused the quantity of X to fall ( Q4 ' is to the West of Q ) and a fortiori expenditure on X to fall ( Q4 " is to the North of Q ) . Is this in fact a possible case ? Figure 7 shows that there is nothing in the three asumptions about the nature of indifference curves given on page 36 which would prevent the line AB being tangential to one indifference curve at Q and the line AB " ' being tangential to a higher indifference curve at Qa " . But what does this mean in terms of Mrs A 's needs and tastes ? Suppose X were bread and Y were meat . The price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 's cost of living . The fall in its price , therefore , appreciably raises her standard of living . But bread is a very inferior good so that , being better off , she buys meat rather than bread . The rise in her standard of living causes her to shift from bread to meat more than the improvement in the price of bread relatively to meat causes her to shift from expensive meat to cheaper bread . She actually buys less bread as a result of the fall in its price . This last point brings out the fact that a fall in the price of X will have a double effect so far as the purchases of X by Mrs A is concerned . ( 1 ) In the first place , a fall in the price of X , with her income and the price of Y unchanged , will reduce Mrs A 's cost of living . Her standard of living is raised . It is equivalent to some rise in her income at constant prices of X and Y , and this in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may call the income effect ' of the change in the price of X. ( 2 ) In the second place , X will now be cheaper relatively to Y and ? if we abstract from the fact that the fall in the cost of living due to the fall in the price of X has made her better off ? this alone would cause her to switch her purchases  | from the now relatively expensive Y to the now relatively cheap X. This we may call the substitution effect ' of the change in the price of X. Figure 8 enables us to distinguish these two effects . Suppose that with a constant price of Y of $1 and with an income of OA , the price of X falls so that Mrs A 's budget constraint line moves from AB to AB ' . Suppose that as a result of this her purchases move from the combination Q1 to the combination Q3 . She is better off . Q3 is on a higher indifference curve than Q1 . Suppose now that her income were simultaneously reduced by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lower price of X , makes her just as well off as before the change , the fall in the price of X being just offset by the fall in her income . She will now have a budget constraint line A " B " which is parallel to AB ' but which is tangential at Q2 to her first indifference curve . At Q2 she is neither better nor worse off than at Q1 her initial position . We may call the movement from Q 1 to Q2 the substitution effect ' of the fall in the price of X. It shows the extent to which she will buy more X and less Y simply because the price of X has fallen relatively to the price of Y , quite apart from the effect on her purchases of the fact that the fall in the cost of living has made her better off . The movement from Q2 to Q3 shows the income effect ' of the fall in the price of X because a movement from Q2 to Q3 could be brought about only by a rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new relative prices of X and Y. The complete move from Q , to Q3 can therefore be regarded as the sum of ( i ) a movement from Ql to Q2 due to a change in relative prices at a constant real income and ( ii ) a movement from Q2 to Q3 caused by the rise in real income which the fall in the price of X represents . ' The substitution effect illustrated by the movement from Qi to Q2 in Figure 8 enables us to define the elasticity of substitution ' between X and Y in Mrs A 's consumption , which is a measure of the ease with which the one product can replace the other product in Mrs A 's needs and tastes . Suppose , as is shown in Figure 9 , that as a result of a change in relative prices represented by the change in the slope of the budget constraint line from AB to A " B " Mrs A 's purchases shift from Ql to Q2 on the same indifference curve I. This substitution effect ' is much greater if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of I in Figure 9 , has a very gentle curvature than it is if , as in the case of I ' , her indifference curve has a much sharper curvature . In the latter case the substitution effect is only from Qi to Q. We can define the elasticity of substitution between X and Y as the percentage change in the ratio of the quantity of Y purchased to the quantity of X purchased that would be brought about by a one per cent rise in the ratio of the price of Y to the price of X. In  | the slope of the line OQt . Thus the elasticity of substitution can be measured by the percentage change in the slope of the line 0Q which is caused by a one per cent change in the slope of the line AB . Clearly the change in slope from OQ1 to OQ2 on an indifference curve like I is much greater than the change in slope from 0Q ; to OQ on an indifference curve like I ' ; but both are brought about by the same change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " B " . t Once again an elasticity of -1 marks an important dividing line . t A zero elasticity of substitution would arise if the indifference curve were shaped as follows : In this case a change in relative prices from AB to A " B " would cause no change in relative quantities . X and Y can only be enjoyed in a fixed proportion . A  | We have already seen that OC measures the ratio of expenditure on Y to expenditure on X at the point Q. Mrs A is spending OC of her income in purchasing Y and AC of her income in purchasing CQ1 of X. Now if the elasticity of substitution between X and Y is equal to -1 , she will spend the same proportions of her income on X and on Y after the change as before the change . For if X and Y are the amounts of X and Y bought , P , , and P. are the prices of Y and of X , and E , , and Ex are the amounts of money spent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? X x P. If the ratio p ' ' went up by 1 per cent without any change in the ratio would go up 1 per cent . If on the other hand the ratio x- went down by 1 per cent without any change in P ' ' , the ratio would go down by 1 per cent . But if the elasticity of substitution is -1 , the ratio will go down by 1 per cent when the ratio goes up by 1 per cent . The change in the price ratio would exactly offset the change in the quantity ratio , so that the expenditure ratio would remain unchanged . If the elasticity of substitution were a ( numerically ) larger figure ( ? 2 , for example ) then the quantity ratio would go down by more than the price ratio went up ; and the rise in the price of Y relatively to the price of X would cause the ratio of expenditure on Y to expenditure on X to fall . Conversely if the elasticity of substitution were ( numerically ) only a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ( numerically ) infinitely large elasticity of substitution would arise if the indifference curve were a straight line : In this case a zero percentage change in relative prices would be sufficient to bring about any given percentage change in relative quantities .  | quantities would move less than the ratio of the prices and the ratio of expenditure on Y to expenditure on X would rise when the price of Y rose relatively to the price of X. In Figure 9 the indifference curve I represents a case in which the elasticity of substitution is ( numerically ) larger than one . For is O C " clearly greater than C " A " . the relative rise in the price of Y has caused the proportion of income spent on Y to fall . Conversely , the indifference curve I ' represents a case in which the elasticity of substitution is ( numerically ) smaller than one . If C were brought down to a level with Q ; and C " were brought up to level with Q , clearly CA would be less than C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused the proportion of income spent on Y to rise . We have now in the present chapter defined and described the possible reactions of a single consumer ( Mrs A ) to a change in prices or a change in her spendable income when she has to choose between only two products X and Y. We must now generalize these definitions to cover the case in which there are more than two products . ' Suppose then that the prices of X , Y , and Z all remain constant and that Mrs A 's income goes up . We may still define the income elasticity of demand for any one of these products ( say X ) as the percentage change in the amount of X which Mrs A would purchase if her income went up by one per cent , all prices remaining unchanged . The income elasticity of demand for all the products could be 1 ; that is to say , it would be possible , when her income went up by 1 per cent , for Mrs A to increase her purchases of each and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income elasticity of demand for one ( or more of the products ) could be greater than 1 provided that at the same time it was less than 1 for at least one of the products ; that is to say , if Mrs A increases the proportion of her income which she spends on one ( or more products ) there must be at least one product on which she spends a smaller proportion of her income . Finally , one ( or more ) of the products might be an inferior ' good and have a negative income elasticity of demand provided that there were at least one product which was not an inferior good and for which the income elasticity of demand was greater than one ; that is to say , Mrs A when she becomes richer  | may actually buy less of some goods , but in that case she must increase the proportion of her income which is spent on at least one good . The generalization to many products of the effects of a change in income is thus in principle simple . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the price of a single product introduces some new considerations . Let us suppose that there are a large number of products ; that the prices of all these products are constant except that of X which is reduced ; and that Mrs A 's money income is constant . We can now re-interpret our diagrams , measuring Mrs A 's money income ( M ) up the vertical axis and the amount of X along the horizontal axis . This is done in Figure 10 . Since the prices of Y and Z and of all other commodities except X are constant , we can measure up the vertical axis a composite commodity of **36;1314;TOOLONG ' . The fact that their prices are all constant gives them all a common measure , namely $1-worth . We assume that Mrs A divides her expenditure on these commodities-except-X ' among the various commodities other than X in the way which gives her the greatest satisfaction . OA measures Mrs A 's money income , while OC measures the amount she spends on all commodities other than X and AC the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is represented by the budget-constraint line AB . When the price of X falls , so that Mrs A 's budget constraint line swings round to AB ' , she purchases C'Q3 instead of CQ1 units of X ; and the change in her purchases can as  | before be split into the substitution effect ' ( Q1 to Q2 ) and the income effect ' ( Q2 to Q3 ) . The substitution effect now measures the ease with which X can be substituted for all other products in general , and we can apply to it exactly the same measure of the elasticity of substitution as we did in the two-commodity case . The elasticity of substitution between X and all other products is the percentage change in the ratio $-Forth of other products bought which is caused by a one per amount of X bought price level of all other goods cent rise in the ratio price of X when all individual prices except that of X remain unchanged and when Mrs A 's money income is so reduced ( i.e. from OA to OA " ) as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the fall in the price of X. Both in the two-commodity case ( Figure 8 ) and the many-commodity case ( Figure 10 ) Q2 lies to the South-East of Q1 . In other words , because the indifference curves slope down from North-West to South-East and are convex from below ( see page 36 ) , the substitution effect is always in the same direction . When the price of X falls relatively to that of other things then ? apart from any income effects ? purchases of the relatively cheaper product X go up and purchases of the other relatively more expensive products go down . The cheaper product is substituted for the more expensive products . This is true whether the more expensive products ' are a single product Y ( as in the two-commodity case of Figure 8 ) or a whole range of other products ( as in the many-commodity case of Figure 10 ) . In the former case it means , of course , simply that less Y is bought . In the latter case it means that less of other goods in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that less is bought of every individual good other than X. Here we have the possibility of a new relationship , namely that of complementarity ' . Consider the three products Pens , Ink , and Pencils . Suppose the price of Pens to fall ( Pens are product X in Figure 10 ) . Apart from any income effects more Pens will be bought and less of other products must be bought to finance the increased purchase of Pens . People will shift from writing with the now relatively expensive Pencils to writing with the now relatively cheap Pens . But Pens are no use without Ink , so that , while the purchase of Pens will go up and the purchase of all other products in general will go down , nevertheless the purchase of one of these other products ? Ink ? will go up . In Figure 10 the purchase of other goods in general will have gone down from OC to OC " ; but this net fall  | may be made up of a very large fall in the purchase of some products ( e.g. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases of one or a few products ( e.g. Ink ) . In such a case Ink and Pens are said to be complementary ' in Mrs A 's demand . Complementarity is thus a relationship which can occur only when there are three or more products . The price of one product ( Pens ) falls ; income effects apart , more of this product and therefore less of other products in general will be purchased ; but while purchases of all these other products combined will have gone down , there may be among them some one product ( Ink ) which has gone up . Pens and Ink are then complements ' in Mrs A 's needs and tastes .  | In the last chapter we gave an account of the way in which a single consumer , Mrs A , may react to a change in her income or in the market conditions in which she has to make her purchases . In this chapter we intend to apply the analysis of the last chapter to the total market for consumption goods constituted by the whole body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our simple economic system on page 29 . It contains two markets : the Shops on the left in which consumption goods are sold and bought and the Firms and Farms on the right where the factors of production are hired and the goods are produced . At the moment we are concerned only with the Shops . That is to say , in this chapter we shall assume ( i ) that each of a large number of consumers ? Mrs A , Mrs B , Mrs C , Mrs D ? has a fixed money income with which she comes to the Shops and ( ii ) that there is a fixed flow into the shops each day of each of the various products ? X , Y , and Z. Our purpose is to see what determines the market prices of X , Y , and Z when the fixed money incomes of Mrs A , B , C , and D meet the fixed supplies of the products . This is a very partial analysis because the market prices of X , Y , and Z @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Farms in two ways : first , by affecting the relative amounts of X , Y , and Z which are produced and put into the shops and , second , by affecting the demand for various factors of production ? such as labour and land ? and thus affecting the distribution of our fixed money national income among the owners of the factors of production , Mr A , B , C , and D. In other words , in this chapter we ask at what levels the prices of the various consumption goods would stand , if the distribution of money incomes and the supplies of these consumption goods were given . We shall have to enquire in later chapters how in the Firms and Farms the prices of the consumption goods affect the distribution of money incomes and the supply of goods . We will start our enquiry into the formation of prices in the Shops with two very special assumptions : ( i ) that there are only two products , X and Y , on sale in the Shops and ( ii ) that each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes and needs as every other consumer . So long as we make this second assumption ( ii ) , there is no difficulty in applying the indifference-curve analysis of the previous chapter to the whole community of consumers . Suppose that any one consumer 's , say Mrs A 's , indifference map between X and Y was as shown in Figure 11 ( i ) . Mrs A is indifferent between O'Di of X with O'C ; of Y and 0 ' . N. of X with O'C of Y. Both combinations lie on her indifference curve , IC . But if there are 1000 consumers with the same incomes and the same tastes ' and confronted with the same prices in the Shops , Mrs A will be purchasing O 'D ; of X and O'Ci of Y only if her 999 neighbours are also each purchasing O 'D ; of X and O'Cj of Y and are also each on their own indifference curve , I ; . We can , therefore , draw a set of community indifference curves in Figure 11 ( ii ) which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) except that in ( ii ) every dimension is 1000 larger than in ( i ) . OD , is 1000 times O 'D ; and represents the fact that there is a total supply of OD , on the market of which O 'D ; is being purchased by each of 1000 identical consumers . Thus the combination of ODt with OCt on the market must mean that there are 1000 consumers each  | consuming O 'D ; + O'C ; and each on her indifference curve , II . If total market supplies changed to OD2 + OC2 , then each individual consumer 's consumption would change to 0'D2 + O'C ; and as can be seen from ( i ) , each consumer is on the same indifference curve . This is represented on ( ii ) by making the community indifference curve II pass through Q2 as well as Q1 . These are both total supplies which , when equally divided among all consumers , will put each consumer on her same indifference curve , The slope of the community indifference curve at Q is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; , the slope of 71 at Q2 is the same as the slope of I ; at Q2 ; and so on . This can be seen in the following way . Suppose that the slope of Ii at Q ; were 1 in 2 or , in other words , Mrs A must at this point have 2 more units of X to make up for the loss of a 1 unit of Y. Then as far as market supplies are concerned , in order that every consumer should remain equally well off , there must be 2000 more units of X supplied in order to make up for the loss of 1000 units of Y. In other words the slope of Il at Q1 is 1000 in 2000 or 1 in 2 , which is the same as the slope of Ii at Q ; . We can use this set of community indifference curves very simply to show the way in which the prices of X and Y will be determined in the Shops . This is done in Figure 12 . We suppose that OD of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market each week . Then there is a point Q which represents this combination of X and Y which consumers must purchase . There is an indifference curve I which passes through this point Q. Draw the line AB tangential to I at the  | point Q. The line AB will describe the resulting market prices of X and Y. This can be understood in the following way . Let Figure 12 shrink until it is only 1/1000 of its present size , so that it represents the indifference map of one of our 1000 identical consumers , Mrs A. Mrs A must be induced to purchase OD of X and OC of Y , i.e. 1/1000 of the total supplies of each product ; for this is the only way in which the market can be cleared . But Mrs A can be induced to do this only if she has a budget constraint line AB . In other words the money price of Y must be such that her money income ( 1/1000 of the total national income ) must be able to purchase OA units of Y ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her money income could purchase 0B of X. The slope of the line AB then represents the price of X relatively to the price of Y. Mrs A could purchase any combination of X and Y on her budget constraint line AB ; and she chooses the combination Q which is on her highest indifference curve . Inflate Figure 12 by 1000 times back into a picture of the whole community . The price of Y must be such that the whol , national income could purchase OA units of Y at the current market price of Y. National Money Income In other words , the money price of Y equals .1 A and the money price of X equals National Money Income The line AB represents the relationship between the market prices of X and Y. The community has a money national income with which , at current prices , it could purchase OA units of Y. But it spends only a fraction DA of its national income on Y. The other fraction OA it devotes to the purchase of X and it is able at the current price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AC of Y. Its purchases of OC of Y and OD of X just clears the market at Q. Suppose that tastes had been different and that at the combination of a 1/1000 part of OD and of OC , each consumer had a higher marginal valuation of Y relatively to X. Mrs A would need to receive more X to make up for the loss of a unit of Y. The slope of the indifference curve at Q would be less steep ( as in the case of I ' ) . In this case the market price line would be A'B ' . The money price of Y would be higher ( the same money national income would purchase only OA ' instead of OA units of Y ) and the money price of X would be lower . If we now suppose that the supply of one of the products is changed , the effect on the prices of the products is less easy to  | determine . Suppose , for example , that money incomes remain unchanged , that the weekly supply of Y is unchanged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is increased . What will be the effect on the money prices of X and Y ? There is one thing which we can say for certain , namely that the money price of X or the money price of Y or both money prices must fall . The same supply of Y and a larger supply of X has got to be purchased with the same total money income and the price of something must fall . But it turns out that this is practically everything that one can say for certain . Whether the price of Y or even the price of X will fall depends upon the nature of the consumers ' tastes and needs . This is illustrated in Figure 13 . We start with supplies of OC of Y and OD of X on the market . The supply of Y remains unchanged and the supply of X rises to OD ' . At the point Q the slope of the indifference curve gave a market price line AB . According to the slope of the indifference curve which passes through the new combination Q ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind ranging from AiBI to ASBS . Let us consider what these various possibilities mean . Consider first the possibility AZBZ where A ' coincides with A. This means that consumers ' needs and tastes are such that when the  | supply of X on the market is increased the money price of X falls but the money price of Y remains unchanged . The fall in the money price of X is represented by the fact that OBz is greater than OB , so that with their given money incomes consumers could purchase more X than before ; and the constancy in the money price of Y is represented by the fact that OAZ equals OA . This case is in fact the case in which the price elasticity of demand for X is -1 . In this case consumers can be induced to purchase more X by a fall in the price of X with their incomes and the price of Y constant . They spend the same amount of money on Y as before and have left over the same amount as before for expenditure on X. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path Q ? Q ' 2 " which shows a price elasticity of demand of -1 . In Figure 13 the line A ; B ; shows a situation in which the price elasticity of demand for X is ( numerically ) less than one ( e.g. ? I ) . In this case the price of X falls when more X is put on the market ( OB ; #@# OB ) . But in consequence consumers spend less of their income on the cheaper product X and have more left over to spend on Y so that the money price of Y rises ( OM @#@ OA ) . The line A3B on the other hand shows the case where the price elasticity demand for X is ( numerically ) greater than one ( e.g. -2 ) . In this case when the price of X falls consumers spend more of their income on the greater supply of X and , in consequence , spend less than before on the fixed quantity of Y. The prices of Y and of X both fall ( OA #@# OA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to AB which would mean that the money prices of X and of Y had both fallen by exactly the same percentage so that their relative prices ( i.e. the slope of AB ) were unchanged . Then the income elasticity of demand for Y would be zero and Y would be just on the border line of being an inferior good ( cf. a horizontal path for Q ? Q " ' on Figure 6 ) . The equal proportionate fall in the prices of both X and Y would be equivalent to a rise in spendable incomes with constant prices ; and the consumers ' needs and tastes would have to be such in this case that they would spend the whole of this increase in income on X and none on Y. If 2,413 were more gently sloped than AB , then the income elasticity of demand for Y would be greater than zero and Y would not be an inferior good ; for if both prices had fallen by the same percentage consumers would be trying to purchase more Y and this would drive the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand if A3B3 were more steeply sloped than AB , then Y is an inferior good ; for in this case if both prices had fallen by the same percentage consumers would be trying to purchase a smaller absolute amount of Y and this would be lowering the price of Y still further .  | The line A4B4 where B4 coincides with B represents a case in which Y is so inferior a good that the price elasticity of demand for Y is zero . This is a case in which there has been no change in the price of X ( OB4 = OB ) but a heavy fall in the price of Y ( OA4 #@# OA ) . Consumers , having the same income and faced with the same price of X , purchase no more Y when the price of Y falls but purchase only more X. The extreme case of inferiority for Y is represented by the line ASBS where the increase in the supply of X causes the price of X to rise and the price of Y to fall very heavily . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y has become a positive figure so that a fall in the price of Y would actually cause a reduction in the amount of Y purchased , if money incomes and the price of B remained unchanged . Suppose we were at Q ' on the line A4B4 and consumers wanted then to purchase less Y and more X ; the price of Y would fall still further and the price of X would actually rise above its initial level . This is a very paradoxical , but nevertheless a possible , result where an increase in the supply of X causes a rise in the money price of X and a heavy fall in the money price of Y. We can perhaps understand the final outcome by imagining the following sequence of events . The immediate effect of the increase in the supply of X is to cause the price of X to fall . This makes people better off . X is the commodity they want when they are better off . They therefore attempt to purchase less Y and still more X. But this causes the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now enjoy a larger total real purchasing power not so much because X is cheaper but because Y is cheaper than before . Y is so markedly inferior ' that this attempted shift from Y to X goes on until the money price of X has made up more than the whole of its initial fall and is actually higher than it was initially . We are now ready to modify the first of the two special assumptions which we made on page 54 , namely that there were only two products X and Y. Our analysis does not need any very great modification to allow for the existence in the Shops of a large number of different products . If there are 1000 identical consumers , then the prices in the Shops must be such as to cause Mrs A , with her 1/1000 part of the national money income , to wish to take 1/1000 part of the supply of each product . The money price will rise for any product of which she is trying to take more than 1/1000 part of the total supply ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs A is taking less than 1/1000 part of the total supply off the market . If the market were in equilibrium and all the consumers ' tastes changed simultaneously so that , at the initial equilibrium prices , they wished to purchase more Y and less X , then the immediate  | effect would be that the price of X would be driven down and the price of Y would be raised . There might now well be further repercussions on the prices of Z and many other products . When the price of X fell this might cause consumers to shift from purchasing Z to purchasing X , if for some purpose the now cheaper X was a good substitute for the still expensive Z. Or , if in some uses X and Z were complements , the fall in the price of X might encourage the use of X for a purpose which required also an increased use of Z. Thus the fall in the price of X might well lead to a sympathetic fall in the prices of products which were good substitutes for X in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were complementary to X in some uses . Similarly , sympathetic rises might take place in the case of products which were good substitutes for Y and sympathetic falls in the case of goods complementary to Y. And there might then be some further price changes which were sympathetic to these sympathetic price changes ; and so on in an endless intertwining of repercussions . But finally we must imagine the market settling down to a new pattern of prices , in which some ? including that of Y ? have gone up and somet ? including that of X ? down , and in which the consumers with their new tastes are now prepared to clear the supplies in the Shops . Rather similar repercussions must be imagined if there is an increase in the supply of any one product , X , coming on to the market . If we rule out as too improbable the possibility that all other products together make up an inferior ' group of products , we can assume that this causes the money price of X not only to fall absolutely but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products . But there may then be important sympathetic falls in the prices of particular products which are good substitutes for X and rises in the prices of any particular products which are complementary to X. And there may be further price changes sympathetic to these first sympathetic price changes ; and so on . But once again we can imagine the market settling down to a new equilibrium in which with unchanged money incomes and unchanged needs and tastes the consumers are taking the same amounts as before of products Y , Z , etc. , but larger amounts of X. Let us next modify the second assumption made on page 54 , namely that each consumer had the same money incomes and the needs and tastes . In order to analyse this situation let us revert to the assumption that there are only two products , X and Y. We now imagine a series of consumers ? Mrs A , B , C , and D , etc. ? perhaps  | with different tastes and needs and with different money incomes to spend ? Ma , Mb , Mc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes Ma + Mb + Mc + Md + , etc. , adds up to the total national income , M. Our problem is to determine how the prices of the two consumption goods ( PX and P , , ) are determined when given supplies of X and Y are coming on to the market , when the total money income to be spent on X and Y is M , when this total income is distributed in a fixed manner between the various consumers , Ma going to Mrs A , Mb to Mrs B , and so on ( Ma  --  Mb + M + ... = M ) and when the different consumers may have different indifference maps . We can tackle this problem by means of Figure 14 . Let us arbitrarily choose two prices PX and P , , and see whether they give an equilibrium solution or not and , if not , what will happen to these prices . With prices Px and and with an income of Ma , Mrs A could purchase p a units of X if she spent all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she spent all her income on Y. In Figure 14 ( i ) we draw OaAa equal to Ma and OaBa equal to Ma , so that AaBa is Mrs A 's budget constraint line . She will move along this line to her highest indifference curve at Qa and will purchase OaCa units of Y and OaDa units of X. Figure 14 ( ii ) and ( iii ) give similar constructions for Mrs B and C. Since the market prices ( PX and PY ) are the same for all consumers the slope of the individual budget constraint line is the same for each consumer . But Mrs B is richer than Mrs A and her budget constraint lies further to the right than does Mrs A 's . Similarly , Mrs C is richer than Mrs B. The combinations of X and Y demanded by Mrs A , B , and C are shown by the points Qa , Qb , Qe . These show a higher proportion of X to Y in Mrs B 's purchases than in Mrs A 's and in Mrs C 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that X was a rich person 's product and Y a poor person 's product ; or it might be due to quite other differences of individual need and taste . For our present purpose the reason is irrelevant . For whatever reason the total market demand for X is OaDa + ObDb + O , D , + ... We show this as OD in Figure 14 ( iv ) . Similarly we show the total of the individual demands for Y ( OaCa + ObCb + + ... ) as OC in Figure 14 ( iv ) . QD shows the total market demand for X and Y at the arbitrary prices PX and PY ; and OA ( =OaAa + ObAb + 0 , . A , + . . . ) shows the value of the total money income in terms of Y and OB its value in terms of X. If by accident QD also represents the supplies of X ( CQ ) and of Y ( DQ ) which are being supplied on the market , then the prices Px and P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But suppose that while the demands for X and Y are at QD , the supplies of X and Y are at a different point , namely Qs . In Figure 14 ( iv ) we show four possible supply points : at Q1 there is an excess supply over demand for both X and Y and F. and PY will both fall ; at al both X and Y are in excess demand and PX and PY will both rise ; at QZ Y is in excess demand and X in excess supply so that P , , will rise and Px fall ; and at Q4 Y is in excess supply and X in excess demand so that P , , will fall and PX rise . Let us consider this last case in more detail . The lengths OaAa , ObAb , O , A , , etc. , will all lengthen as a result of the fall in P , , while all the OB 's will be shortened because of the rise in P , .. The points Qa , Qb , Qc , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . For the community as a whole the market demand point QD will move North-West towards the market supply point Q. If QD then passed , for example , somewhat to the  | right of Q4 , both X and Y would be in excess demand ; P , , as well as PX would tend to rise ; the OA 's as well as the OB 's would be shortened ; and QD would be brought South-West towards W. We are not at present concerned with this dynamic process of adjustment . It is clear , however , that there will be a set of prices P , x and P , , which will make QD coincide with QS . For our present purpose we simply assume that the market mechanism will on the general lines indicated successfully find this point of equilibrium . In Figure 15 we reproduce the market equilibrium for the whole economy . Total supplies on the market are OD of X and OC of Y. The prices of X and Y have been set in the way already described so that the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X at current prices . Consumers as a whole have incomes which , at current prices , would enable them to purchase any combination on the market price line AB . In fact prices are such that they choose the combination Q which corresponds to the supplies actually available . Suppose now that an important group of consumers changed their tastes and at current prices wished to purchase more Y and less X. This would drive up the price of Y and lower the price of X. The market price line in Figure 15 would swing round on the point Q to a position such as A " B " . The new market price line would have to pass through the point Q because total supplies on the market have not changed and the market price line , which represents the new combinations which consumers as a whole could purchase at the  | new prices , must pass through the combination Q which they do in fact continue to purchase in the new conditions . Let us now consider the effect of this change on some individual consumer ? say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs A enjoys 1/1000 of the national income . Then she has a budget constraint line which , on a scale of 1 in 1000 , is an exact replica of the market price line AB of Figure 15 before , and of A " B " of Figure 15 after , the change of taste of her neighbours . This is shown in Figure 16 . It is clear that she will gain as a result of the change if as at QQ her tastes are such that she consumes an exceptionally large proportion of X , the product which has fallen in price because her neighbours do not want it . She will lose if she consumes , as at Qa , an exceptionally large proportion of the product which is now more highly priced because her neighbours are competing more heavily for it . ' Figure 15 will also enable us to analyse the effect on individual consumers of an increase in the total market supply of X. There will now be a new market price line such as A'B ' which must pass through Q ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 15 we have drawn A'B ' so that the increase in X has caused the prices of both X and Y to fall ( OA ' #@# OA and OB ' #@# OB ) . In this case no  | individual consumer could fail to gain from the increased supply of X. Any one with a fixed money income must gain when the price of every product falls . But if in the market as a whole the price elasticity of demand for X were ( numerically ) smaller than one ( e.g. - 1z ) , then the price of Y might rise as in the case of A ; B ; in Figure 13 . Or , at the other extreme , if Y were such an inferior product that a fall in the price of Y would cause the amount of Y demanded to fall , the price of X would rise as in the case of ASBS in Figure 13. ( cf. p. 60 above ) . In either of these two cases an individual consumer such as Mrs A might conceivably be hurt by the increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs A 's budget constraint line in the initial position of equilibrium is AQBa . The supply of X increases in the market . In the case of the new budget constraint line AaBa ' the market price elasticity of demand for X is ( numerically ) less than one ( e.g. -1 ) so that the price of X falls very much ; and the price of Y rises because on the average consumers spend more on Y than before . If Mrs A spent a very large proportion of her income on Y ( as at Qa ) she might be hit by the increased plenty of X on the market . The case of the budget constraint line AQBa represents a much more paradoxical position . Because Y is such an inferior good on the average of consumers in the market , the increased supply of X and the consequential rise in standards of living causes such a shift of expenditure away from Y onto X that the money price of X  | actually rises . If Mrs A now consumes an exceptionally large proportion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qq ) , it is conceivable that she is hurt by the increased supply of X on the market . The heavy consumers of Y are now so advantaged by the fall in the price of Y that they drive up the price of the more plentiful X against the already heavy consumers of X. If the rich man 's good is increased in supply , making the general public better off , the higher standards of the poor may cause them so to compete for the rich man 's good that the rich man is worse off . This possible event is a most unlikely curiosity . Normally , of course , an increased supply of X will be particularly favourable to the heavy consumers of X because the price of X will fall more than that of other products . We can apply these principles to the general case in which there are many products and many consumers with differing incomes and needs and tastes . A market change , due either to a change in consumers ' tastes or to a change in market supplies , will cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have examined . Consumers with fixed money incomes will gain from price falls and lose from price rises . A consumer who consumes an exceptionally high proportion of a particular product will suffer an exceptionally heavy gain ( or loss ) if there has been an above-average fall ( or rise ) in the price of that product . This is the first set of principles to bear in mind in considering the effect of market changes on the distribution of real income between the individual citizens of the community . But there is a much more important set of factors affecting the distribution of incomes among persons , namely the effect of market changes upon the distribution of money incomes among persons . We shall turn to this problem in the next and following chapters .  | We have now considered what goes on in the Shops when given streams of money incomes meet given flows of various products on to the market . We explained at the beginning of the last chapter ( p. 54 ) that we were neglecting the effect of price changes in the Shops upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we explained that in fact there were two sets of influences in the Firms and Farms which might have repercussions in turn upon the market for finished products in the Shops . For , first , a change in product prices might affect the supplies of X , Y , and Z produced in the Firms and Farms for the Shops ; and , second , this might cause a change in the demand for various factors of production and thus in the relative earnings of various citizens and so in the personal distribution of the fixed national money income between the individual consumers . In this chapter we shall construct and discuss a set of assumptions about what goes on in the Firms and Farms which will enable us to continue with our assumption that the supplies of the products X , Y , and Z are unaffected by changes in the prices of X , Y , and Z but to drop the assumption that such price changes have no effect upon the distribution of incomes . This result would occur if the factors of production ( i ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialized in the production of different commodities , and ( iii ) were very unequally owned . Let us start with a very extreme example . Suppose ( i ) that there are two factors of production , land ( N ) and labour ( L ) , each fixed in amount ; ( ii ) that there are two products , food ( X ) and clothing ( Y ) , food being produced by land without the co-operation of any labour and clothing being produced by labour without the co-operation of any land ; and ( iii ) that there are two classes of citizens , landlords ( A ) who own all the land and do no work and workers ( B ) who do all the work and own no land . The outputs of X and Y would now be fixed , the output of X being the given output of the available supply of N and the output of Y being the given output of the available supply of L. But variations in the price of X and Y would cause variations in the rents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the distribution of the national income between the classes A and B. In order to continue with the simple model of the economy which we explained in Chapter I we will assume that the X produced by the landlords on their Farms is all sold at the current market money price in the Shops ; the landlords ' wives receive this money income ; and next day they spend it in the Shops partly on buying some Y produced by the workers in the Firms but partly on buying back , as it were , some of the X which has been produced on the landlords ' Farms the previous day . Similarly , we suppose that the workers sell in the Shops at the ruling price all the Y produced by them in the Firms , their wives receiving the wages thus earned and spending them on purchasing X and Y from the Shops . If we assume that each landlord 's family is exactly similar to every other landlord 's family in the sense that ( i ) each owns the same amount of land and thus receives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each has the same set of tastes and needs , and if we make a similar assumption about the workers and their families , we can treat the present case very simply . We can for each of the two groups of families in the community construct a group indifference map out of the indifference map of a representative family in that group on the principles which have already been explained at length ( pp. 55-56 ) . At the top left half of Figure 18 we draw a group indifference map for the whole of the workers ' families . We measure horizontally to  | the right from B the amount of X , and downwards vertically from B the amount of Y , consumed by the working class . Thus the point Q represents a working-class consumption of BD of X and BC of Y. Since all are alike in incomes and needs and tastes , each workers ' family will be consuming 1/1000 of BD plus 1/1000 of BC , if there are 1000 workers . Each individual working-class family will be on an indifference curve which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bli we have represented all those combinations of total consumption of X and of Y by the workers as a whole which , when spread evenly over all the workers , would put each individual working-class family on this same individual indifference curve , At the bottom right half of Figure 18 we do the same for the landlords as a class . We measure the amount of X consumed by the landowning class to the left along the horizontal axis from the origin A and the amount of Y consumed by the land-owning class up the vertical axis from the origin A. Thus the point R represents the consumption of AE of X and of AF of Y by the landowning class . If there are 100 landlords , each landlord 's family will be consuming 1/100 part of each of these quantities . All points on the A-group indifference curve marked All represent combinations of X and Y which , when they are divided into 100 equal parts , would suffice to keep each individual landlord 's family on the same individual indifference curve , say Al ; . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amount of Y equal to OB ( each individual worker producing 1/1000 of OB ) . This amount of Yis sold in the Shops . Whatever the money price of Y ruling in the Shops the market price line for the workers must pass through the point O. If the price of Y is high , the money incomes of the workers will be high ; but , the price of Y being high , this money income would purchase only BO of Y if it were all spent on Y. If the price of Y were low , the money incomes of the workers would be low ; but , the price of Y being low , this money income would purchase as much as BO of Y if it were all spent on Y. The workers in fact will in all circumstances receive a money income which , if all spent on Y , would purchase that amount of Y ( namely BO ) which they have in the first instance sold in the Shops . According to the money price of X relatively to the money price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starting from 0 , will have a steep slope such as that of the line y or a gentle slope such as that of the line 8 . In the case of y the workers ' wives by refraining from repurchasing OC of the Y sold by their husbands to the Shops can purchase CQ of X. In the case of 8 by refraining from purchasing OC ' of Y they can obtain C'Q ' of X. Since the slope of  | 8 is less steep than that of y , more X can be obtained for each unit of Y given up on 8 than on y . On S the price of X is lower relatively to the price of Y than it is on y . When the relative prices or , as they may be called , the terms of trade between X and Y are represented by the price line y , the workers will in fact choose the combination O. For this is the point at which their market price line y is tangential to their highest attainable indifference curve BIi . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will purchase the combination Q ' , bringing them on to a higher indifference curve BI2 . The curve O ? 01 , which is often called group B 's offer curve ' maps out all the points Q at which the market price lines through 0 are tangential to group B 's indifference curves . It is in fact analytically the same construction as the price-consumption curve shown in Figure 7 for all consumers in the conditions discussed in Chapter It . Since OC represents the total amount of purchasing power in terms of Y which group B will spend on X , group B 's price elasticity of demand for X is ( numerically ) greater than one when the curve O ? O , , is sloping up from 0 in a North-Easterly direction , is ( numerically ) equal to one when 0 ? O , , is horizontal and moving due East , and is ( numerically ) less than one when it is sloping down to the South-East , as the price of X falls in terms of Y. Similarly in the bottom right half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land available to them can produce AO ' of X of which each landlord receives 1/100 part . This they can sell in the Shops in competition with each other , receiving an income which , whatever the price of X may be , will give their wives a purchasing power over AO ' units of X. If the money price of X relatively to that of Y gives a terms of trade ' of 8 , then their wives by refraining from the repurchase of O'E of X can obtain AF of Y. In fact , this brings them to a consumption combination R which is on their highest attainable indifference curve All . The terms of trade y represents a rise in the price of X relatively to that of Y. The landlords ' families will be better off and will now move to the consumption combination R ' by refraining from the repurchase of O'E ' of their output of X in order to purchase R'E ' of Y in the Shops . The curve 0 ? O ? is group A 's offer curve ' . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'E represents the amount of purchasing power in terms of X which group A spends on purchasing Y , group A 's price-consumption curve has an elasticity ( numerically ) greater than one so long as it slopes up North-East from 0 ' , an elasticity equal to one if it rises due North , and an elasticity ( numerically ) less than one if it moves in a North-Westerly direction as the price of Y in terms of X falls . By bringing the points 0 and 0 ' together we can from Figure 18  | construct the box diagram given in Figure 19 . Group B is producing BO of Y and group A is producing AO of X. Suppose the terms of trade were as shown by the line S. Then group A would be trying to consume the combination shown at R because , as is indicated by the offer curve O ? Oa by giving up OE of X in return for ER of Y group A can now attain the highest achievable indifference curve . Group B on the other hand would wish to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of group A 's output of X in order to achieve the consumption combination at Q which , as group B 's offer curve shows , brings group B to the highest attainable indifference curve . In this situation the demand for X would exceed the supply since group A 's consumption ( AE ) plus group B 's consumption ( BD ) is greater than the total output ( AO ) . Conversely , the supply of Y ( BO ) would exceed the demands of group A ( AF ) and of group B ( BC ) . The money price of X would rise and of Y would fall . The terms of trade would move in favour of X and against Y. The price line S would swing round in the direction of the arrow . Equilibrium would be possible only at the terms of trade represented by y , the price line which passes through the point P , where the two offer curves intersect . It can be seen from the Figure that at this point R and Q would coincide and for both products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps worth noting that in the case of offer curves with price elasticities ( numerically ) less than one there may be more than one possible equilibrium level of the terms of trade . This is illustrated  | in Figure 20 where the two offer curves intersect at Q1 , Q2 , and Q3 . At all the three terms of trade represented by straight lines passing from 0 through Q1 , Q2 , or Q3 , total demand and supply would be equal . The point Q2 would , however , represent a very unstable point . For supposing that the terms-of-trade line happened to pass slightly above the point Q2 , as in the case of the line y shown in Figure 20 , then , as can be seen in the Figure , the demand for X would exceed the supply ( RF + CQ #@# AO ) , while the supply of Y would exceed the demand ( BO #@# DQ + RE ) , so that the price line would be pulled in the direction shown by the arrow , away from Q2 towards Q1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price line passed between Q2 and Q3 it would be pulled away from Q2 towards Q3 . But Q1 and Q3 are both equilibrium points . The existence of more than one equilibrium point is probable only if X and Y are bad substitutes for each other and are demanded in rather fixed proportions by both groups , A and B. The commonsense of this possibility can then be seen in the following way . Suppose the terms of trade are very unfavourable to group B. Group B has to give up a lot of Y to get a little X. This little X goes with the little Y left over to group B to make up a low level of balanced consumptions of X and Y. At the same time group A has received a lot of Y and is giving up little X and , therefore , has much of both X and Y to consume ? a high-level balanced consumption . Both groups A and B might be in equilibrium . At vastly different terms of trade greatly in favour of group B the roles are simply reversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X and has a high-level balanced consumption , while group A gives up much X for little Y and has a low-level balanced consumption . Again both groups A and B might be in equilibrium . We can now use this box diagram to observe the effects of a change of tastes on the part of one group . Suppose that group A 's demand for Y increases and for X decreases in the sense that at any given terms of trade group A would sell more X in order to buy more Y. This is shown in Figure 21 . Before the change group A 's offer curve was shown by 0 ? O. After the change group A 's offer curve has shifted to 0 ? 0 , . At the terms of trade y group A consumed the combination Q , but after the change consumes at Q ' a larger amount of Y and a smaller amount of X. Similarly , at the terms of trade 8 group A formerly consumed at R and after the change at R ' . The initial equilibrium terms of trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the point Q where 0 ? Ob and 0 ? 0 , , intersect . After the change of group A 's tastes the terms of trade will have moved to a since the line 8 passes through R where O ? 0b and 0 ? O , intersect . The increased demand for Y and the decreased demand for X by group A will have raised the money price of Y and lowered that of X and group B will be better off . How much the terms of trade will have moved in favour of group B and against group A will clearly depend , not only upon the shift in group A 's offer curve , but also upon the shape of group B 's offer curve . Between Q and R ' group B 's offer curve is inelastic . Suppose  | that the curve had been elastic as on the broken line between Q and R " . The terms of trade would have moved much less against group A as a result of the increase in group A 's demand for X. The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decreased demand for X causes the price of Y to rise and of X to fall . If a small fall in the price of X relatively to that of Y causes group B to purchase much more X and to spend more Y on the purchase of X then A 's increased demand for Y can be met without very extensive price changes . Suppose next that there were some change in the productivity of the soil and that more X per acre is produced , so that the total output and the output per landlord of X is increased . The result of this on the terms of trade is illustrated in Figure 22 . We start with a production of X of AO and of Y of BO . The line y represents the equilibrium terms of trade and the point Q represents the initial equilibrium trading point . It is on group A 's offer curve 0 ? 00 which cuts the line y at the point Q. To avoid confusion in the diagram we have not shown group B 's offer curve ; but since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B 's offer curve must pass through Q. The increased output of X is represented by the fact that group A can now produce AO ' instead of AO of X. As far as group B is concerned this means simply that group B 's origin is shifted to the left from B to B ' and all group B 's indifference curves and so B 's offer curve is simply shifted by an amount of B'B or 0'O to the left .  | If we take the same price line as before ( y ' is parallel to y ) group B 's offer curve will cut the price line at the same point . In other words group B 's offer curve , having been shifted by an amount 0'O to the left , passes through Q " where Q " is a point directly to the left of Q by the same distance . If the new equilibrium point were at Q " , group B 's position would be completely unchanged by the increased output of X. The outcome clearly depends upon what has happened to group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 's initial real income in terms of X has gone up by an amount 00 ' . In other words , still taking the point A as the origin of group A 's consumption map , we have to draw group A 's offer curve starting with an income for group A in terms of X of AO ' instead of AO . What the new offer curve of group A looks like depends upon the nature of group A 's indifference map . 0 ' ? Oa ' , 0 ' ? Oa , and 0 ' ? Oa ' represent three possible positions of group A 's new offer curve . The curve 0 ' ? 00 " passes through Q " . In this case there is no change in the terms of trade . Group B 's position is unchanged . Starting with the same real income in terms of Y ( B'O ' = BO ) and faced with the same terms of trade ( y ' is parallel to y ) , group B is in exactly the same market position as before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting with a larger real income in terms of X ( AO ' #@# AO ) and faced with the same terms of trade as before . This case will occur if and only if group A 's income elasticity of demand for Y is zero . Group A 's income goes up by 0'O in terms of X and at unchanged terms of trade , group A adds the whole of this amount of X to its own consumption of X leaving its consumption of Y unchanged . The curve 0 ' - OQ ' passes South-West of Q " and cuts y ' at Q " ' . This is an example of what would happen if Y were an inferior good in group A 's consumption , so that when group A 's income went up and prices remained unchanged group A would purchase less Y than before in order to spend more than the whole of the increase in income on X. Q " ' is South-West of Q. In this case unless the terms of trade changed group B 's consumption would be at Q " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an excess demand for X and an excess supply of Y. The terms of trade would move against group B in the direction of the arrow pointing from Q " ' . If B 's offer curve ran from Q " through K " , then R " ' would be the new equilibrium point . Group B would be worse off than before because of the increased supply of X. Group A has become rich by producing more of the rich man 's product ' and therefore buys less of the poor man 's product ; and this has hurt group B which produces the poor man 's product .  | O ' ? Oa shows the more normal case in which group A 's income elasticity of demand for Y is positive . When group A 's income increases , prices remaining the same , group A in this case buys more X and more Y. Q ' is North-West of Q. Now unless there is a change in the terms of trade there will be an excess demand for Y and an excess supply of X , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and group A 's at Q ' . The terms of trade will move in the direction of the arrow from Q ' in favour of group B and against group A. Group B will be better off than before , having the same real income in terms of Y but being able to trade it on better terms . Other things being equal , it is good to trade with rich people because they are likely to have a high demand for your product . Group A starts with a larger income in terms of X but in the present case can trade on worse terms . If group B 's price elasticity of demand for Xis ( numerically ) less than one , it is possible that the net outcome of the two changes will be to make group A worse off than before . Suppose in the case of Figure 22 that group B 's offer curve ( which is not drawn on the Figure ) ran from Q " South Eastwards through R ' . Then K would represent the new equilibrium position . The slope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the line O'R ' and the slope of group A 's indifference curve at Q is that of the line y . If the line O'R ' extended passed below Q , then R ' might be on a lower indifference curve for group A than is Q. If the farmers ( group A ) produce more wheat ( X ) and if they do not want to consume more wheat themselves but want to sell it to get more manufactured goods ( Y ) , and if the manufacturers ( group B ) do not want to eat more wheat unless the price of wheat is very greatly reduced , then the farmers may in competition among themselves so spoil the market for wheat that they are worse off as a result of a good harvest . This is the well-known problem of the producers of primary products . It is of some interest to consider in the three cases of 0 ' ? Oa ' , 0 ' ? OQ , and 0 ' ? Oa ' " of Figure 22 what will have happened to the absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the output of Y is constant but the output of X has increased , and since we are assuming total money expenditure on both goods to be constant , the prices of X or of Y or of both X and Y must have fallen . If the money price of Y is constant , then the money income of group B is constant ; therefore , the money income of group A must also be constant ; and therefore the distribution of money income between the two groups is unchanged . If the money price of Y has fallen , the money income of group B will be up and that of group A must , therefore , have fallen ; and the distribution of the money income will have changed in favour of group B. Conversely , if the money price  | of Y has fallen , the distribution of the national income will have moved in favour of group A. Now in the case of the new offer curve O ' ? OQ ' in Figure 22 the money prices of both X and Y will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y ' parallel to y ) both money prices must have moved together and both must , therefore , have fallen . The distribution of the national income has moved in favour of group A which has a larger income in terms of X and thus against group B which has no change in its real income . ' In the case of 0 ' ? C " in Figure 22 the terms of trade have moved against Y. The absolute money price of Y will , therefore , have fallen still more than in the case just examined , since the money price of Y must now have fallen by a larger proportion than the price of X. If Y is sufficiently inferior in group A 's consumption it is possible that the terms of trade will have moved so heavily against Y that . with a constant money expenditure on X and Y together , the price of Y will have fallen so much that the price of X does not fall at all or even rises.2 In this case there will have been a very marked shift in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 0 ' ? Oa ' in Figure 22 the terms of trade will have moved against X. The price of Y will have fallen less than the price of X. It can be seen from the position of the point R ' that the smaller ( numerically ) are the elasticities of A 's and B 's offer curves the more the terms of trade will move against X. It is possible that the terms of trade move so much against X that , with a constant total money expenditure on X and Y together , the money price of X falls so much that the money price of Y either does not fall at all or actually rises.3 In this case the increased output of X by group A would cause no improvement or even an actual decline in the share of group A in the national income . Any changes in the shares of group A and group B in the national income can be seen very simply from Figure 22 . In order to compare the incomes of group A and group B we must choose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what measuring rod we choose , since it is simply the ratio of group A 's to group B 's income which we are considering . There are three possible measuring rods . We can measure money income , or real income in terms of purchasing power over Y ( i.e. money income divided by the price of Y ) , or real income in terms of purchasing power over X ( i.e. money income divided by the price of X ) . Let us 1 This corresponds to line A3Bj in Figure 13 when AjBj has the same slope as AB . 2 These two cases correspond to the lines A4B4 and ASBS in Figure 13. 3 These would correspond to the lines AZBz and A ; B ; of Figure 13.  | measure the incomes of both groups in terms of purchasing power over Y. Group B 's income in terms of Y is , of course , group B 's output of Y which remains unchanged at BO = B'O ' = AD . Group A 's income in terms of Y is group A 's income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of trade . Before the change in Figure 22 this is equal to AC . For group A has an income in terms of X of AO which can be converted at the initial market prices into AC units of Y. The ratio of group A 's income to group B 's income AC is , therefore , AD ' After the increase of group A 's output to AO ' , group A 's income in terms of Y would be equal to AC ' if the terms of trade were unchanged ( i.e. y ' parallel to y ) . This as we have seen would be the case if the income elasticity of group A 's demand for Y were zero , represented by the new offer curve O ' ? Oa " . In this case the ratio of AC ' group A 's income to group B 's income would have risen to AC If Y were an inferior good in group A 's consumption ( i.e. with a new offer curve of the sort O ' ? 0 ' , ; ' ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction of the arrow from Q " ' , C ' would rise up the vertical axis through A , and the ratio of group A 's income to group B 's income would be even larger . With a new offer curve of the kind 0 ' ? Oq , the terms of trade line would be pulled in the direction of the arrow from Q ' . If there were a sufficient pull in this direction , the point C ' on the vertical axis through A might be pulled below C. In this case the ratio of group A 's to group B 's income would be lower than before the increase in the output of X. With a constant money national income , the increased output of X would have raised the money income of group B and lowered the money income of group A. We can generalize the type of situation discussed in this chapter by allowing for a large number of products . The essence of the situation is that the prices of the products X , Y , Z , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of citizens , but will not affect the output of the products themselves . For this to be the case we must imagine a large number of factors of production each specialized for the production of a single product . Thus one man is a cobbler , another man a baker , and so on ; and one acre of land can produce wheat , another beef , and so on . The cobbler can not become a baker , and the wheat land can not be used for grazing . We must imagine further that the ownership of these specialized factors is not evenly spread over the families of citizens in the  | communities . Thus one family receives its income from shoe-making rather than from the baking of bread or from the raising of cattle ; and so on . ' Our analysis proceeds then on exactly the same lines as in Chapter III except that we now have to allow for the fact that changes in the prices of the products will themselves improve the position of those citizens who are concerned with the production of the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are concerned with the production of the lower priced products . Consider the case of a shift of demand from X to Yin this general case . As we have argued in Chapter III , the direct effect would be a fall in the price of X and a rise in the price of Y. There would then be a series of sympathetic price changes in those products which were close substitutes for , or complements to , X or Y. These price changes would now have repercussions upon the money incomes of the producers of the various products , money income being transferred from the producers of the products which had fallen in price to the producers of the products which had risen in price . These distributional effects require some comments . First , the effects upon the distribution of real income between the citizens in the community now depends upon the outcome of two sets of forces . The citizens who will gain most are those who ( i ) produce in more than the national average those products which have risen most in price and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national average those products which have fallen in price . That is to say , citizens now stand to gain or lose both as producers and consumers . If their income as producers is very specialized ( i.e. if it depends exclusively upon the production of one product ) whereas their expenditure as consumers is very widely spread ( i.e. something like the national average ) over all products , then they are likely to be much more closely affected as producers than as consumers by any change in relative prices . But it is the combination of the two influences which now determines how much particular groups will be benefited or hurt by a change in prices . Second , the effect on the distribution of the national money income between various producers which is caused by changes in the relative product prices may itself now affect the demand for the various products . This may reduce or may magnify the price changes . It is not necessary to assume that each family receives its income from only one source , but merely that each family receives a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the share of those activities in the national average and receives a lower proportion of its income from some other activities than corresponds to the share of those activities in the national income .  | Thus suppose that as a result of a shift of demand the prices of X and of good substitutes for X go down whereas the prices of Y and of good substitutes for Y go up . The producers of the former group lose , and of the latter group gain , money income . If the former group has an exceptionally large income elasticity of demand for X and substitutes for X , while the latter group has an exceptionally large income elasticity of demand for Y and substitutes for Y , then the redistribution of money incomes will intensify the initial shift of demand away from the X-group of products on to the Y-group of products ; this will further intensify the shift of money incomes which will further intensify the shift of demand and the shift of prices , and so on . The price changes may now have to be much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distribution of incomes . In the opposite case , if the producers of the X-group of products have an exceptionally high income elasticity of demand for the Y-group of products , and vice versa , the price changes may be much less marked than they would have been in the absence of the effects on the redistribution of incomes . Price changes and the redistribution of incomes itself will now be moderate because those who gain in price spend more on those who have lost , while those who have lost cut back their demand for the products of those who have gained . Exactly the same sort of considerations must be borne in mind in the case of a change of relative prices due in the first instance to an increase in the supply of one product , X. We have already discussed in Chapter III ( pp. 61 and 67 ) the sort of changes in relative prices which this change may bring about in the absence of repercussions upon the distribution of money incomes . We must now bear in mind that ( i ) the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or down ) according as the money price of X has gone down less ( or more ) than in proportion to the increase in its supply and ( ii ) the money incomes of other producers will have gone down ( or up ) according as the prices for their products have gone down ( or up ) . These shifts in the distribution of money incomes must be considered from the two points of view which we have just examined . First , the final effects on the real standards of living of different groups will depend upon whether they produce the goods which have gone up or down in price and whether they consume the goods which have gone up or down in price . Second , the initial redistribution of money incomes may cause shifts in demand . These will intensify the initial changes in distribution , if those who have lost spend less on the products of those who have lost while those who have gained spend more on the products of those who have gained . The opposite pattern of demand will mitigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gainers would increase the demand for the products of the losers and vice versa . But if we assume that citizens are much more similar as consumers than as producers , we can concentrate our attention on the way in which the price changes which we have already examined in Chapter III are likely directly to affect the distribution of money incomes between the various groups in the economy . The further repercussions would be of secondary importance .  | In the last chapter we examined a case in which changes in the prices of the products might affect the distribution of income but not the outputs of the various products . In this chapter we will examine a case which gives exactly the opposite result : a change in the prices of the products may now affect the outputs of the various products but not the distribution of incomes . For this purpose let us assume : ( i ) that there is only one factor of production , namely , labour , all workers being equally skilled in all occupations . Alternatively we may assume that while there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such plentiful supply that there is no economic scarcity of them at all . Any producer can hire any amount of land which he wants at a zero or negligible rent . Labour is the only factor for which he must pay ; and ( ii ) that this factor , labour , can and does move freely and without cost from one occupation to another in search of the highest money reward , the other non-monetary advantages and disadvantages being the same for a worker in all occupations . Since we are assuming constant returns to scale ( assumption 7 on p. 27 ) , a given state of technical knowledge ( assumption 6 , p. 27 ) , a constant money national income ( assumption 10 , p. 28 ) , and a constant working population ( assumption 4 , p. 26 ) , we now have constant money costs of production for each product . With a constant money national income and a constant working population , we must have a constant money wage per worker equal to the money national income divided by the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move freely from lower to higher paid occupations until the wage earned is the same in every occupation ; and since there are no other factors of production wages will absorb the whole national income . With constant returns to scale and with given technical knowledge there will be a given and constant output per worker in each occupation , and thus the money cost of production of each product will be given and equal to the money wage rate of a worker divided by output per worker of that product . In a fully competitive equilibrium each product must be selling at its cost of production . If this were not so , producers would be moving  | in to produce more in those occupations in which the price of the product was above the money wage cost ; and they would be moving out of , and so reducing output in , those occupations in which the price of the product was below its cost of production . In these circumstances it is extremely easy to illustrate geometrically what would happen if there were only two products , X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of workers ' families , A , B , C , etc . Each worker receives the same money income which has a purchasing power over OaAa ( =ObAb = OA ) which is the output per worker of Y and over OaBa ( = ObBb = Ock ) which is the output per worker of X. For each worker receives the same money wage and the money price of each product is equal to its wage cost , so that each worker receives a wage which has a purchasing power over Y ( or X ) equal to a worker 's output of Y ( or X ) . The lines AB which are the same for each worker show the budgetconstraint line for each working class family . Each moves on its budget constraint line until it is purchasing at Q that combination of X and Y which brings it to its highest indifference curve . In Figure 23 we illustrate the situation in which family A has a high demand for Y , family B an intermediate demand for Y , and family C a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be OaCa + ObCb + and for X will be Ca Qa + CbQb + We can easily construct a picture for the whole economy from the individual pictures given in . Figure 23 . This is done in Figure 24 . The length OA measures the total amount of Y which the community could produce if all workers produced only Y , so that OA = OaAa + ObAb + OcAe + ... from Figure 23 . Similarly OB measures the total amount of X which the community could produce if all workers produced only X. The community can produce any  | combination of X and Y on the line AB . Each worker who moves from the production of Y to the production of X will reduce the output of Y by an amount equal to OaAa , and will increase the output of X by an amount equal to OaBa , in Figure 23 . OC in Figure 24 represents OaCa + ObCb + . . . of Figure 23 and shows the amount of Y which , given the needs and tastes of all the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CQ in Figure 24 equals the sum of CaQa + CbQb + of Figure 23 . It is now very easy to see what will be the result of a change of taste or of an increased supply of one of the products . Suppose first that in a given equilibrium situation tastes change and consumers demand more Y and less X. The immediate effect will be to drive up the money price of Y and to reduce the money price offered for X. But workers will then move from the production of X in which a loss is now made to that of Y which has now become exceptionally profitable . This will reduce the supply of X and raise the supply of Y until the previous price relationship which corresponds to costs of production has been restored . The final result will be simply that with the change of tastes some or all of the points Qa , Qb , Qc . . . move North-West up the lines AaBa , AbBb , A , B , , .. . in Figure 23 ; and , in correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q moves North-West up the community 's production possibility line AB in Figure 24 . The change of demand will ultimately have caused a change of outputs without any change in prices or in the distribution of income . The effects of a change in productivity is also easily illustrated on Figures 23 and 24 . Suppose that the output per head of X increases  | from OaBa to OaBa ' in Figure 23 . The cost and so , in any new equilibrium , the price of X falls in a corresponding proportion . The individual budget-constraint lines of Figure 23 and the production possibility line of Figure 24 all change in the same way : the length OA remains constant but the length OB increases in the ratio of the increased output per head of X to OB ' . Each individual family will now have the same money income as before and will be faced with the same money price for Y but p , lower money price of X. What happens to the demands for X and Y depends , therefore , simply on the price-consumption curves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above ) . In Figure 23 family A is assumed to have a price elasticity of demand for X ( numerically ) equal to one ; after the fall in price the same amount is spent on X as before ( AaCa = AQCa ) . Family B has a price elasticity of demand for X ( numerically ) greater than one ; more is spent on X after the fall in price ( AbCb #@# AbCb ) . Family C has an elasticity ( numerically ) less than one ( ACCC @#@ AcC ; ) . It is interesting to observe from Figure 23 that in the present case in which the increased output of X can have no effect on the distribution of money incomes or on the price of Y , every individual family must be benefited by the increased productivity in the production of X. Each family has the same income , the same price of Y , but a lower price of X in the Shops . Q ' is on a higher indifference curve than Q in every case in Figure 23 . This result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two chapters where particular families might be hurt by a fall in their money incomes or a rise in their cost of living resulting from increased productivity in one line of production . By summing up all individual demands shown in Figure 23 one can get , in the present case where there is no effect on the distribution of incomes or the price of Y , a straightforward community priceconsumption curve for X. This is shown in Figure 24 where CQ =-Ca Qa + CbQb + Cc Qc + ... and C'Q ' = COQ ; + CbQb + Cc Qc + .... The movement from Q to Q ' shows the movement in the community 's demand for X and Y when the national income and the price of Y remain unchanged but the price of X falls . Once again there is no change in the distribution of income ; prices are set at constant levels equal to costs of production ; and it is the supplies of the products X and Y which are adjusted by the flow of labour from unprofitable to profitable occupations until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be generalized to cover the case where there are many products , X , Y , Z , etc . Each worker as before has a money income equal to the money national income divided by the  | number of workers ; the cost of each product will be equal to the money wage rate divided by output per head of that product ; in competitive equilibrium supplies will shift until prices are equal to costs for all products ; supplies will thus have adjusted themselves to demands at given incomes and given money prices . Any shift of demand from one product to another will tend to raise the price of the latter and to lower the price of the former . But this will cause changes of supply until the final result is simply reduced output of the former and increased output of the latter sufficient to satisfy the new demands at the old unchanged prices . Any increase in output per head in any one occupation will cause a corresponding fall in the cost and , in competitive equilibrium , in the price of that product . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect will depend upon the price elasticity of demand for the product whose cost has fallen . If this elasticity is ( numerically ) greater than one , then more will be spent on this product and less on other products in general . But while less labour will in this case be devoted to the production of other products in general , nevertheless within this general group of other products there may be a particular product which is a complement to the product whose price has fallen and this particular complementary product may be in greater demand than before . In this case the production of some other products must have fallen still more markedly . If the price elasticity of demand for the product whose cost has fallen is ( numerically ) less than one , then less resources will be devoted to its production and more labour will be devoted to the production of other products in general . But this does not mean to say that each and every other product will be increased in supply . There may be a product or group of products which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen . These , being supplied at an unchanged cost , are likely to be bought in smaller amounts . This means that the output of some other products will go up all the more . But the fundamental conclusion for our present case is a very simple one . Prices will be set on the cost side by the technical productivity of labour in the various occupations . Whatever happens to changes in tastes or changes in productivity , there will be no permanent effect upon the distribution of incomes among the individual citizens ; but the outputs of the various products will be adjusted until the supply of each product is equal to the demand for it at given and unchanged individual money incomes and at prices equal to the technically given costs .  | In the last two chapters we have examined models in which either ( i ) the factors of production were so specialized in the production of particular products that a change in demand could cause no transfer of factors between different occupations , so that prices changed but outputs remained constant , or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all in the production of different products but could move so easily from one line of production to another that outputs changed without any change in prices . We shall now turn to the intermediate cases in which different factors can move between different lines of production but for one reason or another have certain partial advantages or disadvantages in particular lines of production . In these intermediate and more realistic cases a change of demand will , as we shall see , cause partly a change in prices and partly a change in outputs . There are many reasons why this intermediate situation may arise . In the first place suppose that labour were the only scarce factor of production , but that different men had different aptitudes . Mr A is a cobbler but could become a baker . Mr B is a baker but could become a cobbler . But productivity as a cobbler relatively to productivity as a baker may be higher in Mr A 's case than in Mr B 's case because of the different aptitudes of the two men . Consider the numerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only two products X and Y , that labour is the only scarce factor , but that each worker owing to his particular innate aptitudes has his own particular productivity in each line of production . Table III shows the position of Messrs A to K in the economy . Column ( i ) shows each worker 's daily output of X ; column ( ii ) shows his output of Y ; and column ( iii ) shows his output of Y relatively to his output of X. In Table III the workers are arranged in order according to the level of their productivity in Y relatively to their productivity in X. As we go down the table the figure in column ( iii ) rises continually . Which product each of these workers will choose to produce will depend upon the prices offered for products X and Y. Suppose that initially , as is illustrated in columns ( iv ) and ( v ) , the demands for X and Y were such that the price of X ( Ps ) were  | $1.5 and the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker whose productivity in Y was exactly 1+ times his productivity in X would be able to earn the same in either industry , since the shortfall in his productivity in X would be exactly balanced by the higher price offered for X. ( $1.50 = 1.5 x $1.0 ) . But any worker whose productivity in Y was less than 1+ times his productivity in X would choose to produce X , while any worker whose productivity in Y was more than 1- times his productivity in X would choose to produce Y. Looking down column ( iii ) we see that the dividing line will come between Mr F and Mr G. Messrs A to F will produce X and Messrs G to K will choose to produce Y , the total outputs of X and Y will thus be 118 and 123 units respectively ( column iv ) . The money incomes which each worker will now earn in his chosen occupation are shown in column ( v ) , being simply the output of each worker in his chosen occupation multiplied by the price of his output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds up to $300 . It is to be observed that the workers choose their jobs not according to their absolute advantages in producing X or Y , but according to their comparative advantages ' in their productivity in the two industries . Thus Mr G can produce an absolutely larger output of X ( 20 units ) than can either Mr C ( 16 units ) , Mr E ( 16 units ) or Mr F ( 12 units ) . Yet Mr G chooses to produce Y while Messrs C ,  | E , and F produce X. The point is that Mr G has an absolute advantage over Messrs C , E , and F in both lines of production , but he has a greater absolute advantage in producing Y than in producing X. It is column ( iii ) which measures the comparative , as contrasted with the absolute , advantage of each worker in producing Y rather than X ; and it is according to this scale that they will choose their jobs . Of course , those workers whose absolute productivity is high ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes . In column ( v ) it can be seen that Mr G earns $40 a week , while Messrs C , E , and F earn only $24 , $24 , and $18 a week respectively . Absolute productivity will affect the distribution of incomes ; comparative productivity will determine the allocation of jobs . Suppose now that there is a shift of demand from Y to X so that the price of X goes up and of Y goes down . Suppose ( column ( vi ) that this change in demand is such as to cause the price of X to become 21 instead of 11 the price of Y in the final equilibrium after any consequential changes in supplies of X and Y have occurred . Any worker whose productivity in Y is less than 22 times his productivity in X would now choose to produce X. The dividing line in column ( iii ) now comes between Messrs G and H instead of between Messrs F and G. The total output of Xis increased by 20 ( the output of Mr G in X ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the output of Mr G in Y ) . The total output of X thus goes up from 118 to 138 and of Y goes down from 123 to 83 ( column ( vi ) ) . If , as we are assuming , the total national money income remains unchanged at $300 , then the price of X must rise from $1.5 to $1.75 and the price of Y must fall from $1 to $0.70 ( approximately ) .1 We can then see what the new distribution of incomes between the individual workers will be by multiplying the outputs of each worker by the new price of his output . This is done in column ( vii ) . All those who were producing X before and after the change ( Messrs A to F inclusive ) will have gained in money income in the ratio of the rise in the price of X from $1.5 to $1.75 . All those who were producing Y before and after the change ( Messrs H to K inclusive ) will have lost in money income in the ratio of the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr G was threatened by a similar fall in his income ; but he was able to avoid the greater part of this fall by moving to the production of X in which , with the higher price of X relatively to Y , his comparative advantage now lies . His income falls only from 1 We know that in this case X = 138 and Y = 83 . For the national income to remain constant at $300 we must have 138 PX + 83 Py = 300 . Moreover , we are assuming x = 2.5 . From these two equations we have Ps = $1.7525 and y Py = $0.701.  | $40 to $35 . It would have fallen to $28 if he had stayed in his old job . We can see then that in this sort of case a rise in the demand for X relatively to that for Y will ( i ) cause some increase in the output of X and fall in the output of Y , ( ii ) cause some rise in the price of X and fall in the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income in favour of those whose comparative advantage in X is very marked at the expense of those whose comparative advantage in Y is very marked , and ( iv ) will enable those producers of Y whose comparative advantage in Y is not very marked to offset the threat to their incomes by moving across to the production of X. The movement of Mr G from the production of Y to that of X by increasing the output of X and reducing the output of Y will , of course , cause the prices of X to rise , and of Y to fall , by less than they would otherwise have done . Thus it helps not only to maintain Mr G 's personal income , but also to reduce the shift of income from the Messrs H to K to Messrs A to F. We have a case which is intermediate between those of Chapter IV and of Chapter V. This situation can be depicted geometrically as is done in Figure 25 . Let us start at the bottom of Table III . Let KZ = 5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and KW = 30 , the output of Y which Mr K could produce . Let JW = 5 , the output of X which Mr J could produce , and JU = 25 , the output of Y which Mr J could  | produce . And so on up the table . The result is that OZ measures the total amount of X that the community could produce if all workers concentrated on the production of X while OL represents the community 's output of Y if all workers produced only Y. The points W , U , T , S , etc. , represent other intermediate possible combinations of output . Thus W represents the case where Mr K alone moves from the production of X to that of Y so that the community , starting with an output solely of X of OZ , gives up KZ of X and acquires KW of Y. U represents the case where Mr K and Mr I have moved to the production of Y ; and so on . So far in Figure 25 , as throughout our discussion of Table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only at one job . On this assumption ( which may for institutional reasons be a realistic one ) the stepped line ZKWJUITHS , etc. , represents the best possible combinations of X and Y which can be produced . If everyone produces X we shall be at the point Z ; Mr K can then slacken off in the production of Z until we are at the point K ; he can then transfer to the production of Y and by exerting himself more and more in that line can move the output from K to W. And similarly up the stepped line for Messrs J , I , H , etc . But it would be more in keeping with our strict assumption that there are no indivisibilities or elements of lumpiness in the system ( assumption 7 on p. 27 ) to suppose that a worker can divide his time in any desired proportions between two or more jobs . For example , Mr K can spend of his time producing X and + of his time producing Y ; and so on . In this case Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the points along the step Z to K and K to W , but are spread along the straight line Z W. By spending + of his time on the production of X and of his time on the production of Y , he will produce + of KZ and I of KW ; his production point will be of the way up the straight line from Z to W. And similarly for Messrs J , I , H , G , etc . In this way the best possible combinations of output of X and Y for the community as a whole are shown by the kinked line ZWUTSR ... L. The relative prices of X and Y can be depicted by the slope of price lines in Figure 25 . Thus when the price of X is 11 times the price of Y ( Px = 1.5 ) , then one unit of X can be bought in the market for every 11 units of Y that are sold . This is depicted by a straight line sloping downwards from left to right with a slope of 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 along ( 1 unit of X gained ) . On Figure 25 three price lines with this slope are shown going through M , R , and W. Suppose Mr C were producing Y ; he would be producing CM of Y which would be worth only CN of X ; but he could  |p9393  produce CP of X , so that he would shift from the production of Y to that of X. Conversely , Mr J could produce JW of X which would be worth only JV of Y , while he could produce JU of Y , so that he would produce Y rather than X. The point R is clearly the critical dividing point with the price line PX P = 1.5 . Mr G will now produce Y , because he can produce an amount GR which , since the price line through R passes to the right of S , has a greater value in terms of X than GS , the amount of X which he could produce . Conversely , Mr F will produce FR of X which , since the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater value in terms of Y than the amount of Y ( FQ ) which he could produce himself . This point R is the combination of outputs which maximizes the national income at the current price ratio of PX P = 1.5 . This can be seen in the following way . Consider the point M. The community 's output of Xis OM " and of Yis M " M. But at the price slope ( P " = 1.5 ) passing through M , M " M of Y is worth M " M ' of X. Thus the value of the national income in terms of Xis OM " + M " M ' or OM ' . Similarly , the value in terms of X of the output combination W , at the price slope PX = 1.5 , is OW ' and of the output combination R is OR ' . The national income is maximized by moving along the kinked line ZWUTSRQ , etc. , until one comes to the price line which is farthest to the right . With the price slope Px @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price line passes to the right of S and above Q. With a price slope PX = 2.5 the point which reaches the price line farthest to the right is clearly S , where the price line with slope Pp ? : = 2.5 passes to the right of T and above R. The rise in the price of X relatively to the price of Y from 1.5 to 2.5 will have caused an increase in the output of X of GS and a fall in the output of Y of GR . But it might perhaps happen that when relatively little X and much Y is produced at R , the demand price for X relatively to the  | demand price for Y would be high , namely Px = 2.5 . Whereas when relatively much A ' and little Y is produced at S , the demand price for A ' relatively to the demand price for Y might be low , namely Pz P = 1.5 . In Figure 25 the broken price line X = 2.5 must be Dy Py imagined as passing through R and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both price lines being now regarded as part of the same demand curve . We can now see the importance of the assumption of divisibility of Mr G 's labour . Suppose Mr G had to spend all his time producing either Y or X. Then at R the price of X is high so that it pays to shift to S ; but at S the price of Y is high so that it pays to shift back to R. There would be a continual shift from R to S to R to S and so on . But suppose that Mr G can divide his working time between the productions of A ' and Y. He can now move partially from R toward S along the line RS . As he does so A ' becomes more plentiful relatively to Y and PX falls from 2.5 towards 1 5 . At some point on the journey of Mr G 's output from R to S the slope of the price line coincides with the slope of the straight line RS . At this point  | demand is equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margin of production ( namely the slope GS ) is the same as the slope of the demand price line Py . Even so we are not yet out of the wood . If the situation were as we have just described it , Mr G by deciding how much X and how much Y to produce could in fact affect the market prices of X and Y between the ratios P= 2.5 and Px = 1.5 . We should not be in a situation of perfect competition or of perfect potential competition ( as defined on pp. 30 ? 32 above ) , but in a monopolistic situation in which an individual decision-making unit ( in this case Mr G ) could affect appreciably the price of what he was deciding to put on the market . We can make competitive sense of Table III and Figure 25 only by assuming that A , B , C , etc. , do not stand for single individuals but for groups of individuals with competition between the individuals within each group . Thus group G contains a large number of individuals with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many units of Y as of X ) and a movement from R to S in Figure 25 now represents a shift of the labour of members of this group from the production of Y to that of X.1 This , of course , also makes much better sense of the assumption of divisibility of G 's labour between the productions of X and Y , since the movement from R to S can now take the form of the movement of individuals in group G rather than of the division of one man 's work between two occupations . But why should we asst me that there are a very large number of men divided into a small number ( A to K ) of discrete groups within each of which all members are identical in comparative productivities ? Why not simply assume that there are a very large number of men , no two of whom are exactly alike , but with very narrowly graded differences of comparative advantage in the two lines of production ? // would approximate very closely to a smooth curve of the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if a man could not divide his time between two jobs , the existence of a very large number of men would make the curve a smooth one for all practical purposes . The smooth line LRSZ of Figure 26 ( which is in fact a line with a vast number of tiny steps in it like ZKWJUI . . . L of Figure 25 ) 1 Columns ( v ) and ( vii ) of Table III then show the distribution of the national income between groups and not between individuals .  | shows the combinations of X and Y which it is possible to produce by transferring successively from the production of X to that of Y the workers which have the highest comparative advantage in the production of Y. This curve may be called the production possibility curve ' . Suppose we start at the point W with market prices of X and Y which give market price lines with the slope y . Then at W the slope of the production possibility curve is steeper than that of the market price line . The rate at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a unit of X is greater than the amount of Y that can be gained by any individual in the market producing X and selling it to purchase Y. The marginal worker will move from the production of X to that of Y. This process will go on until the point R is reached at which the production possibility curve is tangential to the highest market price line with the given slope y . The national income will be maximized in value at OR ' in terms of X or OR " in terms of Y. If as a result of a change in tastes the price of X rises relatively to that of Y so that the price line slope swings round from y to S , the combination S will be produced at which the slope of the production possibility curve is equal to 6 instead of y . The value of the national income will now be maximized at OS ' in terms of X or OS " in terms of Y. We can now think in terms of an elasticity of substitution in production between the products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparative advantages of different workers , a small change in the ratio of the price of X to the price of Y will cause a large shift of labour between the occupations and a large change in the ratio of the output of X to the output of Y. In this case we may say that the elasticity of substitution is large . We can define the elasticity of substitution between X and Y in production as the percentage increase in the ratio of X produced to Y produced that would be brought about by a one per cent increase in the ratio of the price of X to the price of Y. If a one per cent increase inPX caused a two ( or half of one ) per cent increase in y , then the elasticity of substitution between X and Y is +2 ( or +I ) . Now the ratio of y in Figure 26 is shown by the slopes of the lines and fi , while the price ratios are shown by the slopes of the lines y and S. If , therefore , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes a  | large percentage change in the slopes between a and then the elasticity of substitution is large . Chapters IV and V can now be seen to be two limiting extremes of the present case , the elasticity of substitution between X and Y being zero in the case of Chapter IV and infinite in the case of Chapter V. This can be seen in Figure 27 . If demand changes , the price slope changes from y to 8 , but the quantity slope remains unchanged at a/3 . The elasticity of substitution is zero . In case ( ii ) ( i.e. Chapter V ) the outputs are OL if all workers produce Y and OZ if all workers produce X , or any combination on the straight line LZ as the workers , with no differences in comparative advantages , move between the two industries . A shift of demand will cause the output combination to move from R to S and the quantity ratio slope to change from a to , 3 ; but there will be no permanent change in the relative prices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the constant cost of X in terms of Y , i.e. by the slope y or a of the production possibility line LZ . An infinitely small change in the price ratio will suffice to cause any given required change in the quantity ratio , and the elasticity of substitution between X and Y is infinite . We shall proceed in the next two chapters to give further models which will lead to production possibility curves of the intermediate kind shown in Figure 26.  | In Chapter IV we considered the case in which the factors of production were completely specialized on producing particular products . In Chapter V we examined the opposite extreme where there was a single factor of production which was completely unspecialized as between different occupations . In Chapter VI we examined one intermediate case in which the factors of production were not completely specialized but had certain comparative advantages in producing various products . In this chapter we shall examine another intermediate case in which there are two factors , one completely specialized and one completely unspecialized . Suppose then that ( i ) there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y ) , ( ii ) there are two factors of production , Labour ( L ) and Land ( N ) , every worker being the same as every other worker and every acre of land being the same as every other acre , ( iii ) Y is produced solely with L , but ( iv ) X needs for its production both L and N , i.e. Land is needed for Food production and only for Food production whereas Labour is required both for Food production and Clothing production . As far as the production of Y is concerned the situation is very simple . Since there are constant returns to scale and no changes in technical knowledge , there will be a fixed output of Y per worker employed in the Y industry . The output of Y will go up or down in direct proportion to changes in the amount of labour employed in the Y-industry . The position in the production of X is , however , now more complicated . The fixed amount of land in the economy has no usefulness except in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available for the production of X. The output of X will vary with the amount of labour left over from the production of Y and available , therefore , to be used with the fixed amount of land to produce X. We are now confronted with the phenomenon of diminishing returns to a single factor ' . When there is little labour employed on the land , an additional worker will be able to add a lot to the output .  | But as more and more labour is employed on the same amount of land , the amount which can be added to the output by employing yet one more worker will become smaller and smaller . On any given acreage only the most important and productive jobs will be done if labour is scarce ; further workers will be set to do the next most important and productive jobs ; and so on , until the farm is so crowded that an additional worker could add little or nothing to total output and might indeed simply get in the way of the other workers . We define the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output of X divided by the number of workers employed , i.e. the output per head . We define the marginal product ' of the workers employed in farming as the addition to the total output of X which would be caused by employing one more worker on the constant acreage of land . The proposition which we are making is that as the total amount of labour employed on a given acreage of land increases , so the marginal product of labour in agriculture will fall . Each successive addition to the labour force will add a smaller amount to the output . We can see at once that the shape of the production possibility curve relating the economy 's outputs of X and Y will be of the general shape shown in Figure 26 of the last chapter . In Figure 28 we measure the amount of Y produced up the vertical axis and the amount of X produced to the right along the horizontal axis . If all labour were employed in producing Y , an amount of Y equal to OA  | could be produced . Suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The output of Y falls by AB and of X rises by BC . If a second worker is transferred , the output of Y falls by the same amount ( CD = AB ) because output per head in Y is constant ; but the output of X rises by a smaller amount than before ( DE @#@ BC ) because of the falling marginal product of labour in X. The transfer of a third worker will decrease the output of Y by the same amount again ( EF = CD = AB ) but will increase the output of X by yet a smaller amount ( FG @#@ DE @#@ BC ) . And so on until all workers have been transferred from Y-production to Xproduction . If there are a large number of workers so that the steps AB , CD , EF , etc. , are each a very small part of the total distance OA , then the stepped line ABCDEFG , etc. , will approximate very closely to a smooth curve of the kind A'Z ' shown in Figure 28 ( ii ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding point G ' on ( ii ) . FG is the amount of X which must be given up to produce EF more of Y , while HI is the additional amount of X that can be obtained by giving up an amount HG ( = EF ) of Y. Where the number of steps is very large the line EGI will be practically a straight line because FG will be very little larger than HI . The slope of this line will show the rate of substitution between X and Y at the point G , i.e. EF or HG which will be practically the same will measure the amount of X which can be obtained for a unit of Y if the production combination at G is being produced . This slope is equal to the slope of tangent to the curve A'Z ' at the point G ' in Figure 28 ( ii ) . NM measures the output of X which can be gained ( or must be sacrificed ) for the sacrifice ( or the gain ) of a unit of production of Y if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of X. We have so far considered the interconnection between the production of X and the production of Y. Let us now consider the market mechanisms which will determine the prices of X and of Y and the wage of labour and the rent of land in this economy . As far as the price of Y and the wage rate of labour is concerned , there is a very simple interrelationship . The output per head in Y production is constant and no other factor is involved . Suppose 1 worker can produce 2 units of Y. Then if the price of Y is $1 the wage of labour must be $2 . If the wage of labour were less than $2 , Ywould be selling at a price which was above its costs of production ;  | more workers would be attracted into the production of Y. If the wage of labour were greater than $2 , then Y-production would be unprofitable and the labour employed in Y-production would be reduced . The position in the X-industry is more complicated . Let us suppose that there are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land and each acting as an entrepreneur farmer , hiring labour at the current wage rate to work on his acreage to produce X. How much labour will each landlord hire at the current wage rate to produce X to sell at the current price of X ? Each landlord will add to his profit by taking on one more unit of labour if the wage of labour is less than the price at which he can sell the marginal product of labour on his farm . For in that case he will add to his costs the wage of an additional worker which is less than what he adds to his receipts , namely the price at which he can sell the additional product due to taking on the one extra worker . Conversely , he will add to his profit by dismissing one worker if the wage ( which he saves ) is greater than the price of the marginal product of a worker ( which he no longer receives as revenue ) . He will maximize his profit at the point at which the wage rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour . The position is illustrated numerically in Table IV . In column ( i ) and ( ii ) we have a description of the total output of X which our landlord-farmer can produce on his given acreage of land with various labour forces . Column ( iii ) is derived from column ( ii ) by showing the addition to the output of column ( ii ) which is caused by taking on one more unit of labour . Thus 4 men produce 340 units , and 5 men 400 units of X ( column ( ii ) ) ; in other words adding  | a 5th worker adds 60 units to output which is shown as the marginal product of the 5th worker in column ( iii ) . The figures are so chosen that the marginal product of labour in column ( iii ) falls as more workers are employed . The average product of labour ( column iv ) is simply the total output of column ( ii ) divided by the total number of workers of column ( i ) . This average product ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marginal product are the same ) is always greater than the marginal product of column ( iii ) , because the average product takes into account , as it were , the high productivity of the first workers as well as the low productivity of the last worker , whose output measures the marginal product of labour . How many men this landlord-farmer will employ depends upon the relationship between the money wage rate and the money price that can be received for selling X. If the wage of labour were 50 times as great as the price of X , then the landlord-farmer would take on 6 men , since ( column iii ) up to that point the value of the marginal product would be above the wage rate of labour and after that point it would be below it . Paying 6 men each a wage which was worth 50 units of X , he would be paying out a wage bill worth 300 units of X ( column v ) . Since the total output of 6 men is 450 units ( column ii ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rent for the landlord of 150 units of X ( column vi ) . If the wage rate were reduced or the price of X were raised , so that the wage rate was worth only 30 units of X , the landlord would employ 8 instead of 6 men . The wage bill would fall from 300 to 240 ; the landlord 's price elasticity of demand for labour is ( numerically ) less than one , since he pays a smaller total amount of X for a larger quantity of labour at a lower price of labour in terms of X. The rent would rise from 150 to 280 . The reaction of our present model to a change of demand will be as follows . Suppose we start in equilibrium with a certain money wage rate . The price of Y must then be equal to the cost of producing Y at this wage rate . A certain amount of labour will be employed on the given amount of land to produce a given amount of X. For this to be an equilibrium output the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marginal product of the labour employed in Xproduction equal to the money wage rate . This , in accordance with the principles shown in Table IV , will leave a certain rent over for the landlords equal to the difference between the average and the marginal product of the labour force . If the workers ' and the landlords ' tastes and needs are such that , at these wage incomes and rent incomes and at these prices of X and Y , they demand X and Y in the amounts produced , the system is in equilibrium .  | Suppose now that their tastes shift and they demand at current incomes and prices more X and less Y. The price of Y and so the money wage rate earned in Y production will fall ; the price of X will rise ; as a result of the fall in the money wage rate and the rise in the price of X labour will shift into the production of X until the marginal product of labour there has fallen so as to compensate for the fall in the wage rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the principle illustrated in Table IV landlords ' rents will go up in terms of X and , since the price of Y has fallen and of X has risen , they will a fortiori have gone up in terms of Y. In money terms , if the money national income is constant , money wages will have gone down and money rents will have gone up by the same amounts . The price and output of X will have gone up and the price and output of Y will have gone down . These changes can be illustrated geometrically in Figure 28 . Without any loss of generality we can assume that in Y-production 1 worker produces 1 unit of Y ; we are simply defining a unit of Y as that amount of Y which can be produced by 1 worker . We can then measure up the vertical axis in Figure 28 either units of Y or units of L ; there is a one to one relationship between them . Suppose now that we start in equilibrium at the point G ' in Figure 28 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being employed to produce O 'M units of Y. The remaining available labour is MA ' ( since O'A ' is the total amount of Y that could be produced , O'A ' must measure the total supply of labour ) . The labour MA ' is employed in the X-industry to produce MG ' units of X. Output per head in the X-industry is thus MA ' or the slope of the line A'G ' . The marginal product of labour in the X-industry is , however , less than this , namely MN or the slope of the tangent at G ' to the curve A'Z ' . This slope represents ( cf. EF in Figure 28 ( i ) ) the amount of X that can be gained by shifting one unit of labour out of the Y-industry into the X-industry . Of the total output of X equal to MG ' an amount equal to G'Q is , therefore , paid in wages in the X-industry ; A 'M ( = PQ ) is the amount of labour employed in the X-industry and MN ( = QQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the wage bill in the X-industry is , therefore , A 'M x MG ' = PQ x QQ = QG ' . The  | remaining output of X , namely MQ is the rent left over to the landlords . We can also see from Figure 28 ( ii ) the distribution of the total national income between wages and rents . Let us measure both wages and rents in terms of Y. Then total wages equals O'A ' ; for this is the total labour force and in equilibrium the wage rate of labour in terms of Y must be its output of Y , namely 1 unit of Y. A'N represents the value of rents in terms of Y ; for A'P ( = MQ ) is the total of rents in terms of X and the slope A'P v= MG ' ) represents the rate at which Y can be obtained for X in the market . Thus the ratio of wages to rents is A'N ' If the demand for X increases , so that the output combination moves from G ' to K , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour and of Y in terms of X falls from the slope of the line NG ' to that of the line EK ; and the ratio of wages to rents falls from A'N to A ' R.  | In the last chapter we examined a model in which in one industry ( Y ) only one factor ( L ) was used , whereas in the other industry ( X ) two factors ( L and N ) were used . This is a special case of a more general phenomenon which we shall examine in this chapter , namely the case in which the proportions in which the two factors are employed is different in the two industries . Suppose then that ( i ) there are two factors , land ( N ) and labour ( L ) , ( ii ) there are two industries , one producing Food ( X ) and one Clothing ( Y ) , ( iii ) each industry employs some Land and some Labour , but ( iv ) at any relevant wage rate and rate of rent the industry producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the industry producing Clothing . We must now imagine certain persons acting as entrepreneurs and organizing competing Firms to produce Clothing or competing Farms to produce Food . These persons may be workers or landowners ; but the amount of labour or land employed in any one firm or farm in no way depends upon the amount of labour or land belonging to the entrepreneur himself . Any entrepreneur can take on more land or labour for his firm or farm by hiring it at the current competitive rent or wage rate , and any entrepreneur can hire out at the current market rent or wage rate any of his own land or labour which he does not wish to employ in his own firm or farm . In our perfectly competitive , stationary economy with constant returns to scale and no changes in technical knowledge there is no risk or uncertainty when equilibrium has been reached . Entrepreneurs will in fact then have a trivially easy job . Anyone can become an entrepreneur if entrepreneurs are earning more than the current wage rate and rate of rent on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being an entrepreneur if entrepreneurs are receiving less than the market return on their own labour and  | land . In equilibrium entrepreneurs will receive nothing for being entrepreneurs . Wages and rents make up the only costs of production of X and Y. If we were to allow for growth , change , risk , uncertainty , economies of large-scale production , and imperfect competition the function of entrepreneurship would become of great importance ; but in this volume we can forget about it . We have already explained ( Chapter I , pp. 30 ? 32 ) that with our present assumptions it makes no difference whether in the production of clothing ( or of food ) there is a single entrepreneur running a single firm ( or farm ) and subject to perfect potential competition or whether there is a large number of entrepreneurs running a large number of firms ( or farms ) which are actually in competition with each other . We imagine then a farmer or farmers hiring labour and land at the current market rates of wage and of rent to produce X for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manufacturer or manufacturers hiring labour and land at current wage and rent rates to produce and sell Y at the current price of Y. In each case the entrepreneur takes as beyond his own control the market prices of the factors he buys and of the products he sells . We must now consider the marginal product of either factor in terms of either product . The marginal product of labour in terms of X , for example , is the amount of X that would be added to the existing output of X if a farmer took on one more worker on the existing acreage of land . The marginal product of land in terms of X , on the other hand , is the amount of X that would be added to the existing output of X if a farmer took on one more acre of land to be worked by the existing farm labour force . Similarly , there is a marginal product of labour in terms of Y and a marginal product of land in terms of Y. We may assume that the marginal product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labour already employed per acre . For additional workers will be put on to the successively less productive jobs as they are employed on the same amount of land . We can similarly assume that the marginal product of land in farming is the smaller the larger is the amount of acreage on which a given labour force is already employed . If the density of labour per acre is very high , the additional product due to taking on one more acre is very great ; but if the density of labour per acre is very low , not much can be added to output by taking on one more acre of land . In fact with our assumption of constant returns to scale the marginal products of labour and land in agriculture will depend solely upon the ratio of labour to land already employed in agriculture . If the numbers employed per acre are already very high , not much more can be added to output by taking on one more man ;  | but a lot can be added to output by taking on one more acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much can be added to output by taking on more labour but not much can be added by taking on yet another additional acre . We can describe this same phenomenon in different language . A farmer takes on land and labour to produce an output of X. This given output of X he can still produce if he takes on more labour and less land . In other words in his productive process he can substitute labour for land . But the more labour he takes on and the less land he takes on the more difficult will it become to produce the same output on an even smaller acreage . As he increases the ratio of labour to land on his farm , the amount of labour that will have to be substituted for an acre of land will become greater and greater . The marginal importance of land ( which is becoming scarce ) will grow relatively to the marginal importance of labour ( which is becoming plentiful ) . As the ratio of labour to land grows , the marginal product of labour falls and of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken on to make up for the loss of yet another acre . These relationships are true in industry as well as in agriculture . In the production of Y the marginal product of L will fall and the marginal product of N will rise as the ratio of L to N employed in the firm rises . The difficulty of substituting yet more L for the loss of one more unit of N will grow as the ratio of L to N rises . Each entrepreneur in each industry in an effort to maximize his own income will take on more labour to employ with the existing amount of land in his firm or farm so long as the wage rate of labour ( which he will thereby add to his costs ) is lower than the market price at which he can sell the marginal product of labour ( which he will thereby add to his receipts ) . Conversely , he will dismiss labour if the wage rate which he will save is greater than the market price which he no longer receives for the marginal product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wage rate in each industry should be equal to the value of the marginal product of labour in each industry . Similarly competitive equilibrium requires that the rate of rent in each industry should be equal to the value of the marginal product of land in each industry . Only in these conditions will no entrepreneur have any incentive to adjust the amount of labour or land marginally in his enterprise . But competitive equilibrium also requires that no entrepreneur in any undertaking should be making a net profit or loss . If his total receipts exceeded his total costs , new entrepreneurs would come in to the industry to expand output by taking on more labour and land to produce more of the output . If total costs exceeded total receipts ,  | entrepreneurs already in the industry would be closing down their businesses . We are , therefore , faced with an apparent puzzle . The conditions mentioned in the previous paragraph told us that each factor of production must be paid a reward equal to the value of its marginal product ; the conditions mentioned in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factors must be equal to the total amount received by the sale of the product . Is there any reason to believe that these two conditions are compatible , that is to say that the total amount received from the sale of output will be just enough ( neither too much nor too little ) to pay to each factor a reward equal to the value of its marginal product ? The answer is that in conditions of constant returns to scale this will necessarily be so . This proposition is illustrated in Table V. Consider the position in a particular farm which is shown in that table . The farmer is in situation I employing 100 units of L and 100 units of N to produce 100 units of X. Since there are constant returns to scale , by increasing both L and N by 1 per cent to 101 he would also increase his output by 1 per cent to 101 ( situation III ) . Suppose , however , that starting in situation I he increases his employment of N by one unit without increasing his employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in situation II will be intermediate between the outputs of situations I and III ; in Table V we assume it to be 100* . We can now see that we have by implication assumed that the marginal product of N is 4 since between situations I and II , the amount of L being unchanged , an increase of 1 unit in N has caused X to rise by 4 of a unit . But by comparing situations II and III we can now see that our assumptions necessarily imply that the marginal product of L is a ; for between these two situations the amount of N is constant and an increase of L by 1 unit has caused the output of X to go up from 1004 to 101 , i.e. by 4 of a unit of X. If now in situation I we pay each of the 100 units of L a wage rate equal to the  | value of its marginal product , we shall pay in wages the value of 100 x i = 75 units of X. If similarly we pay each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its marginal product , we shall pay in rents the value of 100 x a = 25 units of X. Wages of 75 plus rents of 25 add up to 100 , which is exactly equal to the total available output . With constant returns to scale the payment of a reward to each factor exactly equal to the value of its marginal product will absorb exactly the total output , neither less nor more . ' We can now consider the general properties of our present simple two-factor two-product economy . In equilibrium the given money income of the community is spent on certain outputs of X and Y at certain prices of X and Y. At these outputs , prices , and money income consumers are satisfied . Labour and land are allocated between the two industries in such a way as to produce these outputs . The money wage rate of labour is the same in both industries and is equal to the value of the marginal product of labour in each industry ; and similarly for the money rate of rent per acre of land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at the existing incomes of wage earners and landlords and at the existing prices of X and Y $100 more is spent on Y and $100 less on X. If the ratio of labour to land employed in the production of Y were the same as that in X , all that would happen would be that more Y and less X would be produced without any change in the prices of X and Y or in the distribution of the national income between wages and rents . We would be in the situation examined in Chapter V. Suppose that in both X and Y 40 per cent of the cost are rents of land and 60 per cent wages of labour . The reduction of $100 in expenditure on Xwould represent indirectly a $40 reduction in the demand for the use of land and a $60 reduction in the demand for labour , the increase of $100 in expenditure on Y would represent indirectly a $40 increase in the demand for the use of land and a $60 increase in the demand for labour . Land and labour would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , and the output of X would fall by $100 and of Y would increase by $100 without any change in the prices of Y or X and without any change in the money wage rate or rate of rent . The arithmetical argument from Table V. is not in fact a strict one . What Table V shows is a case in which the marginal product of land in situation I is 1 ' and the marginal product of labour in situation II is + . But will labour in situation I be paid a wage equal to the value of its marginal product in situation II ? The demonstration in the text relies upon the implicit assumption that this will be so . In fact by taking sufficiently small units of L and N the difference between the ratio of L to Nin situations I and II can be made so small that the difference between the marginal products of labour in situation I and situation 1I becomes negligible .  | But the story is very different if there are differences in the ratio of land to labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and little labour is needed because of the technical nature of food production , whereas in manufactures little land and much labour is needed because of the technical nature of clothing production . For example , suppose that the ratio of rents to wages in X production in the initial equilibrium is 60:40 , whereas in Y production it is 20:80 . Then at current prices a shift of demand of $100 from X to Y represents indirectly a decrease of $60 in demand for land in X and an increase of $20 in demand for land in Y ? a net fall in the demand for land of $40 ( $60-$20 ) at the current rent per acre . The shift in demand also means at the current wage rate an increased demand for labour of $80 in the Y-industry and a decreased demand of $40 in the X-industry ? a net increase in the demand for labour of $40 . The shift of demand of $100 from the land-intensive product X to the labour-intensive product Y will have caused indirectly a shift of demand of $40 from land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages and rents be an excess demand for labour and an excess supply of land . The money wage rate will rise and the money rate of rent will fall . The money cost of X will fall and the money cost of Y will rise . ' Thus in competition the price of X will fall and the price of Y will rise . If there were no technical possibility of substituting cheaper land for more expensive labour in either industry , this change of prices of X and Y would go on without any change in the amounts produced until the price of X had so risen that consumers were content once more to go on consuming the unchanged amounts of X and Y. We should be in the situation of Chapter IV where a shift of demand causes a change in prices and in the distribution of income but no change in outputs . The reason is clear . As long as any less X and any more Y were produced there would be some unemployed land . For a reduction in the output of X releases a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in the output of Y absorbs only a small amount of land with each additional worker employed . But as long as some land were unused , landlords in competition with each other would reduce the rent charged per acre of land . The cost and the 1 Consider some notional intermediate product Z which is produced with the national average ratio of land to labour . When , with a given total supply of L and N , the wage rate goes up and the rate of rent goes down in such a way that a constant money national income is redistributed in favour of L , then the cost of the notional product Z will go neither up nor down . In its case the rise in labour cost will be exactly offset by the fall in rent cost . Any product ( like Y ) which is produced with a higher ratio of L to N will experience some net rise in cost . Conversely X will experience some net fall in cost .  | price of X would thus continue to fall relatively to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to X to an extent sufficient to take up the old initial outputs of X and Y.1 The position would be an intermediate one if it were possible in either X or Y or in both industries to substitute the cheaper N for the more expensive L as the money rent per acre fell and the money wage rate rose . In this case in one or both industries a higher ratio of land to labour will be used than was initially the case . The contraction of agriculture will be more largely through the dismissal of expensive labour and/or the expansion of manufactures will be more markedly through the absorption of cheap land . The possibilities of substitution may well be much greater in one industry than another . For example , in agriculture it may be possible to farm very intensively ( as in the Netherlands ) if land is very expensive relatively to labour or to farm very extensively ( as on the Canadian prairies ) if land is very cheap relatively to labour . On the other hand , in manufactures a rather fixed ratio of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factors . This does not affect the main outcome of the process . Whether it be in the X-industry or the Y-industry does not matter so long as when the price of land falls and of labour rises more land per worker can be used somewhere in the economy . This will enable the output of labour-intensive Y to be increased and of land-intensive X to be decreased without any unemployed land being left unabsorbed into the economy . The greater is the ease of substitution between L and N in X and in Y , the less will be the rise in the wage rate and the fall in the rate of rent required to reabsorb all factors into employment , and the less , therefore , will be the rise in the cost of labour-intensive Y and the fall in the cost of labour-intensive X. We have then again the intermediate case of Chapters VI and VII . A shift of demand from X to Y will cause some fall in the price of X , some fall in the output of X , some rise in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Y. Prices will change much and outputs little if ( i ) there are great initial differences in the factor proportions employed in X and in Y , ( ii ) it is technically difficult for X to contract by releasing what are for it abnormally large amounts of the expensive factor L , and ( iii ) it is technically difficult for Y to expand by taking on what are for it abnormally large amounts of the cheap factor N. The argument of this chapter can be expressed more precisely in geometrical terms . Let us first consider one of our industries , the production of X with the two factors L and N. The relationship 1 Or until rents were zero and labour had become the only scarce factor ( cf. Chapter XI , pp. 160-5 below ) .  | between the inputs of the factors ( L and N ) and the output of the product ( X ) is illustrated in Figure 29 . Along the horizontal axis we measure the amount of L , and up the vertical axis the amount of N , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then shows the combinations of L and N which are necessary to produce 100 units of X. This curve slopes down from left to right because , if one has less N , one must have more L in order to produce the same amount of X. The downward slope of the curve becomes gentler and gentler as one moves along it to the right , because the higher the existing ratio of men per acre the more difficult it will become to produce the same output with yet more men and less land ; the rate at which employment of labour must be increased to make up for the loss of yet one more acre becomes greater and greater as methods become more and more labour-intensive and less and less land intensive . At the point Q OD labour and DQ land are used to produce 100 units of X. The slope of the line a , namely OD measures the ratio of land to labour used in production . The slope of the curve X = 100 at Q namely OB , represents the amount of land that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the margin without changing the total output of X. There will be whole series of curves such as X = 100 , X =150 , X = 200 , etc. , each of which shows the combinations of L and N needed to produce the stated output of X. These curves may be  | called equi-product curves ' . With constant returns to scale once one has drawn one of the curves ( e.g. X = 100 ) one can readily derive all the other curves , so that in fact all the production relationships are given by a single equi-product curve of the kind shown on Figure 29 . Consider the line OQRP . It passes through the curve X = 100 at the point Q. Measure along the line OQ extended a length OR , such that OR = 1-f times OQ . Then the equi-product curve X = 150 must pass through R ; for at R both L and N are 11 times as great as at Q ; and since there are constant returns to scale a 50 per cent increase in both L and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly if we draw OP equal to twice OQ , the equiproduct curve X = 200 will pass through P. Figure 29 also illustrates a second basic feature of these equiproduct curves in conditions of constant returns to scale . Draw any other straight line through 0 such as the line 13 and let it cut the curve X = 100 at Q ' . Draw OR ' = 11 times OQ ' and OP ' = 2 times OQ ' . Then by the process of reasoning used in the last paragraph the equi-product curve X = 150 will pass through R ' and the equiproduct curve X = 200 will pass through P ' . Join QQ ' , RR ' , and PP ' . These three lines will be parallel to each other . Thus OR = 12 times OQ and OR ' = 11 OQ ' so that the triangle QOQ ' will correspond in all its angles to the triangle ROR ' . The slopes of QQ ' , RR ' , and PP ' are therefore all equal . Now let the line /3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The slope of QQ ' becomes closer and closer to the slope of the line AB , namely the tangent to the curve X = 100 at Q. Similarly , the slopes of RR ' and PP ' become closer and closer to the slopes of the tangents of X = 150 at R and X = 200 at P respectively . In the limit as /3 comes to coincide with a , the slopes of QQ ' , RR ' , and PP ' which remain equal to each other , coincide with the tangent of the equi-product curves at Q , R , and P. In other words the marginal rate of substitution between L and N is the same at Q , R , and P. As one moves out from O along a straight line such as a , ( i ) one passes through successive equi-product curves the numbering of which ( i.e. the output of X ) is directly proportional to the distance from 0 and ( ii ) the slope of the equi-product curves remains constant along the line a . The marginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratio of L to N. The higher the ratio of N the greater the marginal rate at which L must be taken on to make up for one unit of N. The slopes of the tangents at Q ' , R ' , and P ' will be equal to each other and the slopes of the tangents at Q , R , and P will be equal to each other . But the former will be gentler than the latter .  | The equi-product curves can be used to show what ratio of labour to land it will be profitable for a farmer to employ given the wage of labour and the rent of land . This is done in Figure 30 . Suppose the wage rate of labour and the rent of land were such that $100 a month would hire OB men or OA acres . Then with $100 the entrepreneur could hire any combination of L and N on the budget constraint line AB . As he hired less land and more labour and moved from A to C to D to E his output rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moved from E to F to G to B his output falls . For $100 worth of factors at existing prices E is the point which gives him the maximum output . Alternatively we can ask what combination of L and N at these given prices will enable him to produce a given output at the lowest cost . Consider the equi-product curve marked ; V. To produce this with combinations of L and N at D or F will cost him $100 ? he is on the line AB . To produce it with the combination at H will cost him less ? he will be on the line A'B ' . Clearly with the relative prices of L and N shown by the slope of the lines AB , A'B ' , etc. , in Figure 30 he will produce with a combination of L and N given by the slope of a . Because of the properties of constant returns to scale which we have just examined , we thus know that if the relative prices of L and N are such as to give a slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? whatever his scale of operations may be ? he will operate somewhere on the line a , i.e. his ratio of labour to land employed  | will be DQ , because it is only on this line that the tangents of the equi-product curves will have the same slope as AB . Similarly , if the price of labour fell and/or the price of land rose so that the relative prices of labour and land were represented by the slope of the line A'B ' in Figure 29 , he would operate on the line /3 , whatever the scale of his operations might be . We have thus a straightforward and unambiguous measure of the elasticity of substitution between L and N. It is equal to the percentage change in the ratio of land to labour employed which will be caused by a one per cent change in the ratio of the rate of rent to the rate of wages . It is ( numerically ) large if a small proportionate change in the slope of the line AB causes a large percentage change in the slope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of labour relatively to the price of land , causes a large rise in employment per acre , then the elasticity of substitution between land and labour is ( numerically ) large . ( Cf. pp. 47 ? 50 above . ) Figure 30 gives a complete description of the production relationships in industry X. We can deduce from it that the marginal product of labour falls as more labour is used with a given amount of land . This is shown in Figure 31 . In that figure we draw equi-product curves for three outputs of X , namely 100 , 101 , and 102 units of X.t Draw any line through the origin 0 to cut these curves at Q , R , and P and draw a horizontal line through R to cut the curves at H , R , and  | K. Draw the tangents at Q and P to cut the horizontal straight line at G and J. Now QR = RP and the slope of GQ = the slope of PJ because of constant returns to scale . It follows that GR = RJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant amount of N ( the height of the horizontal line GK ) a smaller additional amount of labour ( HR ) is needed to raise output from 100 to 101 than is needed ( RK ) to raise output from 101 to 102 . The marginal product of labour will be falling . In the present case of processes in which only two factors ( L and N ) are used to produce only one product ( X or Y ) the productive relationship in any one process can be completely specified in a diagram of the kind used in Figures 30 and 31 . Nevertheless even in this case it is useful for some purposes to transform this diagram into one of another kind which is shown in Figure 32 . In Figure 32 we measure along the horizontal axis the amount of one of the factors used ( e.g. L ) and up the vertical axis the amount of the product produced . Suppose that in Figures 31 OC represents 100 units of N. Then by measuring successive amounts of L along CK ( namely CG , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) we could read off from the equi-product curves the successive amounts of X which would be produced by larger and larger amounts of L , keeping N = 100 . We should obtain a curve of the kind marked N = 100 in Figure 32 . The slope of the line OQ , namely D , represents output per head  | or the average product of labour . The slope of the curve N = 100 at the point Q ( namely the tangent CQ ) measures what maybe called the marginal rate of transformation ' between the input L and the output X with the amount of the other input N given and constant at 100 . This marginal rate of transformation can be thought of in either of two ways . If we consider the additional amount of L needed to produce 1 more unit of X , we may think of it as measuring the marginal cost of X in terms of L. If we consider the additional amount of X that would be produced by taking on one more unit of L , we may think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of X. Since the marginal product of labour falls as one employs more and more labour with the given amount of land , the N = 100 curve in Figure 32 has been drawn with a gentler and gentler slope as one moves to the right . The marginal rate of transformation between L and X diminishes as one increases L and X. There will be a whole family of N-curves . If N rises from 100 to 150 , then any given amount of L will produce more X. The N = 150 curve is above the N = 100 . With constant returns to scale one can plot the relationship between the N = 100 and any other N-curve in the following way . Extend OQ and measure OQ ' = 1-f OQ . Then the point Q ' lies on the N = 150 curve ; for at Q ' there is 50 per cent more L and 50 per cent more X than at Q ; but with constant returns to scale to produce 50 per cent more output with 50 per cent more labour one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , draw any other straight line 13 through 0 to cut N = 100 at R ; extend OR to R ' so that OR ' = 1f OR ; then by a similar process of reasoning R ' must lie on the curve N = 150 . Join QR and Q'R ' . These two lines are parallel because the triangles OQR and OQ'R ' have similar angles . Let P swing round in the direction of the arrow to approach a . The slope of QR approaches the slope of the tangent to N = 100 at Q ( namely CQ ) and the slope of Q'R ' approaches the slope of the tangent to N =-150 at Q ' . In other words on any straight line such as a the marginal products of labour will be the same . On such a line , as we have just seen , the ratio of labour to land is unchanged ( both have grown by 50 per cent between Q and Q ' ) . The marginal product of labour will depend therefore solely on the ratio of labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Q and Q ' ) the marginal product of labour is high ( the slope of the tangents are steep ) ; when the ratio of labour to land is high ( as at R and R ' ) the marginal product of labour is low  | ( the slope of the tangents are gentle ) . The marginal product of labour will be raised by an increase in the amount of land or by a decrease in the amount of labour in use . We can use a construction of the kind shown in Figure 32 to show how much labour a farmer will employ with a given amount of land to maximize his profit given the wage rate of labour and the price of his product . This is shown in Figure 33 . Suppose that the price of the product X and the wage of labour were such that HB units of X had the same value as BE units of labour . Then one could draw a series of parallel straight lines such as HG and AD having the slope B B. These could be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G on the line HG . A farmer who had an output of X equal to OC would use CH of it to hire an amount of labour CG ( since HB will hire BE , HC will hire CG ) ; and he would have left over a profit in terms of X equal to his output CO less his wage bill CH . In other words starting from any level of employment giving any level of output ( such as the point G ) , one can draw through the point G a line having a slope equal to the real wage rate BE ) ? Where this line cuts the axis OX at the point H , HC will equal the total wage bill and HO the total gross profit ' left over for rent on land . Thus all points on the line HG represent a gross profit ' equal  | in value to HO units of X ; and all points on the line AD represent a gross profit ' equal in value to OA units of X. Suppose that our farmer has 150 units of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will produce OB and make a profit of OH . But at this point the marginal product of labour in terms of Xis greater than the real wage of labour in terms of X ( the tangent of the N = 150 curve at E is steeper than the slope of the line HG ) . If he employs more labour and moves up the N curve to D , he will increase his gross profit ( i.e. revenue less wage bill ) to AO . Clearly with a given amount of land of 150 he will choose the point D at which his N = 150 curve is tangential to the highest equi-profit line , AD . One can put the maximizing problem round the other way . Consider on the line HG different ways of making the same gross profit HO . This can be made at E and G with 150 units of land or at F with 100 units of land . The gross profit per acre will be that much higher at F than at E or G. To maximize profit per acre with a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F where the equiprofit line HG is tangential to the lowest N-curve . All points of equilibrium will thus be on the line OD when the real wage rate of labour has the slope of HG ( = slope of AD ) . When the real wage rate falls it will pay to employ more labour with a given amount of land until the marginal product of labour has fallen to the lower real wage rate . When the real wage rate falls from the slope of HF to that of H'F , a farmer with 100 units of N will move from the point F to F ' and gross profit ' will rise from OH to OH ' . We now have a measure of a relationship between L and X corresponding to the measures of elasticity of substitution which we have previously examined . If a small fall in the real wage rate leads to a large expansion of output with a given amount of land , then we may say that the production relationship is a flexible one . Thus if a one per cent change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the slope of the line a we may say that the elasticity of transformation between L and X is large . ' We have analysed at some length the geometrical description of the relationships between inputs and outputs in the industry producing X. Similar relationships exist in the other industry producing Y. We can now put these two production relationships together in order to consider the equilibrium conditions for the whole economy . In our present simple system of two factors and one output a high elasticity of transformation between L and X ( or between N and X ) implies a ( numerically ) high elasticity of substitution between L and N and vice versa . But when we come on to more complicated processes it will be useful to have both measures in mind .  | In Figure 34 we measure to the left from X along the axis XB the amount of L ( Lx ) used in the production of X and up from X along the vertical axis XA the amount of N ( Nx ) used in the production of X. There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XI and X2 showing the combinations of LX and NX required to produce the outputs XI and X2 . Similarly from the origin Y we measure downwards the amount of N ( Ny ) used to produce Y and to the right the amount of L ( Li ) used to produce Y. There are then a series of Y equi-product curves such as YI and Y2 showing the combinations of Ly and Ny required to produce outputs Yl and Y2 of Y. We choose the dimensions of the box in Figure 34 in such a way that YB ( = XA ) equals the total amount of N available in the whole economy and YA ( = XB ) equals the total amount of L available in the economy as a whole . If we then take any point such as E inside the box , we have a complete description of the production arrangements in the economy . At E of the total amount of labour ( YA = XB ) YF is used to produce Y and XI to produce X ; and of the total amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce Y and XH to produce X. Through E there will pass a Y equi-product curve which will show how much Y is produced with YF labour and YG  | land ; and similarly through E there will pass an X equi-product curve which will show how much X is being produced . Consider first any point such as C which is on the diagonal YX . Any point on this diagonal indicates a position in which both the Y industry and the X industry are using labour and land in the national average proportion . At C X is employing Nx in the ratio JC which equals YB which is the ratio in which labour and land are available in the economy as a whole . Similarly , -1 YK = YA N ) , KC XA total N. Through C there will pass an X-equi-product curve ( X2 ) and a Y-equi-product curve ( Y1 ) . In Figure 34 we have drawn the fluke case in which it happens by mere coincidence that on the diagonal X Y at C the slope of the X-equi-product curve is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown by the slope of the line y . The slope of the line y can be taken to represent the price of labour relatively to the price of land . If y is steeply sloped , then much N must be given for little L as one moves along the line y ; or in other words the price of L is high relatively to the price of N. As we have already shown , the X producers will not want to change the ratio of LX to Nx if the slope y is the same as that of the X equi-product curve ; and similarly for the Y producers . The point C on the diagonal is in this case one in which both the X and the Y producers will be willing to use L and N in the national average if the relatively rates of wages and rents are in equilibrium at the slope y . Whether the point C will be the equilibrium point will depend upon the demand in the economy for X and Y. If the demand for Y were greater and for X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from C to D. The output of Y would have gone up from Yl to Y2 and of X down from X2 to XI . Since X will have released resources of L and N in the national average and Y will have taken them on in the same proportion , the ratio of L to N will have changed in neither industry . The slopes of XI and Y2 will both be the same at D as those of X2 and YI at C. The slope of b is the same as that of y . Factor prices and so product costs are unchanged . We have a case of constant costs . But it would be a pure coincidence if both the X and the Y total L  | industry would employ the national average of L to N at the same ratio of factor prices , y . We consider in Figure 35 the much more probable case where this is not so . At the point C on the diagonal XY the slope of the Y-equi-product curve is S and of the X-equiproduct curve is y . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average , the wage rate would have to be very high relatively to the rate of rent to keep the Y producers in equilibrium and it would have to be much lower relatively to the rate of rent to keep the X producers in equilibrium . Because of constant returns to scale the X-equi-product curve has the slope y and the Y-equi-product curve the slope 8 at all points on the diagonal XY . From the way in which the X and Y equi-product curves cut each other ( as at C ) on the diagonal X Y , it is clear that they can be tangential to each other only to the North-East of the diagonal X Y. This means that all points of equilibrium , at which the slope of the X-equi-product curve and of the Y-equi-product curve are the same must lie to the NorthEast of the diagonal XY and that the slope of the line showing the relative prices of land and labour must be intermediate between y and S. A possible equilibrium point is shown at D where the relative factor prices are shown by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio LY is equal to YD i.e. It is represented by the steepness of the slope of the line ) 3 down from the horizontal line YA . Because of constant returns to scale all Y equi-product curves on the line f4 will have the same slope as the line e . Similarly at the point D the ratio of LX is X , which is equal to the slope of the line ? up from the horizontal line XB . Since D is above the diagonal XY , this means that at D X employs a higher ratio of land to labour than does Y. This is not the same thing as saying that for all conceivable prices of L and N the Y industry will be labour intensive and the X industry land intensive . It is possible that techniques of production are such that Y will at every set of factor prices employ a higher ratio of L to N than does Y. But this is not necessarily the case . Suppose ( as in fact we have drawn it ) that the elasticity of substitution between L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Y industry . Then at a very low wage X might be more labour-intensive than Y and at a high wage X might be less labour-intensive than Y. If the total supply of labour were great and of land small , the wage rate might have to fall so low that X became the labour-intensive ratio . This is shown in Figure 36 where the shape of the equi-product curves for X and Yare the same as in Figure 35 but the supply of labour is much greater and of land much smaller . It is now apparent that points of equilibrium like D must lie below the diagonal XY . The point is simply that with the low national average of L to N shown in Figure 35 the price of L relatively to that of N must always be high enough to make X the land-intensive industry , whereas with the high national average of L to N in Figure 36 the price of L relatively to that of N must always be low enough to make X the labour-intensive industry . In Figure 35 D is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final equilibrium point only if the needs and tastes of consumers are such as to make them willing to purchase the amounts of X and Y which correspond to the X and Y equi-product curves which pass through the point D. What would now happen if the demand for X were less and for Y greater ? This is illustrated in Figure 37 . We start at the position D with the ratio shown by the downward slope of 13 and the ratio Lx by the upward slope of a , and with the ratio of the price of L to the price of N shown by the upward slope of E. The demand for Y increases and for X falls ; Lx is greater than LX releases a ratio of land to labour above the national average and Y absorbs a ratio of land to labour below the national average ; there is an excess supply of land ; the price of land falls relatively to the price of labour , and the slope of e becomes steeper , moving in the direction of the arrow from e ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour both the X industry and the Y industry use a  | higher ratio of land to labour than before ; the a line and the /3 line swing round in the direction of the arrows ; when the slope of E has risen to that of E ' , the slopes of a and /3 have changed to a ' and /3 ' ; the point D ' at which a ' and /3 ' intersect is , therefore , the only possible point of equilibrium with the new factor price ratio E ' , because on the line /3 ' lie all the points of the Y equi-product curves with the slope E ' and on the line a ' lie all the points of the X equiproduct curves with the slope We can thus trace out the line Y ? D ? D ' ? X on which all points of competitive equilibrium must lie . As one moves down this line from Y to D to D ' towards X ( i ) more Y and less Xis produced , ( ii ) since Y is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively to that of labour falls , and ( iii ) as a result of the change in factor prices both X and Y employ a higher ratio of land to labour than before . We can also show from Figure 37 that in these conditions there will be increasing costs in the sense that as one moves along the line Y ? D ? D ' towards X one will have to give up more and more Y for each additional unit of X produced . This is shown in Figure 38 which is simply a magnification of the part of Figure 37 lying around the point D in Figure 37 . At D , then , in Figure 38 we have the intersection of the a and /3 factor-proportion lines with the X and Y equi-product curves at D both having the same slope , namely that of E. Measure along a on each side of D equal lengths DB and DC ( DB = DC ) . Because of constant returns to scale the slopes of the X equi-product curves at C , D , and B will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let these a lines cut the line /3 at E , D , and F respectively . Because of constant returns to scale the Y-equi-product curves at E , D , and F will all have the same slope , namely that of e . The triangles DCE and DBF are equal and , therefore , ED = DF . Because of constant returns to scale , therefore , the increases in the output of X between B and D and between D and C are the same , and the decreases in the output of Y between F and D and between D and E are the same ( i.e. X2 ? XI = X3 ? X2 and Y3 ? Y2 = Y5 ? Y3 ) In between the lines a and A ' there runs the curve ( Y ? D ? D ' ? X of Figure 37 ) on which the Y and X equi-product curves are tangential . Let the X equi-product curve through B ( namely XI ) be tangential to a Y equi-product curve ( namely Y4 ) at G and let Y4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve through C ( namely X3 ) be tangential to a Y equi-product ( namely YI ) at H and let YI cut the line cc at K. Consider now a shift of demand from Y to X , first from H to D and then from D to G. This represents an equal reduction in the output of X because ( since by construction CD = DB ) the decrease of X from X3 to X2 is equal to the decrease from X2 to XI . But the shift from D to G represents a smaller increase in the output of Y than does the shift from H to D. We have already seen ( since DF = ED ) that the increase in output of Y from Y3 to Ys is the same as that from Y2 to Y3 . But the shift from D to G represents a smaller increase in output of Y than this ( namely from Y3 to Y4 ) and the shift from H to D represents a larger increase in output of Y than this ( namely from YI to Y3 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each successive unit decrease in the output of X. We have again a case of increasing cost . If we drew the productionpossibility curve ' for X and Y it would be of the same general form as the curve LZ in Figure 26.  | We must now generalize the analysis of the previous chapter to allow for the fact that there are more than two factors of production and more than two products . There are more than one type of land ( hilly land and flat land ) and more than one type of labour ( men capable of heavy physical work and men capable of delicate accurate work ) . There are a large number of products which are produced for the final consumer . We must now envisage a whole range of industrial processes each of which uses some or all of the factors ( L , M , N , etc. ) to produce some or all of the products ( X , Y , Z , etc . ) . Some processes will not employ some factors nor produce some products ; a steel mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bye-product . But nevertheless we have now to allow for the possibility ( which we ignored in the previous chapter ) that some processes will produce more than one product as well as employing more than one factor . Thus a sheep farmer employs land and labour to produce wool and mutton . In our competitive economy there are two sets of conditions which must be fulfilled before the system will be in equilibrium . First , the choice of processes to be employed ( i.e. the choice of industries to be set up ) and the scale at which each chosen process ( i.e. the relative size of each industry ) is operated must be such as to make all chosen processes just cover their costs and such as to leave unused no processes which at current prices payable for the factors and receivable from the products it would be profitable to operate . Second , within each firm or farm ( i.e. in the case of each single entrepreneur operating any process ) it must be impossible to make any further adjustments so as to increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never be operated at all because they are unequivocally inferior to other technically feasible processes . Thus consider two processes using L , M , and N to produce X , Y , and Z. Suppose that any given amounts of L , M , and N would be able to produce more X by process I than by process II without producing less Y or less Z ( no matter in what proportions X , Y , and Z were produced in process II ) , then process II would be unequi- vocally inferior to process I. An entrepreneur could always obtain by process I everything which he could obtain by process II plus something more in addition . But if we leave out of account all such unequivocally technically inferior processes , the decision whether to set up a new firm in order to introduce or to expand the use of a particular process or whether to close down an existing firm in order to contract or to eliminate the use of a particular process will depend upon the relative prices of the various factors and the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product-intensity of each process . In any given situation with given total supplies of L , M , and N and with the ruling prices of L , M , and N , the national income will be divided between the incomes of L , the incomes of M , and the incomes of N. Suppose 20 per cent of the national income goes to L , 50 per cent to M , and the remaining 30 per cent to N. Then on the average for the economy as a whole costs of production must be 20 per cent L-costs , 50 per cent M-costs , and 30 per cent N-costs . If in any particular process the costs , at ruling prices of the factors , were 40 per cent L-costs , 40 per cent M-costs , and 20 per cent Ncosts , we would say that , as compared with the national average , this process was L-intensive ( because more than the average proportion of its costs were L-costs ) and was M- and N-disintensive ( because less than the average proportion of its costs were M-costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling outputs of X , Y , and Z together with the ruling prices of X , Y , and Z will determine the proportion of the national income which is spent on X , Y , and Z. Suppose of the total national income 20 per cent is spent on X , 50 per cent on Y , and 30 per cent on Z. If in any particular process the receipts from sales , at the ruling prices of the products , were 40 per cent from X , 40 per cent from Y , and 20 per cent from Z , then , as compared with the national average , this process would be Xintensive and Y- and Z-disintensive . If the prices of L and Z were very high and of N and X were very low , then processes which were L- and X-intensive would be exceptionally unprofitable , while processes which were N- and Z-intensive would be exceptionally profitable . The former processes would face exceptionally high costs and low receipts while the latter would enjoy exceptionally low costs and high receipts . The former processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general expansion or contraction of particular processes entrepreneurs will make marginal adjustments within processes in order to make each process as profitable as possible . Such marginal  | adjustments will be of three kinds . ( i ) An entrepreneur may find it profitable to change his output programme in such a way as to increase somewhat the output of Z at the expense of the output of X , while using the same amount of factors and producing the same amount of all other products , provided that the price of Z is sufficiently high relatively to that of X. ( ii ) He may find it profitable to change his input programme in such a way as to increase somewhat the input of N so as to economize the input of L , while keeping all his outputs and his employment of other factors unchanged , provided that the price of N is sufficiently low relatively to the price of L. ( iii ) He may find it profitable to change his production programme , i.e. to employ somewhat more of input N in order to produce more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inputs unchanged , provided that the price of N is sufficiently low relatively to the price of Z. The first of these three types of adjustment has not been considered in earlier chapters of this book . Let us take an example . Consider a mixed farm on which land and labour is used to produce various agricultural products including sheep . Now sheep produce wool and mutton ; but , by varying the breed of sheep , the proportions in which wool and mutton can be produced can be varied . If the price of mutton is high and of wool low , a high ratio of mutton to wool will he produced ; and vice versa . The technically possible variations in the output programme of the farm are illustrated in Figure 39 . We measure along the X axis the amount of X ( wool ) produced and up the Y axis the amount of Y ( mutton ) produced . Let the  | curve CPQD represent the combinations of X and Y that can be produced on this farm given the existing employment of the various factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve slopes down from left to right because in order to produce more X with the given resources one must produce less Y ; and its slope becomes steeper and steeper as one moves to the right because the greater the ratio of X to Y which one is producing , the more difficult will it become to produce still more X at the expense of Y. One can draw a series of equi-revenue lines , the AB-lines of Figure 39 , which represent the combinations of X and Y which it will be necessary to sell in order , at the current prices of X and Y , to receive a given revenue from the sale of X and Y. Thus suppose that the price of X is such that OB5 of X will sell for $500 and that the price of Y is such that OA5 of Y will sell for $500 . Then any combination of X and Y on the line A5B5 will sell for $500 . The slope of the line A5B5 measures the price of X relatively to the price of Y. If one increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratio of 6 to 5 , one will obtain a revenue of $600 instead of $500 . The combinations of X and Y necessary to receive $600 are shown on the line A6B6 where OA6 OB6 5 A6B6 is parallel to A5B5 . And so on for the other equi-revenue lines . In order to maximize his profit our farmer will , at the relative prices of X and Y shown by the slope of the AB-lines on Figure 39 , produce OF of X and FQ of Y. He will in fact move along the curve CPQF until this curve becomes tangential to the highest possible equi-revenue line . For the combination at P he will receive $700 , but for that at Q $800 . He will be maximizing his profit only if it is impossible to make any further profitable adjustment of this land between any two of his outputs . We can derive from Figure 39 a measure of the elasticity of substitution between X and Y in our farmer 's output programmes . This can be measured by the percentage change in the ratio of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one per cent change in the ratio of the price of X to the price of Y.1 If a small percentage change in the slope of the AB-lines would cause a large percentage change in the slope of the line OA , then the elasticity of substitution between X and Y in the farmer 's output programme is high . If the 1 This is a partial elasticity of substitution in the sense that we are measuring the farmer 's ability to produce more X and less Y on the assumption that he can not change his input programme at the same time , i.e. he can not take on more of the inputs specially useful to produce X and less of those specially useful to produce Y.  | elasticities of substitution between the various pairs of his outputs are in general high , we may call his output programme a flexible one ; if they are low , we may call it a rigid one . Marginal adjustments of the types ( ii ) and ( iii ) mentioned above on page 129 have already been mentioned in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated in Figure 40 . The entrepreneur in any given process can vary the amount of N and L he employs to produce a given output of each of his products with a given input of each of the other factors . The curve CDEFGHI describes the combinations of N and L needed for this purpose . We can draw equi-cost lines A5B5 , A6B6 , etc. , which show , at the ruling prices of N and L , the combinations of N and L which can be purchased for $500 , $600 , etc . The entrepreneur will move down the curve CDEFGHI till he minimizes his L ? N costs ; this will occur when the curve is tangential to the lowest equi-cost line ; at D or H his L ? N costs would be $800 , at E or G $700 , and at F only $600 . There is a high elasticity of substitution between L and N if a small percentage change in the slope of the AB lines would cause a large percentage change in the slope of the line OF ( cf. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his profit only if he is unable to make any further substitutions between any pair of his inputs such as to reduce his costs at current factor prices . If the elasticity of substitution between the various pairs of his inputs are in general high , his input programme is a flexible one ; if they are low , it is a rigid one .  | Marginal adjustments of type ( iii ) are illustrated in Figure 41 . Our entrepreneur now considers the relationship between any one factor in his input programme ( say , L ) and any one product in his output programme ( say , X ) . Given the inputs of all other factors and the outputs of all other products there is a relationship between his input of L and output of X represented by the curve OCDEF . Given the price of L and the price of X we can draw a series of equisurplus lines such as A5B5 . Suppose the price of X is such that OA of X would sell for $500 ; and suppose that the price of L is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as GA5 units of X. Then any point on the line A5B5 represents a surplus of $500 of the receipts of our entrepreneur from sales of X over his purchases of L. Similar lines A6B6 , A7B7 , etc. , can be drawn for surpluses of $600 , $700 , etc. , of receipts from X over payments for L. Our entrepreneur will move up the curve OCDEF until it is tangential to his highest equi-surplus line as at D in Figure 41 ; in other words he will employ more and more L to produce more and more X until the marginal product of L in terms of X is equal to the real wage rate of L measured in terms of X. The productive relationship between L and X has a high elasticity of transformation if a small change in the slope of the AB-lines causes a large change in the slope of the line OD ( p. 119 above ) .  | Our entrepreneur will be maximizing his profit only if he has adjusted his production programme so as to make it impossible to affect his receipts by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any one input to produce more or less of any one output . If in general the elasticities of transformation between his various pairs of inputs and outputs are high , his production programme is a flexible one ; if in general they are low , then it is a rigid one . We shall speak of a flexible process as one in which output programmes , input programmes , and production programmes are flexible , and of a rigid process as one in which these programmes are rigid . We can now consider how a many-product many-factor system will adjust itself to a change of conditions . We imagine our system to start in an equilibrium situation in which at the ruling prices of the factors and the products it does not pay to contract ( or eliminate ) or to expand ( or introduce ) any particular process and in which all entrepreneurs operating particular processes have no incentive to make further marginal adjustments to their output programmes , input programmes , or production programmes . Further we assume that , at the ruling prices of the products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the factors of production ( corresponding to the ruling prices of the factors of production ) , consumers demand the amounts of each product which are being produced for the market . Let us suppose that in this system there is a change of some consumers ' needs and tastes which shifts demand away from product Y on to product X. We have already examined at some length in Chapter II what would be the effect upon the ruling prices of X and Y and of other products in the market if the supplies of the various products and the distribution of income among consumers remained unchanged . The prices of X and of close substitutes for X in consumers ' demands would go up , while the prices of goods which were complementary in some uses to X might fall . On the other hand the prices of Y and of goods which were close substitutes for Y might well fall , while the prices of goods which were complementary in some uses to Y might rise . Now if the processes which were intensive in the output of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy with Y were L-intensive in their inputs and if the processes which were intensive in the output of X and of the products whose prices had risen in sympathy with X were N-intensive in their inputs , attempts to expand the profitable X-intensive processes and to contract the unprofitable Y-intensive processes would cause an indirect increase in the demand for N and fall in the demand for L. ( A shift of demand  | from clothing to food would have caused an indirect shift of demand away from labour to land . ) In consequence the price of L ( wage of labour ) would fall and the price of N ( rent of land ) would rise . This would give rise to profits in all other L-intensive processes and to losses in all other N-intensive processes in the economy ; and the former would be expanded and the latter contracted . Suppose there to be some process which is very L-intensive in its input but W-intensive in its output , while there is some other process which is N-intensive in its input but Z-intensive in its output . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of W is expanded , while the latter process is contracted so that the output of Z is contracted . The price of W falls and of Z rises . If in consumers ' consumption W is a good substitute for other products , the increased supplies of W can be readily absorbed . Similarly if Z is a good substitute for other products , the decreased supplies Z will be readily accepted and demand will be shifted to other products . ( In terms of our example , the initial shift of demand from clothing to food lowers the wage rate and raises the rent of land ; this lowers the cost of other labourintensive manufactures like cameras and raises the cost of other land-intensive goods like housing . Labour released from a contraction of clothing production can be more readily absorbed into the system if consumers shift easily to the consumption of labour-intensive cameras when their price falls ; and the land required for an expansion of food production can be more readily released from other parts of the system if consumers shift readily away from the consumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general as the prices of factors and of products are affected by these general repercussions throughout the system there will be an expansion of those processes which are intensive in the factors which have fallen in price and in the products which have risen in price and there will be a contraction of those processes which are intensive in the factors which have risen in price and in the products which have fallen in price . These expansions and contractions will serve to make good use of factors which have become relatively abundant , to economize in the use of factors which have become scarce , to increase the supply of products which have become scarce , and to reduce the supply of products which are in relative abundance . The ease of adjustment will clearly be the greater ( i.e. will require smaller changes in product and factor prices ) ( i ) the more readily consumers will shift their demands from high priced to low priced products and ( ii ) the more varied and the more finely graduated are the technically available processes so that processes which use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , processses which produce expensive products can replace those which produce cheap products , and processes which use a cheap factor to produce an expensive product can replace those which rely on an expensive factor to produce a cheap product . It is of interest to note that while the shift of demand from Y to X will cause the new equilibrium price of X to be higher relatively to the price of Y , it will not necessarily cause a rise in the absolute money price of X and a fall in the absolute money price of Y. Suppose that we have only two factors L and N and that we have seven products T , U , V , W , X , Y , Z. Suppose that the ratio of N to I , falls as we move from the production of T to that of U , from the production of U to that of V , and so on down the scale to Z which is the most L-intensive product of all . Suppose that W employs a ratio of N to L equal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a shift of demand from Y to X will raise the demand for N and reduce the demand for L. Since we are assuming a constant money national income and constant supplies of L and N , this means that the money rate of rent must go up and the money wage rate down . Since W employs L and N in the national average , the rise in the price of N will exactly offset the fall in the price of I. in so far as the cost of W is concerned . The money cost of W will remain unchanged ; but the money costs of V , U , and T will rise in increasing amounts since V , U , and T are increasingly N-intensive and the money costs of X , Y , and Z will fall in increasing amounts because X , Y , and Z are increasingly L-intensive . In this simple model the final result of a shift of demand from Y to X would be that the money cost and so the price of W remained unchanged , the money costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rise progressively in that order , and the money costs and prices of X , Y , and Z would all fall progressively in that order . The shift of demand from Y to X would in the end have caused the price of X to rise relatively to the price of Y by causing the money price of Y to fall more than the money price of X. As a result of the shift of demand from Y to X marginal adjustments will be made within processes similar to the adjustments between processes which we have examined in the proceeding paragraphs . When initially the price of X rises and of Y falls as the direct result of the increased demand for X and of the reduced demand for Y , entrepreneurs who are operating processes which produce both X and Y will have an incentive to adjust their output programmes so that more X and less Y are produced . If the system of adjustments involved a change in factor prices ( for example , in the case we have examined above , a rise in the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , t entrepreneurs using both L and N will have an incentive to use more of the cheaper L and less of the more expensive N in their input programmes . At the same time in various processes entrepreneurs will now find it profitable to take on more L to produce X and/or less N to produce Y. In general as the adjustments take place in the economic system entrepreneurs will have an incentive within any process to shift their output programme from lower to higher priced products , their input programmes from higher to lower priced factors , and their production programmes so as to employ more lower-priced factors to produce more higher priced products . The more flexible are the various processes in these three ways , the more readily will it be possible to make the necessary change in the quantities of the products produced with the minimum of change in the prices of the products or of the factors of production . The more flexible ( i.e. sensitive to price changes ) are consumers ' demand , and entrepreneur 's output programmes , input programmes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more varied and finely graded the product- and factor-intensities of technically known processes , the more readily can the economic system be adjusted to changes in demand without marked changes in product prices or in the distribution of money incomes due to changes of factor prices . In a many-factor many-product economy there may , however , exist complementarities which may exaggerate the changes in particular prices needed to effect particular adjustments . These relationships may exist ( i ) in consumers ' demand for final products , ( ii ) in producers ' output of products , or ( iii ) in producers ' demands for factors of production . We will consider each of these three possibilities . ( i ) Suppose Pens and Pencils to be close substitutes in consumers ' demand , but Pens and Ink to be complements in consumers ' demand ( cf. pp. 52 ? 53 above ) . Suppose that in the course of some adjustment in the economy ( such as the shift of demand from clothing to 1 In the preceding paragraphs we have shown how the expansion of an Xintensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this effect , if the X-intensive process were N-intensive and the Y-intensive process were L-intensive . But an exactly similar effect might result from marginal adjustments within any process . For example , suppose that a rise in the price of X ( mutton ) and fall in the price of Y ( wool ) caused an entrepreneur ( sheep-farmer ) who produced both products to increase the ratio of X to Y produced with a given amount of input of L and N. But if for some technical reason wool-producing sheep required rather more human attention than mutton-producing sheep , the marginal rise in the ratio of X to Y in the sheep-farmers ' output programme might , at current prices of L and N , cause him to make a marginal increase in the ratio of N to L in his input programme . Within the process X is N-intensive and Y L-intensive.  | food which we have described above ) the wage rate of labour falls and of the rent of land rises . Suppose that Pens were labour-intensive and that Pencils and Ink were land-intensive in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive land-intensive Pencils to the use of the cheaper labour-intensive Pens . This releases land needed for food production and gives employment to labour released from clothing production . But unfortunately Ink is needed to go with the Pens and the increased demand for Ink , being landintensive , in itself accentuates the scarcity of land . ( ii ) When the price of one product ( X ) goes up relatively to the others ( YZ ) , entrepreneurs will plan to increase the output of X relatively to other outputs . If there were only two products , X and Y , this would mean planning to use a given amount of resources to produce more X and less Y. When there are three products XYZ this means planning to use a given amount of resources to produce more X and less YZ . But this does not necessarily mean producing less Y and less Z. If , for example , X and Y went close together technically in an output programme , it might involve producing somewhat more Y to accompany the increased production of X and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case X and Y are complementary elements in the production programme . Let us take an example . Suppose X to be mutton , Y wool , and Z wheat . A rise in the price of mutton relatively to that of wool and wheat causes an entrepreneur engaged in mixed farming to produce more mutton . But this will involve producing more sheep . It is true that the farmer will attempt to breed mutton-producing rather than wool-producing sheep ; but if the technical possibilities of varying the breed are limited , the net result will be a shift from cereal production to sheep farming with a consequential reduction in the output of wheat and increase in the output of mutton , combined however with some increase in the output of wool . Now it might so happen that in the particular adjustment which was needed in the economy , wool was a product of which a smaller rather than a larger supply was required . The fact that X ( of which a larger supply was needed ) was a complement in production to Y ( of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult . It is to be observed that this penomenon of complementarity in production can occur either within a process or as between two or more processes . If mixed farming is a single process , then the rise in the price of mutton causes our farmer within his single farm to produce more mutton and wool and less wheat . But sheep-farming and cereal-production might be quite different processes . If the former is mutton-intensive while the latter is wheat-intensive , an  | increased demand for mutton relatively to wheat will cause an expansion of the former and contraction of the latter process . But if the former is also wool-intensive , an indirect result may be an increase in the output of wool which may make the total adjustment of the economy so much the more difficult . ( iii ) When the price of one factor ( L ) goes down relatively to the others ( MN ) , entrepreneurs will plan to increase the input of L relatively to that of the others . If there were only two factors , L and N , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment of more L and less N. When there are three factors LMN , this means planning to produce a given output by using more L and less MN . But this does not necessarily mean using less M and less N. If , for example , L and M went close together technically in an input programme ( each plumber must have his boy ) , it might involve employing more M to accompany the increased employment of L and , in consequence , greatly reducing the employment of N. In this case L and M are complementary factors of production . Such a situation could make adjustments more difficult . Suppose that L was particular plentiful in a given situation and needed to be absorbed into the economy ; but suppose at the same time that M was scarce relatively to N. The absorption of L into the system would have increased rather than have reduced the scarcity of M relatively to N. Once more it is to be noted that this relationship of complementarity between factors can occur within or between processes . When the price of L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular process may take on less N and more L , together with some additional M to go with the L. Or there may be two quite separate processes to produce a given product ( e.g. natural and synthetic rubber ) . The one process may be very L-intensive and the other very N-intensive . When the price of L falls , the former will be expanded and the latter contracted . But the former process may also be somewhat 111-intensive . In consequence the adjustment which absorbs L may at the same time increase an existing scarcity of M relatively to N. The two phenomena of complementarity between outputs and complementarity between inputs which we have just discussed can be of great importance in a **25;1352;TOOLONG production system . ' Suppose that in the course of some adjustment the prices of some factors and products have fallen and of other factors and products have risen . This will make any process which is intensive in the cheap factors and/or the expensive products especially pros See the Note appended at the end of this chapter ( pp. 141-6 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive factors and/or the cheap products especially unprofitable . The former will expand and the latter will contract . With constant returns to scale there is nothing in the technical production function itself to halt the expansion of the former process and the contraction of the latter process ; a larger scale of production does not in itself raise costs nor does a smaller scale of production reduce costs . Equilibrium is restored solely by the market effects of the expansion of the profitable process and the contraction of the unprofitable process ; the selling prices of the products in which the expanding process is intensive will fall as their supplies are increased and the purchase price of the factors in which the expanding process is intensive will be bid up as the demand for them rises ; and conversely with the product and factor prices in the contracting processes . In general these forces will exercise a very powerful influence in adjusting amounts of input and output so as to bring down the exceptionally high product and factor prices and to pull up the exceptionally low product and factor prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful leverage in making still scarcer some particular product or factor which has already become scarce or in making still more plentiful some particular product or factor which has already become plentiful . Thus an exceptionally profitable multi-product process may well contain one relatively minor factor which is already scarce and/or one relatively minor product which is already plentiful ; and its general expansion will drive up still further the price of that already scarce factor ( which is an input-complement with the other main factors ) and drive down still further the price of that already plentiful product ( which is an output-complement with the other main products ) . So far we have considered the possibilities that complementarities in output programmes and complementarities in input programmes may intensify the scale on which some price changes must take place in order to restore equilibrium . There is also the possibility of a similar perverse relationship in a transformation programme which we may perhaps call an antipathy between an input and an output ' . We may explain the significance of this phenomenon in the following way . Consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant . If the price of L falls and/or the price of Y rises more L will be employed to produce more Y and this will tend to keep up the price of L and to drive down the price of Y. But suppose now that within a multi-product multi-factor process one is considering the employment of L to produce X and Y. The  | price of L has fallen , while the prices of X and Y have both risen in the same proportion ; more L is employed ; more of XY as a whole will be produced ; but it is possible that while much more X is produced the output of Y is actually reduced . In this case there could be said to be an antipathy between L and Yin the production programme using L to produce XY . A possible explanation could be on the following lines . X is the main product ; when more L is employed with the other inputs , it means shifting the technique of production in the process on to a form which employed a higher ratio of L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat less of some by-product , Y , to be produced . The effect would be to help to maintain the price of L through the increased demand for L , to help to keep down the price of X through the increased supply of X , but to intensify the rise in the price of Y. Or suppose that within a multi-product multi-factor process one is considering the production of X by means of L and N. The price of X rises while the prices of L and N both fall in the same proportion ; more X is produced and more of LN as a whole must be employed to produce it ; but it is possible that while much more L is employed a smaller amount of N is needed . There is an antipathy between N and X in the production programme of producing X by means of L and N. This could be explained by the fact that to increase the proportion of X in the total output of the process involved a change in the techniques of production which called for the employment of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result the price of X would be kept down and the price of L would be kept up , but the already low-priced N would find that the demand for it was still further depressed . Antipathies between inputs and outputs are probably of secondary importance . But complementarities between inputs and between outputs may well be important phenomena which make the economic system appreciably more rigid in its adjustment to change than would otherwise be the case . They can constitute important reasons why relatively large changes in relative prices may sometimes be necessary . We have already noted in Chapter IV ( pp. 80-82 ) another type of market relationship which may intensify the scale of price changes necessary to adjust the economic system to some outside disturbance . If in our example the shift of demand from Y to X causes a fall in the wage rate and a rise in the rate of rent , and if the ownership of land is unequally divided among the population , there will be a shift in the distribution of income away from those families who live mainly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Either because income per head is higher for the one class than for the other or simply because their needs and tastes are  | different , this change in the distribution of incomes may , quite apart from any price changes , cause further shifts in demand . It is quite accidental whether these shifts mitigate or accentuate the necessary price changes . If workers consume labour-intensive clothing and landlords land-intensive food , then the shift from wages to rents which would result from an initial shift of demand from clothing to food will accentuate the fall in the demand for clothing relatively to food , which will accentuate the change in the distribution of income , and so on . The other adjustments in the economy will have to be all the more marked to compensate for this perverse income effect upon demand . Thus adjustment will be easy in an economy in which ( i ) substitutability is marked between different goods in the pattern of consumers ' demands , ( ii ) processes of production are flexible , ( iii ) there is a wide and varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , outputs , and inputs and antipathies between inputs and outputs are rare , and ( v ) there are few perverse income effects . On the face of it in the modern economy , with such a wide range of alternative supplies for consumers and so rich a system of technological alternatives , it would seem probable that moderate price changes could lead to extensive changes in the pattern of outputs . Note to Chapter IX SUBSTITUTABILITY , COMPLEMENTARITY , TRANSFORMABILITY , AND ANTIPATHY IN THE CASE OF A CONSTANT-RETURNS-TOS CALE PRODUCTION FUNCTION Consider first the most straightforward case of Substitutability and Complementarity in consumers ' demand with three goods ? Pencils , Pens , and Ink . We start in equilibrium ; there is a reduction in the price of Pens combined with a reduction in the consumer 's money income such that he remains on the same indifference curve ; he buys more Pens and less of other goods in general ; Pens are substitutes for other goods in general ; but if he buys more Ink ( to go with the Pens ) and a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pens . Note that there are four variables concerned : Pencils , Pens , Ink , and Utility . One variable ( Utility ) is kept constant in amount ; two variables ( Ink and Pencils ) are allowed to vary in amount but kept constant in price ; and one variable ( Pens ) has its price reduced by a given specified amount . We are in fact minimizing the cost of a given amount of Utility when the price of one input ( Pens ) changes and the price of the other inputs ( Pencils and Ink ) remain unchanged .  | We may regard the input of Pens , Pencils and Ink as producing ' the output Utility , or U = F ( K , L , M ) where U is the amount of Utility and K , L , and M the amount of Pens , Pencils , and Ink consumed . We could write this production ' function as 0=K , L , M ) But we can , of course , have a multi-product production function 0 = c ( W , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , L , M , N , . . . ) where in any process of production the inputs K , L , M , N , etc. , produce the outputs W , X , Y , Z , etc . Suppose further that this production function showed constant returns to scale in the sense that if one increased each and every input by 1 per cent and each and every output except one by 1 per cent , then the best that one could do would be to increase this one remaining output also by 1 per cent . Our problem is how to define and handle the ideas of substitutability , complementarity , and similar relationships between these input and output variables . We can take the hint from the analogy with consumers ' demand . In order merely to define our terms we must divide the variables in our production function into three groups ? A , B , and C : Group A. One or more variable ( like Utility in the previous example ) must be held constant in amount . The producer 's object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this group of inputs or outputs by varying the amounts of the other inputs which he purchases or outputs which he sells at their new given market prices . Group B. One or more variable ( like Ink and Pencils in our first example ) must be held constant in price but allowed to vary in quantity . If we are to have the possibility of relationships like complementarity , this group must contain more than one variable . Group C. One variable ( like Pens in our first example ) must have its price changed and be allowed to vary in quantity . This is the variable whose relationship with other variables we are defining . As far as the production function itself is concerned , it is completely arbitrary which variables are put into which Group . Putting the variables into the different Groups is simply a means of defining relationships between the variables . With our constant-returns-toscale production function , for each set of definitions some variables must be held constant ( i.e. Group A must contain some items ) . Otherwise when the price of the Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that variable were an input and  | unprofitable if that variable were an output . If there were constant returns to scale , if no variables were held constant in amount , and if all prices were kept constant at their new level , then in the former case the process would expand indefinitely towards infinity and in the latter case it would contract indefinitely towards zero . Only the existence of the constant variables keeps the process at a positive finite level ; but as far as the production function itself is concerned it is wholly arbitrary which variable or variables are kept constant . In fact it will be the market conditions which , taken together with the production function , will determine which variables will alter most in price and which in quantity . If for some outputs the demand was completely inelastic and for some inputs the supply was totally inelastic , then these variables would because of the market conditions be held constant . If for the other outputs the demand was infinitely elastic and for the other inputs the supply was infinitely elastic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable in amount but constant in price . Of course , in any given situation the variables do not fall into either one or other of these two extreme market categories . We merely assume that some vary only in price and others only in quantity in order to isolate certain relationships in order to define our terms . Let us consider certain cases by considering the kind of variables which we put into Groups B and C ( and thus by a process of elimination into Group A ) . Case ( i ) Suppose that both Groups B and C contain only inputs , Group B containing KLM and Group C containing N. All outputs and all other inputs are kept constant . The price of N falls ; more N is employed ; less is spent on KLM as a whole and N is an input substitute for KL and M as a whole ; but more of one particular member of KLM ( say , M ) may be bought in which case we say that N is input-complementary with M in respect of K and L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been made up differently , ( say of IJM instead of KLM with inputs K and L instead of inputs I and J now constant in amounts ) the input N might not now be input-complementary with M. If you have to use N instead of K or L , you may need some M to go with ' the N. But if you have to use N instead of I or J , you may not need any more M to go with ' the N. We express this by saying that N is input-complementary with M in respect of K and L but is an input-substitute for M in respect of I and J. Case ( ii ) . Suppose that both Groups contain only outputs , Group B containing XYZ and Group C containing W. The price of W falls ; less W and more XYZ as a whole is produced ; W and XYZ as a whole are output-substitutes ; but when W ( wool ) goes down some  | other output X ( mutton ) may also go down in which case W is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again whether X and W are output-substitutes or output-complements depends upon the choice of the other members of Group B. Case ( iii ) Suppose that Group B contains only outputs ( XYZ ) and Group C an input ( L ) . The price of L falls ; more L is employed and as a result more XYZ as a whole is produced . To use Professor Hick 's term , L is transformable into XYZ as a whole . But when L goes up , one output ( X ) may go down while the others ( YZ ) go up all the more . If L are bulls , Xis chinaware and Y and Z are beef and veal , then an increase in L may increase the output of Y and Z but reduce the output of X in this multi-product agricultural-industrial process . L and X may be said to be antipathetic in respect of Y and Z. Case ( iv ) Suppose that Group B contains only inputs ( LMN ) and Group C an output ( X ) . The price of X falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group is employed . Xis transformable into LMN as a whole . But within LMN there may be some factor L which is employed in greater amount when less X is produced , and L may then be said to be antipathetic to X in respect of M and N. Case ( v ) Group B contains inputs and outputs ( XYMN ) and Group C contains an input ( L ) . The price of L falls ; more L is employed ; on balance XY must go up and/or MN must fall , or more accurately the sum PXX + P , Y ? P ? , N ? P ? N must rise , where Px , Py , P , , , , and P ? are the money prices of X , Y , M , and N respectively , L is on balance transformable into XY and/or inputsubstitutable with MN . But a particular output ( X ) may go down in which case L is antipathetic with X in respect of YMN and/or a particular input ( M ) may go up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of X YN . There are in mixed cases of this kind some interesting relationships between input-complementarity and transformability and between input-substitutability and antipathy . Thus consider the case in which L and M together produce X and Y within a process in which this sub-activity , as it were , is not very drastically held up by the constant Group A , i.e. by the fact that some other outputs ( Z , etc. ) must not be produced in greater quantity or that some other factors ( K , etc. ) can not be used in greater amount . A fall in the cost of L may then give rise to a very large expansion of the sub-activity in which X Y is produced by LM . There will be a very high elasticity of transformability of L into X Y ( in respect of M ) but at the expense , as it were , of a very large increase in employment of M , i.e. at the expense of a high degree of input-complementarity between L and M ( in respect of XY ) .  | Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main product which can be produced either with one technical method using mainly L or with another technical method using mainly M , but that when it is produced by the one technical means ( largely with L ) it is produced more or less alone whereas when it is produced by the other technical means ( by M ) a bye-product X is also produced . Then a high degree of substitutability between L and M ( in respect of XY ) will mean that as L is used instead of M the output of the bye-product X is reduced . The high degree of inputsubstitutability between L and M ( in respect of X Y ) is offset by some considerable degree of antipathy between L and X ( in respect of YM ) . Thus a high degree of transformability may often involve a high measure of input-complementarity ; and a high degree of inputsubstitutability can well be combined with considerable antipathy . Case ( vi ) Group B contains inputs and outputs ( XYMN ) and Group C contains an output ( Z ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more XY as a group is produced and/or less MN as a group is employed , i.e. P , X + P , , Y ? PmM must fall . Z is on balance output-substitutable for X Y and/or transformable into MN . But a particular output ( X ) may go down in which case Z and X are output-complements in respect of YMN and/or a particular input ( M ) may go up , in which case Z and M are antipathetic in respect of X YN . If making ZX by means of MN were a rather independent subactivity in a whole process , a fall in the price of Z might cause a great contraction in the whole of this sub-activity . There would then be a very high degree of transformability of Z into MN ( in respect of X ) ; but if X were a joint-product with Z in this sub-activity , this could imply a very marked degree of output-complementarity between X and Z ( in respect of MN ) . Or if in this same sub-activity , it was easy to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different technique which required a rather higher ratio of M to N , then a fall in the price of Z might cause a large fall in the output of Z , some increase in the output of X , some increase in the input of M , but a large fall in the input of N. There would be a high degree of substitutability between X and Z ( in respect of MN ) but this would be combined with some antipathy between Z and M ( in respect of XN ) . Thus in a multi-output multi-input **25;1379;TOOLONG production function there are relationships like substitutability and complementarity which depend solely upon the technical conditions of production . Input-substitutability , output-substitutability , and transformability are the rule . If one includes in Group B only one variable , one is bound to find that it is input-substitutable , output  | substitutable , or transformable with the variable in Group C. It is possible that technical conditions are such that whatever combinations of variables are selected for inclusion in Groups B and C no examples of input-complementarity , output-complementarity , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are the exceptional perverse ' cases . But it is a nonsense question to ask without further specification whether two variables stand in this perverse ' relationship to each other or not . The question becomes meaningful only when one specifies which of the other variables are in Group A and which in Group B. One can only say that one variable stands in this perverse ' relationship with another in respect of the other specified variables included in Group B for the purpose of that particular definition . The sort of purpose for which one needs to use these definitions in economic analysis is to cope with a question of the following kind : Given a once-for-all reduction in the price of , say , L and given the price elasticities of demand for all the outputs ( XYZ , etc. ) and the price elasticities of supply for all the remaining inputs ( M , N , etc. ) , what will be the ultimate equilibrium quantities in a given productive process which is subject to the motives of profit maximization in conditions of perfect potential competition ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infinite expansion of the process . But this will be most effectively impeded by the inability to sell those products for which the demand is least elastic or to obtain those inputs for which the supply is least elastic . It may often be helpful to think of a group of such inputs and outputs as being constant in amount and considering the relationships of input and output-substitutability and complementarity and of transformability and antipathy which would in that extreme case exist between L and the remaining variables .  | In the previous chapters we have considered various models of stationary competitive equilibria . In the last four of these chapters we have examined how the equilibrium would be affected by a change in consumers ' needs and tastes , and we have used these changes on the demand side as means of illustration of the problems of readjustment . But changes on the demand side are not the only changes which can disturb an equilibrium . Changes on the supply side are in fact probably of more importance in the real world . The purpose of this chapter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the type discussed in the last chapter might adjust itself to changes in the conditions of supply . Changes in supply conditions may take either of two forms . ( i ) There may be an improvement in technical knowledge ? an invention ? which enables a greater output to be produced with a given amount of factors of production . ( ii ) There may be a change in the supply of a factor of production ? for example , an increase in the size of the working population . We will examine each of these in turn . Suppose then that there is an improvement in technical knowledge which enables a particular process to be used to produce more output with a given input . There will then be some percentage increase in output per unit of input which this process could achieve if the compositions of its input programme and of its output programme were unchanged in the sense that an unchanged ratio between its various inputs and an unchanged ratio between its various outputs was maintained . Suppose , for example , in the process in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could now produce 10 per cent more of each of X , Y , and Z. If the money prices of each of the factors of production were unchanged but the money prices of each of the products fell by 10 per cent , then the process would continue just to cover its costs . With productivity up by 10 per cent but selling prices down by 10 per cent the balance between revenue and costs is unchanged . There would be no incentive to expand or to contract the scale of operations of the process , measuring the scale by the amount of factors employed .  | But it would not , of course , follow that the entrepreneur would have no incentive to change the composition of his output programme or of his input programme . If the invention had been one which particularly favoured the production of Y within the process , then at unchanged relative prices of X , Y , and Z the entrepreneur might find it profitable to increase the ratio of Y to X and Z in his output programme . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than mutton-bearing sheep ; at unchanged relative prices of wool and mutton farmers would produce a higher ratio of wool to mutton . In this case the invention can be said to be technically biased towards the production of Y ( wool ) and against the production of X and Z ( e.g. mutton ) . Similarly , the invention might be such as to make it profitable for the entrepreneur at unchanged prices of the factors of production to take on less of one factor and more of another to produce the 10 per cent greater volume of output . For example , the invention might be one which in particular enabled farmers to economize in the use of one type of labour rather than in the use of other types of labour or of land . In this case at the unchanged prices of various grades of labour and land the farmers would take on less of the one particular grade of labour ( L ) and more of the other factors ( M and N ) to produce the 10 per cent larger output . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the saving of L and against the saving of M and N. If this process were the only one which existed in the economy , we should now have a complete description of the invention . With our example we could say that it increased overall productivity by 10 per cent and that it was biased in favour of Y production in so far as entrepreneurs at unchanged relative product prices would increase the proportion of sales of Y in their total receipts and that it was biased in favour of L-saving in so far as at unchanged factor prices they would reduce the proportion of purchases of L in their total costs . Another way of putting this same set of definitions ( and one which we shall find convenient when we come to consider an economy using many processes ) is as follows . The invention is one which would enable the same resources to be used to produce 10 per cent more of every product . If with unchanged factor prices and with all product prices 10 per cent lower , entrepreneurs would in fact choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every product , then the invention is a neutral one . ' But if the price 1 The fact that with a neutral invention entrepreneurs would be in equilibrium if all factor prices and inputs were unchanged , all outputs were up by 10 per cent , and all product prices were down by 10 per cent does not , of course , imply that  | of L would have to fall relatively to the price of other factors ( or if the price of Y would have to fall relatively to the price of other products ) to induce the entrepreneurs to go on using the same amount of each factor to produce 10 per cent more of each product , then the invention may be said to be biased towards the saving of L ( towards the production of Y ) . But suppose that the process in which the invention takes place is only one among many used in the economy . How are we now to measure the overall increase in the economy 's productivity which is caused by the invention and how are we to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invention is biased either for or against the production of a particular product or for or against the saving of a particular factor ? Suppose , for example , that the process in question is especially L-intensive in its inputs and Yintensive in its outputs . It is , for example , a labour(L)-intensive industry producing textiles ( Y ) . The invention in this process itself might have no technical bias . That is to say , if all factor prices remained the same and if all product prices fell by 10 per cent , the entrepreneur in the textile industry might have no incentive to change any input or output . But clearly for the economy as a whole this would be a very biased invention since it is above all an invention which enables the same amount of resources to produce more Y or the same amount of output to be produced with less L. An invention which takes place in a process which is L-intensive and Y-intensive can , therefore , be said to have a structural bias in favour of saving L and producing Y. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of structural bias in order to assess the net overall bias of the invention in the whole economy . We can do this by thinking of the whole economy as if it were one large super-process . Suppose then that there is an invention in the L- and Y-intensive ( textile ) industry which would enable the same factors in this industry to produce 10 per cent more of all its outputs . If an appropriate amount of factors of production were moved out of the textile industry into other industries , it would be possible to make use of the special textile invention to obtain a uniform increase in the output of all products in the economy . To take a very simple example , suppose that labour were the only factor in the economy , that an invention raised output per head in the textile industry by 10 per cent , and that initially 20 per cent of the total labour force was employed in the textile industry . the consumers ' markets would be in equilibrium at these unchanged money incomes and these new prices and outputs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in due course .  | Then a shift of 1.45 per cent of the total labour force from the textile industry to other industries would enable all output to be raised by the same percentage , namely 1.825 per cent . ' If we allow for the fact that there are many different factors , we suppose that there is a net transfer of resources from the textile industry to other industries , so as to allow all outputs to go up by the same percentage ; but we suppose that the resources of the community are reshuffled among the various processes in the economy in such a way that with the same total resources in the economy as a whole there is the greatest possible equal percentage increase in every output . If , for example , this percentage were 2 per cent , we would say that the particular invention represented an overall increase in productivity for the economy as a whole of 2 per cent . It would enable the given resources of the community , if used in the most effective way , to produce a 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose that in these conditions the price of every factor were unchanged and that the price of every product had fallen by 2 per cent . For the economy as a whole receipts would equal costs ; the money national income would be unchanged because the same amount of each factor would be receiving the same money price , and money national expenditure would be unchanged because 2 per cent more of each product would be selling at a 2 per cent lower money price . But some processes would be making losses and some profits . In our example , the L- and Y-intensive textile industry would certainly be making large profits since productivity in that process has been increased by the invention by 10 per cent while product prices have fallen by only 2 per cent . Other processes would almost certainly be unprofitable since productivity has not been raised by any invention but product prices have fallen by 2 per cent . The invention would for the economy as a whole prove to be biased towards the production of Y since it would require a fall in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent to remove any incentive to increase the output of Y by more than the average 2 per cent . To achieve the same 2 per cent increase in all outputs resources would have had to be shifted from the textile industry in which the invention took place to the other industries . What resources were released from the textile industry would depend upon factor-intensity in that industry and upon any technical bias in the invention . If the 1 The labour force in other industries would go up from 80 to 80 + 1.45 , i.e. by 1.825 per cent . The labour force in textiles would go down from 20 to 20 ? 1.45 , but each remaining worker would produce 10 per cent more output , so that textile output would have gone up by a proportion equal to 1.1 ( 20 ? 1.45 ) ? 20 20 or 1.825 per cent .  | industry were L-intensive then , unless the invention were technically very biased against saving L , the resources released from this industry would contain an especially high proportion of L. This means that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of L to other factors for their 2 per cent increase in output . The factor L would be made relatively plentiful ; and entrepreneurs would in fact be prepared to employ in all industries together ( including the textile industry ) the same total amount of L only if the price of L had fallen . The invention would have an overall bias in favour of saving L. If an invention has an overall bias in favour of saving L , it must have an overall bias against saving other factors in general . If the price of L would have to go down , the price of some other factors would have to go up in order to induce entrepreneurs to spend the same total amount of money on employing the same amount of each factor . But this does not mean that the price of every other factor would have to go up . Among the other factors there may be one ( say M ) which is a very close substitute for L. The result might then well be that while the price of L and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of N and of other factors would have to go up in order to give entrepreneurs an incentive to employ the same amount of the factors to produce 2 per cent more of every product after the invention . The invention would be biased in favour of saving both L and M and against saving N and other factors . Similarly with the products . The invention might in the way which we have explained be biased in favour of the production of Y. This would mean the price of Y would have to fall by more than the average 2 per cent in order to give entrepreneurs the incentive to increase the output of Y by no more than the average 2 per cent . In this case the prices of other products in general would have to rise or at least fall by less than the average 2 per cent . But this does not mean that the price of every other product would have to fall by less than 2 per cent . In our example the process in which the invention took place produced mainly textiles ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be some other labour-intensive process producing , say , television sets . The fall in the price of labour as a result of the contraction of the textile industry might be by more than 2 per cent , in which case the cost of producing television sets might fall by more than 2 per cent . To avoid an undue incentive to the production of television sets their prices might have to fall by more than 2 per cent . In this case textiles and television sets are good substitutes for each other on the production side ; they need very similar factor-inputs for their production . Although the invention took place only in the textile industry , for the economy as a whole it could have some bias  | in favour of the production of television sets as well as a marked bias in favour of the production of textiles . It would be biased against the production of the generality of other products . We now have a working definition of the overall increase in productivity caused by an invention and of its overall bias for and against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular products . We must now consider how the economy would adjust itself to an invention . Let us first suppose that there is an invention ( or set of inventions ) which produces a 2 per cent increase in overall productivity and which is neutral , i.e. without bias either for or against saving any factor or for or against the production of any product . Entrepreneurs would in fact employ the same total amount of each factor to produce 2 per cent more of each product , if each factor price remained unchanged and every product price fell by 2 per cent . What we now have to ask is whether this situation in which the productive system would be in equilibrium is one in which the market for consumption goods would also be in equilibrium . In fact every citizen 's real income would have gone up by 2 per cent . Since there are so far no changes in factor prices , there would be no change in the distribution of money incomes among persons ; and since every product price has fallen by 2 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her family budget , could purchase 2 per cent more of everything . Now if all income elasticities of demand are unity ( cf. pp. 41-42 ) , when real incomes go up by 2 per cent with relative product prices unchanged , then the demand for each individual product also goes up by 2 per cent . In this case then the market for consumption goods would also be in equilibrium . With factor prices unchanged and each product down by 2 per cent ( i ) entrepreneurs would have an incentive to produce 2 per cent more of each product and ( ii ) consumers would have an incentive to consume 2 per cent more of each product . This happy result depends upon the coincidence of three special conditions : first , that all income elasticities of demand are unity ; ' second that the invention is not biased for or against the saving of any particular factor ; and third , that the invention is not biased for or against the production of any particular product . 1 Accurately speaking , this first condition is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's income elasticity of demand for X is greater than unity but that Mrs B 's is less than unity . In this case when the real incomes of Mrs A and of Mrs B both go up by 2 per cent , the total market demand for X may also go up by 2 per cent ? Mrs A 's by somewhat more and Mrs B 's by somewhat less . The argument in the text depends upon the combined market income elasticity of demand , rather than upon each individual consumer 's elasticity of demand , being equal to unity .  | If income elasticities of demand are not all unity , the increase in real incomes by 2 per cent might cause the demand for some things to go up by more than 2 per cent and for others to go up by less than 2 per cent or ? in the extreme case of an inferior good ? actually to fall . If the invention is biased in favour of saving labour and against saving land , then this factor alone would cause the wage rate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the national income would he redistributed against wage earners and in favour of landlords . If the families of wage earners consumed a rather different set of products from those consumed by the families of landlords , this redistribution of money income would cause the demand for some products to rise by more than 2 per cent and for others to rise by less than 2 per cent or even to fall . If the invention is biased in favour of the production of textiles , then the cost price of textiles will have fallen by more than 2 per cent , i.e. will have fallen relatively to the cost-price of other products . This change in relative prices to consumers will cause consumers to shift their demands . If the price of textiles falls heavily relatively to the price of other things and if textiles are good substitutes for a number of other things , then the amount of textiles which consumers will want to purchase may greatly exceed the 2 per cent increase in their output which the fall in the price of textiles is ex hypothesi designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invention as taking place in two stages . ' We start in an initial ' equilibrium . Then there is an invention . We consider the nature of an intermediate ' equilibrium , i.e. of the changes in factor prices and of product prices which , in view of the overall biases of the invention , would be necessary to give entrepreneurs the incentive to increase every product by the same percentage as a result of the invention . We then consider whether the consumers ' market would also be in balance in this ' intermediate ' equilibrium . If not , then we consider the final ' equilibrium as being the intermediate ' equilibrium modified by shifts of consumers ' demands equal to the differences between the uniform increases in all outputs which occur in the intermediate ' equilibrium and the amounts which , in view of the changes in the distribution of the national income and of the product prices of the intermediate ' t These stages are merely a logical device for comparing the initial stationary equilibrium ( A ) with the final stationary equilibrium ( C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ? i.e. what is called the intermediate ' equilibrium in the text . We compare B with A and then C with B , as a means of comparing C with A. The economy is not to be thought of as moving in time from A to B and then from B to C. In this volume we are not concerned with the dynamic process of adjustment , only with the comparison between two final stationary equilibria . The dynamic process of adjustment will be a major topic of a later volume .  | equilibrium , consumers would wish to purchase . This final adjustment from the intermediate ' to the final ' equilibrium requires the application to the intermediate ' equilibrium of the analysis which we have developed at length in the previous chapter to consider the effects in the economy of a shift of demand . It is not possible to give a general account covering all possible cases . But the following is a particular example which may help the reader to apply the method to other particular cases . Consider once again a 10 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. textiles ) which would represent a 2 per cent overall increase in productivity for the economy as a whole . This invention is biased in favour of saving L and producing Y. The intermediate ' equilibrium will thus be one in which ( i ) the price of L has fallen and of other factors ( e.g. N ) has risen , ( ii ) all outputs are up by 2 per cent , and ( iii ) the price of Y has fallen by more than 2 per cent while the price of the general run of products has fallen less or not at all . Suppose now that Y is a product for which ( i ) the income elasticity of demand is high and ( ii ) there are a large range of close substitutes in consumers ' demands . Then there will be a large excess demand for textiles , and excess supply of other products in the intermediate ' equilibrium . It is as if we started in the intermediate ' equilibrium and were then faced with a large shift of demand away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adjustments discussed in the last chapter . Y-intensive processes will become profitable and other processes unprofitable ; Y and close substitutes for Y will rise in price so that entrepreneurs rearrange their output programmes in their favour ; since the textile industry is Y-intensive and L-intensive , its expansion will increase the demand for L relatively to other factors ; the price of L will rise again and of other factors fall again as compared with the intermediate ' equilibrium ; input programmes will be remodelled to save L and production programmes remodelled to use factors whose price has fallen as compared with the intermediate ' equilibrium to produce products whose price has risen as compared with the intermediate ' equilibrium . If the income elasticity of demand for Y and the elasticity of substitution between Y and other products are both sufficiently high , the re-expansion of the production of Y from the intermediate ' equilibrium may be so great that more resources are employed in the textile industry in the final equilibrium than in the initial equilibrium . Demands will be so shifted on to Y that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent increase in productivity in the Y-industry and the output of other products in general is actually reduced as a result of the invention . In this case , since the Y-industry is L-intensive , the demand for L will have risen relatively to the demand for  | other factors as between the initial ' and the final ' equilibrium . Income will ultimately have been redistributed in favour of L and against the owners of other factors such as N. If , on the other hand , the income elasticity of demand for Y were very low ( a fortiori if Y were an inferior good for which the income elasticity of demand were zero ) and if the elasticity of substitution in consumers ' demand between Y and other products were very low , then in the intermediate ' , equilibrium there might be no excess demand for Y ? possibly even an excess supply of Y. The rise in real incomes and the relative fall in the price of Ywould have stimulated a very small increase in the demand for Y. The depression in the demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case be maintained or even accentuated in the final ' equilibrium . The L-intensive Y-industry would be greatly contracted . In between these two extremes is the case where the income elasticity of demand for Y and the elasticity of substitution between Y and other products were such that consumers spent the same proportion of their incomes on Yin the final ' equilibrium as they did in the initial ' equilibrium . The same proportion of the same money national income would be being spent on the purchase of factors for the Y-industry . Its demand for L would be neither expanded nor contracted ; and , as far as this major influence was concerned , there would be no ultimate change in the price of L or of other factors of production.l So much for the effects of inventions . We turn now to the second type of change on the supply side mentioned at the beginning of this chapter , namely a change in the supply of one of the factors of production . Suppose , by way of example , that there is a once-for-all increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of working age ) . We started in an initial stationary competitive equilibrium . How will this change in the supply of L affect this equilibrium ? The immediate effect in our competitive economy would , of course , be that the excess supply in the labour market would cause the money 1 It is interesting to note that if the owners of L spend an abnormally high proportion of their income on Y this accentuates whichever movement in the price of L would have taken place for other reasons . Thus suppose that in the final equilibrium the Y-industry is expanded and the demand for L is raised as compared with the initial equilibrium . Then the shift of income from the owners of other factors to L will intensify the increase in the demand for Y and so in the demand for L. But if in the final equilibrium the demand for L had been lower than in the initial equilibrium , the shift of income from the owners of L would have accentuated the reduction in the demand for Y and so in the demand for L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of their income on Y , an increase in the incomes of L will damp down the demand for Y and so for L ; and a decrease in the incomes of L will stimulate the demand for Y and so for L.  | wage rate to fall . We are assuming that the total money national income remains constant so that the fall in the money price of a factor of production , labour , allows more employment to be given in the economy as a whole . The fall in the wage rate will make all L-intensive processes particularly profitable and these will be expanded . This expansion of L-intensive processes will cause ( i ) an increase in the supply of those products in which these processes are intensive ( in our previous example , if the textile industry is labour intensive then a fall in the price of labour ( L ) will cause an expansion in the output of textiles ? Y ) and ( ii ) , in a many-factor economy , an increase in the demand for any particular factors in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the textile industry which is intensive in L is also intensive in M , being especially disintensive in N , etc. , the expansion of the textile industry will lead to a particularly heavy increased demand for M ) . Thus the first effects of the fall in the money wage rate will be to increase the supply of products like Y and to increase the demand for factors like M which are complementary to L. The price of Y will fall and of M will rise . The ease of absorption of the increased supply of L into the system will thus depend , inter alia , upon the ease with which increased supplies of Y can be absorbed into the consumers ' market . If a small fall in the price of Y relatively to other products causes a large shift of consumers from other products on to Y , then much L can be absorbed into an expanded textile industry ( L- and Y-intensive ) . Similarly , the scope for the expansion of this industry depends upon the ease with which , when its price goes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the L in the textile industry . The increased demand for M will raise the price of M ; this will make other M-intensive processes unprofitable and will lead to their contraction . Thus the prices of Y and of good substitutes for Yin consumers ' demand will fall ; the price of some close complements with Y in consumers ' demand may be driven up ; the price of L and of other factors which are close substitutes for L will fall ; and the price of a factor such as M which is complementary to L will rise . These price changes will cause other processes which are intensive in the products whose prices have fallen and in the factors whose prices have risen to become unprofitable ; and it will cause other processes which are intensive in the products whose prices have risen and in the factors whose prices have fallen to become profitable ; the former will contract and the latter expand . There will be a whole series of repercussions of this kind , each helping to absorb relatively plentiful factors ? and in particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | These adjustments between processes will be supplemented by adjustments within processes . Within each process entrepreneurs will have an incentive to increase their employment of the cheap factors ? and in particular of L ? to take the place of the relatively more expensive factors , to shift their outputs from the cheaper to the more expensive products , and to take on more of the cheap factors ? and in particular of L ? to produce more of the expensive products . The greater the substitutability between products in consumers ' demands , the greater the range of variety of available processes for expansion and contraction , the greater the flexibilities of each process , the less important are complementarities in consumers ' demands and the less important are complementarities between inputs , cornplementarities between outputs , and antipathies between inputs and outputs in the productive system , the smaller will be the changes in relative prices both of products and of factors which are needed to absorb a given amount of additional L into the system . It is of interest to consider what may have happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The increased supply of L with unchanged amounts of the other factors will mean that there are more factors in general to be hired and that there are more products in general being produced for sale to consumers . With a constant total of money expenditure on products and of money incomes to factors the general level of factor prices and of money prices must both have fallen . It is possible that every money price in the economy will have fallen absolutely and that changes in relative prices will take place only by some prices falling more than others . Consider first the money prices of the factors . If all the conditions in the economy are favourable to the ready absorption of L into the system , a very small fall in the price of L relatively to other factor prices will be required . In this case the proportion of the constant money national income going to L will rise ; a 10 per cent increase in L can be absorbed by , say , only a 5 per cent fall in the money wage rate ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the quantity of L employed outweighs the fall in the price per unit of L ; out of a constant total money income less is left over to go to the unchanged amounts of other factors ; their money prices will also have fallen , though by less than the 5 per cent fall in the price of L , some relative fall in the price of L being required to absorb more L into the system . In this case the price of every other factor might have fallen . But this is not necessarily the case . If there were in a many-factor economy some particular factor which was a close complement to L in many uses , its money price might have gone up ,  | in which case the price of all the other factors would have fallen all the more . In the opposite case in which conditions make it very difficult to absorb L into the system a 20 per cent fall in the price of L might be needed to absorb a 10 per cent increase in the amount of L ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of the constant money income would be left over to go to all the other factors so that L would receive a lower proportion of the total income ; and the general level of all factor prices other than L would have to rise . In this case all other factor prices might rise . But this is not necessarily so because among these other factors there might be one which was a particularly close substitute for L and the price of such a factor might fall in sympathy with the price of L ; but this would mean that the other factor prices rose all the more . In the case in which all factor prices without exception fell it is very probable that all product prices would also fall . If every process produced only a single product , this would necessarily be so . For since the cost of every factor was lower , the cost of producing every product would be lower ; and in the new equilibrium , therefore , since prices must equal costs , every product price would be lower . ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy is difficult and large changes in relative prices are necessary it is quite probable that some product prices will actually rise . For example , in the case in which the prices of some factors go up absolutely there may well be a rise in the costs and so in the prices of those products which rely for their production particularly on these more expensive factors . If labour and land were the only two factors in the economy and if an increased supply of labour could be absorbed into the economy only if the wage rate fell very sharply , a smaller proportion of the constant money national income would go to wages and a higher to rents . The money rent per acre would rise ; and the cost-price of products which were sufficiently land-intensive in their production would also rise , while the cost-price of very labour-intensive products would fall sharply . 1 This is not absolutely certain if a process produces two or more products . Consider labour and land used to produce sheep which provide wool and mutton . The prices of labour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep is lower . But suppose that the technical possibilities of producing a different ratio of wool to mutton are very limited , and that changes in other industries ( e.g. the increased outputs elsewhere of a substitute for wool and of a complement for mutton ) have greatly reduced the demand for wool and increased the demand for mutton . Then the lower cost of a sheep may be covered by a much lower price of wool combined with a somewhat higher price of mutton .  | In the two previous chapters we have discussed the economic system as if it were composed of a number of separate and independent processes within each of which there is the possibility of some marginal adjustments in the pattern of inputs and outputs . There are engineering works and dairy farms ; in the engineering works some adjustments can be made in the proportions in which different engineering products are produced and in the proportions in which different factors are employed ; in the dairy farms some adjustments can be made between the proportions in which butter and cheese are produced or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works remains an engineering works and a dairy farm a dairy farm . This is in fact a realistic and useful way of regarding the economic system and we shall continue often to employ it in the remaining chapters of this work . It will , however , already be clear to the attentive reader of the last two chapters that the problems involved in expanding one process and contracting another are very similar to those involved in making an adjustment of the inputs and outputs of a given process . In this chapter we shall consider a method of analysis which makes no distinction between adjustments as between processes and adjustments within processes . The method consists in supposing that no adjustments within processes are possible . Ea ' h process consists of a method of production whereby a given amount of each factor is needed to produce a given amount of each output ; in any one process some inputs and some outputs may , of course , be zero ? the dairy farm produces no steel ; the scale of operation of the process may be varied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same percentage and every output will be thereby increased by the same percentage . There are , however , a large number of processes , some of which differ rather slightly from each other . For example , there may be many dairy farm ' processes : one may produce much butter and little cheese with much labour and little land ; a second may produce little butter and much cheese with much labour and little land ; a third may produce much butter and little cheese with little labour and much land ; a fourth may produce little butter and much cheese with little labour
