 | No First Lady ever came to the White House with more solid experience in big-league household management than the brown-eyed Southern lady known as Lady Bird Johnson . It would be hard to imagine a less appropriate nickname . There is nothing remotely birdlike about Mrs. Lyndon Baines Johnson . On the contrary , she is an extremely well-organized person who has proved herself not only as a devoted wife and mother , but also as a canny business executive and a seasoned political trouper . ( She logged 35,000 vote-wooing miles in seventy-one days during the Presidential campaign of 1960 . ) Basically Mrs. Johnson is a shy woman . She 's also a woman with unlimited reserves of energy and nerves of steel . While bringing up two rambunctious daughters and supervising the operation of her holdings in television and radio , she simultaneously managed six separate Johnson establishments : a chateaulike town house in Washington ; a duplex apartment in Austin , Texas ; a 430-acre Texas cattle ranch ; a home on nearby Lake Wirtz , and two guest houses on the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this executive potential . She was born on a prosperous East Texas cotton plantation and christened Claudia Alta Taylor , but no one has ever called her that . ( When she was a baby her Negro nursemaid observed that she looked " just like a little lady bird , " and the nickname stuck . The new President even listed his wife that way in his official biography . After all , the initials matched his own ? as do his two daughters ' . ) Left motherless at the age of five , and gently reared by her father and a maiden aunt in the semifeudal society of the Old South , she knew exactly nothing about housekeeping twenty-nine years ago when she married . " I was completely unprepared for housekeeping , " she recalls apologetically . " I had never swept a floor that I remember , and I had certainly never cooked a meal . " The twenty-one-year-old bride learned fast . Moving into a Washington apartment , she was soon keeping house so efficiently on her husband 's $267-a-month salary ( as a congressional secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an automobile and to buy an $18.75 government bond every payday . During the years of her husband 's rapid rise from secretary to congressman to senator to senate majority leader to Vice-President and President , Lady Bird kept the tax records , paid the household bills , signed the checks , and pyramided a $21,000 investment in a run-down radio station into a million-dollar property . She even ran LBJ 's congressional office without pay for eight months after Pearl Harbor , while her husband was off in the South Pacific winning a Silver Star on bombing missions . In addition to being competent , the new First Lady is friendly , good-looking , intelligent and faultlessly groomed . Nonetheless , it was not easy for her at the age of fifty to step into the glamorous shoes of 34-year-old Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy . Never having been a scenestealer , the older woman made a point of remaining in the background during those first agonizing weeks . Inherently thoughtful , it was typical of her to urge Mrs. Kennedy  | to stay on in the White House as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue on the third floor of the Executive Mansion . With her direct but diffident manner of speaking , it was also typical for her to say at the time : " I wish to heaven I could serve Mrs. Kennedy 's happiness . I can at least serve her convenience . " But , just as her husband wasted no time in taking over his new responsibilities , the First Lady quickly began to make changes in the operation of the White House . Zephyr Wright , the Johnsons ' long-time Negro cook , was assigned full charge of the family kitchen and dining room on the second floor of the Executive Mansion . The elaborate French cuisine which was Jacqueline Kennedy 's hallmark was replaced by Texasstyle cookery . Despite the fact that the President has been on a calorie-counting diet since his 1955 heart attack , dinners feature the hot breads and corn pone that have been Zephyr Wright specialties for twenty-one years . Pedernales River chili , enchiladas , frijoles and hominy grits are likewise specialties of the house . Whereas Jackie Kennedy loved to ride to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Bird 's favorite outdoor sport is deer shooting . Both she and the President are crack marksmen , and each autumn bag their quota on their Texas ranch . Whereas Mrs. Kennedy 's favorite recipe ( for poulet a l'estrayon ) begins : " One three-pound chicken , clarified butter for sauteing , two or three shallots , " Mrs. Johnson goes in for deer-meat sausages and follows a recipe which starts in typical Texas fashion : " Take half a hog and half a deer . Grind together and add twenty-five ounces of salt , twenty ounces of black pepper . . . . " Mrs. Johnson Thinks Big in matters of business no less than in meal-planning . Born to comfortable affluence , she invested the first $10,000 of the inheritance she received from her mother in her husband 's career . With it she financed his initial race for Congress , and it paid off handsomely . The rangy Texan won a special election of 1937 which eventually led him to the Presidency . In 1941 , Lady Bird 's father turned over to her the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt-ridden Austin radio station with nine employees , and developed it into the thriving , 104-man television station KTBC . ( Since becoming First Lady , she has placed her radio-television holdings in trusteeship , to avoid any suggestion of conflict of interest . ) Despite her wealth , Lady Bird Johnson has always been a thrifty spender and has kept track of family income and outlay with the accuracy of a C.P.A. For example , it has always been her practice when traveling unofficially to fly tourist class . " You get to exactly the same place at the same time , " she says matter-of-factly . " The only difference is that you do n't get a drink or quite as much elbowroom and extra service . I 've had to travel so much that the saving has added up to a lot . I 'm just real grateful that they have such a thing as tourist prices . " Similarly , although she owned vast tracts of land in her mother 's native Alabama as well as in Texas , she used to haunt the outof-season sales racks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( In those days her expansive husband made a practice of buying costly originals for her , purchased on lone Dallas shopping trips . As President , he , of course , wo n't be able to do so , but Lady Bird intends to be guided by his tastes . ) " I want clothes to serve me , instead of me serving them , " she says . " I begrudge making a career out of clothes . But Lyndon likes bright colors and dramatic lines that do great things for your figure , and I 'll try to please him . I 've really wanted to learn the art of dressing , because you do n't sell for what you 're worth unless you look well . " In small things , the sometimes extravagant new President has been the penny-pincher of the family . With a smile , Lady Bird reports : " Lyndon always comes right along behind the children , turning off lights in their rooms . He really has that light complex to a pronounced degree . I expect it comes from his boyhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have electricity until he was in his teens . " Mrs. Johnson is a frankly indulgent mother who trusts her two teenaged daughters implicitly and offers only the most gentle kind of direction . Nineteen-year-old Lynda Bird has high praise for her mother 's  | methods . " We have moral togetherness , " Lynda Bird says , " Lucy and I always know that whether Mother is with us or not , she is thinking of us . Mother has never told us when to be in from a party or date . She just leaves it to our own good judgment . How can you break faith with a woman who does that ? " President Johnson wholeheartedly shares Lady Bird 's trust . " I 've had a lot of disappointments in my lifetime , " he says , " but never with my family . I 've got the best wife and the best two daughters in the world . How Lady Bird can do all the things she does without ever stubbing her toes I 'll just never know . I sure stub mine sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent now trails the Johnson girls wherever they go , but there was no interference in their social life before that protection began . Mrs. Johnson believes the old adage : Bend a twig in the way it should grow , and the young tree will take care of itself . Understandably , Mrs. Johnson has recently been concerned about the effect of the national spotlight on her daughters . " It is a problem , " she muses . " Our children considered themselves deprivileged even before their father became Vice-President . For years they 've wanted more of his companionship and attention . " In a no-nonsense tone she continues : " I 've tried to impress on them that their father 's importance does n't rub off on them . To feel self-important makes no sense . The thing to aspire to , I tell them , is self-responsibility . " When the new President talks of the woman who has been his closest confidante and companion for twenty-nine years , he talks with his heart . " Lady Bird trusts her children and they know it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when they seek her advice she does n't lay down the law , but helps them weigh all sides and find their own answers . " I know a lot about mothers . My own , I thought , was best in the world , and when I taught school I met many others . But 1 never knew one I thought was more devoted , without ever being gushy , than my wife . " He pauses thoughtfully , and then continues : " She waited ten years to have a baby , and has lost four children  | with miscarriages . I remember once ? about two years after Lynda Bird was born ? when suddenly Lady Bird started running a high temperature . She insisted it was all right for me to leave her and go to the office , but the minute I left the room she called the doctor . She was in terrific pain , and bleeding with a hopeless tubular pregnancy . . . . She 's a person who just wo n't admit her own pain , or ask for mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " President Johnson recalls another example of his wife 's disregard of self . In 1948 , the night before voters were to decide the fate of senatorial candidate Lyndon Johnson , a car in which Lady Bird was riding overturned twice . It landed in a ditch , and left Mrs. Johnson bruised and bleeding . Here , in the President 's words , is the rest of the story : " She got out of the mud , went on and stood in a reception line ( in a dress borrowed from her hostess ) , and then met me in San Antonio to make a speech . She did n't even tell me about the accident until the next day . I wanted her to rest , but she went back to Austin and got on the phone with my mother and sisters . They divided the Austin phone book between them and called everyone in it , in my behalf . We won by eightyseven votes . " Most earlier First Ladies have had a few months ' hiatus between election and Inauguration Day , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , Mrs. Johnson . By the sudden cruel blast of an assassin 's rifle , she found herself the wife of a President . It was a position she had not sought nor even wanted . These first months have been her severest test . Characteristically , she has weathered them with good sense and good taste . She has decided against making any major alteration in the historic building which is now her home , but she has converted two family bedrooms on the second floor within calling distance of the Presidential suite ? into frilly boudoirs for Lynda Bird and Lucy Baines . In addition , she has added to the White House furnishings her own favorite pieces of furniture , paintings and objets d'art , including her collection of artifacts . After Caroline 's school found other suitable quarters , she transformed the nursery-solarium with its adjoining snack bar  | into a room for family activities and entertaining . Lynda Bird , a sophomore at the University of Texas , is engaged to marry Ensign Bernard Rosenbach , a 22-year-old Annapolis graduate assigned to the USS Jonas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " her mother says , " and they plan to be married next summer . The time depends on Uncle Sam , and Bernie 's sailing orders . " Vivacious , brunette Lynda Bird , who in 1961 was crowned Azalea Queen , will make a striking bride . If all goes as planned , she will walk down the curving White House stairs on the arm of her father . It will be the first White House wedding since Eleanor Wilson married Secretary of the Treasury William McAdoo in the Blue Room , almost 50 years ago . Sixteen-year-old Lucy Baines , a junior at the National Cathedral School for Girls in Washington , will be the maid of honor , but whether there will also be a White House wedding in her future will probably depend on her father 's re-election fate . Her current heart interest is Jack Olson , a freshman at the University of Wisconsin , whom she met in Washington last summer while he was working for a Wisconsin congressman . Lady Bird Johnson has come a long way in the twenty-nine years since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she has not changed . The man who knows her best says : " Although she 's past fifty , she has never lost any of the modesty and shyness she had as a young girl . She is just as reluctant to be pushy now as then . She is a warm , understanding person who is patient and genuinely just . I never saw her slice a corner on anything . I suppose her greatest strength is that she can adjust to any situation , and do a good job of whatever she has to do . " Of her own development from a shy , retiring Southern girl to a capable , poised First Lady she says : " Lyndon challenges you . He always expects more of you than you 're really capable of mentally or physically . Somehow that makes you try a little bit harder and makes you produce a little more . It is sometimes tiring , but it is great fertilizer for growth . " Lady Bird is still growing . Those who know her predict that she will one day take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
