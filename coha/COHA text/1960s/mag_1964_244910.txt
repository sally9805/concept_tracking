A space race is on in Western Europe , but the goal is not some distant planet : it is a down-to-earth place to live . Europeans are suffering from the tightest housing squeeze since the immediate postwar days . Rentals have soared , and the price of private houses has shot out of reach for millions of people . Last week , as government officials everywhere stewed over what to do , France 's overbuilt bureaucracy took a few steps to ease its Crise du Loge-ment . It freed some state lands for housing development , announced a major slum-razing and rebuilding program , and sliced back the paperwork that now stymies building permits for up to two years . <P> Halfhearted Efforts . A recent Common Market survey shows that the monthly rent for a three-room apartment in a lower-middle-class district averages $65 in Diisseldorf , $70 in Brussels and a skyscraping $180 in Paris , Europe 's toughest town for housing . In Italy 's cities , unskilled workers have a hard time finding one-room flats for $50 , which represents one-half of their monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a two-bedroom flat in a middle-class district markets for $12.000 in Amsterdam , $14,000 in Hamburg , and $30,000 to $40,000 in Paris-not counting monthly maintenance payments . Costs for private houses commonly run much higher than in the U.S. A typical two-bedroom bungalow in Germany sells for $15,000 , exclusive of extra charges for the land it is built on and for such simple amenities as built-in closets . Trying to deflate prices , municipal authorities in Britain and other European countries are helping to promote the sale of prefab houses that can be erected in an hour or less . <P> <P> There are plenty of reasons for the overall scarcity . Wartime bombers destroyed much of Europe 's housing , and most of what was left was not much good . At least 12% of the houses in France , Germany and Britain were built more than a century ago , and are without indoor plumbing . The shortage has been worsened by massive movements of people to the cities : Eastern refugees into West Germany , dispossessed Algerians into France , and job-seeking Southern Italians into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priced housing , builders have catered to the lucrative luxury markets , putting up Miami-style apartments that now command as much as $125,000 in Rome . National governments have made halfhearted efforts to create space for the middle class , but have been snarled by endless red tape , inadequate budgets , and a shortage of private capital that has lifted the common mortgage interest rate to 10% to 15% a year . <P> Upper Levitt . The incredible demand for space has permitted fly-by-night entrepreneurs to debase Europe 's reputation for quality craftsmanship . Many new houses and apartments have cracker-thin walls , minimum soundproofing , unpainted interiors . On a recent tour of Europe , 20 top U.S. construction experts were shocked by the high prices and lack of standards . Said Tacoma 's Daniel Brown , research director of the Douglas Fir Plywood Association : " There 's no comparing quality here with the U.S. " <P>
