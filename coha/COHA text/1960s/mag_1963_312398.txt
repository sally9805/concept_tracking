The witness arrived in Washington unheralded and drove straight to Capitol Hill , where Senator John Stennis ' Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee was meeting in a closed-door session . Nobody in the Administration 's upper echelons , none of the Pentagon 's top civilian officials , not even Defense Secretary McNamara had been forewarned that he was going to testify . But it was not long before everybody in town knew that the Strategic Air Command 's General Thomas S. Power had been around . " The Old Man , " said a McNamara aide after Power finished speaking his mind on the nuclear test ban treaty , " will blow a gasket when he hears this . " <P> No doubt about that . Power , who has bucked his bosses often during his career , expressed outright disagreement with the Administration 's position on the partial test ban . " The treaty , " he told the Senators flatly , " is not in the best interests of the U.S. " What bothered Power , said Stennis after the secret hearing , was a gnawing doubt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undisputed superiority in nuclear power if it ratified the treaty . General Power believes this is the only present deterrent to war . " <P> Among those disagreeing with Power were the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Their official position , as expressed in a statement approved by all of them : " While there are military disadvantages to the treaty , they are not so serious as to render it unacceptable . " The senators posed a question : If the treaty had not already been initialed , would you be for it ? Said Army General Earle G. Wheeler , " I would probably have come up with the same decision . " The Navy 's Admiral David L. McDonald claimed that it " was not a decisive element . " Declared Marine General David M. Shoup , " I had access to the words of the treaty before it was initialed and I was in favor of its being initialed . " <P> Only Air Force General Curtis E. LeMay , Power 's predecessor as commander of SAC , demurred to any degree : " I would think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things bothering LeMay : lack of an effective U.S. anti-ballistic missile , failure of the U.S. to develop a 50-to-100-megaton bomb . Said LeMay , whose blue uniform set him apart from his three khaki-clad colleagues : " There are net disadvantages from the military standpoint . " Still , since the treaty had been initialed , LeMay was now willing to go along . <P> A Clay Pigeon . When the chiefs stepped down , it was the scientists ' turn . Dr. Edward H. Teller , one of the developers of the hydrogen bomb and strong advocate of intensive atmospheric test ing , told the Senate that " the signing was a mistake . If you ratify the treaty , you will have committed an enormously greater mistake . " Teller 's chief objection was that the U.S. would be un able to perfect an anti-ballistic missile . Though he admits that a workable system would probably cost an astronomic $50 billion , he declared : " Missile defense may make the difference between our national survival and the end of the U.S. as a nation .
