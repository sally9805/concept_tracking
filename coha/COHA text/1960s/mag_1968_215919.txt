Some U.S. physicians asked last week whether the flurry of surgical virtuosity in heart transplants might be premature . A Canadian heart surgeon said it was . The Soviet Union 's health ministry forbade Russian surgeons to do such transplants . Germany 's Dr. Werner Forssmann , who won a Nobel Prize for dangerously daring heart research performed on himself , said : " I consider it a crime to perform an operation in a field where fundamental research is not yet finished . " <P> Although the heart surgeons who had performed transplants obviously did not agree , they made no secret of their concern over the ethical problems involved . Dr. Shumway describes the procedure not as an experiment but as a " clinical trial . " He does not expect heart transplants ever to become routine , partly because of the problem of supply , but he looks forward to the day when they can be considered effective treatment for selected patients . <P> The question then arises : For which patients ? A basic rule in surgery is : " Never perform a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller , less radical operation offered any hope for any of the first five recipients of heart transplants . They were all patients whose condition was judged to be " terminal , " whose end might come any day . In those circumstances , Shumway 's " clinical trial " can be ethically justified . <P> Scratching the Heart . What the surgical spectaculars have done , though nobody planned it that way , is to divert attention-and possibly research money-from corrective measures for heart disease in its earlier stages , and ultimately , of course , from prevention . There are already several surgical approaches designed to repair hearts after coronary occlusion but before the damage becomes near-total and irreversible , as it had in the transplant patients . <P> The oldest of these , pioneered 30 years ago by Cleveland Surgeon Claude S. Beck , involves opening the heart sac and scratching the heart 's surface , so that in self-defense it builds up an increased blood supply . A second technique devised by Montreal 's Dr. Arthur Vineberg requires the freeing of minor arteries in the chest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the removal of a pie-cut wedge of damaged heart , after which the edges of healthy muscle are stitched together . There are , in addition , several methods of reaming atherosclerotic plugs from coronary arteries . <P> All these techniques have been successful , in varying degrees , for small numbers of patients . But until recently , a major difficulty has been for the surgeon to determine in advance where and how big the obstruction was , and so decide how to treat it . That has now been overcome by improved techniques for X-raying the heart 's arteries , developed at the Cleveland Clinic by Dr. F. Mason Sones Jr . Relying on these , two of the Clinic 's surgeons , Dr. Donald B. Effler and Dr. Rene Favaloro , have performed 51 operations of a new and promising type . They cut out the diseased segment of the coronary artery itself . Then they replace it with a graft . But unlike the transplant surgeons , Dr. Effler 's team has no worry about rejection because it gets the graft material from one of the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two of these patients died soon after the operation ; the others are doing well , and X rays show that their coronary blood flow was instantly improved .
