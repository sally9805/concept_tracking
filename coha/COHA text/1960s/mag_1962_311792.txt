As the U.S. space program raises its horizons , new and younger men are needed to perform the difficult tasks that deeper space exploration demands . Last week in Houston the National Aeronautics and Space Administration unveiled its second batch of astronauts-nine young spacemen on whose shoulders will ride much of the success of the U.S. race to the moon . <P> Since they will be national heroes as well as hard-working technicians , it is only fitting that all are handsome , married ( average : two children ) , and with good backgrounds and college educations . They are slightly younger than the first batch ( 32.5 v. 34.5 for the older group when selected ) and for the first time include civilians-two of them . <P> Behind their pleasant facades are impressive records of experience and achievement . All were test pilots with an average of 2,800 flying hours each , 1,900 of them in jets . Four are Air Force pilots , three Navy ; the two civilians came from NASA and General Electric . They were selected from 253 applicants over a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 32 of those were selected for elaborate mental and physical testing . One was eliminated at this stage as too tall ( maximum allowable height : 6 ft. ) , and 31 went to Houston for the finals . <P> The new astronauts will begin their training on Oct. 1 . The first phase will be catching up with the Mercury program , but they will not be trained as pilots of the Mercury capsule . As potential Gemini and Apollo pilots , who may rendezvous around the moon or even land on it , they must learn esoteric subjects-including computer theory and celestial mechanics - that have to do with active space navigation . Their capsules will maneuver more or less freely , changing their orbits and trying to join other orbiting objects . The new astronauts will carry along their own propulsion systems and navigation instruments , and will wrestle with the strange and complicated forces that govern the motion of bodies in space . Thus , the brains of the . nine young spacemen will have to contain knowledge and skills that have never before been crammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
