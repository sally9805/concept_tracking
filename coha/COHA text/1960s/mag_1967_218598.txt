Any serious sports fan would be well advised to follow a couple of simple rules . Never show up late for a prizefight . And never leave the Indianapolis 500 early . <P> All those thousands of spectators who were already on their way home by the time last week 's Indy 500 reached the 492-mile mark could hardly be blamed , of course . One by one , they had seen most of their favorites fall by the wayside : Graham Hill , the 1966 winner , out on the 24th lap with a sick piston in his Lotus-Ford ; Mario Andretti , the speediest qualifier at 168.9 m.p.h. , out on the 59th lap when his Brawner-Ford threw a wheel on the No. 3 turn ; Dan Gurney , the second fastest qualifier ( at 167.2 m.p.h. ) , black-flagged on the 161st lap with a blown cylinder in his American Eagle . And they had watched , first with awe , then with mounting ennui , as Parnelli Jones , in his turbine-powered STP Special , made it look too easy-coasting almost soundlessly around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until with only three laps to go he had opened up nearly a full lap lead . <P> Gambling on Misfortune . The fans still should have stayed around . A. J. Foyt Jr . did . Twice before , in 1961 and 1964 , Foyt , 32 , had sneaked into Victory Lane at Indy when misfortune befell faster cars . A.J. was among a score of drivers who protested that Jones 's car should be banned from the 500-arguing that it really was an " airplane , " and that no piston-engined machine could possibly match the tremendous torque ( 1,000 foot-pounds ) and acceleration produced by its 550-h.p . Pratt &; Whitney power plant . But Foyt is nothing if not a pragmatist : he ordered a special " overdrive " gear installed in his Coyote-Ford to save his engine and cut down on fuel consumption . He was content to play tortoise to Jones 's hare , drive at a steady pace and allow Parnelli to pull away-gambling that the turbine car would break down before the 500 miles were up . <P> The strategy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just about given up hope . " I thought the turbine would be out of business within 300 laps , " he said later . " When the darn thing was still going by then , I figured Parnelli had won . " Then came Lap 197 . Just eight miles from the finish , a $6 ball bearing failed inside Jones 's gearbox . Into the pits went Parnelli , and into the lead went Foyt . Victory was just around the corner . Or disaster . Sweeping through the last turn and into the main straightaway , Foyt was only yards from the checkered flag when the track in front of him was suddenly filled with fishtailing racers and flying tires . Five cars had cracked up , and Foyt 's Coyote was sixth in line . Somehow , A.J. threaded his way through the wreckage and across the finish line . <P> Records All Around . Foyt became the fourth driver in history to score three victories at Indy . His purse for this one-$171,227-set a record . So did the average speed : 151.207 m.p.h . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foyt snapped Firestone 's 43-year-victory string at Indy.
