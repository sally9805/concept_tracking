Okinawa 's Kadena Airbase was last week proving that life in a remote U.S. military outpost facing Red China can indeed be beautiful . Not only were the brass and high-ranking non corns on Okinawa enjoying the privilege of private bathing beaches and their well-appointed clubs ; even privates and corporals could go to their own pleasure domes for evening relaxation . Each evening , busloads of pretty Okinawan hostesses pull up to the blue-and-white-striped awning before the Kadena Airmen 's Club ( for airmen up to corporal 's rank ) , and the gaily chattering girls-each of whom has passed a physical exam-hurry inside to dance with and entertain G.I.s . The charge for an evening 's companionship : 75 . <P> Girls are not all a G.I. gets . In the club foyer stand 34 slot machines that spill out jackpots of up to $1,500 . The slot machines are what makes everything else possible . There are bingo games with $1,000 prizes , plus free trips to Hawaii with all expenses paid . At the bar , cocktails and highballs cost 5 each . Steaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once a week , pizza pies are served free ; once a month , all drinks are on the house . <P> The Gimmicks . The job of thinking up new delights for the 4,447 club members belongs to M/Sgt . Joseph Peter Klauzar , 42 . A beefy ( 237 lbs . ) , Milwaukee-born former movie-house manager , Klauzar says : " When I was in showbiz the secret was constant gimmicks . " Some gimmicks come easy , like giving free champagne and 16-ounce steak dinners to any G.I. on his birthday , and again when he completes his tour of duty and must say " sayonara " to kindly Kadena . But only a showbiz expert like Club Manager Klauzar would have the daring to go shopping for Stateside acts like the De Castro Sisters , Sammy Davis Jr . or Ray Anthony 's band to provide a floor show for the tired airman who has spent a hard day in the hangar or office .
