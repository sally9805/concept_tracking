txt Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers retired from baseball today at the peak of his career because he feared he might permanently injure his arthritic left arm if he continued to pitch . The man generally recognized as the best pitcher in the major leagues told a news conference that the pain in his left elbow had grown progressively worse since it began three seasons ago . A few minutes before , he said , he had sent a letter to the Dodgers asking them to put him on the voluntary retired list . Koufax , whose salary of $125 , - 000 this year made him the highest-paid pitcher in history , has set numerous records and won many awards , even after hurting his arm in 1964 . " I feel I am doing the right thing and I do n't regret one minute of the past 12 years . The only regret is leaving baseball , " the 30-year-old pitcher said . Koufax , whose lightning-fast ball and sweeping curves had befuddled National League batsUnited Press International Telephoto Sandy Koufax announcing his retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Manager E. J. Bavasi just before the season ended that it likely was his last year . He said he informed Bavasi last night he felt he could wait nol longer to make the announce- , ment , even though Bavasi wanted him to wait until the Dodger owner , Walter O'Malley , returned Sunday from a tour of Japan with the team . " I felt that I was being too devious when my friends kept asking me what I was going to do , " Koufax said . " I did n't want to lie and I did n't want to keep on being devious . I had several calls at home last night . That 's when I finally decided to make the announcement . " He said his condition had progressed to the point that he had to have the left sleeves of his coats shortened . The shortening was not much , he said , but it indicated what was happening . He has been taking pills , shots and therapeutic treatments . " This is going to get worse as I get older . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . Might O'Malley persuade him to change his mind ? Sandy laughed . " No , my mind was made up , " he said . What will the Dodgers , the National League pennantwinners and World Series losers to the Baltimore Orioles , do . without him next year ? " Other ballplayers have retired and the team has managed to get by , " he replied . No Future as Hitter " Maybe the Dodgers will need a fourth starting pitcher , but if they can come up with another kid like Don Sutton they 'll be all right . " Koufax joined in the laughter when someone asked if the Dodgers would like to keep him for his hitting . Sandy is widely known as a weak hitter , even for a pitcher . He repeatedly explained that he simply did not want to risk a permanent disabling injury to his elbow . He said that in the past year he took more and more shots and medication than ever before and this worried him . " A few too many shots . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could be doing this a year too soon , but that 's the way it is . I do n't want to take a chance of completely disabling myself and losing the use of my left arm . It did n't get any better last year and it is worse this fall than last fall . " He said that he had been dropping things with his left hand and learning to do some things with his right . Pleased by His Consistency Koufax said he had many bright moments in his career but one thing that had pleased him in the last three or four ' years was his ability to pitch consistently . " I used to pitch a good game and then a bad game , " he said , " but in the last three or four years I feel that I was able to be consistent . " He has no yearning for a career as an actor but mentioned that he might be interested in a radio or television sports commentary job . Station WHN in New York has sent a telegram offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " said Sandy , again laughing . Romance ? Koufax , a bachelor , laughed , " I have made no decision on that . " He said he would vacation in the Bahamas after Thanksgiving . " After that I will make some decision about my future . I prefer to stay in Los Angeles , " he said . There were no members of the Dodger front office present at the news conference . Bavasi apparently did not want to attend . " Buzzie and I have had our arguments over the years , but we are good friends and I think we will remain that way , " said Sandy . Bavasi said later that Koufax 's retirement would seriously handicap the Dodgers in trading at the winter meetings next month . " I wanted Sandy to wait until after the winter meetings , " Bavasi said . " It would have been a big help to the club . But now that I have to go into the meetings without Koufax on our roster , the other clubs will have us right where they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( AP ) ?
