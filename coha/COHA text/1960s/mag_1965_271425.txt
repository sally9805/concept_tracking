The big little salt war between the U.S. and Mexico was finally over . On both sides of the border , there were cheers for the long-awaited settlement of a minor but highly abrasive issue : U.S. pollution of the Colorado River . <P> The Colorado is a life-giving stream for much of the arid U.S. Southwest and for Mexico 's Mexicali Valley . Under a 1944 treaty , the U.S. promised to share the river for irrigation . Mexico built a dam one mile below the border , spider-webbed the once desolate Mexicali Valley with irrigation canals . Then in 1961 , under the Wellton-Mohawk reclamation project in Arizona 's Yuma Desert , U.S. cotton growers began draining salty irrigation water from their soil-and flushed the residue back into the river , whose salt content rose from a tolerable 800 parts per 1,000,000 to more than 6,000 . Mexicali crops withered , and the Mexican government estimated farm losses at $80 million . <P> The dispute , of course , gave agitators a fine anti-Yanqui talking point ; in one demonstration , 4,000 campesinos marched noisily past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt . Realizing that the U.S. was vulnerable under international law , Presidents Kennedy and Johnson pressed hard for a solution . Under the new agreement-not a formal treaty - the U.S. will spend $5,000,000 to build a 13-mile drainage canal that will divert the salty water from the Wellton-Mohawk project into the Colorado River at a point safely below the Mexican Dam . If pollution remains dangerously high at the end of five years , the U.S. and Mexico will get together to figure out what else to do .
