 | Saving a City from a Cloud of Death When hurricane Betsy rampaged over southern Louisiana last September , our inland shipping suffered its worst disaster . Left in Betsy 's wake were 200 sunken or stranded vessels . But the most urgent question was the fate of one particular craft . Tied up awaiting a tow at a Baton Rouge dock had been the unmanned barge MTC 602 , with a cargo of 600 tons of deadly chlorine . Some time in the night of Sept. 9 , Betsy ripped it from its moorings . By next morning , MTC 602 had vanished . Apparently the runaway barge , swamped by a wave , had nose-dived to the bottom of the Mississippi River ? at some place unknown . If the liquid chlorine in the barge 's four tanks escaped , it would turn into a greenishyellow poison gas that could kill tens of thousands of people . Bubbling to the river 's surface , the gas could be swept by a breeze into Baton Rouge , a city of J50,000 . At the U. S. Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Col. Lawrence W. Norton IL the crew-cut . Lurch boiled Deputy District Engineer , got the 1 ' ' ' . ' .... . A , - , . ... A  | word from his commanding officer : " Larry , we 've got to send someone to search for that chlorine barge . You 're it . " Norton could picture the bargeful of liquid chlorine lying on the bottom like a ticking bomb . All he asked was , " When do I leave ? " Then Ile drove fast to Baton Rouge . President Johnson had ordered the full forces of the federal government to be made available . Norton , as Search and Recovery Project Officer , was assigned to coordinate all efforts to find the sunken barge ? and to remove it , without spreading a cloud of death over the region . " I knew I had a tiger by the tail , " he told me . " The day after Betsy , I had flown a helicopter down the river for 115 miles . following every bend . Not the faintest trace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Baton Rouge braced for a potential catastrophe , he lived through a nightmare of suspense . He averaged three hours ' sleep a night , wondering if anything had been overlooked that might cause a devastating leak . " We had a lot to worry about , " he says . " As the river level fell , could a ship ram the wreck ? Would a dropped anchor smash a chlorine tank ? Would a weakened safety valve of a tank blow ? One of our first moves was to close the river to shipping along a 38-mile stretch . " The Coast Guard sent out helicopters ,  | picket boats , and cutters . Our patrol boats , with fathometers going , located four sunken objects , and the Navy spotted 11 . But none was the missing MTC 602 . " Dragging the river with chains between two boats proved fruitless . Thirteen Army divers from Fort Belvoir and Fort Eustis , Va. , and 19 Navy divers drew blanks . On orders from Washington , two Navy planes and the destroyer Hyman , using electronic sub-hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain . " Baffling mischance . This sub-searching gear had successfully spotted a sunken chlorine barge near Natchez , Miss. , in 1962 PS , April , 1963 . It did n't work at Baton Rouge because eight other barges happened to be on the surface right above the sunken MTC 602 . The airborne gear picked up only the floating barges , which masked the one beneath . " All this time we maintained surveillance by squirting ammonium hydroxide in the water , " Norton goes on . " If a white cloud appeared , we 'd know chlorine was leaking . " Someone said to me , You could look for that barge all your life and never find it . ' I refused to believe that . " Pressure to find the barge and open the river to traffic kept mounting . Then the searchers heard of two remarkable devices called a Precision Sonar Profiler and a Sea Scanar . Only a few weeks before , these aids had confirmed the location of an airliner that crashed in Lake Michigan . They had also been used by Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peditions ; by salvage companies , in harbors ; and by commercial fishermen . The sonar sets , developed for ant marine warfare by Honeywell , Inc. , scan a river bottom by sending out sound imp from a boat . Echoes from the bottom bouncing back , give a reading or profile the riverbed ? which is automatically plotted on electro-sensitive paper , by a rec carried aboard , in as little as 10 seconds . Sophisticated versions of the sonar struments were rushed from Houston . Attaching them to survey boats , the Engi task force swept the muddy Mississipi river bottom with sound waves . To t acoustic " fingers , " probing slantwise as well as straight down , vessels on the surf were no obstruction . At 5:30 p.m. on Sept. 16 , just a ' a after Betsy struck , the first contact ' a made . Two " humps , " much like the si and shape of the cylindrical chlorine tanks , magically appeared on the graph paper . Found ? the lost barge . Navy divers went down at the indicated location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Identification was positive ? it was the MTC 602 . The barge was in 60 feet of water , just off the Louisiana State University campus . Notified 10 minutes after the profile came through , Norton hurried to the spot . Finding the lost barge was reason for rejoicing . But , as Norton tells it : " We still had a tough job ahead . How could we pull up that poison-laden barge without rupturing the tanks and causing , 1 holocaust ? Just how tightly was it sucked to the bottom ? " We all knew what happened four years before , when a chlorine tank car on a freight train was rammed and punctured by a hopper car at Morganza , La . There , the escaping fumes instantly killed a child and sent 64 people to hospitals . That was only 30 tons of chlorine . We had 600 tons ! " Salvage experts converged on Baton Rouge from all over the nation . There also were technicians from the barge 's builder , Bethlehem Steel , and from the contractor selected to do the salvaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle , every possible contingency , was minutely studied . They could n't risk trying to lift the barge from the outside ; its skin plate was only 5/16 of an inch thick , and slings  | would cut through it like a knife . On the Natchez job in 1962 , the chlorine tanks were strapped to the barge ; the straps could be cut , and the tanks lifted separately . But on the ITC 602 at Baton Rouge , the tanks were welded to the barge . This procedure was finally worked out : Divers would cradle the four tanks in 16 steel-cable slings ? four to each tank ? padded with oak blocks . The slings would be hooked , through 32 " pad eyes , " to a tremendous bridgelike frame called a " strongback " that would be lowered into the water . The strongback , specially designed for the project , would hang from lifting blocks on a giant 800-ton derrick with twin 240-foot towers . As the derrick pulled up the strongback , it would lift the four tanks at once , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most rugged assignment ? to hook up all connections , then put the sirongback on top . Thirty-two teams hired by the contractor , the J. Ray McDermott Co. , worked day and night seven days a week . With visibility almost zero in the murky water , fingers had to do the work of eyes . The current was tricky , sometimes moving at three feet a second . Occasionally a diver became disoriented , confusing the port side of the barge with the starboard side . And the hardware the divers handled was heavy . Slings were 2 ? - inch cables . Each shackle connecting a sling with the strongback weighed about 200 pounds ; each pin for a pad eye , 75 pounds . Everything but hand tools had to be controlled by power air lines . Generally a diver could stay down only 90 minutes a day . At times he 'd come up so exhausted that it took End of Big Lift has brought chlorine barge safely above water . Steel-cable hoisting slings had to be attached to chlorine tanks themselves , as seen here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . three men to lift him up out of the water . Working bare-handed by finger-feel meant skinned knuckles . One diver caught his hand in the wrong place and had to have nine stitches to sew him up . Another slashed off the tip of his thumb . Diver Joe Savoie got his hose hooked on a tree that had fallen across the sunken barge . " I could n't pull any slack , " he said later , " or let go to try to move ? I 'd risk the bends . So I stayed put for 15 minutes , until another diver pulled me free . " Every time a diver emerged , Norton waited tensely for his report . What was the condition of the barge ? Any serious damage ? Once , a diver reported he had found a hole big enough to stick his arm through , but did n't know where it was . It worried Norton . ( Later they found there was no such hole . ) Another time , bubbles suddenly - rose to the surface , and Norton was concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were only air bubbles , apparently released by displaced mud . The underwater job took 20 long days and nights . Everything had to be " glued " together , tied up in one rigid package . Sixteen slings had to be attached and connected to the strongback . Working blind , it took a lot of tedious maneuvering . The fateful day . At last came Lift Day ? Friday , Nov. 12 . All Baton Rouge and much of the nation held its breath . That morning the skies were overcast . A faint mist hung over the river . Army and Coast Guard helicopters hovered at the scene ? ready to alert the public from loudspeakers and follow the deadly cloud , if it appeared . Gas masks were issued to those Continued on page 238 APRIL 1966 1111  | on duty in the danger zone . The National Guard posted 600 men in case mass evacuation became necessary . Hundreds of hospital patients and old people had already been moved out , the day before . Standing by were gasoline-powered wiz machines , the kind used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , engine ( would try to roll back the fumes behind windwall , to give crewmen a chance t scramble off the salvage ships . The wat was constantly checked for chlorine traces Every detail of the plan was coordinated with State civil-defense forces . At 8:00 a.m. , Norton gave the order for the Big Lift . Cables leading from the derrick to the strongback drew taut as violin strings . Steadily , tension rose on each boom of the lifting gear : 200,000 pounds . . 300,000 pounds . The barge stirred . Cables strained and quivered . At 8:55 , the MTC 602 broke loose from the mud and swung free . Slowly , a foot a minute , the cables hauled it up . First the strongback broke the surface . Then came the barge , inch by inch , until watchers could see the tops of the clammy - tanks and the warning sign : DANGER ! CHLORINE NONFLAMMABLE GAS TOXIC Quickly , inspectors from the Chlorine Institute jumped aboard and checked all valves and domes for leaks . All clear ! Though it seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours and 15 minutes . By 11:30 he gave the " all clear " to State Civil Defense , which announced it to the public . Baton Rouge had been saved from a cloud of death . Two hours ' pumping drained the barge of water and made it buoyant again . Surprisingly , the only damage to the hull proved to be a few small holes above the waterline , which were easily welded . Next day . MTC 602 was floated 43 miles downstream and its lethal cargo safely unloaded . Salvage Project 602 was done . It had cost an estimated $1 million ? but not a single fatality . Baton Rouge 's Mayor W. W. Dumas suggested that people go to church that Sunday and bow their heads in thanks . " It was an ordeal I can tell my grandchildren about , " says Colonel Norton . " But I never want to go through anything like it again . "
