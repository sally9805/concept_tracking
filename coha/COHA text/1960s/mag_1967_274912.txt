At first glance , the 27th Paris Air Show at Le Bourget airport seemed to belong to the U.S. Not only was the U.S. exhibit the biggest around , but it had an extra impact : it was a celebration of the 40th anniversary of Charles Lindbergh 's historic transatlantic hop to that very same airfield . <P> In flew a replica of the Spirit of St. <P> Louis to go on display under a model of Eero Saarinen 's St. Louis arch out side the $250,000 U.S. pavilion . In side the pavilion , 75 companies plugged their products with splashy displays . <P> Nineteen more showed their wares around the field . Gemini Astronauts Michael Collins and David Scott were there along with the 250-seat DC-8-61 , largest passenger jet now in scheduled operation . Experimental craft ranged from Ling-Temco-Vought 's V/STOL XC-142 to Martin Marietta 's Lifting Body , in which astronauts may some day glide back from orbit . In military aviation , the star of the show was General Dynamics ' swing-wing F-lll fighter , flown from the U.S. and shown for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacular were the Russians , who contributed to the show 's remarkable catalogue of names and numbers with the YAK-40 jet transport , the turboprop AN-22 which can carry 720 passengers , and the 300-ton Vostok satellite . <P> Europeans Mean Business . Beyond all the U.S.-Soviet image building , though , it became clear that the Western Europeans are expanding their own aircraft making with renewed confidence . By pooling their strained capital resources through mergers and joint efforts , they are getting ready to compete with such U.S. giants as McDonnell Douglas , Boeing and Lockheed . " The Americans would like to have a monopoly on the aircraft industry , " says Director van Meerten of Holland 's Fokker , which has just test flown its new F28 twin-jet transport , " but we are here to tell them this is not to be . " <P> The French , who normally like to go it alone , are the most aggressive joint-effort boosters . This year the Transall , a German-French military-cargo plane , is to go into service . The Breguet 1150 antisubmarine aircraft , produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also being delivered . A FrancoBritish combine has announced plans to build a supersonic Jaguar fighter . And France and Britain are thinking of spending $2 billion for a twin-engined variable-geometry fighter to compete with the F-lll . <P> <P> Trouble in the Civilian Sector . Still , the European combines have yet to profit from rising civilian demand . Orders for Caravelles , Tridents and null have been disappointing , and British , French and West German manufacturers are struggling to get a medium-distance " Airbus " off the drawing boards . Plans now call for delivery in 1971 . In the meantime , U.S. companies may well corner most of the market for subsonic jet transports .
