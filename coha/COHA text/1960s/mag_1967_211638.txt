Imaginative and inventive surgeons have tried several ways to help the victim of a heart attack regain normal circulation , but none had ever been so bold as to cut out a piece of the heart itself . None , that is , until Dr. Raymond O. Heimbecker was confronted at To ronto General Hospital with a 56-year-old diabetic victim of a heart attack . <P> As the only hope of saving him , Dr. Heimbecker decided to try an unprecedented open-heart operation . <P> With the patient 's circulatory system connected to a pump-oxygenator , the surgeon opened the heart and found that the septum ( wall ) between the main pumping chambers , the ventricles , was torn and consisted partly of dead tissue . A substantial part of each ventricle , to which the blood supply had been cut off by the shutdown of a coronary artery , was also dead or dying . Dr. Heimbecker repaired the septum with a Teflon patch . Then , as the dying muscle in the ventricle walls was interfering with the working of healthy muscle , he boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each 3 in. by 2 in. , one from each ventricle . The surgeon put nothing in their place , but closed the heart by stitching together the muscle from opposite sides of the holes . <P> The patient 's heart performed fairly well , Medical World News reports ; its bouts of irregular activity were checked by drugs and electrical stimulation . But the patient 's lung damage had necessitated cutting a breathing tube into his windpipe , and after a month he died from an unforeseeable rupture where this tube had been placed . <P> Clearly , despite hundreds of earlier tests on dogs , such daring surgical deeds are for use in only the direst cases , but Dr. Heimbecker expects to see more of them and to repeat his bold procedure .
