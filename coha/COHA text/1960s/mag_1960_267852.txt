At the halfway mark , with the second of four rounds completed , the Kennedy-Nixon TV debate had already carved its place in the annals of U.S. politics . On the same date 102 years before , a crowd of 20,000 witnessed the historic Lincoln-Douglas debate in Galesburg , Ill . Some 64 million people witnessed Round No. 2 of the Kennedy-Nixon debate-more than the number of citizens who voted in the presidential election of 1956 . <P> The continuing TV debate adds a new-sophistication to the concept of government by the people . The ingenuity of the TV industry in fitting the campaign to TV 's dimensions and the sharpness of journalists who asked last week 's questions provided a genuine public service . Whatever the outcome in November , the election will be decided by an electorate that , to an extent unique in history , were able to look at the candidates and their programs in a cool , objective light , free of the usual hoopla , pennants and brass bands . The electronic eyes that scan the men in the TV studio are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the candidates there is no place to hide , no way of ducking behind a " no comment " or a sonorous platitude . Every quaver of voice , every fleeting grimace , is subject to merciless scrutiny . <P> Under this ordeal by camera and microphone , Jack Kennedy and Richard Nixon showed some striking similarities . Both proved themselves to be quick-thinking , tough-fibered fighters , charged with youthful intensity and energy ( Nixon is 47 , Kennedy 43 ) . Only men still young could have hammered away at each other so hard for a steady hour , their heads so full of facts and figures . They showed the aggressiveness and alertness that makes them formidable campaigners , the drive that enables them relentlessly to crisscross the country all day , all week , to keep up the most exhausting schedules in the history of U.S. presidential campaigns . <P> Kennedy was the unexpected winner of Round 1 because he took a tense and soft-hitting Nixon down a me-too path on domestic issues . In Round 2 Kennedy came through on foreign affairs with considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1950s and demanding better for the ' 60s in broad terms of mission and purpose . ( " That . " said he . " is the big issue . " ) But Nixon topped him with a sureness on cold war specifics . Most notable : Kennedy plumped for U.S. withdrawal from the offshore Nationalist Chinese islands of Quemoy and Matsu to facilitate an orderly defense of Formosa ; Nixon warned quickly that withdrawal would start a " chain reaction " : " The Communists . " said he , " are n't after Quemoy and Matsu . They are after Formosa . " He snapped at " the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea . " <P> Since Nixon 's comment came after Kennedy 's , he had , for the moment at least , an important last word . But between sign-off of the last debate and curtain time for this week 's , both candidates would think hard on what they had said and what they should say in the remaining two rounds . So would the U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions of ballots ever .
