txt A Mew Year and Varying Views on Student Unrest WASHINGTON ? As the time approached for the nation 's more than six million college students to return to the campuses ? starting this week  --  for the 1969-70 school year , one could obtain within the Federal Government at least three widely varying opinions about how much turmoil to expect . Late in August , very high officials within the Administration , who asked not to be identified , said they believed that student militancy had declined since the violent outbreaks of last spring and that campuses this fall would be relatively quiet . They based their belief on conversations with university officials . Later , J. Edgar Hoover , director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , predicted that campus unrest " would not Subside in the coming months . " Writing in the September issue of the F.B.I . law enforcement bulletin , Mr. Hoover said , " Just as soon as the firebrands can muster a caucus of dissidents , we will witness a continuation of the senseless plunder that caused more than $3-million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A third view emerged from a group of 22 Republican Representatives who toured the campuses last spring and have kept in touch with developments since . This view , as expressA by Donald J. Riegle Jr . of Michigan , holds that the campuses will continue to be potentially explosive , not because of the actions of the " firebrands " who are a small minority , but because discontent is widespread among the college population and there has been " no signal breakthrough " to alleviate the root causes of the discontent . Criticizing Government The Congressmen are publicly expressing their displeasure with the Administration of their own party for not acting on the recommendations they made following their campus tour . While praising Government officials for opposing the enactment of repressive legislation against disorders , they say the Nixon Administration has not taken the positive steps needed  --  for example , the creation of a Presidential Commission on Higher Education to oversee the administration of all youth programs . Beyond administrative steps . Representative Riegle pointed out that neither the Administration nor Congress has moved meaningfully in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to the student unrest in the first place . Mr. Riegle believes that a substantial withdrawal of troops from Vietnam in August would have done much to cool the campuses . Instead , some students are planning further antiwar protests and a general strike in October . Congress has done nothing about the Administration 's proposals to reform the military draft . And whenever Vice President Agnew talks of going to Mars , the militant stn. dents are reminded of what they consider disordered priorities , with social needs suffering at the expense of space and the military . In Mr. Riegle 's opinion , the Government has not responded as it should because the predominant view both within the Administration and in Congress is that the campus disorders are a passing phase , the-work of a small minority , and can be contained . The Michigan legislator and others believe this view to be " dead wrong , " that large numbers of the most , able and articulate students are determined to take the country down a " different road . " They believe there is , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than constructive dialogue and compromise . There is substantial agreement here that the colleges have by now taken steps in rules and procedure that should help diminish violence and unlawful acts on the campuses . Most colleges threatened with disorders are prepared to seek court injunctions. against unlawful seizure and destruction ? thus re , moving the college president and the administration from the lawenforcement role , Administrative Changes Many colleges , too , have made administrative changes that were demanded by campus protesters : for example , to give the students more of a voice in the making of policy , to improve communications between the administration and the student body , and to establish black studies programs sought by the growing number of Negro students . But the barest fact that deep divisions exist within the Government over the nature of the student revolt ? reflecting the same divisions in the society ? was a strong indication that the nation could draw no assurance that the worst of the campus unrest was over . - J01- 11T HEREE'llS             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
