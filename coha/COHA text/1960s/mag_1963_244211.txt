The most reluctant rubberneck in Egypt last week was Communist China 's Premier Chou Enlai . Granted only three sessions with President Nasser during his week 's sojourn in Cairo , Chou was propelled relentlessly through the list of VIP tourist attractions : an automobile plant , a museum , Egypt 's military academy , the Aswan Dam . When his hosts insisted on a close-up inspection of the Sphinx , Chou asked plaintively : " Do I have to go ? I 've already seen it from a distance . " <P> Though the visit to Egypt was only the first leg of his scheduled two-month swing through Africa , the round of sightseeing clearly tired the ailing , 67-year-old Chou . For the first time , Westerners noticed that he has only partial use of his right arm , which was usually clutched tightly over his stomach . At one point , after climbing a flight of stairs at an Aswan power station , the ashen-faced Premier staggered off into a corner as if he were about to faint . <P> One of two doctors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiff of smelling salts . As Chou raised his head , blood trickled from his nose . " It happens whenever he gets tired , " shrugged one of his aides . " It is not serious , but that is why he always has a doctor with him . " <P> Chou nonetheless had plenty of energy for speechmaking , harped repeatedly on the Peking version of Moscow 's we-will-bury-you refrain . Indeed , to hear Chou , the Afro-Asians will bury not only the West but Russia as well . " The Asian and African peoples , " he proclaimed , " through their labor and intellect created illustrious civilizations which were demolished by imperialist aggression and tyranny . Now that we have broken the imperialistic shackles , we will be able to work new miracles . " <P> For all his eagerness to win African support for Peking 's side in the Sino-Soviet conflict , however , Chou could offer little cash to the underdeveloped countries . In some areas that the Chinese have cultivated , they may even end by making more enemies than friends . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grab adjacent territory , Peking has angered neighboring Kenya , where it has also spent heavily to woo the new nation . It may succeed at least in raising Russia 's ante in Africa and Asia . At week 's end , as Chou left for Algeria , Nikita Khrushchev was reportedly planning his own swing through Africa . Before visiting Cairo next spring , he may also junket to India and Nepal on Chou 's back doorstep . Then it will be Nikita 's turn to tell who will bury whom .
