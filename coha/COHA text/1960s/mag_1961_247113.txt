Photographer David Douglas Duncan had often passed the locked door during his visits to the Riviera villa of Pablo Picasso , but in the three years he had known " the Maestro. " he never guessed what was stored on the other side . One day in 1959 , Picasso took him by the arm , unlocked the door , and motioned him inside . There , and in other rooms in the villa , were 532 finished paintings by Picasso that the world had never seen- " the greatest unrecorded treasure in modern art . " Duncan says . <P> This week , as Picasso celebrates his 80th birthday , the treasure goes on record in a new book illustrated and written by Duncan and printed under his supervision in Switzerland ( and published in the U.S. by Harper* ) . Picasso 's Picassos is more than a historymaking catalogue of the unknown paintings at the villa " La Californie " ; it is also a touchingly sentimental journey into Picasso 's life . Duncan spent six months photographing the paintings while Picasso watched and commented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an added dimension . As the reader examines them , he can almost imagine Picasso looking over his shoulder , offering comment and explanation as Picasso did for Duncan . <P> The Personal Note . There has never been a collection of Picassos more personal than this , and that , along with his canny desire not to flood the market , is the reason for its being kept so long from view . The four paintings that TIME reproduces ( see color ) catch a variety of styles and colors-plus this personal note . Picasso has seldom been more tender than in his first portrait of Marie-Therese Walter , and rarely has he endowed a figure with such regality as in the second portrait of her . The Minotaur is all passion , sad and fierce at once , almost like the master himself , and in the portrait of the woman with the dramatic hat , all conventions of beauty and ugliness are swept aside , as if the artist were intent only in crashing through the skin to get a look inside . In all four paintings the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there-it explodes . <P> Today , married to 35-year-old Jacqueline , the sixth of the important women in his life , Picasso is as exuberant as ever . But in a sense , this most inventive of living artists has come to be one of the least controversial : his stature is so enormous , his gifts and influence so overwhelming , that even the most conservative critics are apt to forgive his occasional tendency to showmanship and shock . His very restlessness sometimes seems a form of dilettantism , but every art movement from cubism to collage to abstraction , has felt his presence . In the entire history of art , no one man has offered so many ideas or seemed to find so many ways of looking at the world . To a great extent , Pablo Picasso is a history of modern art in himself .
