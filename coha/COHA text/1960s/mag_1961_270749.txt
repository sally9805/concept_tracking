Fallout from the latest and largest Soviet nuclear test was still drifting toward the U.S. last week when President Kennedy gave the go-ahead signal for Project Gnome , the Atomic Energy Commission 's long-planned underground experiment in the peaceful applications of nuclear energy . Southeast of Carlsbad , N.Mex. , a shaft has already been sunk 1,200 ft. in the ground to penetrate a thick formation of rock salt . From the shaft 's bottom , a 1,116-ft. horizontal tunnel leads into the salt and curves back on itself in a giant hook . At the tip of the hook a small ( 5-kiloton ) bomb will be exploded in December . If all goes well , the explosion will seal the horizontal tunnel by collapsing the hooked end , and it will leave a cavity partly filled with molten salt . <P> The hot ( 1400 F. ) liquid salt , the AEC hopes , will prove an energy reservoir from which power can be extracted , probably by injecting water into the cavity and taking it out as high-pressure steam , capable of running a turbine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost : $5,500,000 ) will yield power cheap enough to be economically competitive . Even if all the energy in the 5-kiloton Domb were recovered as electric power , it would cost nearly $1 per kwh . Conventional coal-fired power stations produce electricity for less than per kwh . <P> But big nuclear bombs , even up to 100-megaton size , cost little more than small ones . By successive experiments the AEC lopes to learn how to store the energy of large explosions in salt or rock . If a multimegaton explosion can be safely confined underground , the power it produces may be cheap enough to compete with electricity from conventional sources . <P> Other goals of Project Gnome : <P> &gt; To gain experience with nuclear explosives as blasting agents for digging har-&gt;ors , canals , or passes through mountains . <P> &gt; To experiment with large-scale production of artificial isotopes . Isotopes that do lot exist in nature are generally made by bombarding natural elements with neurons in a reactor . A nuclear explosion underground will supply a vast number of neutrons for this purpose . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shock to bring inaccessible oil deposits to the surface .
