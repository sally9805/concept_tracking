Backstage on Broadway went Margaret Truman Daniel , 39 , renewing acquaintance with a puppet regime that strikes her as a million laughs . The occasion was opening night of Sergei Obratsov 's Russian Puppet Theater , a miniature spectacular that had the critics banning real live actors to some theatrical Siberia . Among the characters applauded was one splintery soprano , and Margaret loved that too . " A marvelous show , " she trilled . " I first saw them in Moscow in 1960 . " <P> <P> Roger M. Blough , 59 , board chairman of U.S. Steel Corp. , first tested his mettle playing guard , tackle and end for Susquehanna University , Selinsgrove , Pa . That was in the rah-rah ' 20s when Susquehanna lost the big ones by scores of 91-0 , 87-6 , 61-7 . In December , Blough will receive the National Football Foundation 's 1963 gold-medal award for " outstanding contributions to the game . " How come ? Well , deadpans the foundation , which in previous years has honored such All-American names as Herbert Hoover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not have been one of football 's greatest players , but he was certainly one of the pluckiest ... an undersized , hard-playing lineman for an outmanned varsity . " <P> <P> " Pretty Penny , " her 21-room house in suburban Nyack , N.Y. , abounds in memories : a wood carving from Alex Woollcott , a clock from Richard Burton , a salad bowl from John Barrymore . " Bric-a-brac , that 's what it all is , " says Theatrical First Lady Helen Hayes , 63 , who has already put up for sale the house where she spent nearly three decades with Playwright Charles MacArthur . This week the dishes , furniture and memorabilia-more than 1,000 items-will be sold at auction on the front lawn , with proceeds going into a scholarship fund named for Daughter Mary , who died of polio in 1949 . Having a last look around before flying off to winter in Mexico , the actress evinced few regrets . " The financial and spiritual strain has been too hard . There is so much-from so many years . " <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 55 , chain-smoking director of the U.S. Information Agency , grew hoarse and decided to check in at Washington Hospital Center on his return to the capital . Doctors found a tumor in his left lung , decided that location of the growth made it necessary to remove the entire lung . <P> An organization man who really swings was what Warner Brothers wanted . So , for an undisclosed sum , they hired none other than Frank Sinatra , 47 , as a new special assistant to help 71-year-old President Jack L. Warner on matters of high policy . Whether Sinatra might be heir apparent to Warner 's movie-making empire was anybody 's guess , but Hollywood insiders can readily identify the secret ingredient that qualifies Frankie to join the ranks of rising executives : it 's a gas . <P>
