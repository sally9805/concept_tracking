Red China produced a second surprise last week . At Peking airport . Premier Chou En-lai welcomed Outer Mongolia 's Premier Yurnzhagiin Tsedenbal , 46 , who is normally regarded as a Russian puppet . Whisked off in a black . Soviet-made limousine among crowds dutifully waving Chinese and Mongolian flags , Tsedenbal was put through the usual routine of toasts , banquets and fulsome speeches . Then , on the same day that Red China announced plans to define its borders with Pakistan , Tsedenbal and Chou En-lai signed a treaty fixing the 2,500-mile frontier between their two countries . <P> It was another little lesson aimed at Delhi . At the farewell banquet for Tsedenbal , Premier Chou En-lai smoothly noted that Red China had now solved its border problems on the basis of " peaceful coexistence " with Burma , Nepal , Pakistan and Outer Mongolia , making the point that only two neighbors now remain with whom China has not made a border adjustment : India and the Soviet Union .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
