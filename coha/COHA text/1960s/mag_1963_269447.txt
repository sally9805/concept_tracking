" I think this strike has gone on long enough , " said New York Post Publisher Dorothy ( " Dolly " ) Schiff in what was surely the understatement of the week . " The city should have at least one newspaper . " With that , Dolly Schiff broke the united front of New York publishers against Bert Powers ' local of the International Typographical Union . She resigned from the New York Publishers Association and announced that the Post would reappear on the newsstands this week . <P> One &; All . Dolly 's defection , said New York Times Vice President Amory H. Bradford , chief negotiator for the publishers , was " a great mistake . " The publishers , like the NATO allies , operate on the principle that an attack on one is an attack on all ; and when the I.T.U. called strikes at four New York dailies last December , five others voluntarily stopped their presses . Now , said Bradford , Dolly 's action " is bound to stiffen the union 's position and may well prolong the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to persuade the unions to arrive at a settlement that will permit all the newspapers to continue . " <P> Bert Powers , naturally , thought otherwise . " The other afternoon papers , " said he , " will not miss the fact that their competitor is publishing . " He might have a point . Though the Post 's pre-strike circulation was only 327,629 , it was expected to run off at least 500,000 papers a day in an effort to pick up readers from the idle Journal-American ( circ. 601,625 ) and World-Telegram ( 442,936 ) . Powers insisted that Mrs. Schiff would have settled " a long time ago " but for fear of " retribution from advertisers . " What suddenly made Dolly change her mind ? <P> Accept or Reject . Knowing hands pointed out that just after she handed in her resignation to the association at a meeting in midtown Manhattan 's Daily News building , she scooted off to meet Powers at an uptown hotel . After nearly three hours , she emerged with Powers to announce that she would immediately begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the old contracts . But it might not be that easy to get back in print on the cheap ; the American Newspaper Guild advised its members to report for work , whether they were asked to or not . To rumors that Dolly already had a separate secret deal with Powers , she replied : " I have no agreement with Mr. Powers about a new contract . We will accept or reject any new settlement as it comes up . " <P> There was no quarrel with Dolly 's argument that New York needs its newspapers . The strike has deprived New Yorkers of 5,780,000 papers a day , has idled 20,000 workers , and has cost an estimated $100 million in wages , advertising and circulation revenue . But whether publication of the Post would do anything to help settle the argument was something else again .
