Who 's afraid of Virginia Woolf ? Not high-minded Smith College . Despite the unflattering references to the fictional school in Edward Albee 's hit play ( " Musical beds is the faculty sport here " ) , Smith is allowing Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton the run of the campus for exteriors in the screen version of Virginia Woolf . Explained a Smith official : " As an educational institution we did n't feel we could conscientiously bar them from our premises . " A Northampton chamber of commerce official was also unafraid : <P> " We 're glad to cooperate with business people , real craftsmen who say they expect to spend $150,000 here , all told . "
