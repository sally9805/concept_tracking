Who 'll Save the Plowboy ? ( by Frank D. Gilroy ) . The husband , Albert , guzzles false courage out of beer cans . The wife , Helen , darns his socks and whines testily , " When was the last time you cut your toenails ? " She is not so much asking a question as emitting a fixed tone signal , an S 0 S of day in , day out desperation . " Death or a new stove , I 'll settle for either one , " she says . The shabby New York apartment is like a tank of formaldehyde preserving the couple 's dead marriage , dead hopes , and dead selves . <P> A visitor stirs the tank . Larry had been badly injured in World War II while saving Albert 's life in combat . At remeeting , they act out the awkward , bantering joviality of two men who have only a 15-year-old memory in common . But Larry 's questions become pressing , his manner grave . Is Albert happy ? Why did n't he buy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicknamed him " the plowboy " ? Where is the child whom Albert named after Larry ? Between them , husband and wife desolate the visitor with unsparing revelations . The farm was bought and bankrupted . The marriage is a sterile sham punctuated with joyless infidelities . And when the play at length gives away its key secret , the monstrous lot of the child , Larry 's disillusionment is complete , for it turns out that he is dying of his old wounds and wanted to assure himself that saving Albert was not for nothing . At play 's end , all that remains is to face despair with decency . <P> Despite O. Henry-like plot twists . Plowboy is a gritty and gripping play . Frank D. Gilroy sees character with 20-20 vision and he can shape the grey , doughy speech of the inarticulate into revealing patterns . Gerald O'Loughlin makes Albert a hollow but pitiable clown ; the burntout , empty eyes of Rebecca Darke 's Helen are as lifeless as pits on the moon ; William Smithers ' grey-faced Larry has the strength to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a slice-of-life play , but in its spare and honest intensity it slices close to the center .
