If a ship has neither a bow nor a stern , it is certainly not a ship . But it is a nifty little method of getting the benefits of U.S.-built ships without the high cost . On order last week from the Hamburg yards of German Shipbuilder Willy Schlieker ( TIME , Oct. 26 ) were the midsections of six vessels for Mobile 's McLean Industries , Inc . With a booming business carrying highway trailer vans by sea , McLean decided to add six new vessels , each with a capacity of 476 vans , to his fleet of trailer ships . The problem was that if the vessels were built abroad they could not ship between domestic ports . <P> ( U.S. coastal trade is limited to U.S.-built ships . ) But if they were built at home , the cost would run between $10 million and $12 million per vessel . <P> McLean 's solution is to play both ends against the middle . Schlieker will build only the midsections , which can then be towed across the Atlantic and enter the U.S. as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships by simply buying old T-2 war-surplus tankers , hiring U.S. yards to graft the bows and sterns onto his German midsections , thus qualifying as " built in America . " Total cost : less than $5,000,000 a vessel , a saving of 50% to 65% . So simple is the idea that other U.S. firms ( e.g. , American Ship Building ) have ordered the midsections for several big ore carriers from Schlieker.
