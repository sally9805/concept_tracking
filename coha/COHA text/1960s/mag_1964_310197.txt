Doulos-The Finger Man . Lippy Jean-Paul Belmondo , who first made crime pay as a pint-size Bogart in Breathless , now proves himself a magnum Cagney who can rough up a moll in vintage Chicago style . When Jean-Paul wants blonde Thrse to rat on a pal , he slugs her , ties her wrists to her ankles , loops a belt around her neck and lashes it to a radiator pipe , gags her , decants a bottle of Haig &; Haig over her while she 's down , slugs her again . " Now sweetheart , baby , act sensibly , " he coos . So she does . Later , the police find poor Therese under her wrecked Renault at the bottom of a cliff . <P> The rest of the plot , hlas , acts nowhere near so sensibly . Belmondo plays the bland best friend of Maurice ( Serge Reggiani ) , a ferret-faced hood who bumps off a fence to get the loot from the big Avenue Mozart jewel robbery . Then , on Maurice 's next job , somebody tips the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoolie ? It looks that way until Belmondo uses the Mozart swag to triple-cross a gangland czar , gets Maurice sprung from jail , and splits a pile of G notes with his old copain . It takes a long flashback to tie all the subplots together in time for a grisly finale . <P> Does anyone still care ? Sure , a little . Director Jean-Pierre Melville keeps his expert cast zipping right along , pursued by a camera that emphasizes the gritty black-and-whites of his murderous milieu . Admittedly hooked on oldtime U.S. gangster movies , Melville manages to make Paris look like the back lot at Warner Brothers . Doulos , in consequence , seldom seems more than an ambitious hybrid , a gangland epic with Gaul .
