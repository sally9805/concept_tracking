Something hidden . Go and find it . go and look behind the ranges - some thing lost behind the ranges . Lost and waiting for you . Go ! <P> - Rudyard Kipling , The Explorer <P> For archaeologists in Peru , that hidden something has always been the lost city of Vilcabamba , the last great capital of the Incas . As described in the 16th century chronicles , Vilcabamba was believed located somewhere in the southern Peruvian Andes . There , for nearly four decades , some 4,000 Indians lived , waged sporadic war on the Spaniards , and built great palaces and temples . Then in 1572 , after the Spanish killed the last Inca ruler , the Indians apparently deserted their capital , and Vilcabamba disappeared beneath the jungle . <P> In 1911 famed Archaeologist and Yale Scholar Hiram Bingham first thought he had found Vilcabamba when he discovered the spectacular ruins at Machu Picchu . But most people agreed that Vilcabamba was still out there . Now , another exploration party thinks that it has finally found the lost city behind the ranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed , no one can be certain . But throughout the U.S. and Latin America last week , archaeologists were eagerly watching-and hoping . <P> Strangers Beware . The expedition leader was Gene Savoy , a 37-year-old explorer from Portland , Ore . For five years , Savoy has been tramping the Peruvian Andes , turning up everything from three pre-Inca cities to a 100-ft. - wide pre-Inca highway . In 1963 he joined forces with Peruvian Explorer Antonio Santander Cascelli , 62 , and together they started hunting for Vilcabamba . Old records seemed to point to a forbidding area northwest of Machu Picchu , called the Plain of the Spirits . <P> Six weeks ago , Savoy and Santander reached the Plain of the Spirits by mule team and made contact with some local Indians . At first , the Indians refused to guide them . Tribal legend said that anyone who escorted strangers into the plain would soon die . But after some powerful persuasion , the Indians agreed to join the expedition . They led Savoy and Santander on a three-day march through the jungle to the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't believe our eyes , " says Savoy . " Each day , it became more fantastic . " <P> Tiles &; Horseshoe . The ruins , says Savoy , cover some 6 to 10 sq . mi. and stretch across three succeeding plateaus . The first plateau-roughly four times the size of Machu Picchu-begins at about 4,500 ft. ; the second is at 5,500 ft. , and the last , poking eerily up through a misty halo of clouds , may reach as high as 12,000 or 13,000 ft . <P> On the first plateau , Savoy and Santander found a luxurious palace and at least 16 separate communities-built mostly of granite and limestone , and complete with fountains , gardens , courtyards , large terraced dwellings apparently used by Inca nobles , and 100 or so squat circular huts that probably housed lower-class Indians . True to archaeological expectations , a strong Spanish influence was evident-the result , old records suggest , of seven Spanish turncoats who came to live in the Inca capital .
