To Aristotle , tragedy 's effect was tripartite ; it moved from pity to terror to catharsis . By those tenets , as valid as they are venerable , Bernard Malamud 's Pulitzer Prize novel The Fixer misses greatness by a third . It has the first two requisites , but it omits any purge of the emotions . Malamud brings his hero , Yakov Bok , to the brink of destruction-or salvation-and freezes the action . There , in Auden 's phrase , " the seas of pity lie , locked and frozen in each eye . " By definition , the film of The Fixer can aspire to be only two-thirds of a great movie . Still , it has within it an irresistible moral force and an impressive cast of characters who have truly Dostoevskian resonance . <P> <P> Alan Bates plays Bok-a handyman , a fixer of broken things . His home is the shtetl , a rural Jewish village in 1911 Russia . It is a time of pogroms and malignant rumors of Jews who murder Christians as part of their religious rites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Carol White ) , abandons his emotions , his conscience and his home . His destination is the ancient Russian Orthodox city of Kiev , where he promptly sends himself to hell by passing as a gentile . In scenes that seem to have emerged from the mainstream of Russian literature , Lebedev ( Hugh Griffith ) , a rabid anti-Semite , makes Bok a trusted employee until Lebedev 's daughter Zinaida ( Elizabeth Hartman ) falsely accuses the fixer of rape . The recriminatory shriek becomes a chorus when religious fanatics also accuse Bok of ritual murder . The fixer is seized and imprisoned . The . machinery of the state begins : moved by a heritage of hate , it tries to grind the fixer to dust . <P> Shining Interior . Astonishingly , he will not disintegrate , All the degradations , all the tortures will not make him confess to his " crimes . " As the universal sufferer , Bates wears the exhausted eyes , the depleted physique , the rime of salt about the parched lips like indestructible medals . In Malamud 's view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Job who grows from suffering to manhood . The fixer finally fixes himself , and , symbolically , all sufferers . Like the book , the film has no end , only a conclusion : there is no such thing as indifference ; an abstention from humanity is a vote for evil . When Yakov goes to trial the story halts , as if the future were epilogue . Unfortunately , it is not . Malamud based his novel on the agonies of a real Russian Jew , Mendel Beiliss , who was finally exonerated . Torn between actuality and false doom , The Fixer becomes a victim of artistic indecision . <P> <P> Because the story has no conventional plot development , it is at its interior that the film shines . In the title role , Bates ' indomitable intelligence radiates through the rough peasant vocabulary and makes Yakov too mortal to die . <P> As a symbol he is perfect ; as a Jew he is wanting . Betrayed by his English accent , he can not articulate inversions like " Luck I was always short of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His most effective support comes from Dirk Bogarde as Bibikov , the court-assigned defender of the fixer . Wearing a fine mask of melancholy disdain , he grows gradually more revulsed by the corruption he witnesses in the palace of justice ; his actions and his death predict the fall of the Romanovs as surely as any Leninist edict . <P>
