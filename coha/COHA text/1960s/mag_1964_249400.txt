CIVIL RIGHTS <P> The Rev. Bruce W. Klunder , 27 , was a big , mild , bespectacled man , a sort of Clark Kent of the pulpit . But within him burned a fierce- and , as it turned out , fatal-sense of indignation . <P> A white Presbyterian minister , Klunder was born in Oregon , graduated from Yale University Divinity School , went to Cleveland in 1961 as assistant executive secretary of the Student Christian Union at Western Reserve University . He swiftly threw himself into the center of the city 's civil rights fight . <P> A prime target in that fight is the Lakeview school , under construction as part of a crash program that was started in February after a burst of race riots and a series of conciliatory meetings between the Cleveland school board and civil rights leaders . But because Lakeview and two other new elementary school sites are all in predominantly Negro neighborhoods , the civil rights forces insist that they would merely " promote resegregation . " <P> Storm of Stones . One afternoon last week , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy Lakeview lot , threw themselves at the wheels and treads of bulldozers , power shovels , trucks and mobile concrete mixers . A power shovel operator watched in disbelief as six people-including a woman five months pregnant-leaped into a ditch and stretched out prone just beneath the shovel 's jaws . Police moved in to disperse the demonstrators , but many came out of the muck fighting . Twenty-one were arrested that day ; two were hurt . <P> The civil rights leaders were by no means through . Said the Rev. Klunder , who was also vice chairman of the local CORE group : " We are dedicated and committed to continue , and we will not stop short of having the school board revise its plans . This can be done by placing our bodies between the workers and their work . " <P> Next day Klunder and about 1,000 other demonstrators returned to the school . Already awaiting them were dozens of Cleveland cops in a glowering cordon around the site . The inflamed mob threw rocks , bricks , bottles and chunks of cement at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrators repeatedly tried to break through the lines . Thirteen persons-eight of them cops-were hurt . Twenty-six were arrested . <P> Sneak Invasion . Klunder gathered a group on a nearby street corner , devised a plan for a-sneak invasion of the construction site through adjacent backyards . Moments later the minister , two women and a man dashed across the rutted school lot toward a dirt-pushing bulldozer . Three of them flung themselves into the path of the steel treads . Klunder lay down behind the machine . The driver , John White , 33 , stopped when he saw the three in front . He looked around , but did not see Klunder . Slowly , he began backing his six-ton bulldozer . When he finally stopped , the dead body of Bruce Klunder lay in the tread-marked mud .
