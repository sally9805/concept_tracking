INFLATION discriminates among its victims . It hurts the life styles of some families more than others , depending on their size , income , and even their personal tastes . Sample effects on three families in different income brackets : <P> Upper-Middle Income . The aptly named Costley family of Rockville , Md. - Nancy , 35 , Wayne , 37 , and five children aged five to ten-do not feel that they are going broke on $25,000 a year , but neither are they getting anywhere . Wayne , a vice president of Consultec , a management-consulting firm , earns $10,000 a year more than he did in 1964 . " But even with steady increases in salary , " he says , " I do n't see any increase in buying power . " <P> Mrs. Costley , a former TWA hostess who is a part-time religion teacher and Little League batting coach , is anything but extravagant . She asks her butcher to trim fat off meats so that she will not have to pay for it . Still , she spends $85 a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as four years ago . The Costleys not long ago added a porch , patio and basketball court to their ten-room , $46,000 house , at a cost of $4,200 , or $1,200 more than they would have paid in 1967 . " But I still do n't have any dining-room chairs , " says Mrs. Costley . " It is just something we have had to postpone . " She tried recently to save on sneakers for her four boys by picking up two pairs for $4 each at a sale , but they soon " disintegrated " and she had to go back to buying sneakers at $9 a pair . <P> " Virtually nothing is going into the savings account , " says Wayne Costley . " I 'm still in my 30s , but I do n't have the freedom to enjoy these years . There 's no boat , there are no trips . I work hard , but it amounts to Nancy 's going on vacation with the kids once in four years . " <P> Middle-Income . The Munson family of Geneva , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two sons aged nine weeks and 20 months-spends its income of about $16,000 on things that older people might consider luxuries but that the Munsons regard as necessities . They have greatly increased their living standards in the four years since they married . Munson is an associate in his father 's law firm , and last September the family moved from a Chicago apartment to a $32,500 house in the exurbs . <P> Mrs. Munson protests the rising cost of plastic baby pants ( 69 a pair v. 29 less than two years ago ) and of teen-agers who come in as " mother 's helpers " four mornings a week ( they now charge $1.25 an hour , up from 75 a year ago ) . She has furnished the house with used pieces rather than new furniture . She thought of economizing by making her own clothes , but concluded that there would be no saving " because the price of fabric has skyrocketed . To make an average dress , including lining , costs $25 . " <P> Entertainment is a must item for the Munsons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have two babies , this is one place where you do n't want to cut down-if only for sanity 's sake , " says Mrs. Munson . She and her husband have substituted a local movie for their former weekly trip into Chicago , where they used to see plays . They hold one dinner party a week , even though Mrs. Munson complains that it costs an " absolute minimum " of $45.
