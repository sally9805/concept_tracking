Most Georgians were pleasantly surprised at the moderate pronouncements of Lester Garfield Maddox after he took over the statehouse last January . His critics in the cities had feared the worst from the onetime purveyor of fried chicken and racist pamphlets who earned national notoriety by chasing Negroes away from his Pickrick restaurant in Atlanta at gunpoint . But Governor Maddox seemed to grow in his new job . Racial peace was preserved , his administration was untainted by corruption , and he plunged into work with gusto , opening his office door to " the little man , " black or white , whom he had pledged to represent . <P> Maddox , 51 , hired Negroes for state jobs , ordered a sweeping inquiry into Georgia 's fetid convict camps , and bustled around greeting one and all with a breezy " Everything Pickrick ? " Some of his constituents even took comfort from the Governor 's proclivity for picayune problems . " I 'd rather have him clipping my toenails , " averred one critic , " than operating on my heart . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and civic leaders no longer view their Governor 's performance with such equanimity . The prison probe generated no tangible reforms , and most Maddox innovations have proved to be short-lived palliatives at best . Hopes for better education were dashed when the Governor moved to bar consolidation of schools and began toying with illicit schemes to subsidize all-white private schools with state funds . A plan to alleviate the desperate financial squeeze on Georgia 's cities by allowing them to tack 1% onto the state 's 3% sales tax was also rejected by Maddox , who has yet to put forward a comprehensive legislative program . " I reckon I 'll get around to that soon , " he muses . <P> Industry , which the state had wooed successfully under the progressive , racially moderate administration of Governor Carl Sanders , was less than impressed by Maddox 's populist style and outspokenly unhappy over his retrogressive plans for the schools . Nor were prospective clients encouraged when Maddox fired the head of the state 's department of industry and trade . As a result , Republican Legislator Rodney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , charges that capital outlay for new factories and expansion of existing plants in the state slumped by $86 million during the first six months of 1967 . <P> <P> Bingo &; Booze . But Maddox has time for other matters . A teetotaling , nonsmoking , hard-shell Baptist , he fervently believes that gambling-even church bingo-breeds " drinking , assault and drug addiction . " Accordingly , he declared war on all games of chance , although his own furniture store in Atlanta was then raffling off a $299 sleeper set . He wasted no time combatting Sabbath drinking . Despite a 1964 state law permitting local authorities to set hours for closing bars , state agents obeyed the Governor 's orders one Sunday by raiding an Atlanta nightclub at 2 a.m. and hauling away $5,000 worth of liquor . The owner is suing the Governor , who had invoked an obscure 1938 blue law prohibiting the sale of drink on the Lord 's Day .
