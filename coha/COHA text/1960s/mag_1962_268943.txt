On the sand beneath a pier at Daytona Beach , Fla. , a group of collegians gathered , glanced surreptitiously about , and one by one held out their arms . At that moment a passing dowager spied the scene , stared for a moment in horrified silence , and rushed away to report what was certainly a wicked rite . " I knew it ! " she gasped . " They 're taking the needle ! " <P> It was n't a needle at all . One of the group had bought a special pencil , was marking the backs of hands with symbols that would show up under the ultraviolet lamp used by a local casino to check admissions to the twist dance that night . The entrepreneur was doing a rush business . Regular admission price : $1.70 . His rate : 25 . <P> " When in Doubt . . . " This innocent bit of counterfeiting was part of Daytona life last week . As Easter weekend approached , some 15,000 college boys and girls had swarmed into town to roast in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out " ( or , far more accurately , to talk about making out ) . On the beach a couple of fast-slapping guitar players started up a hot beat . Within moments , a score of college kids were doing the twist while cheering onlookers , some of them wearing sweatshirts marked " Property of Daytona Beach Jail " and " Stamp Out Virginity , " raised their beer cans on high . <P> " Oh man ! " cried a young fellow . " I came down here from Penn State on $40 . I got a nickel in my pocket , and I 'm having a ball ! " He chugalugged his beer and roared : " When in doubt , drink and shout ! " That night , in a motel room . 24 boys and girls twisted to the music of a four-piece combo , adroitly avoiding two double beds , a table , a sink , a stove and a refrigerator . Cried a University of Miami coed : " Daytona Beach is the best place in the whole world ! " That was precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In recent springs , U.S. college kids had been heading like lemmings to Fort Lauderdale , about 200 miles farther south . But last year Lauderdale plainly showed that it was fed up with the hijinks , and authorities cracked down hard . No fewer than 800 arrests were made during Easter vacation . <P> Flying Squad . What Lauderdale was tired of , Daytona wanted-and it began a campaign to attract the collegians for the 1962 holidays . Daytona City Commissioner Stanley Nass got civic groups to agree to " welcome the youngsters , leave them alone and let them entertain themselves with the facilities we have . " The city appropriated an extra $12,000 for its recreation fund . Nass hired Jazzman Dave Brubeck for a show , got together a music-making group called the Folksters , gave them a truck and made them a " flying squad . " Last week , whenever Nass got a report that the boys and girls were getting out of hand , he put the Folksters onto the truck-bed and sent them out to do a show . Baron ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now owner of the Safari Motel , toured college campuses as far as Maryland and Kentucky to offer free beer for parties and , in some cases , rebates on gasoline expenses for the trip south .
