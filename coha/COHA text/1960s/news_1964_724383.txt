txt A Casper , Wyo. , housewife serves her party guests French bread flown in from Paris . Diners at New York 's Waldorf-Astoria savor St. Peter 's fish , a rare delicacy caught in the Sea of Galilee a day earlier and flown to the U.S. aboard El Al Israel jets . And West Coast papaya lovers now enjoy tree-ripened supplies of the fruit , thanks to air freight . As such examples testify , the airplane is creating a minor revolution in eating habits . Air freight to ship foods , especially gourmet items , is a booming business that airlines are carefully nourishing by repeated rate cuts . Foreign and domestic foodstuff traffic of U.S. airlines is growing about three times as fast as air freight in general , according to Howard R. Jennings , director of domestic air freight for Trans World Airlines . And the general air freight figure itself is climbing ; this year it 's running at least 20g ahead of last year 's level of just over one billion ton miles . A ton mile is one ton flown one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total air freight , but its growth has just begun , many authorities say . " Our foodstuff traffic is running double the 1963 rate and should double again next year , " says Douglas Stark , TWA 's director of perishable marketing . And Leslie M. Cox , traffic manager for Western Growers Association , a group of produce growers and shippers based in Los Angeles , comments . " There 's no doubt in my mind that air freight for our members will grow tenfold in the next five years . " Unused Air Cargo Capacity Despite such growth , it is n't keeping pace with the expansion of cargo capacity of the air carriers . Many of the bigger new jets can carry roughly three times as much freight as the piston planes they replaced . As a result , only 48% of U.S. air cargo capacity is now being used , down from 56.8% five years ago , according to the Air Transportation Association of America . ? Airlines are searching for freight traffic that might rise sharply if rates were cut . thus helping use empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Air Lines says that thus far this year it has flown more than 3.5 million pounds of fresh strawberries from California to the East , up from less than 200,000 pounds last year . One reason for the rise : United slashed the rate on strawberry shipments of at least 10.000 pounds to $8.90 per 100 pounds from last year 's rate of $11.95 . Besides helping the airlines , airborne food shipments are boosting sales of many a small retailer . Bread from Paris has become a big seller at Cheese Unlimited , a small New York store , which says it sells about 1,000 loaves a month , double the amount two years ago . Each long , thin loaf , weighing under a pound , costs 59 cents , of which the air freight is about 15 cents . " Lots of people think the price is extravagant , but they 'll pay it for a special occasion , " says Gus Chacham , who operates the store with his brother . A middle-aged New York executive , buying five loaves , says : " We use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about it more than the main course . " A Bear From Canada Air freight also solves big and little kitchen emergencies . For a party last month celebratr ing the , fourth anniversary of its Bull and Bear restaurant , the Waldorf-Astoria had no trouble representing the bull with beef , but the bear posed a problem . The last-minute solution : A 68-pound bear from the Canadian wild was flown in for the meal . Like many hotels and restaurants , the Waldorf is turning to air freight to obtain fresh foods all year . " With frozen foods on the rise , guests appreciate freshness more than ever , " says Alfred E. Matt , food and beverage manager . The hotel , which employs six men to do nothing but cut fresh string beans , is using 15 times as much food ' shipped by air as it did 10 years ago , says Eugene R. Scanlan. executive chef . In Hollywood , Patton 's Nutrition Center is flying in ripe papayas from Hawaii . It charges 49 cents apiece for them , compared with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipped by surface carriers . Despite the increased price , the store boosted its monthly sales of the fruit to more than 1,500 from 500 since it began using air freight . " Customers say this fruit tastes much better when picked ripe , " says Miss Loretta Brown , part owner of the store . For a large " fancy food " chain of stores such as Jurgensen 's Grocery Co. , Pasadena , Calif. , air freight may be the extra service that distinguishes it from ordinary grocers . " It widens the gap a little more between us and the supermarkets , many of which are getting into the gourmet field themselves , " says Robert W. Jurgensen , executive vice president . " We often ship gift items by air and we 've sent birthday cakes by air to servicemen overseas . " It often is cheaper to ship foods by air from areas where they are abundant and cheap than to buy them locally during the off-season when they 're scarce . When water cress was in short supply around New York this fall , Restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury establishments as the Four Seasons , saved money by ordering a supply flown in from California . Restaurant Associates says rates on its air shipments of food have dropped to about onehalf the level of five years ago . But the diner still pays a sizable premium . One typical-bill received by the chain recently totaled $235.28 for 86 pounds , of fish caught in France and flown from Paris . Of the total , $67 represented transportation and a small tariff . Some cost savings are possible using air transport of highly perishable foods . A New York hotel says that 40% of the oysters it orders from Washington State which are shipped by truck die in transit and must be discarded . Since such losses are negligible with air freight , the net cost per oyster is about the same by air or by truck , the hotel claims . The largest gains in foodstuff air traffic are in such highly perishable products , airlines say . Flying Tiger Line 's total perishable fruit traffic this year is up between 200% and 250% from last year , Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , estimates . Airlines sometimes find sizable business in flying U.S. foodstuffs abroad . Pan American World Airways , for example , has flown 200,000 live eels this year from the U.S. to Great Britain , where eels are in high demand but short supply .
