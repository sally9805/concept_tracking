On his record , Psychiatrist Robert Coles , 33 , should be tending bothered Brahmins on Boston 's Beacon Street . A graduate of Milton Academy and Harvard ( magna ) , Coles got his M.D. at Columbia and trained at proper Boston hospitals , from Children 's to McLean to Massachusetts General . He even married a Hallowell-a word that some Boston tots think is part of the Lord 's Prayer : " Hallowell be thy name . " <P> Instead , Coles has been off tackling one of the great questions of U.S. education : How , in detail , does desegregation affect children ? He may now be the nation 's leading expert on the subject . As gifted with words as he is with feelings , Coles last week issued an eloquent report under the auspices of the Southern Regional Council and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith . <P> Sharing the Strain . In the tense summer of 1961 , Coles moved to Atlanta , where ten Negro children were girding themselves to " integrate " four white high schools . Bomb rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With foundation money , Coles and his wife set up a unique " practice " - fulltime sharing of the kids ' trials and triumphs over the next two years . <P> Every week Coles tape-recorded interviews with each of the Negroes and a dozen of their white classmates , half of them from intensely segregationist families . By 1962 , his " patients " included 40 more integrated Negro students and additional whites , plus numerous teachers and parents . Once a month , he similarly interviewed 19 grade-school children in New Orleans including the four Negroes who went through desegregation riots there in 1960 . Along the way , he scoured other integration hot spots from Little Rock to Clinton , Tenn . <P> Paroled to America . Coles found that youngness is the key to successful desegregation . Much as he was moved by one small Negro girl 's drawing of herself in New Orleans as " a lonely blackbird , cautiously winging her way toward the school , " he observed that the youngest children show the least strain . In New Orleans , white six-year-olds gravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope with them as soon as they got to school . Equally important , the world of school shut out adult rioters ; all they did was create more school spirit . " Frantz School will survive , " sang the kids in New Orleans , and it did . <P> Atlanta 's teen-agers had a lot tougher time . Though untouched by violence , they had to unlearn old fears amid " normal " adolescent strains . One Negro boy worriedly studied karate before entering a white school : another dreamed of himself in Little Rock , holding off whites with a machine gun . Yet integration spurred many to sudden pride and progress . Instead of " always watching and peeking around , " as one boy put it , " I feel as if I 've been let out of jail and into America .
