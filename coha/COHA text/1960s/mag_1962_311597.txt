The genius of Eero Saarinen was rewarded twice last week . The New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects presented his widow , Aline , with its Medal of Honor , a tribute to the " combined esthetic delights and technical rewards " of Saarinen 's diverse forms . And the Columbia Broadcasting System announced that construction will start this spring on its new 38-story freestanding tower-Saarinen 's only building in Manhattan and his only skyscraper . <P> When Saarinen died at 51 last September , he left a portfolio of projects that include much of his most daring work. + Of these , the CBS building was unique in Saarinen 's eyes because " it will be the simplest skyscraper statement in New York , " a " vertical leap of masonry and glass . " In a " return to solid , massive strength , " the structure will be made of granite-clad reinforced concrete instead of structural steel , rising without a break in line from the green-granite faced , sunken plaza surrounding it . Triangular columns carrying wiring , heating and air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking up the expanse of shimmering glass that gives a cellophane-wrapped look to much that is modern . <P> No More Wedding Cakes . The CBS Building is one of the first to be built under New York 's new zoning resolution , which rewards builders for foot-traffic space in the plaza by allowing a higher , unbroken climb . The old zoning resolution required setbacks as the building rose , and cursed the city with scores of massive wedding cakes that filled their building sites to the sidewalks and threw away all sense of height . <P> The building 's clean design results in part from Saarinen 's admiration of the lines of Mies van der Rohe 's Seagram Building in Manhattan . Saarinen decided that the only way to best the master was to be even purer . He took as his clue the words of pioneer Skyscraper Designer Louis Sullivan , " a proud and soaring thing , rising in sheer exultation that from bottom to top it is a unit without a single dissenting line . " The idea of purity so ruled his design that CBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than allow the lines of the tower to be interrupted by truck entrances ; supplies will be delivered to the building through a subterranean passageway . <P> Outdoing NBC . The new building 's site , at West 52nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas , is only two blocks from NBC 's 70-story skyscraper in Rockefeller Center . Thus a main goal of the architecture is to make CBS look distinguished in comparison to its lofty rival . The sunken plaza that consumes almost half the space of the tract not only singles the building out but draws the eye downward before it turns upward , adding to the effect of rise . <P> *Among the works-in-progress : Washington 's Dulles Airport , two college buildings at Yale , the Jefferson Memorial Arch in St. Louis , the Trans World Airlines terminal at Idlewild and Lincoln Center theater in Manhattan .
