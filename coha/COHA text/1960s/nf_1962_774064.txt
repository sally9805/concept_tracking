txt twentieth century the busiest port in the United States . It was a difficult passage for sailing ships which made first landfall at the Highland Light . The keeper of the light , as he stood his lonely watch , consulted a small volume listing the names of 3,000 ships of American registry which he might expect to see . In addition he had , in the huge volume of the Universal Code of Signals , a compilation of another 20,000 vessels of all nations and an extensive code of signals , semaphore for daylight and Morse for flashing messages after dark . Once he had determined the name of a ship , he looked it up and sent word to owners in the United States by telegraph or in Europe by cable that their ship had " got by . " This archaic system , so inadequate to save men and tonnage , was all the safeguard there was when Marconi arrived to discuss building a wireless station . The men of Highland Light would have none of it or of him . They thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigner . Not even Ed Cook was able to override their thorny New England resistance to strangers and new-fangled contraptions . Ed 's third try was almost assured of approval by the local citizenry since he picked one of his own hills ( at least he claimed it was his and no one disputed him at the time ) near South Wellfleet . The great advantage here was that the village sits at the narrowest point of the Cape and building materials could come in ships to the dock on the bay side , be loaded on wagons , and trucked along short-cut back roads to the sea , little more than a mile away . For the twenty 200-foot masts that would go up to more or less duplicate the Poldhu installation , 100-foot lengths of yellow or white pine were to be lashed together . Timber must be shipped in . Large trees could not be found in the neighborhood ? the region had long ago been deforested to build ships , its land left barren except for warped and stunted plants . Steeples of churches , around which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone reached upward toward the sky . De la Vergne oil burners for the powerful generators could be imported either by boat or train . Marconi ordered food , too . The 100 South Wellfleet hotel , Holcomb House , was capable of feeding the Marconi contingent but the meals must have been deplorable . Marconi gained an unmerited reputation for being finicky because he had what were described as " fine foods and wines " sent from Boston . Soon after the site was settled on , my father packed up and sailed back to England , where there was so much that only he could do . Vyvyan stayed on to see the building of the station through , not without misgivings as he had little faith that the structure could withstand heavy weather . His uneasiness deepened as the equinoctial gales set in and he cabled London for permission to lower the height of the masts . In October , before the answer came and only weeks after the Poldhu masts collapsed , a storm struck and wiped out the station . One of the massive pine shafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashed within three feet of where Vyvyan was standing . People of the Cape still speak of the terrible clamor and the sense of disaster that filled the night . This second catastrophe , an anticlimax after the Poldhu failure , was received with comparative stoicism in England , where Marconi was buoyed up by the success of experiments that began early in November between Poldhu and his most distant station at Crookhaven on the west coast of Ireland , 225 miles away . The signals came in strong and clear . He was confident they could carry ten times the distance . Time was his only enemy . While repairs were going ahead at Cape Cod , Father decided to transfer to Newfoundland and take a flyer on a kite . He told only the few people who would be working with him most closely . Poole , where , more nearly than anywhere else , he had headquarters during that year , is closely linked to Newfoundland . The Dorset fishermen were as familiar with its waters as with their own Solent . For generations the boys of Poole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back not only fish and game and cranberries for their tables but also mementos . I like to speculate that the Pool of Pool Bay in the New World is a corrup-101 tion of Poole in the old . The fishermen that Father knew liked to talk to him about this English world beyond the sea and he read intensively about it . When Marconi met the Governor of Newfoundland , then an English colony ( it was only later that it became a province of Canada ) , he said he had been shocked by the bulletins published by the Newfoundland Marine and Fisheries Department because they showed the parts of the coast where eighty vessels had come to grief , more than 600 lives lost and millions of dollars worth of property wiped out . My father was compassionate , as well as practical . D. W. Prowse 's History of Newfoundland must have helped prepare him for his venture . I own Father 's copy with G. Marconi written in a flamboyant hand on the flyleaf . Prowse 's note of presentation is pasted in below it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since a Genoese , John Cabot , originally Giovanni Caboto , " found the isle , " lively correspondence from Italian archives is included . The pages have been much thumbed and some , perhaps to be taken in his pocket on the voyage , are cut out of the back . One book , in my father 's hands , took on a special meaning , though its ultimate import was not yet clear to him in 1901 . In 1896 , Isabella Judson published a biography of her father , Cyrus W. Field , pioneer of intercontinental cable , whom the men of Poole remembered well . Thirty years earlier , Field had brought the western end of his Atlantic cable to Heart 's Content , one of the more merciful bays on the merciless continental shelf , not far from St. John 's . After a series of costly failures , Field 's original , badly managed company , which had to be rescued with refinancing as often as his cable had to be rescued from the ocean floor , was superseded by " The Anglo-American Telegraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a table in London and put down ten thousand pounds apiece . " Bolstered with further funds from the maintenance company and sale of shares to private investors , Field succeeded in laying the first workable cable in 1866 . The cost should have concerned my father . Analogies between 102 Field 's Anglo-American and Marconi 's Wireless Telegraph Company are all too apparent today . Both were backed by men who , understandably enough , invested not only to be repaid but also to have their money make money . Instead both companies called on them for additional sums . Marconi 's Wireless Telegraph Company had expanded rapidly and there were no dividends in sight for such outlays as the Poldhu station . Now , at last , Field 's company was reaping a rich harvest from its financial information ( the company made a " great point in transmitting quick-time messages , or stocks as they are termed " ) . Anglo-American 's enormous international capital and earnings , if wireless were sticcessful , would be mortally threatened . There is no hint that Marconi was thinking apprehensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he set out for Newfoundland . " On November 26 , 1901 , " Father recorded , " I sailed from Liverpool in the liner Sardinian accompanied by two assistants , Messrs . Kemp and Paget . As it was clearly impossible at that time of year , owing to the inclement weather and especially in view of the shortness of time at our disposal to erect high poles to support the aerial , I had arranged to have the necessary aerial supported in the air by a small captive balloon , and so we took with us two balloons as well as six kites . " The luggage that came out of the Sardinian 's hold on December 6 at St. John 's , Newfoundland , included wooden crates and a hamper big enough to have concealed Falstaff , but weighing less than if it had . In it were the " toys " on which a mighty future would hang . There was no crowd of reporters at the gangplank , as there had been in New York on his previous trip , though Newfoundland 's newspapers all originate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herald sent a man from the United States , possibly the same dogged reporter who had covered the America 's Cup races . Undoubtedly he thought Marconi was going to try for increased distance in communicating with ships at sea . The arrival seemed quiet and routine . Marconi continues his story : " We landed at St. John 's on Fri-103 day , December 6 , and the following day I visited the Governor , Sir Cavendish Boyle , the premier , Sir Robert Bond , and other members of the ministry . " It must have been then that he talked about the ghastly record of losses at sea for they " promised me their heartiest cooperation and placed the resources of every department of the Government at my disposal in order to facilitate my work . They also offered me the temporary use of such lands as I might require for the erection of depots at Cape Race , or elsewhere , if I should eventually determine to erect the wireless stations which they understood were being contemplated . " With considerable cunning , my father proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cabled Liverpool requesting Cunard and other lines carrying wireless equipment , to give him positions of their outbound ships so that he might begin distance tests with them . The stories the Herald reporter filed over the next days show that he had no suspicion of the truth . They have a gossip-column , breakfast-table breeziness which is refreshing and funny . As they sailed into St. John 's , the three scientific voyagers at the rail had been struck by the tower to John Cabot which stands high above the harbor . " After taking a look at various sites which might prove suitable , I considered that the best one was to be found on Signal Hill , a lofty eminence overlooking the port and forming the natural bulwark which protects it from the fury of the Atlantic gales . On top of the hill there is a small plateau of some two acres in area which I thought very suitable for the manipulation of either the balloons or the kites . On the crag of this plateau rose the new Cabot Memorial Tower which was designed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old military barracks which was then used as a hospital . " Beside this two-story stone building is a walled courtyard nakedly exposed to the weather , where the Herald man found them . As a result of his visit he sent a story his paper published the next day , Tuesday , December 10 . Marconi and his assistants , he said matter-of-factly , were busy unpacking instruments and 104 removing the balloons and several cylinders of hydrogen gas to one of the old buildings near the tower . A local firm was about to prepare the ground by covering it with zinc . When Marconi picked up the story , the tone was very different . " It was in a room in this building that I set up my apparatus and made preparations for the great experiment . " Two hundred and twenty-five miles had been bridged by wireless between Poldhu and Crookhaven . Now it was 2,170 that he proposed to put to the test . " On Monday , December nine , barely three days after my arrival , I began work on Signal Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost the old habit of sharing credit , working as lead man of a team . " I had decided to try one of the balloons first as a means of elevating the aerial and by Wednesday we had inflated it and it made its first ascent in the morning . Its diameter was about fourteen feet and it contained 1,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas , quite sufficient to hold up the aerial which consisted of a wire weighing about ten pounds . " As the Herald described it : " Mr. Marconi was at Signal Hill all day testing the balloons .... He hopes to have everything completed by Thursday or Friday , when he will try and communicate with the Cunard steamer Lucania , which left Liverpool on Saturday . " The disguise was working perfectly . " The experiments are exciting keen interest here , " he went on . " St. John 's merchants are considering the advisability of having the system installed on the sealing steamers . " It is reported that the Canadian Government is awaiting results of Mr. Marconi 's experiments here preparatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf of St. Lawrence . " Tuesday was difficult . The captive balloon was launched but escaped . Wednesday 's account in the Herald described what happened : " Mr. Marconi lost a balloon today while experimenting for the proposed wireless signals here . Although foggy , the weather did not look unfavorable for our work , ' Mr. Marconi said , and we continued experiments . One of the balloons measur-105 ing fourteen feet in diameter was sent up . The wind freshened quickly increasing to a gale , and when the balloon had gone up about one hundred feet we decided to take it down . Unfortunately the rope broke and it disappeared out at sea . " " Today 's accident will delay us for a few days and it will not be possible to communicate with a Cunarder this week . I hope , however , to do so next week , possibly with the steamer leaving New York on Saturday , ' " the Herald quoted him as saying . Father 's and Paget 's account , given later over BBC , makes it clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather , " Paget recalled , " was terrible and for a couple of days we battled with the elements , one of the balloons having been carried away by the gale , which snapped the heavy mooring rope like a piece of cotton . So Mr. Marconi suggested that for his crucial test on the third day we should use kites , and on that morning we managed to fly a kite up to four hundred feet . " It flew over the stormy Atlantic , surged up and down in the gale tugging at its six hundred foot aerial wire . The icy rain lashed my face as I watched it anxiously . The wind howled around the building where in a small dark room furnished with a table , one chair and some packing cases , Mr. Kemp sat at the receiving set while Mr. Marconi drank a cup of cocoa before taking his turn at listening for the signals which were being transmitted from Poldhu , at least we hoped so . " Father takes up the story : " It was shortly after midday on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earphone to my ear and started listening . The receiver on the table before me was very crude ? a few coils and condensers and a coherer , no valves , no amplifier , not even a crystal . " I was at last on the point of putting the correctness of all my beliefs to the test . The experiment had involved risking at least 50,000 pounds to achieve a result which had been declared impossible by some of the principal mathematicians of the time . The chief question was whether wireless waves could be stopped by the curvature of the earth . All along I had been convinced that this was not so , but some eminent men held that the roundness of the earth would prevent communication over such a great dis-106 tance as across the Atlantic . The first and final answer to that question came at 12 : 30 . " He set down exactly what happened then . " Suddenly , about half past twelve there sounded the sharp click of the ' tapper ' as it struck the coherer , showing me that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three sharp clicks corresponding to three dots sounded in my ear ; but I would not be satisfied without corroboration . " Can you hear anything , Mr. Kemp ? ' I said , handing the telephone to my assistant . Kemp heard the same thing as I. P. W. Paget , a little deaf , was unable to hear it , and I knew then that I had been absolutely right in my calculations . The electric waves which were being sent out from Poldhu had traveled the Atlantic , serenely ignoring the curvature of the earth which so many doubters considered would be a fatal obstacle , and they were now affecting my receiver in Newfoundland . I knew that the day on which I should be able to send full messages without wires or cables across the Atlantic was not far-distant . " In this triumphant hour , his vision of the future did not include the frantic battles that would ensue with the cable company . " The distance had been overcome and further development of the sending and receiving apparatus was all that was required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently owing to changes in the capacity of the aerial which in turn were due to the varying height of the kite . But again at 1:10 and 1:20 the three sharp little clicks were distinctly and unmistakably heard , about twenty-five times altogether . " On Saturday a further attempt was made to obtain a repetition of the signals but owing to difficulties with the kite we had to give up the attempt . However , there was no further doubt possible that the experiment had succeeded and that afternoon , December 14 , I sent a cablegram to Major Flood Page , managing director of the Marconi Company , informing him that the signals had been received but that the weather made continuous tests extremely difficult . The same night I also gave the news to the press at St. John 's whence it was telegraphed to all parts of 107 the world . " That very day he also cabled the news to Pontecchio . The New York Tinges began its December 15 story on this extraordinary piece of news : " St. John 's , N.F. Dec. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific development of modern times . " And what of the Herald ? Its reporter 's interest seems to have flagged on the crucial Thursday and Friday , for his Saturday story opened : " The weather on Signal Hill was extremely cold and unfavorable for wireless telegraphy experiments . The kite used yesterday fell into the water near the cliff , but was afterward rescued by a passing tug-boat and returned . " He had missed the scoop . Now the world knew and congratulations poured in . Small girls , in chilly little clumps , climbed Signal Hill with bouquets of flowers for Father . The Governor gave a lunch with long speeches on the historic role of Newfoundland as the link between Europe and America . Everyone was interviewed . Professor Michael Pupin , American scientist and inventor , acknowledged handsomely that " Marconi has proved conclusively that the curvature of the earth is no obstacle to the system of wireless telegraphy . " In New York , Mr. Cuthbert Hall of the Marconi Company received reporters and prophesied that there was no foreseeable limit to the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared the costs of wireless installations to the costs of laying cable ( there were by now fourteen on the Atlantic bed , enough to girdle the earth seven times ) . This brought an immediate dissent from the president of the Commercial Cable Company . " Signor Marconi , " he said , " had mistaken the action of the ground current or lightning for signals . " But the lay public was delighted . They still saw Marconi as a boy and even more delightful , as a boy with a kite . Ray Stannard Baker , writing for McClure 's , caught this reaction : " A cable , marvelous as it is , maintains a tangible and material connection between speaker and hearer : one can grasp its meaning . But here is nothing but space , a pole with a pendant wire on one side of a broad and curving ocean , an uncertain kite struggling in the air on the other ? and thought passing between . And the apparatus 108 for sending and receiving these transoceanic messages costs not a thousandth part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this article , taken at St. John 's a few days after the experiments , gives a very good idea of the inventor 's face , though it can not convey the peculiar lustre of his eyes when he is interested or excited ? and perhaps it makes him look older than he really is . One of the first and strongest impressions that the man conveys is that of intense activity and mental absorption . He talks little , is straightforward and unassuming , submitting good-naturedly ? although with evident unwillingness ? to be lionized . " In the eyes of the world what Marconi had done with two balloons and six kites was magic , an occult modern mystery . The Field achievement was by comparison pedestrian and cumbersome . He himself had written when he was taken aboard the Great Eastern to see the ship 's crew through their heavy labors , toward the end of the cable-laying voyage , that there had been on board " ten bullocks , one milk cow , 114 sheep , 20 pigs , 29 geese , 14 turkeys , 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including 28 bullocks and eighteen thousand eggs . " Nor was this all . When they dragged the ocean floor to bring up the " slimy monster , " they had to use as grapnel twenty miles of rope twisted with wires of steel in order to bear the strain imposed by thirty tons of cable . It took two hours even to lower it to the bottom . As against this , Marconi had instantaneously caught his intangible train of waves with a kite that could be packed in a wicker hamper and weighed a few ounces . Long , long afterward , the Italian government asked my father to record , in his own voice , the thing he accomplished in Newfoundland . I listened to the record in the Library of Congress in Washington , D.C. It had been years since he had heard the three dots come over the stormy sea from Poldhu but the excitement is there , fresh and real , beneath the controlled , musical voice . On that December 15 , Marconi reported to the Herald : " The success of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further tests with kites and balloons for a short time and erect a large station here at a cost of fifty thousand dollars having 109 towers or masts for supporting wires . This , of course , provided there is no governmental objection . This will necessitate my going back to England at the end of next week in order to have the necessary equipment sent here , with suitable transmitting machinery and other requirements . " There could , his tone implied , be no question of government objection . Marconi had reckoned without Anglo-American . // Before going back to England Marconi took a short trip to Cape Spear to see whether it was suitable for a permanent wireless station . He returned to St. John 's on December 16 to find an officer of the law waiting to hand him a threatening communication from Anglo-American 's lawyers : " Unless we receive an intimation from you during the day that you will not proceed further with the work you are engaged in and remove the appliances erected for the purpose of telegraphic communication , legal proceedings will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for any damages which our client may sustain or have sustained ; and we further give you notice that our clients will hold you responsible for any loss or damage by reason of your trespass upon their rights . " If Commercial Cable dismissed Marconi 's conquest of the Atlantic as a " fairy tale of science , " this document made it clear that Anglo-American did not . It contended that it held a monopoly , as the legislature had granted exclusive landing and working rights for fifty years in 1884 , on telegraphy in Newfoundland , and it meant to protect its contracts , though they had only two more years to run . Marconi laughed when he read the paper but the cable com-lii pany had already " sustained damage " serious enough to explain its apprehensions , if not the crudity of the attack . Said a London newspaper : " The fall in the securities of cable companies which commenced with the announcement of the success of 1/Iarconi 's experiments in having signals transmitted across the ocean by his wireless system of telegraphy has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the men of Newfoundland backed Marconi . American and English papers at once reported " widespread and growing indignation " at St. John 's . Sir Cavendish Boyle , responding to the general Canadian feeling that Anglo-American was behaving unsportingly , made a point of going on the seventeenth with his full cabinet up to the old barracks to pay an official visit to Marconi 's station . The announcement they made was pompous ? they had decided " to countenance him because of the great scientific interest concerned " ? but their action was warm . Governor Boyle cabled King Edward VII about Father 's success , gave an imposing luncheon in his honor , and obviously approved a resolution passed on December 20 : " The Council are much gratified at Signor Marconi 's success , marking as it does , the dawn of a new era in transoceanic telegraphy , and deplore the action of the Anglo-American Company . " Lower down the line , the fishermen were as angry as the government . They liked Marconi because he was unpretentious and direct . They understood him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concerned over the difficulties and dangers of their lives , whereas the cable company , they felt resentfully , made it all too clear where its interests lay . On occasion Marconi loved a good fight but , coming as it did at the end of a long period of strain , he had no stomach for this one . He decided to leave and Ray Stannard Baker later wrote : " I accompanied Mr. Marconi across the island on his way to Nova Scotia , and it seemed as if every farmer in the country had heard of him , for when the train stopped they came crowding to look in at the window . From the comments I heard , they wondered most at the inventor 's youthful appearance . " He was twenty-seven . 112 As soon as it was known that Marconi was quitting St. John 's , offers flooded in from other communities eager to cooperate with him in building a permanent station . Alexander Graham Bell wrote that his property at Cape Breton was at Marconi 's disposition . Alec Johnston , representative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sydney , Nova Scotia , Record was actively concerned in the outcome and wrote me thirty years later : " I resolved to make a dash to North Sydney where Marconi would change from the steamer Bruce to the train for New York for the story . ' " I was pacing up and down the pier when the steamer arrived . The passengers commenced to disembark with little delay . The train which was to carry them to their respective destinations would shortly arrive and consequently there was no time to lose . " I had no difficulty in picking out my man from the rest of the passengers . While his luggage was being assembled I approached him , introduced myself and in a very few words explained to him the purpose I had in mind . This purpose was not merely to obtain a newspaper story but to point out , if he would listen to me , that in my opinion the experiments in which he was engaged could be carried out from points along the Cape Breton coast as well as from Newfoundland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence . " At this stage I gathered that Signor Marconi was registering interest . But he raised the point that the same difficulties that confronted him in Newfoundland might similarly operate against him in Cape Breton . " It was easy to set his mind at rest on that score . There were no communication companies that could or would set up any claim of monopoly . " The train for New York pulled out without Marconi . Whether by good fortune or good management , G. H. Murray , head of the Nova Scotia government , was in town for the day and joined Johnston in persuading Marconi to stay over long enough to reconnoiter the shore between Sydney and Louisburg . He was delighted to accede and under distinguished auspices started out 113 grandly in a special car furnished by the Dominion Oil Company which owned not only the railroad but also the steamship line and a great deal of land round about . Marconi sat next to the window with Cornelius Shields , general manager of the coal company beside him , maps and charts spread across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoreline so they caught constant glimpses of the ocean . Between Bridgeport and Glace Bay , a flat headland ringed with cliffs , jutted out . Marconi was instantly taken with it , saying excitedly that " it looked like a fine location . " Shields seized the bell cord and the engineer obligingly stopped the train . The men walked across to the tableland and climbed up on to it where the view of the Atlantic was sweeping . Marconi 's enthusiasm continued to grow . His companions were immensely excited ; they wanted the honor and the glory which AngloAmerican had denied Newfoundland for Nova Scotia . To clinch it Shields volunteered on the spot that his company would give this piece of land to my father as its contribution toward the enterprise . It was an auspicious beginning . There was more to come . That night the party dined at the Sydney Hotel in a mood of celebration which spread , Johnston recalled , " even to the staid Marconi . " Financing , the Nova Scotians believed , could be arranged with the national government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in Nova Scotia . The next day they carried Marconi and Kemp and Paget off to Ottawa where Finance Minister Fielding , a man noted for his care in dispensing public monies , sent them along to Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier . All Canada had followed the accounts of Marconi 's work and Sir Wilfrid was one of his ardent admirers . It would take $75,000 , a far larger sum then than it is now , but Marconi got it and in record time . By the following night , a contract for the building of the Table Head Station was drafted and the Canadian government pledged enough money to cover the new station and meet the cost of such construction as remained to be done at Cape Cod . 114 Marconi left for New York in the morning , undoubtedly breaking his trip to see how things were going at South Wellfleet . People there still remember that he used to drop in unexpectedly to check progress . On these visits he stayed in a strange little cottage shaped like a tower which had been moved down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Codders may be set in their ways , but they move their houses the way most people move their cars . Father 's cottage has been moved back three times as the sea ate into the coastline . It is now a tourist cabin . I have walked through it and climbed to the room where he slept . From every window , moor , sky , and ocean stretch away endlessly . In New York , scene of earlier triumphs and wild adulation , Marconi met with a kind of hostility less tolerable than the bludgeoning of Anglo-American . Many of his colleagues , the men of science who should have understood and rejoiced in his progress , were not convinced . He had violated a preconception and they did not like it . If , as they believed reasonable , electromagnetic waves traveled in a straight line , they would have been over 1,000 miles above the earth by the time they reached St. John 's from Poldhu . Only two men had heard , or claimed they had heard , the three dots . They might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . There was no suggestion of fraud but the inference that his announcement was premature and rash cut Marconi cruelly . A fellow scientist , Oliver Lodge , expressed this attitude in a letter to the London Times : Sir , ? It is rash to express an opinion either way as to the probability of the correctness of Mr. Marconi 's evidently genuine impression that he obtained evidence on the other side of the Atlantic of electrical disturbances purposely made on this side , but I sincerely trust that he is not deceived . . . . Proof is , of course , still absent , but by making the announcement in an incautious and enthusiastic manner , Marconi has awakened sympathy and a hope that his energy and enterprise may not have been deceived by unwanted electrical dryness of that wintry shore . 115 Major Flood Page replied in haste in a hand he feared could not be deciphered because he was in " a very shaky railway carriage on his way to the continent , " reminding Lodge that Marconi was not there to answer letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sportsmanlike . He ended furiously , " It seems to me incumbent that some reply should be made , which is my apology for addressing you . " The Daily Telegraph of December 18 rubbed salt in lIarconi 's wounds : " Despite the detailed , signed statement by Signor Marconi . . . there was an indisposition . . . to accept as conclusive his evidence that the problems of wireless telegraphy across the Atlantic had been solved by the young inventor . Skepticism prevailed in the city . One swallow does not make a summer , ' said one , and a series of " S " signals do not make the Morse code . ' The view generally held was that electric strays and not rays were responsible for actuating the delicate recording instruments . . Some attributed these wandering currents to the old trouble ? earth currents , others to the presence of a Cunarder fitted with Marconi apparatus which was , or should have been , within two hundred miles of the receiving station at St. John 's on the day of the experiment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An outsider wrote that " everybody " loved him and admired his courage . They simply did not believe that Marconi could have sent messages across the Atlantic . The New York Times was then and always pro-Marconi : The initial success of Marconi appeals powerfully to the imagination . It will be the fervent hope of all intelligent men that wireless telegraphy will very soon prove to be not a mere " scientific toy , " but a system for daily and common use . The men of science point out obstacles . They have commonly been deemed insuperable . The first triumph is an augury of future conquests . This was comforting but when the old friend and supporter , Preece , was numbered among the waverers , it distressed young Marconi . Sir William was quoted as saying the three dots used 116 for S and the dot-dash-dot that indicates R are the sounds most frequently caused by natural atmospheric disturbances . It was suggested that Father might unwittingly have heard from a Cunarder signaling with his apparatus . A French naval officer , though any Frenchman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France and on ships for the French Navy , maintained that the wireless coverage of the Columbia-Shamrock race was a hoax ? that the stories released in New York bore no resemblance to the ones sent from the Grande Duchesse . Edison 's first reaction to the news that wireless had crossed the ocean was that it was impossible . He gallantly corrected this immediately , saying that his faith in Marconi 's integrity was sufficient ground for accepting the claim . Michael I. Pupin , Professor of Electrical Mechanics at Columbia , fully believed that Marconi had succeeded and said , " According to the newspaper reports I have read , the signals were very faint but that has little to do with it . The distance ... was overcome , and further development of the sending instruments is all that is required .... Marconi has proved conclusively that the curvature of the earth is no obstacle to wireless telegraphy ... it is only to be regretted that there are so many so-called scientists and electricians who are trying to deprive him and his people of the credit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mixed though reactions were , there were scientists who wished to honor Marconi . They decided , with certain businessmen , to give him a dazzling banquet . It was arranged under the auspices of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers whose president was Charles Steinmetz . T. Comerford Martin , editor of the Electric World and a stout champion of Marconi publicized it vigorously . As plans proceeded , the committee in charge of arrangements found to their horror that many reputable scientific men would not risk attending . At this juncture Martin appealed to Elihu Thomson , one of the great American electrical pioneers ? his work with wireless actually anteceded Hertz 's ? who , almost alone among the experts , believed that electrical waves follow the curve of the earth . He wrote Martin a strong letter stating his absolute faith in Mar-117 coni . With this letter as a bellwether , Martin rounded up many of the timid . In spite of initial difficulties , the banquet in the Astor Gallery of the old Waldorf Astoria on the night of January 13 turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection which the preparations for the party bore witness to moved Marconi to tremendous happiness . He was like a child , a solemn child , his eyes shining but with no words to express the quickening of his emotions . Attached to the wall back of the table of honor a large black tablet bore the letters M-A-R-C-O-N-I appropriately spelled out in electric lights . On the wall at the head table 's right another tablet bore the name Poldhu , and opposite was St. John 's , both wreathed in smilax and linked by a silken cord . On this symbolic cable , lights winked out the three dots of the S in Morse code . There were about three hundred guests and countless people jammed the balconies . The menu bore a likeness of Marconi at the historic hour when he received the first transatlantic signal and the dinner wound up with ices , each bearing an icicle telegraph pole . Whoops of glee and cries of " Frozen out ! " greeted them while Marconi , in an access of pleasure , stood up and clapped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sheaf of letters . Nikola Tesla wrote that Marconi , " a deep thinker ... may prove one of those whose powers reach out for the good of the race and the honor of his country . " Said Edison , " I am sorry not to be present to pay my respects to Marconi . I would like to meet that young man who has had the monumental audacity to attempt and succeed in jumping an electrical wave across the Atlantic . " He had talked with Edison , the toastmaster added , within the past ten days and that great man had said " ... he thought that sometime there might be signals across the Atlantic without wires but he did not know when and , being preoccupied , he did not think he would have time to do it himself . I 'm glad he did it , ' he said . That fellow 's work puts him in my class . It 's a good thing we caught him young . ' " From behind the rose-banked table with its winking lights , 118 young Guglielmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the afternoon of December 12 . He made his speech quietly and seriously , thanking the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and feeling " greatly honored to be in the midst of so many eminent men , whose names are household words in the whole civilized world . " Steinmetz , Bell , Thomson were at his table . If he had felt rancor over their doubts it was dissipated now in the joy of the hour and he had nothing but gratitude and abiding affection for Elihu Thomson . He outlined what had happened , thanked Canada for its hospitality and help and spoke of what 7777 would accomplish . " By experiments and improvements which have been made , messages can be read only when the receiver and transmitter are attuned . " Of the cable battle he said only , " The cost of laying cables is so large that the cable companies have to charge a high price for the service . My system will cheapen the cost very greatly . " And with his customary generosity he shared his laurels . " I have built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like to mention Clerk Maxwell , Lord Kelvin , Professor Henry , and Professor Hertz . I do not know if you are aware that the message received at St. John 's was heard through a telephone receiver and in connection with the telephone the name of Professor Alexander Graham Bell is inseparable . " He finished : " I drink a toast to the health of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers ! " and raised his glass high , then lowered it to his lips . The assembled throng raised their glasses to him and drank in profound silence . Then they cheered . Two days later his old and good friend , The New York Times , said on its editorial page : His statement was so modest , so free from every trace of exaggeration for business purposes , so generously just in its recognition of the obligation to the pioneers in experimentation along the lines he has followed , so frank in acknowledging the claims of the living as well as the dead , and withal so conservative in its predicting of what may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone present realized that to Marconi was not only due the honor of his discoveries in the field of mechanics , but 119 the still higher honor which belongs to one who can subordinate all professional jealousies and rivalries to the truth . From the wreath woven for his own brow he borrowed enough to make wreaths for his predecessors and colleagues in the study of electrical waves . . . and by what he took from it his own was rather enriched than impoverished . // y father , Guglielmo Marconi , the young man who bore himself with such decorum and modesty at the Waldorf , had already made his great and original contributions to science . I can see , from the perspective of history , that he had actually completed the framework on which , for the rest of his life , he built . It was an unmarked pinnacle then . In his own eyes , it seemed that there was much more to do than had been done . Indeed in the years ahead there would be new patents of great importance , tests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever he accomplished was imperfect he would drive himself to improve it and as long as men doubted his work , he would continue to prove it to them . A scientist like Professor Ambrose Fleming , by nature exceedingly cautious , admitted that Marconi had achieved an awesome thing . " When it is realized , " he wrote in a letter to the London Times , " that these visible dots and dashes are the result of trains of intermingled electric waves rushing with the speed of light across the intervening . . . miles , caught on one and the same short aerial wire and disentangled and sorted out automatically by the two machines into intelligible messages in different languages , the wonder of it all can not but strike the mind . " My father him-121 self never lost the sense of that wonder . It tended to make him humble rather than proud , and increasingly remote . Ten days after the testimonial dinner Marconi sailed for England on one of his innumerable ocean crossings . For once he did no actual experimenting . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail to sort and answer ? letters from admirers and invitations to lecture and write articles ( he was prepared to do little of either ) . Knowing how his mind worked , however , I am certain that his days at sea were given over to assessing the Newfoundland discoveries and predicating his future moves on them . At any rate the fruit of the voyage was a highly technical patent so explicitly clear to him that he filed an application and built a pilot model within the next few months . In London he was in no mood for the reporters who invariably appeared at railroad stations when he traveled , so he parried their questions and proceeded to disappear , as far as the press was concerned . Director Marconi left instructions at Finch Lane that his address be kept secret . Then he took a hansom cab to the quietly anonymous part of the city where his mother was living and walked in unannounced . For one month thereafter she feasted on the pleasure of having her son to herself , of being necessary to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . No one was permitted to invade this privacy except Luigi Solari . He was always welcome . And I bless him for taking notes of the discussions of those private days . Luigi , a far more ebullient man than Guglielmo , asked what was the greatest emotion his friend had felt over the transatlantic affair . " I am never emotional , " Guglielmo answered with a passion that belied his words . Then , as was his way , he weighed his statement and candidly amended it . To his mother 's delight he admitted , " I did feel strongly when I saw my mother again . She 's the only person on earth who understood my misgivings and trepidation when I left for Newfoundland . " And furthermore she believed in him , blindly , 122 unscientifically , maternally even when he did not quite believe in himself . Mostly they talked about the technical problems that confronted him and of his practical plans . His mother knew , sitting in the lamplight listening , that her son would leave her soon . Always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his marriage some day but she could not find it in her heart to make a whole and separate life for herself ? she never did . Annie Marconi held herself ready for the less and less frequent arrivals of her son till the day she died . That evening in the quiet parlor she heard him say that he must go back to America as soon as possible , and whatever was in her heart , her face showed nothing . Guglielmo went on . After he had cleared the rough agreement proposed by the Canadians with his company , he would get the Nova Scotia station under way and check the progress of the Cape Cod installation . Did the rotation of the earth affect the passage round it of electrical waves ? He thought not . He would test his conviction by sending west-to-east messages from the ship he took to America . Three almost supraphysical unknowns troubled him . The first was the effect of solar light ; the second , the effect of electrical disturbances ; and the third , the effect of mountainous terrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wanted to communicate over the land that lies between Europe 's seas and , he told his mother and Solari , the British Admiralty had offered to put a cruiser at his disposal . Though grateful for this offer , he would have preferred an Italian warship . But why not ? Solari broke in . Guglielmo was persona grata with the Italian authorities and with the House of Savoy . The new King , Victor Emmanuel III , was as ardently interested in Marconi 's work as his father , Umberto I , had been . Nothing could be simpler to arrange . Marconi took fire at the idea , hesitating only because , " in Italy there is really extraordinary skepticism about wireless communication . " Thereafter , that night , they talked on and on about Italy . By blood he was only half Italian , 123 by love more nearly all Italian . For the present , though , the homesick man could not go home . The Mediterranean would have to wait on the Atlantic . A month to the day after he landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed from Cherbourg on the same ship . With him was a considerable entourage : Mr. and Mrs. R. N. Vyvyan , for that gentleman , as he wrote dryly , had " taken the opportunity of a brief holiday to get married , " another engineer , J. D. Taylor , two wireless operators , F. C. Stacey , who had served on the Princesse Clementine , and C. S. Franklin , as well as Henry S. Saunders of the company , and Marconi 's secretary . The purpose of the crossing , as far as they were concerned , was to blazon the truth of what wireless could do to a doubting world . It was , Vyvyan felt , " a memorable voyage . " The Marconi troupe was at work before the Philadelphia cleared harbor . They fixed an aerial to the 170-foot mast and ran a wire into the cabin they had set aside as a workshop and demonstration center . Since the length of this wire was fixed , unlike the one to the kite at St. John 's , they were able to employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals on tape with a Morse " inker " that printed blue dots and dashes . Both these procedures had been ruled out by the dancing ups and downs of the Newfoundland kite . As the ship quit France and passed south of the British Isles , Marconi and his engineers , who had embarked at Cherbourg for this purpose , kept in touch with the Needles for the first 70 miles , the limit of the station 's sending range . After that they tuned in Poldhu . Guglielmo Marconi was still smarting from Oliver Lodge 's contention that his announcement from St. John 's had been given in " an incautious and enthusiastic manner . " Enthusiastic he most certainly was . Incautious never . For the shipboard demonstration he provided himself with unimpeachable and technically knowledgeable witnesses : the captain , A. R. Mills , and the chief officer , C. Marsden . Passengers of various nationalities were also invited to look on . Before he docked in New York , Marconi had 124 a series of tapes , signed as bona fide by the captain . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells the story of what had happened : Messages received on board steamship PHILADELPHIA from Marconi station at Poldhu ( Cornwall ) as follows : No. 1-250.2 miles ; No. 2 464.5 miles ; No. 3-1032.3 miles ; No. 4-1163.5 miles ; No. 5-1551.5 miles . Signals 2099 miles from Poldhu when we were in Latitude 42.01 N. , and longitude 47.23 Reporters were on hand when the Philadelphia 's gangplank went down in New York ( within a year Father would be described as " the most interviewed man in the world " ) . The boyishness , so evident and irresistible on his first arrival in the United States , was replaced by a certain defensiveness . " This merely confirms , " he said a trifle grimly as he handed the newsmen his tapes , " what I have previously done in Newfoundland . There is no longer any question about the ability of wireless telegraphy to transmit messages across the Atlantic . " For an instant , however , his reserve was penetrated . They asked him about the future , and like all men of vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he told them , he thought it possible to send wireless around the world . This they printed without comment . In 1901 how could they believe him ? It would be nearly twenty-five years before electrical waves circled the earth . Could even Marconi have foreseen the time when impulses girdling the globe three times would be recorded at the starting point of each revolution a seventh of a second after takeoff ? At last , however , what Marconi had already accomplished was generally credited . McClure 's editorialized : " Marconi and the ship 's officers and others aboard the Philadelphia heard the tick and , looking at the tape , saw the dots and dashes which you or I or anybody can still see . When a machine does a thing , we humans believe ; so long as a man stands between , we doubt . " We humans , then , believed . However , there were endless riddles to be solved . Marconi did not use the words " adequate apparatus " 125 lightly . He was plagued by the inadequacy of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty . The record taken on the ship does not disclose this , but for over 700 miles , no messages were received by daylight . At night , they came in at better than 2,000 miles . As Marconi put it : " . . clear sunlight and blue skies , though transparent , act as a kind of fog to powerful Hertzian rays . " Twenty years later smaller and smaller waves would overcome the " daylight effect . " At the time , however , so primitive was the knowledge of electrical waves that it is not surprising Marconi should have thought that perhaps greater power would penetrate that fog . The power at Glace Bay , he concluded on shipboard , must be stepped up . The Canadian plans needed to be revised . What he had in mind was a .50-watt alternator , twice as large as the one at Poldhu . The cost and the time for installation would be prodigious but nothing could be allowed to stand in the way of attaining commercial service . Vyvyan went with Marconi to Table Head , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great good fortune he could buy the alternator they needed second hand . This would greatly advance the operation . Still it would be months before the station was ready to function . Vyvyan first had to enlarge the buildings . He used a crew of out-of-work miners from the mine directly beneath the station ? Poles , Italians , Americans , Canadians , and Indians . While Vyvyan was engaged in this complex building job , Father went to Ottawa to reach a final agreement on the contract . Only one new clause was inserted by the Canadian government : The rate for wireless messages should be no higher than ten cents a word . Though the signed contract was not designed for the purpose , it was a strong answer to the cable company 's objections to wireless . This was a price they could not meet . Father looked in once more on Cape Cod , then shuttled back to England where , in June , he filed application for another patent . Poole was the birthplace of this innovation ; Sir Ernest Rutherford , who had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 126 On a rarely beautiful early morning , Marconi left his laboratory in the Haven Hotel and mounted his bicycle ( he still loved to wheel through the country ) to ride into Bournemouth , 15 miles away . Along the road he passed clumps of rhododendrons in riotous bloom . In Bournemouth , Father went from shop to shop looking for the thinnest possible wire . He could find nothing that would do until he remembered a flower shop where he had frequently watched a pretty girl wind the stems of flowers for corsages with wire as thin as button thread . She gladly supplied him with as much as he wanted and his bicycle sped back to the Haven . Could Mr. Kemp give him a box ? Kemp , the dependable , provided a box as unquestioningly as he provided everything else his boss needed . Father sat down and in less than fifteen minutes his deft hands put together what was subsequently described as a " jewel of workmanship . " The coherer had , all along , been the weakest Iink in the chain that produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibration of motors , the rolling and pitching of the vessel . What Marconi tagged his " magnetic detector , " since it picked up impulses from a moving wire belt ( hence the need for wire ) that traveled under a pair of horseshoe magnets , was sufficiently sensitive to register electric impulses but insensitive to the movement of ships . This was the " jewel , " created in a flash , although the plan for it was clear to him long before he mounted his bicycle on that bonny day . Now it was done and the summer belonged to him . Here was a break he had earned by driving himself unremittingly for two years . The three balls he had been juggling since early in 1900 were safely in his hands . The Company was going well , the Atlantic had been conquered , and selective tuning was established with the " four sevens " patent . His mother and his colleagues urged him to take a holiday . Instead , he went to sea . // V Vhile Marconi journeyed west , Solari went east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with King Victor Emmanuel . On this occasion he told his king that Marconi dreamed of experimenting in an Italian ship . The response was handsome , as Luigi had known it would be . Marconi was important to modern Italy , a nation which needed to catch up before it could take its place in the sun . The Italian Navy , as its young lieutenant , Solari , had confidently predicted , was instructed to put a ship at Marconi 's disposition . The cruiser Carlo Alberto was chosen , a signal honor , as it was the bright particular star of the fleet , detailed to take part in the festivities attendant on the coronation of Edward VII . Admiral Morin , Minister of the Italian Navy , issued an invitation to Marconi to join it after the Spithead review for its return to Italy in the summer of 1902 . For a man who had always had to make do on Atlantic liners where he was a paying passenger or guest , the prospect was gratifying and heady . The Carlo Alberto , a magnificent ship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own " technical staff , " small , young , and companionable . Marconi was head man , Lieutenant Solari , second-in-command , and the third was a midship-128 man , Giuseppe Raineri-Biscia , a Bolognese whose family were friends of the Marconis . Giuseppe kept a diary of that wonderfully romantic cruise . Midshipman Raineri-Biscia , by the time he loaned me his day book , had become Admiral Raineri-Biscia , and the diary itself had contributed to his rise . In elegant script , illustrated with line drawings , he expatiated therein on the beauties of the Carlo Alberto 's " modern " design , devoted a section to his conclusions about winds and currents off the Mediterranean shore of Gibraltar , kept a seaman 's meticulous log and a personal memoir . It is a splendid record , so splendid that I am told it earned him a promotion of two grades . " On the morning of June 18 , 1902 , " he wrote , " we Marconi was not yet with them steamed in view of the English coast and the high masts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of greetings . I confess to having felt tremendous emotion on being present for the first time at this new method of communication . " A few days later Admiral Mirabello , commanding officer of the Carlo Alberto , received disconcerting news : King Edward was about to undergo an operation for appendicitis and the review was canceled indefinitely . Return to Italy was , therefore , imminent , and he put in at Poole to allow Marconi to come aboard and make arrangements for his experiments . The ship 's company gave Father a welcoming dinner , at which a long friendship began between the Admiral and the scientist . Not to be outdone in generosity , Marconi gave the Carlo Alberto his magnetic detector . Next morning , Marconi went to London to attend to business , thinking he had several days free before they would leave for Italy . The ship proceeded to Weymouth where Mirabello 's orders were changed again . Victor Emmanuel had decided to visit Czar Nicholas at Kronstadt , Russia 's great naval base , and the Carlo Alberto was to be in attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already Saturday , July 5 , and the ship was expected in Russia on July 12 . Mirabello wired Marconi in London asking him to come along . Without waiting for an answer , he took the wire-129 less equipment and Kemp aboard and sailed for Dover , where he hoped to pick up Marconi . Marconi 's answer was not received until Monday . It said he would be on the dock at Dover Tuesday morning . All during the night it took the ship to run from Poole to Dover , Kemp and Raineri-Biscia worked to erect a new mast and spread a fourfold aerial between it and the permanent mainmast , and lead a line into the wireless cabin . At a quarter to eleven the next morning , Raineri-Biscia was on the pier at Dover to meet Marconi . The two of them made the ship at the double . Her anchor was stowed , her engines turning over as they raced down the dock . An hour later Marconi was at work . Poldhu had instructions to send the Carlo Alberto 's call letters  --  CD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solari , and Admiral Mirabello , using a telephone coupled to the magnetic detector , received signals from Poldhu , five hundred miles away , at five minutes past twelve . On Wednesday the aerial was hooked up to the Morse machine and recorded messages without a hitch . As the ship moved into the North Sea other stations were tuned in ( by now there were twelve European shore installations ) . To their dismay the detector did not dispel the effects of atmospheric disturbances . But , at hundreds of miles and across the British Isles and the breadth of Denmark , dots and dashes were recorded from Poldhu , though erratically . Marconi notified Finch Lane he was in touch as far as Gotland and wished Poldhu to continue its program of sending , but only at night . Over five hundred miles he still got nothing by day . They could not find the answer to the riddle . For a half hour before dawn and after sunset Poldhu engineers transmitted the letters S ( three dots ) and V ( three dots and a dash ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervening hours in the small cabin . They stayed awake , somehow , hopefully adjusting their instruments but as the first traces of light appeared in the sky through the porthole , the signals of the night faded and ceased . Marconi was reduced to cursing in his Bolognese dialect : " Damn the sun ! How long will it torment us ? " 130 They tried everything , wearily scaling the masts while the ship was making full speed ahead even in heavy weather . One expedient they tried was to drape a canopy of thin copper wires over the steel ridgepole they had strung between the masts . RaineriBiscia made a fine drawing of the rig in his diary . Alas , it did not work . On Saturday morning , July 12 , the Carlo Alberto came within sight of the five grim fortresses at the entrance to Kronstadt roadstead and the onion-shaped spires of the port 's churches . When the Italian cruiser dropped her anchor , Russian officers came aboard to pay their respects to Admiral Mirabello . The Russian fleet was in and the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father had experienced at Cowes . But , as at Cowes , his work went on . Now even night signals failed him and he began a patient series of adjustments . On the evening of July 15 he was rewarded . Messages from England were received in Russia , a distance of 1,600 miles . The next morning the festivities began in earnest for him and he took time to enjoy them . Yet when the Italian Admiral asked him to come to Krasnoie-Selo for a military review , he was impelled to refuse and stay aboard ship . The King and the Czar announced they would visit the Carlo Alberto the following day . Marconi was in a dilemma . He knew they would wish to see messages sent , which was simple , and received , which was impossible . Nothing would come through from Poldhu after sun-up and the two rulers could hardly be asked to come back after dark . Solari master-minded a solution . He installed a small transmitter at one end of the ship and prepared to send a message of homage to Nicholas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper story of that day . The imperial yacht Alexandra , with the monarchs aboard , dropped anchor close by the gaily beflagged Carlo Alberto while the flotilla of ships in the bay let off volleys till clouds of smoke enveloped the scene . Hurrahs from the Russian crews floated across the water . Victor Emmanuel was first to board the cruiser to the strains of his national anthem . Gusts of wind carried the sound of the march 131 played simultaneously on all the Russian ships . The Carlo Alberto crew shouted " Viva it Re ! " and the royal standard was broken out on the foremast . Then Nicholas boarded , to the strains of the Russian national anthem . Followed by his officers , he reviewed the ship 's company and talked with Victor Emmanuel . In a few minutes , king and emperor went to the wireless cabin . Marconi was presented to the Russian ruler and , in English , explained the functioning of the instruments and showed strips of telegrams received from Poldhu . The Czar stayed for over half an hour , asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Solari had composed , he asked where it had come from . Marconi confessed how Solari had arranged the special transmission . Smiling , the Czar asked to meet the enterprising lieutenant , so Luigi was called to the cabin and duly presented . When it was all over there was a round of luncheons , receptions , teas , and dinners for the Italian Navy officers but again Marconi was too busy to go to them . He could not , however , escape the visits of the whole of the Italian colony which came down the canal from St. Petersburg , keener to see him than their ship . One day a Russian caller arrived at the foot of the Carlo Alberto 's gangway and said to the Italian sailor who helped him aboard , " I want to pay my respects to Marconi , the father of wireless . " That caller was Alexander Stepanovitch Popoff , the Russian scientist who had discovered that the coherer could be used to predict thunderstorms , and who was widely credited with the invention of wireless . On the calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlo Alberto weighed anchor , to salvos of Russian cannon , and sailed slowly out of Kronstadt . In the Gulf of Finland fog closed down and stayed with her as she refueled at Kiel and crossed the Baltic except for one propitious moment when it lifted to disclose the royal British yacht , Victoria and Albert . Edward liked to convalesce at sea and his cruise obviously benefited him , for Admiral Mirabello was notified that the Spithead review had been rescheduled and he was to proceed there as senior foreign officer . On the first day Edward , on his yacht , passed majestically be-132 tween the ranks of the greatest ships of Europe , drawn up to salute him and play " God Save the King . " The Victoria and Albert came to rest to port of the Italian cruiser . This was glory . The next day was chagrin . The Carlo Alberto was to lead the foreign and British fleets past the English sovereign 's ship . A capricious wind sprang up . Her anchor fouled and she passed at the end of the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he landed briefly at Poole , he rejoined his ship to supervise additional work on the wireless masts . When the review was over he was returned to Poole where he stayed while the ship was fitted at Plymouth and Coverack Bay for the Mediterranean voyage and loaded up with wireless equipment for other Italian vessels . This done , she anchored in front of the Poldhu station and her officers came ashore to see it . They were immensely delighted to find an Italian flag flying on British soil . At noon on August 26 , the Carlo Alberto set her course for Ferrol , Spain , with Marconi on deck ready to make a trial he had been contemplating , I think , ever since the day of the incident in Queen Victoria 's garden at Osborne House . Then he had been wrestling with the possibility that the East Cowes hills might prove an impediment to Hertzian waves ; now he meant to learn if they would transcend a far greater massif . The ship coasted down past the western flank of Spain and Portugal to North Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strait of Gibraltar in thick fog . Marconi asked the Admiral to take a position which would keep his wireless sheltered by the Spanish sierras and plateau . At a great distance from Poldhu , with a rocky mass between sender and receiver , the future of his invention could be tested . At two o'clock in the morning , Marconi , Mirabello , and Solari sat around the table which held his receiving instruments ? detector and coherer . He put on the earphones : complete silence . Sensing the strain of the two wireless experts and not wishing to disturb them , the Admiral left the cabin . At half-past two Marconi , sick at heart , went to find him on the bridge to tell him the news . " We have to wait for Poldhu 's 133 next signals at three o'clock . The station may have had some slight mishap that would account for the silence at two . If there is still nothing at three , I am afraid we will have to conclude that the European continent is an insuperable obstacle to the propagation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the Admiral stayed on the bridge and his ship described slow circles through the fog . Precisely at three the Morse inker began to print a long series of Vs on the tape and Solari headed for the bridge at a flat-out run to call Admiral Mirabello . When he reached the deck he was half-blinded by a searchlight . With no intention of anchoring , the Admiral had failed to advise British port authorities of his presence and a cruiser , spotting the unaccounted-for ship on its crazy course , came to demand an explanation . The first bright beam was multiplied into dozens , cutting strangely through the murk , as a pilot boat left port . The Admiral ordered the helmsman to head for the open sea at full steam then went astern to the wireless cabin to read the messages which came in and continued to come in through the night . Marconi was in bed with a high fever by the time they reached Cagliari in Sardinia and Solari diagnosed it as fatigue . However , he was on his feet again when they sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape he had asked to have sent from Poldhu . His plan was to record a message for the King of Italy on shipboard ? which , having crossed Europe , would be a first of its kind ? and give it to him on arrival . As the instrument began to record , Marconi realized that the operator in Poldhu did not know the Morse code . There would be a start , then a mistake followed , by way of correction , with a series of senseless dots . Worn out by anxiety and fever , Marconi succumbed to one of his rare , hot fits of rage . He thrashed out at the apparatus , knocking it askew on the table and smashing a large case of Leyden jars . At this Solari intervened , reminding him that he , Solari , was responsible for Navy equipment and would have to make good the loss to the arsenal of Naples . When Marconi calmed down , he reassembled his machines , and 134 began to send instructions to Poldhu with what Solari called his " inimitable skill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light touch to the relay , a lick of the thumb and index finger of both hands and a squeeze to the two extremities of the coherer , then a light knock to the hammer striking the coherer and the Morse machine began to function properly . " By the time Marconi was engrossed and cooled off , the operator in Poldhu had been replaced by a man who knew Morse and the telegram was transmitted correctly . A moment later , meaningless dots began to appear and Marconi muttered , " Poldhu must have changed to a longer wave length . " Syntonic instruments , to harmonize the length of waves between two stations , had not yet been perfected so for long waves Marconi used a special type of inductor made of copper wire rolled around an ebony cylinder and inserted in the tail of the aerial . He had used up his supply of these on the voyage . Poldhu would be off the air in a few minutes so he had to improvise , fast . He snatched up a broken candle , wound wire round it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegram was received , Poldhu signed off for the night and Marconi went to bed while the ship plowed on to Spezia . Solari made a full report of the scientific findings of the trip for the Italian Navy ; distance did not limit the propagation of electrical waves so long as the energy used was proportionate to the distance to be traversed . Land and mountains did not interfere with communication . Daylight greatly diminished the intensity of the waves . Under adverse atmospheric conditions , the less sensitive the receiving instrument , the less it was affected by these . Combining the bare facts , he deduced that increasing power and using relatively insensitive instruments produced most stable results . It was only later that they learned that the magnetic detector , since it did not require constant adjustments , was superior in bad weather to any coherer . .. Young Midshipman Raineri-Biscia , faithfully recording all aspects of the cruise , wrote that the ship stopped " to call on the Minister of Marine , Admiral Morin , " at Forte dei Marmi . Like 135 all Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were overjoyed at the intense blueness of the sky and the enchanting profile of the Alpi Apuane . For Father in 1902 the pleasure was dulled by the knowledge that the Carlo Alberto would go on without him . His sadness was premature . He would have to leave Italy but he would not be parted from the ship . From Spezia he went to Racconigi near Turin where the King received him . The Secretary of the Navy decided to dispatch the cruiser , though it was already the middle of September , on a second wireless trip , this time to Canada to be present at the inauguration of regular transatlantic wireless services . The Carlo Alberto , after crossing through mountainous seas , which disconcerted Father not at all , passed Table Head on October 31 . At any time of year the prospect is cheerless and after Italy it was grim indeed . I have a photograph of the first Glace Bay station as the men aboard the ship saw it that day . The striated rock of the headland pushes out into water clogged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden fretwork towers and a half dozen masts like elongated telephone poles . Below are two sizable frame buildings and one small , forlorn shack . Over all the sky is leaden . The decks of the cruiser were heavy with snow when she anchored in the bay of Sydney that afternoon . The crew assembled on the upper deck as Marconi and Solari drove off in a sleigh to catch the train for Glace Bay . Across the icy air their voices rang out in a resounding cheer . // Vvyan met Father and Solari at the gate of the barbed-wire fence that protected Table Head station from intrusion and showed them over the station . Father had a premonition of what was ahead : the next weeks were the most alarming of his scientific career . He therefore wisely instituted a regimen as formal as a ship 's to carry them through such enforced proximity and severe strain in unfriendly surroundings . ( One photograph shows Father with five engineers , looking like so many Russians in fur caps and boots , the clapboard station festooned with a fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) At eight o'clock they sat down to dinner . Marconi , the youngest of the eight men , took his place at the head of the table . His assistants were seated according to rank . No first names were used . Actually everyone inclined to call Father sir . Solari wrote that Marconi at this time " showed all the geniality of his mind , all the authority of his character and all the activity of his organizing genius . " The morale of the men needed all the bolstering Marconi could give . For twenty-nine consecutive days no signals came through from Poldhu . At the beginning no one worried unduly , since only half the electrical wattage at the Cornwall installation was in use . 137 When it was stepped up to its full potential , there was still nothing and this was unnerving . To compound the tension , the company manager in London cabled that the price of Marconi shares was dropping , making financing for the tests hard to find . The world press reflected the general pessimism . As the days passed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , came to the station to say his ship could wait no longer than Christmas . The engineers were fumbling for a formula that eluded them . As Vyvyan said afterward : " Some combinations gave good results , some poor , but an arrangement that gave good results one night the next gave very different results and thus it became difficult to say for certain whether any improvement or progress was being made . In the light of our present day knowledge it is easy to see where the trouble lay ; we knew nothing then about the effect of the length of a wave transmitted governing the distance over which communication could be affected . We did not even have the means or instruments for measuring wave length , in fact we did not know accurately what wave length we were using . " All they knew was that something was wrong ? either the amperage at Poldhu was insufficient or the arrangement of machinery faulty ? so they decided to experiment in reverse , sending from Canada to Cornwall . The first attempt was made on November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals came through but as a confused and unintelligible jumble . Outside , snow fell incessantly . Local laborers shoveled to clear a passage between the sending but and the plant . From the instruments the loud crackle and crash and brilliant flashes from the fifty-megacycle sparks assaulted the night . On December 5 came the first partial inkling of success , a message from England : " ... weak signals for the first half-hour , nothing doing next three-quarters , last three-quarters readable and recordable on tape . " Marconi 's reaction was to stiffen . He dropped the jocularity with which he had tried to buoy up the morale of his men . That day he came to lunch , his jaw set , his look abstracted . His staff caught the mood and during the next eleven days worked as they 138 had never worked before . At seven o'clock in the morning of December 16 the miracle in which they believed came true . Readable signals through two hours ' programme . Mad with relief and delight the men ran , half dressed , into the 30-degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining room where an enormous fire blazed . Marconi did not permit himself to indulge his own great joy . As soon as their high spirits quieted he held a council . Messages to mark this event must be dispatched to the kings of Italy and England and to the governor of Canada . A representative of some great newspaper should be present to dispel any skepticism and to add a warranty to the success of the system . Before these messages went out , he proposed to ask the London Times ' Ottawa correspondent , Dr. George Parkin , to the station . Under a pledge of secrecy , Parkin was to observe and then to take part in sending and to vouch for the first transatlantic message . ( Father always had a nice sense of history . As far as possible , he planned those events in which he was involved , timing and underlining them for posterity . ) At the same session , he considered the delicate matter of protocol . Should the wire to the King of Italy or the one to the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give precedence to Italy , as the wireless would have to be relayed to Rome and transmittal time would be greater . The two should consequently be received at about the same hour . The seven other men in the dining room found this just and reasonable . On December 15 Parkin wirelessed London at one o'clock and again at three and at seven , but weather conditions were poor and his message only got through finally between ten and twelve . Times London . Being present at transmission in Marconi 's Canadian Station have honour send through Times inventor 's first wireless transatlantic message of greeting to England and Italy Parkin . The story he then wrote gives a lively picture of the circumstances . " A little after midnight the whole party sat down to a light supper . Behind the cheerful table talk of the young men 139 on the staff , one could feel the tension of an unusual anxiety as the moment approached for which they had worked , and to which they had looked forward so long . It was about ten minutes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating room . I believe I was the first outsider to inspect the building and the machinery . " It was a beautiful night ? the moon shone brightly on the snowcovered ground . A wind , which all day had driven heavy breakers on the shore , had died away . The air was cold and clear . All the conditions seemed favorable . " Inside the building , and among its somewhat complicated appliances , the untechnical observer 's first impression was that he was among men who understood their work . The machinery was carefully inspected , some adjustments made , and various orders carried out with trained alertness . All put cotton wool in their ears to lessen the force of the electric concussion , which was not unlike the successive explosions of a Maxim gun . As the current was one of most dangerous strength , those not engaged in the operations were assigned to places free of risk . " It had been agreed that at the last moment before transmission , I should make some verbal change in the message agreed on , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message thus changed was handed to the inventor , who placed it on a table where his eye could follow it readily . A brief order for the lights over the battery to be put out , another for the current to be turned on , and the operating work began . " I was struck by the instant change from nervousness to complete confidence which passed over Mr. Marconi 's face the moment his hand was on the transmitting apparatus ? in this case a long , wooden lever or key . " He explained that it would first be necessary to transmit the letter S ' in order to fix the attention of the operators at Poldhu , and enable them to adjust their instruments . This continued for a minute or more and then , with one hand on the paper from which he read and with the other on the instrument , the inventor began to send across the Atlantic a continuous sentence . " Outside there was no sign , of course , on the transverse wire 140 from which the electric wave projected of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words seemed to be spelled out in short flashes of lightning . It was done slowly , since there was no wish on this occasion to test the speed . But as it was done , one remembered with a feeling of awe , what he had been told ? that only the ninetieth part of a second elapses from the moment when he sees the flash till the time when the record is made at Poldhu . " The messages were sent to the two kings and the governor of Canada , and Solari set out for Sydney to give the news to the captain of the Carlo Alberto and to fetch an Italian flag for the inaugural ceremonies . The flag was brought to Glace Bay with an escort of sailors . At a little before eight in a cold northern dawn , a small band of English and Canadians and Italians gathered at the foot of one of the towers . Solari indicated where the Italians were to stand . Marconi , head high and with military precision , walked up to them and stood bareheaded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian sky . There were merry moments in the days that followed . One message read : Times London by transatlantic wireless Please insert in birth column Jan 3rd wife of R. N. Vyvyan Chief Engineer Marconi 's Station of a daughter . Marconi . As if this were not garbled enough , it was received in part as " Jane 3rd wife of R. N. Vyvyan .... " A few mornings after the inauguration Father let out a shout of laughter as he read the Sydney newspaper , and passed it across the table to Solari : " Yesterday the Italian cruiser Carlo Alberto , which has brought to us that commander of space , Guglielmo Marconi , left our port to voyage to Venezuela . We shall long remember the officers of this ship that has contributed to making unforgettable the historical period during which matured the miracle performed by Guglielmo Marconi . Our Harbour without the Carlo Alberto now seems sad and deserted . But on the other hand tranquility has entered again into the intimate circles of many families . " Transatlantic communication , Glace Bay showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent twenty-four times be-141 fore they came through . Though he would have preferred to cease sending and devote his time to further experiments , Marconi kept messages dribbling through the Nova Scotia station and , with an eye to the financing so desperately needed , he left for the United States on January 10 to explore the possibilities of setting up a relay from Cape Cod to Poldhu via Glace Bay . The reporters were waiting for him at Holcomb House in South Wellfleet ? they knew they could not get to him at the station , which was barricaded with barbed wire . He arrived by the night train and did not even glance their way , but went directly to Ed Cook 's carryall and drove off . Years later at South Wellfleet I talked with Mrs. Joseph Beals , who had been a youngster in 1903 and remembered a great deal about the week Father stayed at Holcomb House . Her mother used to take her over to the " plant " and , she recalled , " lurid flares lit up the dark sky and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue current sent the shivers down many an elderly , superstitious Cape Cod spine . " Mrs. Beals took me to call on old inhabitants who remembered , too , and she and I walked along the short-cut the men used to take from the freight station , now vanished except for the timbers of its platform , to the wireless station . According to Mrs. Beals , a " character " named Billy Hatch was watchman at the gate of the plant and he passed the time by playing the triangle and singing . Marconi heard him once and took Billy along to Holcomb House to sing and play while he accompanied him on the piano . Billy Hatch 's watches were not entirely lonely for they were shared by Captain Paine . His job was to keep his buggy and mare at the ready . Huddled in his wolfskin coat and with two blankets over his nag , he waited , he claimed , for six days . When the time came he was to carry the news of success to the telegraph office at South Wellfleet for Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was meant to transmit by wire to be consigned to the air , either via Glace Bay or direct , had been in Marconi 's pocket for days . On the night of January 18 between nine and eleven o'clock , it 142 was transmitted to Table Head , with instructions to forward it to Poldhu . At the same time Marconi sent it from Cape Cod and , to his immense joy , England received the message direct from the United States on January 19 . " All of a sudden , " Charley Paine told Mrs. Beals , " I see Marconi come tearing out of the plant with both hands full of white tape . He was just like a crazy man . ' You wait there , Paine , and I 'll be with you in a minute , ' he yelled and started for his office . I got my buggy all turned round and ready .... When he come out again he had two big envelopes in his hand . They were messages to be telegraphed to Washington and New York . Drive like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this message had been received : His Majesty , Edward VII , London , England . In taking advantage of the wonderful triumph of scientific research and ingenuity which has been achieved in perfecting a system of wireless telegraphy , I extend on behalf of the American people most cordial greetings and good wishes to you and all the people of the British Empire . Theodore Roosevelt South Wellfleet , Massachusetts , Jan. 19 , 1903 The answer came back : The President , White House , Wash. , America . I thank you most sincerely for the kind message which I have just received from you through Marconi 's transatlantic wireless telegraph . I sincerely reciprocate in the name of the people of the British Empire the cordial greetings and friendly sentiment expressed by you on behalf of the American nation , and I heartily wish you and your country every possible prosperity . Edward R. and I. Sandringham , Jan. 19 , 1903 The excitement was worldwide now but Cape Codders took it at a local level . At nine o'clock that night Mrs. Eliza Doane , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Wellfleet station , served them a dinner of roast goose . Next day she gave them a lunch so American that it carries me back to that 143 pre-packaged era . The menu : oysters , turkey , Cape Cod cranberry sauce , turnips , squash , and Indian pudding . Mrs. Doane later wrote about how all the doings seemed to South Wellfleet : " After the news of the establishment of communication was made known extra operators in Provincetown and Wellfleet had to take care of the messages which came in by telegraph . Telephones on the Cape ... were rare . The King of Italy sent half a page of congratulations . It came via Provincetown telegraph office and by telephone to the little store at South Wellfleet . The fatigued storekeeper and his pretty clerk had been standing most of the day by the wall telephone with a pencil in one hand , trying to take down the names of men of importance it was stunning to contemplate . " That was the way it seemed to people outside the barbed-wire enclosure . Inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " It was clear that these stations were not nearly in a position to undertake commercial service . " So experiments continued . The South Wellfleet station has passed out of existence , if not out of history . It was dismantled in World War I by the local salvage committee , its remnants converted into armaments . On the fiftieth anniversary of the messages between Roosevelt and King Edward , a handful of commemorators tried to place a plaque where the station had been . They had to content themselves with erecting it a mile and a half away where Wireless Station Road branches off from the main road to South Wellfleet Beach . Here stands a house fenced with cables taken from the wreckage of the transmitting towers , and here I found the plaque . Beyond the road the area bristles with No Trespass signs . The land has been taken over for a military reservation . All that day I heard the guns boom at guided robot planes , circling dizzily above the high moor . Over the ridge , past the roaring guns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil generators of those pioneer transmitters , long since converted into arms . Nothing else remains . // The Marconi Company barely survived the financial drain imposed by falling stock values and skyrocketing costs for new stations . Fortunately , by the time of Marconi 's return to England , the chairman of the board , Sir Euan Wallace , was able to announce to his directors for the first time that income exceeded expenditure . Earnings rested mainly on a fourteen-year contract with Lloyd 's licensing twelve ship lines to use Marconi equipment operated by Marconi men ( ship-to-shore sending was still the bulk of the business ) and from fifty-four land stations . Also the London Times had undertaken to have stories transmitted by wireless and the British Post Office was negotiating to increase its services at press rates . The Marconi Company was doing business internationally , of course , but not very profitably as yet and at least one major country was trying to compete without using Marconi 's patents . Germany , to whose Professor Adolphus Slaby great courtesies were shown at the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to telegraph more than 100 meters through the air , " was striking out on her own . Slaby set himself to make changes in the Marconi system so significant as to put Germany in a position where she could ignore the Marconi patents 145 ( and royalties ) . However , Slaby 's devices were far from satisfactory , based as they were on Father 's original , tentative findings . The Germans proceeded to try by unlawful means to get what they could not produce and were unwilling to buy . A German fleet anchored , on a hot summer day , in the dangerous waters of Glace Bay and its Admiral came ashore at Table Head with thirty officers . When Vyvyan saw that they were heading for the station , he met them at the gate in the barbed wire with cool drinks . This was a technique he commonly employed to discourage reporters and the curious sightseers who constantly turned up . It did not suffice for the Germans . The refreshments , he wrote , " were declined and the Admiral stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed him that I should be delighted to show them over . Doubtless he had a letter of authority from Marconi or the Directors of the Marconi Company authorizing me to do so . He said he had not ; I expressed my regrets that without authority it was impossible for me to admit him . He became very brusque and informed me that His Imperial Majesty would be much annoyed . Again I expressed my regrets and he and his staff went off , again declining any refreshment . " The fleet stayed at anchor and I kept a watchman on one of the towers to report . Next day boats put out from the fleet and in due course a crowd of about 150 sailors arrived at the gates . Apparently there were no officers with them ; they pushed past me in an unruly mob . I informed them admission was forbidden and if they persisted I would use force to prevent them entering the station . At the time , we had a considerable body of workmen employed on certain construction work , and when they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be trouble . A whistle was blown and they all went out , a disciplined force , and no longer an unruly crowd of men . " At about the same time , Prince Henry , the Kaiser 's brother , en route from Hamburg to New York , flashed an order to the Marconi Company from off the coast of England , to relay his personal messages . The Marconi operators inquired if he were 146 in need of assistance . Otherwise they were under no contractual or international obligation to handle his traffic . Relations between Marconi and the German Reich were exceedingly cool after these incidents . The company took care from then on not to hire Germans for fear they might be informers . Italy , on the other hand , honored and appreciated its man . Prince Prospero Colonna , the Mayor of Rome , invited Marconi to return to the capital to receive honorary citizenship . My father was delighted . To any Italian , Roman citizenship is the greatest of privileges . A Roman is citizen of the world . First he went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His father was over eighty in 1903 and his health had failed so greatly that Annie Marconi was spending more time with him than she had for years . Both Giuseppe and Annie welcomed Guglielmo and took part in the public homecoming of Bologna 's world-famous son . The reception he was tendered there moved him more than any other because it came from friends and neighbors . Even his stern defenses against emotion crumbled at the outpouring with which he was greeted . At the University where he had not even been able to matriculate , his old hero , Professor Righi , made a welcoming speech which reduced tough old Giuseppe to tears of joy and filled reserved young Guglielmo with such unexpected shyness that when he got to his feet he was incapable of responding . His cheeks flaming with embarrassment , he stumbled back to his seat in silence . For the trip to Rome , Giuseppe Marconi drew on what was left of his waning physical resources . With his wife and son , he rode through its streets in Prince Colonna 's state coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taken their place between the shafts . Beside Annie he sat beaming while their son , his shyness gone , made a speech to the King , the Queen , the Ministers and , most stirring to Guglielmo , the scientists of Italy . On this occasion , my father , who had always shared credit , showed an almost mystical humility , saying " .. . in truth teleg-147 raphy without wires is no more than a simple consequence of observing and studying the means employed by nature to obtain her effects of heat , light , of magnetism across space . As the heat and light of the sun upon which depend the life of our planet are transmitted across millions and millions of kilometers of space , as the light of the most distant stars , as the electrical and magnetic perturbations of nature are manifested to us after having crossed the most immeasurable distances , it appeared to me that by adopting means similar to those adopted by nature , it should be possible to transmit these effects at our will .... " At a court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to Kaiser Wilhelm II , then a guest at the Quirinal . The German Emperor 's manner was correct and strikingly uncordial . " Signor Marconi , " he said , " you must not think that I have any animosity against yourself . It is the policy of your company I object to . " Marconi was equally correct and equally uncordial . To his eternal credit he replied , " Your Imperial Majesty , I should be overwhelmed if I thought you had any personal animosity against me . However , it is I who decided the policy of my company . " A little later at Berlin a scientific congress was held where Germany hoped to assemble enough data to perfect its imperfect communication system . Marconi by-passed it and sent Solari , who reported that much breath was spent in sneering at the advances of wireless , designating them as fantasies in the minds of Signor Marconi 's friends . Solari , never a patient man and maddened by any attack on his old friend , protested ringingly , then marched out . Though he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overjoyed that the German conference proved a thorough-going fiasco . Nevertheless the Marconi Company , outraged by the German sneers and still in a shaky financial position , felt that further public demonstrations would be advisable . Any misunderstandings as to capabilities of Marconi 's inventions could be most unfortunate . Father set off on the Lucania . Passengers , in relays , were asked 148 to watch wireless at work and sign statements describing its performance . One of the first operators , C. J. Weaver , has left an account of what wireless transmission was like : " The transmitter received its power from a bank of storage batteries and the crash of the spark in the open gap was a source of continual annoyance to those cabin passengers so unfortunate as to be quartered near the wireless room .... The old key which was used to break the heavy current ... was actually ' pounded ' and was equipped with giant platinum contacts . The maximum speed we could handle was about ten words a minute . And even at that slow rate of transmission operators would soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key worked like a pump and required considerable expenditure of energy .... " In addition to these demonstrations , Father utilized an earlier idea to further publicize his and his assistants ' achievements . The St. Paul , on November 1 , 1899 , had published Volume I , Number I of The Transatlantic Times , a news bulletin . On the Lucania , he inaugurated the Cunard Daily Bulletin , a ship 's paper that set a pattern which continues to this day . It caused great excitement in America and put Marconi on the front pages of the newspapers for days . One event of the crossing which received no publicity was that Marconi lost his heart . He did so with fair regularity but this one seems to me the most unlikely attachment he ever formed . Except for her beauty , Inez Milholland embodied everything he basically disapproved . She was a confirmed bluestocking and a feminist . As a pioneer suffragette I believe that she rode up Fifth Avenue on a white horse . Nevertheless , he proposed and was accepted . The romance did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more serious one and the lovely Inez joined Josephine and countless other pretty women as only one of his passing fancies . However , she remained a very good friend . The few weeks in America were marked by two unlikely occurrences : Father drank too much on one of them and ate too little on the other . He was an official guest at the St. Louis Exposition and came to grief after making acquaintance with a 149 mild-looking drink called a " mint julep . " By the time he had drunk several toasts and it was his turn to speak , he could not stand up . He seriously believed he had been poisoned . Edison , still eager to meet the " young fellow , " invited Marconi and Solari to visit him at his house in Orange , New Jersey . First he forgot to answer the doorbell and they nearly left in despair . Then , after he let them in , he became so absorbed in talking about his work that he forgot lunch . My father at last hinted broadly and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was nothing to drink but water . Marconi , still shaken after St. Louis , felt it might be better that way . Father loved meeting the old giant . Mr. Edison 's skepticism had quickly and warmly turned to generous and fatherly recognition , whereas his own father , Giuseppe Marconi , had been reluctant and begrudging in the early days . Poor old Giuseppe Marconi had become increasingly dour as he grew old . People who knew him observed how he had turned bitter , egocentric and tyrannical , mean for meanness ' sake with those he had once loved and who had loved him . Living out his years as a country gentleman , his small successes dwarfed by his son 's , his position as paterfamilias hollow , the old man had for some time left Villa Grif one during the winter months and moved to the Palazzo Albergatti in Bologna 's Via Saragozza where his wife Annie joined him when she could . The trip to Rome had been a mighty effort , and his last . Back in Bologna , on March 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died at dawn . I think of him as pathetic and lonely . My cousin , Pietro Marconi , a boy of twelve , was wakened in the middle of the night , he remembers , and taken to Grandfather 's bedside to pray . My grandmother was beside him , her head bent . She buried Giuseppe in the Marconi family vault in the exquisite old cemetery of the Certosa in Bologna . Then she returned to England . They had been married for forty years . For sixteen more she lived on in London . Ironically , this Englishwoman was homesick for Italy until the day of her death . Absorbed in company troubles , my father could not go to Italy for the funeral . The Marconi Company finances were in bad 150 shape , and the business required total attention . He could not find the hours of solitude to do the experimenting which would improve wireless and make it pay its way . At thirty , his nerves were dangerously frayed , he was disheartened , and near the end of his endurance . In spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wireless was at a low ebb in Ottawa and London . He told Luigi Solari bitterly , " A man can not live on glory alone . " // At a time of thorough disillusionment , Marconi fell head over heels in love . Late in the summer of 1904 , when he claimed he had had his fill of glory , he met nineteen-year-old Beatrice O'Brien , daughter of the thirteenth Baron Inchiquin . My father was anything but an impulsive man , yet the moment he saw her he knew that he wanted to marry this high-spirited country girl , so beautiful , so naive and so abominably dressed . ( " The dress she had on was awful ! " he always said . ) The Inchiquin O'Brien world was astronomically remote from the Marconi world . Beatrice 's father was descended from that warrior king of Ireland , Brian Boru or Brian Boroimhe , who was slain in his tent in 1014 . Thereafter there were always sons to carry on the name ? Dermod , Mortogh , Torlogh , Teige and Donough ? until by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through twenty-seven generations , as Barons Inchiquin or Marquises of Thomond , in direct succession . One of his ancestors , Murrough O'Brien , made submission to Henry VIII in the first half of the sixteenth century and as a result the O'Briens retained great privileges . Even the married women of the family had the right to royal colors and a crest . The last time the Inchiquins used their state coach , bearing the 155 royal arms , another of their hereditary rights , was at Queen Victoria 's jubilee . Lilah O'Brien , Beatrice 's sister , tells of how their father took her and Beatrice to the coachmaker 's in St. James 's Street where it was kept . While he issued instructions about the turnout , the two little girls enjoyed their ancient privileges by hopping in and out of the carriage squealing with glee . Under the terms by which the family retained its title and estate ( or what remained of the original Dromoland property in County Clare ) the Inchiquin O'Brien children were bound to be brought up in Ireland , the sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British monarchs in ancient times held nearautonomous lords in the marches as vassals . The thirteenth Baron kept a residence at Hereford House in London and sat while Parliament was in session as a representative peer for Ireland , but he was domiciled on his Irish acres and was never an absentee landlord . The huge family ( Beatrice had seven sisters and six brothers as well as countless cousins scattered through England and Scotland ) visited at large but lived at Dromoland . Here Beatrice grew up . A tomboy who could give her brothers a good game of tennis , and could ride and sail , she delighted in hare-brained escapades . When they were in England they all loved their visits to the Coke cousins at Holkham in Norfolk best . This was a perfect place for running and hiding with its formal Italian gardens and miles of corridors , so long its mistress , Beatrice 's Aunt Alice Leicester , complained that it took fifteen maids to keep them in order . Sandringham was next door and the royal children came as often as they could for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Holkham was reserved for them and before they arrived their servants were sent ahead to see that everything was in readiness . Edward was particularly finicky . Beatrice took dancing lessons with the young Princesses ? Ena , later Queen of Spain , among them . She played hide-and-seek with George , long before anyone imagined he would ever ascend the throne . At the end of the English sojourns , shepherded by nurses and governesses and tutors , the O'Briens piled into the low white 156 trains of that day , balancing pails crammed with frogs and baskets packed with favorite snakes they hoped to introduce into Ireland . All the train attendants knew the children and cheerfully let them commandeer cars for their own use . When they reached home , white-wigged footmen were waiting to lift down the pails and baskets full of contraband , the mountain of luggage and the perambulators ? in a family so large there was always a baby or two . Beatrice 's father had stood out against Home Rule , for which Disraeli tried to reward him by reviving the lapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and through . As a dedicated agriculturist , he took the well-being of the small Irish farmer very much to heart . And he was a man of unswervable probity . An eminent English judge , named Atkinson , told my mother that her father 's sense of honor was so strong that , though he stood to gain and no one would be hurt , he would not , under great pressure , shade his testimony . The fact that Dromoland was one of the few castles left ungutted in the Irish troubles attests the love and respect in which he was held . Voluntarily , the people of the county formed a cordon around the house to protect him and his family . At the peak of the violence , Inchiquin went his way freely and refused to go armed . The children were told to leave their windows wide open , their curtains undrawn so that all men might know they were not afraid . These were rather pleasurably scary days for the young O'Briens . They left no scars on the youngsters whose lives were a merry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to a different public school before going up to Oxford or Cambridge and each one brought his friends home to Dromoland which was said to have the best shooting ? and to be the most fun ? in all Ireland . Despite footmen and a fair share of protocol ( O'Brien sons addressed their father as " My Lord " and stood at his approach ) existence was on the whole hilarious for them . Out of the gay years came an immense sense of family solidarity and loyalty , centering on the head of the house . Around Lord Inchiquin revolved this diminutive kingdom with its many-acred orchards , stock and dairy farms , its sawmill , 157 smithy , and carpenter shop . Two liveried coachmen with helpers looked after the ten carriages ; grooms cared for the hunters ; and gamekeepers and their families lived in the six gate lodges . Inside the battlemented house were the two governesses and a tutor , domestic servants , maids , and cooks . The schoolroom and the nursery each had its liveried footman . One man did the boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When one of Beatrice 's brothers , alarmed at the profusion of the household , proposed that the same footman might pass the gravy and the bread sauce , his father was shocked . . . it would cause anarchy in the pantries . Like any proper Irish family , they were more than a little mad and had one eccentric . Lady Inchiquin 's mother , Lady Annaly , lived with them and infuriated her son-in-law . The tiny lady with a face like a marmoset 's was a Scot , a Stuart , and she looked , Beatrice recalled , like a very smart monkey , not cleversmart but chic-smart . She wore black satin bonnets frilled in lace dripping velvet streamers and huge-sleeved black satin dresses , with enormous style , despite which her manners were flagrant . Lady Annaly detested eating at the dinner table and feigned lack of appetite at the very moment she was smuggling tidbits into her sleeves and pockets . Later she would consume them in the drawing room or the musicians ' gallery , strewing the crumbs and scraps around her when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them behind the curtains . One night in London her two extremely fashionable sons ( Luke was equerry to King Edward ) came home from a ball at two in the morning to find their mother , her gray hair unpinned and hanging down her back , on her way to the pillar box to post a letter in her nightgown . She was indignant when they insisted on going with her , one on either side . But of all the stories of this odd old woman the one that the O'Brien children loved best was about when her son-in-law , a passionate amateur photographer , was drying his plates on the terrace at Dromoland one day and she dumped a pail of slops out of the window on him . 158 He rushed up to her room raging , " Lady Annaly , I 'll thank you not to empty the slops . I have maids to empty the slops . " She was impenitent and uncowed .
