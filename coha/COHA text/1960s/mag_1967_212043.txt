Seldom had a nation managed to attack , antagonize or alienate so many of its neighbors in a single week . All around its vast perimeter , in a great circle from Russia and Japan on the north to India and Indonesia on the south , China stirred up trouble and resentment . The sudden spurt of hostility seemed prompted by an overflow of missionary zeal for Maoism , a certain amount of frustration at the difficulties encountered at home by Mao 's Cultural Revolution and a new wave of China 's historic xenophobia . <P> The most direct and serious provocation occurred in the Himalayan kingdom of Sikkim , whose defense and foreign policy are controlled by India . On Sikkim 's border with China , Communist troops suddenly opened fire with machine guns and mortars on Indian soldiers laying wire at the 14,000-ft. - high Natu Pass . The Indians fired back , and for four days gunfire and cannonades echoed through the thin Himalayan air , causing numerous casualties on both sides . It was the worst Sino-Indian border incident since the Chinese invasion of 1962 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China are historic rivals and enemies , but Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia was one of China 's few remaining friends in Asia-until last week . When the Chinese accused him of " imperialism , revisionism and reaction , " Sihanouk , who has lately been troubled by smatterings of Communist insurgency in rural areas , reacted quickly . He recalled his ambassador from Peking , fired two pro-Chinese ministers from his Cabinet and closed down all of Pnompenh 's privately owned newspapers ( one of which had printed the offending Chinese telegram ) . Sihanouk warned that he would break relations with Peking entirely " if China continues to insult us and interfere in our affairs . " Then , knowing exactly how to jab the Maoists , he added that " the Chinese practice an imperialism stronger than the Americans ' . " <P> <P> China also lashed out at Japan , Indonesia and Ceylon for that sin of sins against Peking : cozying up to Taiwan . Japanese Premier Eisaku Sato 's three-day good-will visit to Taiwan came under the heaviest fire . Sato , said the Chinese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Peking threatened to cut off trade with Japan , as it had done in 1958 for five years after a Chinese flag was pulled down in a Japanese department store display , and underscored its ire by expelling three of the nine Japanese correspondents resident in Peking . <P> Indonesia 's " serious political provocation " was extending an invitation to a Taiwan trade delegation , after having canceled trade with China last month . General Suharto 's government replied by announcing that it would pull the entire Indonesian embassy staff out of Peking and send them on " vacation . " Ceylon got a nasty diplomatic note because two Ceylonese M.P.s and a newspaper publisher had visited Taiwan .
