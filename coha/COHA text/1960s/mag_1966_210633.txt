If they were looking for a relaxed and lazy vacation , the 26 students who signed on for summer jobs at the St. Petersburg Times soon got a new slant on the months ahead . Not for them the nearby beaches ; not for them such time-killing chores as toting copy , answering phones or writing the myriad obits that the retirement haven inevitably requires . On his first day , Marc Rosenbaum , a Colgate freshman-to-be , found himself on the rewrite desk . " I 'm not even sure what I 'm doing , " he gasped as the deadline rushed up . But he did fine . And so did the others . <P> The students may have been surprised by their own activity ; the Times was not . No replacements are hired for vacationing staffers , and it is expected that the trainees will fill in . Every summer the entire crew-which may include anyone from a next-fall high school senior on up-is scattered through all phases of the paper . Wherever they work , they soon learn that they are attending one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . <P> Age &; Skill . Occasionally they all come together for a full day of lectures on the various aspects of newspapering . They are relatively well paid ( $76 a week to start ) , and at the end of the summer most of them also get a bonus ( from $100 to $2,000 ) to help handle the cost of their education . Not many of them come back to the Times permanently , but a hefty 50% stay in journalism . Which is all that Times Publisher-Editor Nelson Poynter is after . " I just think it 's worthwhile perpetuating the breed , " he says . <P> His preference for youth extends to the paper 's regular staff as well . Poynter himself is 62 , and his executive editor , Don Baldwin , is 48 . But after them , the editorial brass are all relative youngsters-a 25-year-old city editor , a 30-year-old sports editor , a 24-year-old telegraph editor . Last month the paper got a new managing editor , Bob Haiman , 30 . The Times needed a new managing editor because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been chosen for a top Cowles editorial slot on a new paper being considered for Suffolk County , L.I . <P> Credit the Boss . St. Pete Timesmen cover a geriatric city , but they need their youth to keep up with the paper 's tradition of aggressive , investigative reporting . The paper won a 1964 Pulitzer Prize for its scandal-packed report on a Florida turnpike boondoggle ; most recently , it took out after Governor Haydon Burns with stories attacking him for nepotism and doing questionable favors for an insurance man . The Times 's crusade helped defeat Burns 's re-election bid in the May primary . <P> Generally liberal in a conservative town , the Times is so widely read that when a substitute takes over a delivery route , he is simply told to fling a copy onto every porch . That way he only makes an 8% error , for 92% of St. Petersburg households take the Times .
