" DO you know what TIME has done to me ? " the blind Greek lawyer asked . " It has changed my whole life . " <P> What TIME had done to Evanghelos Georgakakis was to tell his story , " The Losing Winner , " in our March 3 issue . It was the story of the deep inner powers of a man , a onetime Cretan shepherd lad , blind , with an artificial right hand and only one finger with any sense of touch on the left . Yet , at 33 , using Braille and tape recorders , he had topped all 361 candidates in the Athens bar examinations . Despite this , as the story told , he was unable to find a job . No one , it seemed , wanted a blind and crippled lawyer . <P> Happily all that changed after our story appeared in Greece . Newspapers commented on it , and the afternoon daily Messimvreni took Greeks to task for not helping " this young man of darkness " in his " battle against his destiny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . U.S.-educated Professor Adam Pepelasis , deputy governor of the Agrarian Bank of Greece , told TIME Reporter Mario Modiano : " I read your story and I felt a feeling of shame . It showed how a blind man can look inside his soul and discover the meaning of life-truth . " <P> Pepelasis saw the lawyer and offered him a demanding job in legal research . His assignment : to review the entire body of Greek legislation and unearth obsolete laws that are frustrating modern agricultural development . His salary : 7,000 drachmas ( $233 ) a month . There were other offers , but this was the best . A day or two before TIME appeared Georgakakis actually had his first chance , thanks to Queen Mother Frederika , who had induced the Federation of Greek Industries to give him a job at 3,000 drachmas a month . <P> " Greek newspapers have repeatedly written about me , " said Georgakakis . " But as soon as TIME ran the story , everyone started showing an active interest . I hope I will come up to the expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been tampered with by censors and other officials in many countries , but never to our knowledge has anyone stamped a rub-out X on the cover. * Last week we learned that in Taiwan authorities had ordered the Formosa Magazine Press , TIME 's distributor , to stamp a three-inch blue cross upon the puffy features of Mao Tse-tung on the Jan. 13 cover . The distributor hand-stamped the thousand or more copies ( exclusive of those for the U.S. military ) that circulate in Taiwan . Earlier , the Taiwanese have occasionally stamped our pictures of Red Chinese figures with the word Kungfei , or Communist bandit . Deliveries of the X-ed issue were several days late , but the Nationalists had their figurative revenge and the last word in Taiwan on Chairman Mao as far as TIME was concerned . We feel they also provided an intriguing comment on the Chinese mentality and its preoccupation with form , subjects discussed in this week 's ESSAY . <P> <P> * We ourselves X-ed Hitler on the Victory in Europe cover , May 7 , 1945 and completed the one-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1945 cover to mark the surrender of Japan .
