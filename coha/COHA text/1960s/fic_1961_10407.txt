" Death , " said the old Judge , " is the great treachery . J.T. , you feel the doctors believe you have a fatal disease . I do n't think so . With all due respect to the medical profession , the doctors do n't know what death is  --  who can know ? Even Doc Tatum . I , an old man , have expected death for fifteen years . But death is too cunning . When you watch for it and finally face it , it never comes . It corners around sideways . It slays the unaware as often as it does the ones who watch for it . Oh , what , J.T. ? What happened to my radiant son ? " " Fox , " Malone asked , " do you believe in the eternal life ? " " I do as far as I can encompass the thought of eternity . I know that my son will always live within me , and my grandsonwithin him and within me . But what is eternity ? " " At church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the salvation that draws a bead on death . " " A pretty phrase  --  I wish I had said it . But no sense at all . " He added finally , " No , I do n't believe in eternity as far as religiongoes . I believe in the things I know and the descendants who come after me . I believe in my forebears , too . Do you call that eternity ? " Malone asked suddenly , " Have you ever seen a blue-eyed Nigra ? " " A Nigra with blue eyes you mean ? " Malone said , " I do n't mean the weak-eyed blue of old colored people . I mean the gray-blue of a young colored boy . There 's one like that around this town , and today he startled me . " The Judge 's eyes were like blue bubbles and he finished his drink before he spoke . " I know the nigger you 're thinking of . " " Who is he ? " " He 's just a nigger around the town who 's of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jack-of-all-trades . Also , he is a well-trained singer . "  |p21Malone  said , " I ran into him in an alley behind the store and he gave me such a shock . " The judge said , with an emphasis that seemed at the momentpeculiar to Malone , " Sherman Pew , that 's the nigger 's name , is of no interest to me . However , I 'm thinking of taking him on as a houseboy because of the shortage of help . " " I never saw such strange eyes , " Malone said . " A woods colt , " the Judge said ; " something wrong between the sheets . He was left a foundling in the Holy Ascension Church . " Malone felt that the Judge had left some tale untold but far be it from him to pry into the manifold affairs of so great a man . " Jester  --  speaking of the devil  --  " John Jester Clane stood in the room with the sunlight from the street behind him . He was a slight limber boy of seventeenwith auburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his upturned nose were like cinnamon sprinkled over cream . The glare brightened his red hair but his face was shadowed and he shielded his wine-brown eyes against the glare . He wore blue jeans and a striped jersey , the sleeves of which were pushed back to his delicate elbows . " Down , Tige , " Jester said . The dog was a brindle boxer , the only one of its kind in town . And she was such a fiercelookingbrute that when Malone saw her on the street alone he was afraid of her . " I soloed , Grandfather , " Jester said in a voice that was lifted with excitement . Then , seeing Malone , he added politely , " Hey , Mr. Malone , how are you today ? " Tears of remembrance , pride and alcohol came to theJudge 's weak eyes . " Soloed did you , darling ? How did it feel ? " Jester considered a moment . " It did n't feel exactly like Ihad expected . I expected to feel lonely and somehow proud.  |p22But  I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt  --  responsible . " " Imagine , J.T. , " the judge said , " a few months ago this little rapscallion just announced to me that he was taking flying lessons at the airport . He 'd saved his own money and already made the arrangements for the course . But with not so much as by-my-leave . Just announced , Grandfather , I am taking flying lessons . ' " The judge stroked jester 's thigh . " Did n't you , Lambones ? " The boy drew up one long leg against another . " It 's nothing to it . Everybody ought to be able to fly . " " What authority prompts the young folks these days to act on such unheard of decisions ? It was never so in my day or yours , J.T. Ca n't you see now why I am so afraid ? " The judge 's voice was grieving , and jester deftly removed his drink and hid it on a corner shelf . Malone noticed this and was offended on the judge 's behalf . " It 's dinnertime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The judge rose ponderously with his cane and the dog started to the door . " Whenever you 're ready , Lambones . " At the door he turned to Malone . " Do n't let the doctors intimidateyou , J.T. Death is the great gamer with a sleeve of tricks . You and I will maybe die together while following the funeral of a twelve-year-old girl . " He pressed his cheek to Malone and crossed the threshold to the street . Malone went to the front of the place to lock the main door and there he overheard a conversation . " Grandfather , I hate to say this but I do wish you would n't call me Lambones or darling in front of strangers . " At that moment Malone hated jester . He was hurt at the term " stranger , " and the glow that had warmed his spirit in the presence of the judge was darkened instantly . In the old days , hospitality had lain in the genius of making everyone ,  |p23even  the commonest constituents at a barbecue , feel that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was only isolation . It was Jester who was a " stranger "  --  he had never been like a Milan boy . He was arrogant and at the same time overpolite . There was somethinghidden about the boy and his softness , his brightness seemed somehow dangerous  --  it was as though he resembled a silk-sheathed knife . The Judge did not seem to hear his words . " Poor LT. , " he said as the door of the car was opened , " it 's such a shocking thing . " Malone quickly locked the front door and returned to the compounding room . He was alone . He sat in the rocking chair with the compoundingpestle in his hands . The pestle was gray and smooth with use . He had bought it with the other fixtures of the pharmacy when he had opened his business twenty years ago . It had belonged to Mr. Greenlove  --  when had he last rememberedhim ?  --  and at his death the estate sold the property . How long had Mr. Greenlove worked with this pestle ? And who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pestle was old , old and indestructible . Malone wondered if it was n't a relic from Indian times . Ancient as it was , how long would it still last ? The stone mocked Malone . He shivered . It was as though a draft had chilled him , although he noticed that the cigar smoke was undisturbed . As he thought of the old Judge a mood of elegy softened his fear . He remembered Johnny Clane and the old days at Sereno . He was no stranger  --  many a time he had been a guest at Sereno during the hunting season  --  and once he had even spent the night there . He had slept in a big four-poster bed with Johnny and at five in the morning they had gone down to the kitchen , and he still remembered the smell of fish roe and hot biscuits and the wet-dog smell as they breakfastedp24before the hunt . Yes , many a time he had hunted with Johnny Clane and had been invited to Sereno , and he was there the Sunday before the Christmas Johnny died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mainly a hunting place for boys and men . And the Judge , when he shot badly , which was nearly all the time , would complain that there was so much sky and so few birds . Always there was a mystery about Sereno even in those days  --  but was it the mystery of luxury that a boy born poor will always feel ? As Malone remembered the old days and thought of the Judge now  --  in his wisdom and fame and inconsolable grief  --  his heart sang with love as grave and somber as the organ music in the church . As he stared at the pestle his eyes were brilliant with fever and fear and , transfixed , he did not notice that from the basementunderneath the store there was a knocking sound . Beforethis spring he had always held to a basic rhythm about life and death  --  the Bible rhythm of the three-score years and ten . But now he dwelt on the inexplicable deaths . He thought of children , exact and delicate as jewels in their white satin coffins . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fry and died within the hour . And Johnny Clane , and the Milan boys who died during the first war and the last . And how many others ? How ? Why ? He was aware of the knocking sound in the basement . It was a rat  --  last week a rat had overturned a bottle of asafetida and for days the stench was so terrible that his porter refused to work in the basement . There was no rhythm in death  --  only the rhythm of the rat , and the stench of corruption . And the pretty singingteacher , the blond young flesh of Johnny Clane  --  the jewel-like children  --  all ended in the liquefying corpse and coffin stench . He looked at the pestle with a sick surprise for only the stone remained . There was a footstep on the threshold and Malone was so suddenly unnerved that he dropped the pestle . The blue-eyedp25nigger stood before him , holding in his hand something that glinted in the sun . Again he stared into those blazing eyes and again he felt that look of eerie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon to die . " I found this just outside the door , " the nigger said . Malone 's vision was dimmed by shock and for a moment he thought it was the paper knife of Dr. Hayden  --  then he saw it was a bunch of keys on a silver ring . " They 're not mine , " Malone said . " I noticed Judge Clane and his boy was here . Maybe they 're theirs . " The nigger dropped the keys on the table . Then he picked up the pestle and handed it to Malone . " Much obliged , " he said . " I 'll inquire about the keys . " The boy went away and Malone watched him jay-walk across the street . He was cold with loathing and hatred . As he sat holding the pestle there was in him enough composureto wonder at those alien emotions that had veered so violently in his once mild heart . He was split between love and hatred  --  but what he loved and what he hated was unclear . For the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror that choked him was not caused by the knowledge of his own death . The terror concerned some mysterious drama that was going on  --  although what the drama was about Malone did not know . The terror questioned what would happen in those months  --  how long ?  --  that glared upon his numbered days . he was a man watching a clock without hands . There was the rhythm of the rat . " Father , Father , help me , " Malone said aloud . But his father had been dead for these long years . When the telephone rang Malone told his wife for the first time that he was sick and asked her to drive to the pharmacy and take him home . Then he sat stroking the stone pestle as a sort of comfort as he waited.  |p26THE  JUDGE kept the old-fashioned dinner hours and dinner on Sundays was at two o'clock . Shortly before the time to ring the dinner chimes , Verily , the cook , opened the shutters of the dining room which had been closed all morning against the glare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond there was the burnt lawn and the fever-bright border of flowers . Some elm trees at the end of the lawn were dark and breezeless in the lacquered brightness of the afternoon . Jester 's dog responded first to the dinner summons  --  he walked slowly under the table , letting the long damask cloth linger against his spine . Then Jester appeared and stood waiting behind his grandfather 's chair . When the old Judge entered , he seated him carefully and then took his own place at the table . The dinner began according to custom and asp27usual vegetable soup was the first course . With the soup two breads were served  --  beaten biscuits and cornsticks . The old Judge ate greedily , sipping buttermilk between swallows of bread . Jester could manage only a few spoonfuls of the hot soup and he drank iced tea and held the cold glass to his check and forehead from time to time . According to the habits of the house , there was no conversation during the soup course except for the Judge 's customary Sunday remark : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever . " He added his little Sunday joke : " If you cook this well . " Verily said nothing  --  only pursed her purplish wrinkled lips . " Malone has always been one of my most loyal constituents and best supporters , " the Judge said when the chicken was brought and Jester had stood up to carve . " You keep the liver , Son , you ought to have liver at least once a week . " " Yes , Grandfather . " So far the meal was consonant with habits and the customs of the house . But later a strange dissonance appeared , a jolt in the usual harmony , a sense of cross purposes and communicationdeflected and estranged . Neither the old Judge nor his grandson realized what happened at the time , but at the end of the long , hot , customary meal they both felt that something had altered so that their relationship could never again be the same . " The Atlanta Constitution today referred to me as a reactionary , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry . " " Sorry , " said the old Judge . " It 's nothing to be sorry about . I 'm glad ! " Jester 's brown eyes exchanged a long , asking stare . " You must take the word reactionary ' literally these days.  |p28A  reactionary is a citizen who reacts when the age-long standardsof the South are threatened . When States ' rights are trampled on by the Federal Government , then the Southern patriot is duty-bound to react . Otherwise the noble standardsof the South will be betrayed . " " What noble standards ? " Jester asked . " Why , boy , use your head . The noble standards of our way of life , the traditional institutions of the South . " Jester did not say anything but his eyes were skeptical and the old Judge , sensitive to all his grandson 's reactions , noticed this . " The Federal Government is trying to question the legality of the Democratic Primary so that the whole balance of Southerncivilization will be jeopardized . " Jester asked , " How ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . " " Why are you always harping on segregation ? " " Why , Jester , you 're joking . " Jester was suddenly serious . " No , I 'm not . " The Judge was baffled . " The time may come in your generation  --  I hope I wo n't be here  --  when the educational system itself is mixed  --  with no color line . How would you like that ? " Jester did not answer . " How would you like to see a hulking Nigra boy sharing a desk with a delicate little white girl ? " The Judge could not believe in the possibility of this ; he wanted to shock Jester to the gravity of the situation . His eyes challenged his grandson to react in the spirit of Southern gentlemen . " How about a hulking white girl sharing a desk with a delicatelittle Negro boy ? " " What ? "  |p29Jester  did not repeat his words , nor did the old Judge want to hear again the words that so alarmed him . It was as though his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is fearful to acknowledge the approach of madness in a beloved . It is so fearful that the old Judge preferred to distrust his own hearing , although the sound of Jester 's voice still throbbed against his eardrums . He tried to twist the words to his own reason . " You 're right , Lambones , whenever I read such communist ideas I realize how unthinkable the notions are . Certain things are just too preposterous to consider . " Jester said slowly : " That 's not what I meant . " From habit Jester glanced to see if Verily was out of the room . " I ca n't see why colored people and white people should n't mix as citizens . " " Oh , Son ! " It was a cry of pity , helplessness , and horror . Years ago when Jester was a child he had been occasionally subject to sudden vomiting fits at the table . Then , tendernesshad overcome disgust , and afterward the Judge had felt himself sickish in sympathy . Now the old Judge responded to this sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to his ear as if he had an earache and he stopped eating . Jester noticed the old Judge 's distress and he felt a tremor of sympathy . " Grandfather , we all have our own convic-tions . " " Some convictions are not tenable convictions . After all , what are convictions ? They 're just what you think . And you are too young , Son , to have learned the pattern of thought . You are just deviling your grandfather with foolish words . " Jester 's emotion of sympathy withered . He was staring at a picture over the mantelpiece . The picture was a Southern scene of a peach orchard and a Negro shack and a cloudy sky . " Grandfather , what do you see in that picture ? "  |p30The  Judge was so relieved that the tension had snapped that he chuckled a little . " The Lord knows it ought to remind me of my folly . I lost a small fortune with those pretty peach trees . Your Great-aunt Sara painted it the year she died . And then right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I mean , what do you actually see in the picture ? " " Why , there 's an orchard and clouds and a Nigra shack . " " Do you see there between the shack and the trees a pink mule ? " " A pink mule ? " The Judge 's blue eyes popped in alarm . " Why naturally not . " " It 's a cloud , " Jester said . " And it looks to me exactly like a pink mule with a gray bridle . Now that I see it that way , I ca n't see the picture any other way any more . " " I do n't see it . " " Why you ca n't miss it , galloping upward  --  a whole sky of pink mules . " Verily came in with the dish of corn pudding : " Why , mercy , what 's the matter with you all . You ai n't scarcely touch your dinner . " " All my life I had seen the picture like Aunt Sara had intendedit . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in it . I try to look back as I used to see it  --  but it 's no good . I still see the pink mule . " " Do you feel dizzy , Lambones ? " " Why no . I 'm just trying to explain to you that this pictureis a sort of  --  symbol  --  I guess you might say . All my life I 've seen things like you and the family wanted me to see them . And now this summer I do n't see things as I used to  --  and I have different feelings , different thoughts . " " That 's only natural , Son . " The Judge 's voice was reassuring , but his eyes were still anxious.  | " A symbol , " Jester said . He repeated the word because it was the first time he had spoken it in conversation , although it was one of his favorite words in school compositions . " A symbol of this summertime . I used to have ideas exactly like everybody else . And now I have my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not answer for a moment . And when he spoke his voice broke with tension and adolescence . " For one thing , I question the justice of white supremacy . " The challenge was plain as a loaded pistol flung across the table . But the Judge could not accept it ; his throat was dry and aching and he swallowed feebly . " I know it 's a shock to you , Grandfather . But I had to tell you , otherwise you would have taken it for granite I was like I used to be . " " Take it for granted , " the Judge corrected . " Not granite . What kind of wild-eyed radicals have you been consorting with ? " " Nobody . This summer I 've been very  --  " Jester was going to say I 've been very lonely , but he could not bring himself to admit this truth aloud . " Well , all I say is , this talk about mixed races and pink mules in the picture are certainly  --  abnormal . " The word struck Jester like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pain made him strike back : " All my life I have loved you  --  I even worshiped you , Grandfather . I thought you were the wisest , kindest man on earth . I listened to everything you said like gospel truth . I saved everything in print about you . My scrapbook on you was started as soon as I began to read . I always thought you ought to be  --  President . " The Judge ignored the past tense and there was the warmth of self-pride in his veins . A mirrorlike projection reflected hisp32own feelings for his grandson  --  the fair , unfolding child of his fair doomed son . Love and memory left his heart open and unaware . " That time I heard about when that Negro from Cuba was making a talk in the House I was so proud of you . When the other congressmen stood up you sat back farther in your chair , propped your feet up and lighted a cigar . I thought it was wonderful . I was so proud of you . But now I see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am ashamed for you when I remember it . When I think back how I used to worship you  --  " Jester could not finish , for the distress of the old Judge was obvious . His crippled arm tightened and his hand curled hard and spastic while the elbow joint crooked uncontrollably . The shock of Jester 's words interacted with his disorder so that tears of emotional and physical hurt started . He blew his nose and said after some moments of silence : " Far sharper than a serpent 's tooth it is to have a thankless child . " But Jester resented the fact that his grandfather was so vulnerable . " But Grandfather , you 've talked all you want to always . And I have listened and believed . But now that I have a few opinions of my own , you wo n't stand for it and start quoting the Bible . That is n't fair because it automatically puts a person in the wrong . " " It 's not the Bible  --  Shakespeare . " " Anyway I 'm not your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The fan turned in the breathless afternoon and the sun shone on the dining table with the platter of carved chicken and the butter melted in the butter dish . Jester held the cool tea glass to his cheek and fondled it before he spoke . " Sometimes I wonder if I 'm not beginning to suspect why my father  --  did what he did . "  |p33The  dead still lived in the ornate , Victorian house with the cumbersome furniture . The dressing room of the Judge 's wife was still kept as it was in her lifetime with her silver appointments on the bureau and the closet with her clothes untouched except for occasional dusting . And Jester grew up with his father 's photographs , and in the library there was the framed certificate of admittance to the bar . But though all through the house there were reminders of the lives of the dead , the actual circumstance of death was never mentioned , even by inference . " What did you mean by that ? " the old Judge asked with apprehension . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural to wonder about my father 's death under the circumstances . " The judge tinkled the dinner bell and the sound seemed to gather the tension in the room . " Verily , bring a bottle of that elderberry wine Mr. Malone brought me for my birthday . " Right now , today , sir ? " she asked , as wine was usually served only at Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners . She took the wineglasses from the sideboard and wiped off the dust with her apron . Noticing the platter of uneaten food , she wondered if a hair or a fly had been cooked in the candied yams or dressing . " Is anything wrong with the dinner ? " " Oh , it 's delicious . I just have a mite of indigestion , I sup-pose . " It was true that when Jester talked of the mixing of races his stomach seemed to churn and all appetite had left him . He opened and poured the unaccustomed wine , then drank as soberly as if he had been drinking at a wake . For the break in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . The Judge was hurt and grieving . And when hurt has been caused by a loved one , only the loved one can comfort.  |p34Slowly  he put his right hand palm upward on the table toward his grandson , and after a moment jester placed his own palm on his grandfather 's . But the judge was not satisfied ; since words had hurt him , his solace lay in words . He grasped Jester 's hand in desperation . " Do n't you love your old grandfather any more ? " Jester took his hand away and drank some swallows of wine . " Sure I do , Grandfather , but  --  " And though the judge waited , Jester did not finish the sentenceand the emotion was left qualified in the strained room . The Judge 's hand was left extended and the fingers fluttered a little . " Son , has it ever occurred to you that I am not a wealthy man any longer ? I have suffered many losses and our forebears suffered losses . Jester , I 'm worried about your education and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage . " " You 've heard the old saw about the best things in life are free . It 's both true and false like all generalizations . But this one thing is true : you can get the best education in this countryabsolutely and entirely free . ' West Point is free and I could get you an appointment . " " But I do n't want to be an army officer . " " What do you want to be ? " Jester was perplexed , uncertain . " I do n't know exactly . I like music and I like flying . " " Well go to West Point and enter the Air Corps . Anything you can get from the Federal Government you ought to take advantage of . God knows the Federal Government has done enough damage to the South . " " I do n't have to decide about the future until I graduate from high school next year . " " What I was pointing out , Son , is my finances are not whatp35they used to be . But if my plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " The Judge had often made vague hints from time to time of future wealth . Jester had never paid much attention to these intimations , but now he asked : " What plans , Grandfather ? " " Son , I wonder if you are old enough to understand the strategy . " The Judge cleared his throat . " You 're young and the dream is big . " " What is it ? " " It 's a plan to correct damages done and to restore the South . " " How ? " " It 's the dream of a statesman  --  not just a cheap political scheme . It 's a plan to rectify an immense historical injustice . " Ice cream had been served and Jester was eating , but the Judge let it melt in his saucer . " I still do n't get the drift , sir . " " Think , Son . In any war between civilized nations what happens to the currency of the country who did n't win ? Think of World War I and World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armistice ? Did the Germans burn their money ? And the Japanese yen ? Did the Japanese make bonfires of their currency after their defeat ? Did they , Son ? " " No , " Jester said , bewildered by the vehemence of the old man 's voice . " What happens in any civilized nation after the cannons are silenced and the battlefields are quiet ? The victor allows the vanquished to rest and restore in the interests of the commoneconomics . The currency of a conquered nation is alwaysredeemed  --  devalued , but still redeemed . Redeemed : look what is happening now in Germany  --  in Japan . The Federal Government has redeemed the enemy money and helped the vanquished restore itself . From time immemorial the currency of a defeated nation has been left in circulation.  |p36And  the lira in Italy  --  did the Federal Government confiscatethe lira ? The lira , the yen , the mark  --  all , all were redeemed . " The Judge was leaning forward over the table and his tie brushed his saucer of melted ice cream , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War Between the States ? Not only did the Federal Government of the United States free the slaves which were the sine qua non of our cotton economy , so that the very resources of the nation were gone with the wind . A truer story was never written than Gone With the Wind . Remember how we cried at that picture show ? " Jester said : " I did n't cry . " " You certainly did , " the Judge said . " I wish I had written that book . " Jester did not comment . " But back to the issue . Not only was the economy of the nation deliberately wrecked , but the Federal Government completely invalidated all Confederate currency . Not one cent could be redeemed for the wealth of the entire Confederacy . I have heard of Confederate bills used as kindling for fires . " " There used to be a whole trunk of Confederate bills in the attic . I wonder what happened to them . " " They 're in the library in my safety box . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not answer ; instead , he pulled from his vest pocket a Confederate thousand-dollar bill . Jester examined it with some of the wonder of his attic-playing childhood . The bill was so real , so green and believable . But the wonder illuminedhim only for a few instants , then was extinguished . Jester handed the bill back to his grandfather . " It would be a lot of money if it was real . "  | " One of these days it might be real ' as you say . It will be , if my strength and work and vision can make it so . " Jester questioned his grandfather with his cold clear eyes . Then he said : " The money is nearly a hundred years old . " " And think of the hundreds of billions of dollars squanderedby the Federal Government during those hundred years . Think of the wars financed and public spending . Think of the other currencies redeemed and put back into circulation . The mark , the lira , the yen  --  all foreign currencies . And the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should have been treated as brothers . The currency should have been redeemedand not devalued . Do n't you see that , Lamb ? " " Well it was n't and it 's too late now . " The conversation made Jester uneasy and he wanted to leave the table and go away . But his grandfather held him with a gesture . " Wait a minute . It 's never too late to redress a wrong . And I am going to be instrumental in allowing the Federal Governmentto redress this historic and monumental wrong , " the Judge stated pontifically . " I am going to have a bill introducedin the House of Representatives if I win the next electionthat will redeem all Confederate monies , with the proper adjustment for the increase of cost-of-living nowadays . It will be for the South what F.D.R. intended to do in his New Deal . It will revolutionize the economy of the South . And you , Jester , will be a wealthy young man . There are ten million dollars in that safety box . What do you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money accumulate ? " " There are ancestors of vision in our family  --  remember that , Jester . My grandmother , your great-great-grandmother , was a great lady and a woman of vision . When the war was over she traded for Confederate money , swapping now and then a few eggs and produce  --  once I remember her tellingp38me she even swapped a laying hen for three million dollars . Everybody was hungry in those days and everybody had lost faith . All except your great-great-grandmother . I will never forget her saying : It will come back , it 's bound to . ' " " But it never has , " Jester said . " Until now  --  but you wait and see . It will be a New Deal for the economy of the South and benefit the nation as a whole . Even the Federal Government will be benefited . " " How ? " Jester asked . The Judge said calmly , " What benefits one benefits the whole . It 's simple to understand ; if I had a few million , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local business . And I 'm just one individual to be reimbursed . " " Another thing , " Jester said . " It 's been about a hundred years . And how could the money be traced ? " The Judge 's voice was triumphant . " That 's the least of our worries . When the Treasury announces that Confederate money is being redeemed , the money will be found all right . Confederate bills will be cropping up in attics and barns all over the South . Cropping up all over the nation and even in Canada . " " What good would it do to have money cropping up in Canada ? " The Judge said with dignity : " That 's just a figure of speech  --  a rhetorical example . " The Judge looked hopefully at his grandson . " But what do you think of the legislation as a whole ? " Jester avoided his grandfather 's eyes and did not answer . And the Judge , desperate for his approval , persisted . " What , Lamb ? It 's the vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Journal has many times referred to me as a great statesman ' and the Courier always speaks of me as the first citizen of Milan . Once it was written I was one of the fixedp39stars in that glorious firmament of Southern statesmen . ' Do n't you admit I am a great statesman ? " The question was not only a plea for reassurance , but a desperate command for emotional annealment . Jester could not answer . For the first time he wondered if his grandfather 's reasoning power had been affected by the stroke . And his heart balanced between pity and the natural instinct for separationthat divides the sound from the infirm . The veins of age and excitement crawled in the Judge 's temple and his face flushed . Only twice in his life had the Judge suffered from rejection : once when he was defeated in an election for Congress , and again when he sent a long story he had written to the Saturday Evening Post and it was returned to him with a form letter . The Judge could not believe this rejection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the other stories in the Post . Then , suspecting that it had not been properly read , he glued certain pages of the manuscript together and when it was returned another time he never read a Post again , and never wrote another story . Now he could not believe that the separation between himselfand his grandson was a reality . " Do you remember how , when you were a little boy , you used to call me Grandy ? " Jester was not moved by the recollection and the tears in his grandfather 's eyes irritated him . " I remember everything . " He rose and stood behind the Judge 's chair , but his grandfather would not get up and would not let him leave . He grasped Jester 's hand and held it to his cheek . Jester stood stiff with embarrassment and his hand did not respond to the caress . " I never thought I 'd hear a grandson of mine speak as you have done . You said you did n't see why the races should n't mix . Think of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you like that ? Would you let your sister marry a Nigra buck if you had a sister ? " " I 'm not thinking of that . I was thinking of racial justice . " " But if your so-called racial justice ' leads to intermarriage  --  as it will according to the laws of logic  --  would you marry a Nigra ? Be truthful . " Involuntarily , Jester was thinking of Verily and the other cooks and washwomen who had worked at home , and of Aunt Jemima of the pancake ads . His face flushed bright and his freckles darkened . He could not answer immediately , so much did the image appall him . " You see , " the Judge said . " You were only making empty lip-service  --  for the Northerners , at that . " Jester said : " I still think that as a judge you judge one crime in two different ways  --  according to whether it is done by a Negro or a white man . " " Naturally . They are two different things . White is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall meet if I can prevent it . " The Judge laughed and held Jester 's hand when he tried to pull away again . " All my life I have been concerned with questions of justice . And after your father 's death I realized that justice itself is a chimera , a delusion . Justice is not a flat yardstick , applied in equal measure to an equal situation . After your father 's death I realized there was a quality more important than justice . " Jester 's attention was always held by any reference to his father and his death . " What is more important , Grand-father ? " " Passion , " the Judge said . " Passion is more important than justice . " Jester stiffened with embarrassment . " Passion ? Did my father have passion ? " The Judge evaded the question . " Young people of yourp41generation have no passion . They have cut themselves off from the ideals of their ancestors and are denying the heritage of their blood . Once when I was in New York , I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl and something in my bloodstream sickened . My outrage had nothing particularlyto do with justice  --  but when I saw those two laughingtogether and eating at the same table , my bloodstream  --  I left New York that same day and never went back to that Babel , nor will to my dying day . " " I would n't have minded at all , " Jester said . " Soon , as a matter of fact , I am going to New York . " " That 's what I meant . You have no passion . " The words affected Jester violently ; he trembled and blushed . " I do n't see  --  " " One of these days you may have this passion . And when it comes to you , your half-baked notions of so-called justice will be forgotten . And you will be a man and my grandson  --  with whom I am well pleased . " Jester held the chair while the Judge pushed himself up from the table with his stick and stood upright for a moment facing the picture above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sought desperately some words that would abridge the chasm that had opened in the last two hours . And finally he said : " You know , Jester , I can see the pink mule you were talking about  --  there in the sky over the orchard and the shack . " The admission altered nothing and they both knew it . The Judge walked slowly and Jester stood near him ready to steady him if necessary . His pity mingled with remorse and he hated pity and remorse . When his grandfather was settled on the library sofa , he said : " I 'm glad you know how I stand . I 'm glad I told you . " But the tears in his grandfather 's eyes unnervedhim so that he was forced to add : " I love you anyway  --  I do love you  --  Grandy . " But when he was embraced , thep42smell of sweat and the sentimentality disgusted him , and when he had freed himself he felt a sense of defeat . He ran out of the room and bounded up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the upstairs hall there was a window of stained glass which brightened Jester 's auburn hair but cast a sallow light on his breathless face . He closed the door of his room and flung himself on the bed . It was true he had no passion . The shame of his grandfather'swords pulsed in his body and he felt that the old man knew that he was a virgin . His hard boy 's hands unzipped his fly and touched his genitals for solace . Other boys he knew boasted of love affairs and even went to a house run by a woman called Reba . This place fascinated Jester ; on the outsideit was an ordinary frame house with a trellis on the porch and a potato vine . The very ordinariness of the house fascinatedand appalled him . He would walk around the block and his heart felt challenged and defeated . Once , in the late afternoon , he saw a woman come out of the house and he watched her . She was an ordinary woman wearing a blue dress and with her lips gummed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as she glanced at him casually , the shame of his secret defeat made him draw up one foot against the other leg and stand stricken until the woman turned away . Then he ran all the six blocks to his house and flung himself on the same bed where he lay now . No , he had no passion , but he had had love . Sometimes , for a day , a week , a month , once for a whole year . The one year 's love was for Ted Hopkins who was the best all-around athlete in the school . Jester would seek Ted 's eyes in the corridor and , although his pulses pounded , they only spoke to each other twice in that year . One time was when they entered the vestibule together on a raining day and Ted said , " It 's foul weather . "  |p43Jester  responded in a faint voice , " Foul . " The other conversation was longer and less casual but completely humiliating . Because Jester loved Ted , he wanted more than anything to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the football season , he saw in a jeweler 's a little golden football . He bought this but it took him four days to give it to Ted . They had to be alone for him to give it and after days of following , they met in the locker room in Ted 's section . Jester held out the football with a trembling hand and Ted asked , " What 's this ? " Jester knew somehow , someway , he had made a mistake . Hurriedly , he explained , " I found it . " " Why do you want to give it to me ? " Jester was dizzy with shame . " Just because I do n't have any use for it and I thought I would give it to you . " As Ted 's blue eyes looked mockingly and suspiciously , Jester blushed the warm painful blush of the very fair and his freckles darkened . " Well thanks , " Ted said , and put the gold football in his trousers pocket . Ted was the son of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Milan , so this love was shadowed by the thought that his father would be transferred . And his feelings , furtive and secret as they were , were intensified by the menace of separation and the aura of distance and adventure . Jester avoided Ted after the football episode and afterward he could never think about football or the words " foul weather " without a cringing shame . He loved , too , Miss Pafford who taught English and wore bangs but put on no lipstick . Lipstick was repulsive to Jester , and he could not understand how anyone could kiss a woman who wore gummy smeary lipstick . But since nearly all girls and women wore lipstick , Jester 's loves were severely limited . Ip44Hot , blank and formless , the afternoon stretched ahead of him . And since Sunday afternoons are the longest afternoons of all , Jester went to the airport and did not come back until suppertime . After supper , he still felt blank , depressed . He went to his room and flung himself on his bed as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still unsolaced , a sudden spasm lifted him . He was hearing from far away a tune played on the piano and a dark voice singing , although what the tune was or where it was coming from he did not know . jester raised up on his elbow , listening and looking into the night . It was a blues tune , voluptuous and grieving . The music came from the lane behind the Judge 's property where Negroes lived . As the boy listened the jazz sadness blossomed and was left unshattered . Jester got up and went downstairs . His grandfather was in the library and he slipped into the night unnoticed . The music came from the third house in the lane , and when he knocked and knocked again the music stopped and the door was opened . He had not prepared himself for what he would say , and he stood speechless in the doorway , knowing only that something overwhelming was about to happen to him . He faced for the first time the Negro with the blue eyes and , facing him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jester quailed when he faced the blue eyes opposite him . They were cold and blazing in the dark and sullen face . They reminded him of something that made him quiver with sudden shame . He questioned wordlessly the overwhelming feeling . Was it fear ? Was it love ? Or was it  --  at last , was it  --  passion ? The jazz sadness shattered . Still not knowing , Jester went into the room and shut the door.  |p45THE  SAME midsummer evening while the scent of honeysucklelingered in the air , J. T. Malone made an unexpected visit to the old Judge 's house . The Judge went early to bed and was an early riser ; at nine in the evening he sloshed mightily in his evening bath and the same procedure happenedat four in the morning . Not that he liked it . He would have liked to be safe in the arms of Morpheus until six o'clock or even seven like other people . But the habit of being an early riser had got into him and he could n't break it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was needed two baths a day , and those who were around him would agree with this . So at those crepuscular hours the old Judge would be splashing , snorting and singing . . . his favorite bathtub songs were " On the Trail of the Lonesome Pine "  |p46and  " I 'm a Rambling Wreck from Georgia Tech . " That evening he did not sing with the usual gusto , as his talk with his grandson had troubled him , nor did he put toilet water behindeach ear as he might have done . He had gone to Jester 's room before his bath but the boy was not there , nor did he answer from the yard . The Judge was wearing a white dimity nightshirt and clutching a dressing gown when the doorbell rang . Expecting his grandson , he went downstairs and crossed the hall barefooted and with his robe slung negligently on his arm . Both friends were surprised to see each other . Malone tried to avoid looking at the too-small bare feet of the very fat Judge , as the Judge struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the night ? " the Judge said in a tone as though midnight had long since passed . Malone said , " I was just out walking and thought I might step in for a moment . " Malone looked frightened and desperateand the Judge was not deceived by his words . " As you see I 've just finished with my bath . Come up and we can have a little nightcap . I 'm always more comfortable in my own room after eight o'clock . I 'll pile in my bed and you can lie in the long French chair . . . or vice versa . What 's bothering you ? You look like you 've been chased by a banshee , J.T. " " I feel like it , " Malone said . Unable to bear the truth alone , that evening he had told Martha about the leukemia . He had run from his own house in terror and alarm , fleeing for comfortor solace anywhere . He had dreaded in advance the intimacythat tragedy might have restored from the distant casualness of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worse than any dread . Martha had cried , insisted on bathing his face with cologne and talked of the children 's future . In fact , his wife had not questioned the medical report and behaved as though she believed that herp47husband was incurably sick and was in fact a slowly dying man . This grief and credence exasperated and horrified Malone . As the hours passed the scene grew worse . Martha talked about their honeymoon at Blowing Rock , North Carolina , and the births of the children and the trips they had taken and the unexpected changes in life . She even mentioned , in connection with the children 's education , her Coca-Cola stock . Modest , Victorian lady  --  almost sexless it had seemed to Malone at times . This lack of interest in sex had often made him feel gross , indelicate , almost uncouth . The final horror of the eveningwas when Martha unexpectedly , so unexpectedly , referred to sex . Martha was embracing the unnerved Malone when she cried , " What can I do ? " And she used the phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It used to be the phrase for the act of love . It originated when Ellen was a baby who watched the older children do handsprings on the Malone summer lawn . The small Ellen would call out when her father came home from work , " You want me to do a handspringfor you , Daddy ? " and that phrase of summer evenings , wet lawns and childhood had been their word for the sexual act when they were young . Now the twenty-years-married Martha used the word , her bridges carefully placed in a glass of water . Malone was horrified knowing that , not only was he going to die , but some part of him had died also without his having realized . So quickly , wordlessly , he hurried out into the night . The old Judge led the way , his bare feet very pink against the dark blue carpet , and Malone followed . They were both glad of the comfort of each other 's presence . " I told my wife , " Malone said , " about that . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there was an immense four-poster bed with a canopy and feather pillows.  |p48The  draperies were rich and musty and next to the window there was a chaise longue which he indicated to Malone before he turned his attention to the whiskey and poured drinks . " J.T. , have you ever noticed that when someone has a failing , that fault is the first and foremost thing he attributes to another ? Say a man is greedy . . . greed is the first thing he accuses in others , or stinginess . . . that is the first fault a stingy man can recognize . " Warming to his subject the Judge almost shouted his next words , " And it takes a thief to catch a thief . . . a thief to catch a thief . " " I know , " Malone replied , somewhat at a loss to find a hinge to the subject . " I do n't see ... " " I 'm getting around to that , " the Judge said with authority . " Some months ago you were telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . " " Yes , " Malone said , still puzzled . " Well , this very morning while Jester and I were coming home from the drugstore , I chanced to see Dr. Hayden and I was never so shocked . " " Why ? " ? The Judge said : " The man was a sick man . I never saw a man fall off so rapidly . " Malone tried to digest the intimations involved . " You mean ... ? " The Judge 's voice was calm and firm . " I mean , if Dr. Hayden has a peculiar blood disease , it is the most likely thing in the world to diagnose onto you instead of himself . " Malone pondered over this fantastic reasoning , wondering if there was a straw to grasp . " After all , J.T. , I have had a great fund of medical experience ; I was in Johns Hopkins for close on to three months . " Malone was remembering the doctor 's hands and arms . " It 's true that Hayden has very thin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be silly , J.T. , hairiness has nothing to do with it . " Malone , abashed , was more willing to listen to the Judge 's reasoning . " The doctor did n't tell you that out of meanness or spite , " the judge went on . " It 's just the logical , human way of contaging bad things away from yourself . The minute I saw him today , I knew what had happened . I knew that look of a mortally sick man . . . looking sideways , his eyes averted as though ashamed . I have seen that look many a time at Johns Hopkins where I was a perfectly well , ambulatory patient who knew every soul at that hospital , " the Judge said truthfully . " Whereas your eyes are straight as a die , although you 're thin and ought to eat liver . Liver shots , " he said almost shouting , " are n't there things called liver shots for blood trouble ? " Malone looked at the Judge with eyes that flickered between bewilderment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johns Hopkins , " he said softly . " I suppose you did n't bruit it around because of your political career . " " Ten years ago I weighed three hundred and ten pounds . " " You 've always carried your weight well . I 've never thought of you as a fat man . " " Fat man : of course not . I was just stout and corpulent .. . the only thing , I would just have falling-out spells . It worried Miss Missy , " he said with a glance at his wife 's portrait on the wall across from him . " She even spoke about doctors . . . harped on the subject , in fact . I had never gone to a doctor in my adult life , feeling instinctively that doctors meant either cutting or , just as bad , diet . I was close friends with Doc Tatum who used to fish and hunt with me , but he was in a different category . . . otherwise I just let doctors alone and hoped they would leave me alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink of health . When Doc Tatum died I had a terrible toothache . . . I think it was psychosomatic , so Ip50went to Doc 's brother who was the best mule doctor in the county . I drank . " " Mule doctor ! " His faith in the Judge 's reasoning echoed with a sick dismay . The old Judge did not seem to notice . " Naturally , it was the week of Doe 's funeral , and what with the wake and cortege and all , my tooth hurt like an electric bell . . . so Poke , Doe 's brother , just drew the tooth for me ... with novocain and antibiotics which he uses for mules anyhow , as their teeth are strong and they are very stubborn about anybody fooling with their mouths and very sensitive . " Malone nodded wonderingly , and as his disappointment still echoed , he changed the subject abruptly . " That portrait is the living image of Miss Missy . " " Sometimes I think so , " the Judge said complacently , as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was greatly superior to the possessions of others . . . even if they were identical . He added reflectively : " Sometimes when I am sad or pessimistic I think that Sara made a bad mistake with the left foot . . . at my worst moments it sometimes resembles a kind of odd tail . " " I do n't see that at all , sir , " Malone said comfortingly . " Besides it 's the face , the countenance that matters . " " All the same , " the Judge said passionately , " I wish my wife 's portrait had been painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds or one of the great masters . " " Well that 's another story , " Malone said , looking at the badly drawn portrait done by the Judge 's elder sister . " I have learned not to settle for the cheapest , homemade product . . . especially when it comes to art . But at that time I never dreamed that Miss Missy was going to die and leave me . Tears brightened the dim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Judge could never speak about his wife 's death.  |p51Malone  was also silent , remembering . The Judge 's wife had died of cancer and it was Malone who had filled the doctor 's prescriptions during her long illness , and he often visited her  --  sometimes bringing flowers from his garden or a bottle of cologne as though to soften the fact that he was delivering morphine . Often the Judge would be lumbering bleakly about the house , as he stayed with his wife as much as possible even , Malone thought , to the detriment of his political career . Miss Missy had developed cancer of the breast and it had been removed . The Judge 's grief was boundless ; he haunted the halls of the city hospital , harrying even doctors who had nothing to do with the case , weeping , questioning . He organizedprayers at the First Baptist Church and put a hundred dollars in her envelope every Sunday . When his wife returned home , apparently recovered , his joy and optimism were boundless ; also , he bought a Rolls-Royce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily airings . When his wife knew she was ill again she wanted to spare her husband the truth , and for a while he went on with his joyous extravagant ways . When it was apparent that his wife was failing , he did n't want to know and tried to deceive both her and himself . Avoiding doctors and questions , he accepted the fact that a trained nurse had become a member of the household . He taught his wife to play poker and they played frequently when she was well enough . When it was obvious that his wife was in pain , the Judge would tiptoe softly to the refrigerator , eat without tasting what he ate , thinking only that his wife had been very sick and was just recovering from a serious operation . So he steadied himself to his secret everyday grief , and would not let himself understand . The day she died was a frosty day in December , with a cloudless blue sky and the sound of Christmas carols chiming in the icy air . The Judge , too dazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hiccups which let up , thank God , during the reading of the funeral service . Late that winter 's day , when the ceremonies were finished and the guests were gone , he went alone in the Rolls-Royce to the cemetery ( he sold the car the week afterward ) . There , as the first frosty stars were appearing , he poked the newly laid cement of the grave with a walking stick , pondered over the workmanship of the job , and very slowly went back to the car driven by the " safe , colored driver , " and there exhausted , he went to sleep . The Judge gave a final look at the portrait before he turned his brimming eyes away . A purer woman never lived . After a proper time of mourning , Malone and the rest of the town expected that the Judge would marry again ; and even he himself , lonesome and grieving as he rattled around the enormous house , felt a feeling of unknown expectancy . On Sunday he dressed very carefully and attended church , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glued to the choir . His wife had sung in the choir and he loved to watch the throats and bosoms of women when they sang . There were some lovely ladies in the First Baptist 's choir , especially one soprano whom the Judge watched constantly . But there were other church choirs in the town . With a feeling of heresy , the Judge went to the Presbyterian church where there was a blond singer . . . his wife had been blond ... whose singing throat and breasts fascinated him , although otherwise she was not quite to his taste . So , dressed to kill and sitting on one of the front rows , the Judge visited the various churches of the town and watched and judged the choirs , in spite of the fact that he had very little ear for music and was always singing off key and very loudly . No one questionedhim about his changes of churches , yet he must have had some guilt for he often would declare in a loud voice , " I like to be informed about what goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always been very broad-minded . " The judge never thought consciously of marrying again ; indeed , he often spoke of his wife as though she were alive . Still there was this hollow yearning that he tried to fill with food or alcohol or watching choir ladies . And there had begun a veiled , subconscious search for his dead wife . Miss Missy was a pure woman , and automatically he considered only the pure . A choir singer , only choir singers attracted him . Those requirements were not too hard to fill . But Miss Missy had also been an excellent poker player , and unmarried , pure choir singers who are also canny poker players are somewhat rare . One evening about two years after Miss Missy 's death , the judge invited Miss Kate Spinner for Saturday night supper . He also invited her elderly aunt as a chaperon and planned the supper with the forethought that was exactly like his wife 's . The supper started with oysters . This was followed with a chicken dish and a curry of tomatoes , currants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's favorite company dishes . Wine was served at each course and brandy followed the ice cream dessert . The judge fidgeted over the preparations for days , making sure that the best plate and silver were used . The supper itself was a keen mistake . To begin with , Miss Kate had never eaten an oyster and was deadly afraid of having to eat one when the judge tried to coax her . The unaccustomed wine made Miss Kate giggle in what seemed to the judge a somewhat suggestive manner which obscurely offended him . On the other hand , the old maiden aunt said she had never touched a drop of spirits in her life and was surprised that her niece would indulge . At the end of that dismal supper , the judge , his hopes shaken but not yet gone , brought out a new deck of cards to have a game with the ladies . He had in mind his wife 's slender fingersp54ringed with the diamonds he had given her . But it materializedthat Miss Kate had never held a card in her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cards were the entrance to the devil 's playground . The party broke up early and the Judge finished the bottle of brandy before he went to bed . He blamed the fact that the Spinners were Lutherans and not quite expected to be in the same class as those who attended the First Baptist Church . So he consoled himself and soon his natural optimism returned . However , he did not go so far afield in his broadmindedness about sects and creeds . Miss Missy had been born Episcopalian , changing over to First Baptist when they were married . Miss Hettie Peaver sang in the Episcopal choir and her throat was pulsing and vibrant as she sang . On Christmas the congregation stood up at the Hallelujah passage . . . year after year he was fooled by this passage , sitting there like a ninny until he realized that every soul had stood up and then trying to make amends by the loudest singing in the church . . . but this Christmas the Hallelujah section came and went unnoticedas the Judge craned his neck at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invited her and her aged mother to Saturday night supper the following week . Again he agonized over preparations . Miss Hettie was a short stout woman of good family ; she was no spring chicken as the Judge well knew , but then neither was he , pushing seventy years old . And it was of course not a question of marriage as Miss Hettie was a widow . ( The Judge had automatically in this unconscious search for love excluded widows and , of course , grass widows , as he had held it as a principle that second marriages were most unbecoming for a woman . ) That second supper was quite different from the Lutheran one . It turned out Miss Nettie adored oysters and was trying to get up nerve to swallow one whole . The old mother toldp55a story about when she cooked an all-oyster dinner . . . raw oysters , scalloped oysters and so forth , which the old lady named in detail . . . for the business partner of Percy , " my beloved spouse , " and how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . As the old lady drank her wine , her stories grew longer and more tedious and the daughter would try to change the subject with little success . After dinner when the Judge brought cards , the old lady said she was too blind to make out the cards and she would be perfectly satisfied just finishing her port and looking at the fire . The Judge taught Miss Hettie blackjack and found her an able pupil . But he so much missed Miss Missy 's slender hands and diamond rings . And another thing , Miss Hettie was a little buxom to his taste and he could not but compare his wife 's slender bosom to her somewhat hefty form . His wife had had very delicate breasts , and indeed , he never forgot that one had been removed . On Valentine 's Day , sick with that hollow feeling , he bought a five-pound box of heart-shaped candy , much to the interest of J. T. Malone , who made the sale . On the way to Miss Hettie 's house he reconsidered judiciously and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took two months . However , after some other little episodes like this that came to nothing , the Judge devoted himself solely to his grandson and his love for him . The Judge spoiled his grandson beyond reason . It was the joke of the town that once at a church picnic the Judge had carefully picked the grains of pepper out of his small grandson'sfood , as the child did not like pepper . When the child was four years old he could recite the Lord 's Prayer and the Twenty-Third Psalm , thanks to his grandfather 's patient coaching , and it was the old man 's delight when townspeople gathered to hear this prodigy perform . Absorbed in his grand/son , his hollowness of grief diminished , as well as his fascinationfor choir ladies . In spite of advancing age , which indeed the Judge did not admit , he went early every morning to his office in the courthouse  --  walking the morning way , being driven back at noon for a long midday dinner , and being driven back for the afternoon work hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's drugstore . On Saturday night he played poker in a game held in the back room of the New York Cafe . All these years the Judge had as his motto : " Mens sana in corpore sano . " His " stroke " did not alter this as much as would have been supposed . After a cantankerous convalescence , he returned to his usual ways ; although he went to the office only in the morning and did little but open his diminishingmail and read the Milan Courier , the Flowering Branch Ledger and , on Sundays , the Atlanta Constitution , which infuriated him . The Judge had fallen in the bathroom and had lain there for hours until Jester , sleeping his sound boy 's sleep , finally heard his grandfather 's cries . The " little seizure " had happened instantaneously so that the Judge had at first hoped that his recovery would come about with the same instant speed . He would not admit it was a true stroke  --  spoke of " a light case of polio , " " little seizure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he declared he used the walking stick because he liked it and that the " little attack " had probably benefited him as his mind had grown keener because of contemplationand " new studies . " The old man waited restlessly for the sound of a doorlatch . " Jester is out so late , " he said , with a note of complaint . " He 's usually such a thoughtful boy about letting me know where he is when he goes out at night . Before my bath , when I heard some sound of music from not far away , I wondered if hep57had not stepped out in the yard to listen . But the music stopped and when I called there was only silence , and although it 's past his bedtime , he has not come home . " Malone put his long upper lip against his mouth , as he did not like Jester , but he only said mildly : " Well , boys will be boys . " " Often I have worried about him , brought up in a house of sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why he loves sad music , although his mother was a great one for music , " the judge said , forgetting he had skipped a generation . " I mean of course his grandmother , " he corrected . " Jester 's mother was with us only at that time of violence , sorrow and confusion . . . so much so that she passed through the family almost unnoticed , so that now I can hardly remember her face . Light hair , brownish eyes , a nice voice . . . although her father was a well-known rum runner . In spite of our feelings she was a blessing in disguise if ever there was one . " The trouble was , she was just sandwiched in between Johnny 's death , Jester 's birth , and Miss Missy 's second failing . It would take the strongest personality to not blur against all this and Mirabelle was not strong . " Indeed , the only memory that stood out was one Sunday dinner when the gentle stranger said : " I love baked Alaskas " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mirabelle , " he said sternly , " you love me . You love the memory of your husband . You love Miss Missy . But you do n't love baked Alaskas , see ? " He pointed out , with a most loving glance at the piece he was cutting , " You like baked Alaskas . See the difference , child ? " She saw , but her appetite had quite left her . " Yes sir , " she said as she put down her fork . The Judge , feeling guilty , said angrily : " Eat , child . You 've got to cat in your condition . " But the idea of being in her condition only made her cry , and leave the table . Miss Missy , with a glance of reproach to her husband , followedp58soon after , leaving him to eat in solitary fury . As a punishmentto them he deliberately deprived them of his presence most of the afternoon , playing solitaire in the library behind locked doors ; it was a great satisfaction when the doorknob was rattled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as to go to the cemetery alone instead of escorting his wife and daughter-in-law on the customary Sunday visit to Johnny 's grave . The jaunt to the cemetery restored his usual good temper . After a stroll in the April twilight , he went to Pizzalatti 's which was always open and bought sacks of candy , tangerines , and even a coconut , which the family enjoyed after supper . " Mirabelle , " he said to Malone . " If she had only been taken to Johns Hopkins for the confinement . But Clanes have always been born at home , and who could know how it would turn out , besides . Hindsight is always better than foresight , " he finished , dismissing his daughter-in-law who had died in childbirth . " Such a sad thing about Mirabelle , " Malone said , just in order to say something . " Women seldom die in childbirth in this generation , and when they do it 's especially sad . She used to come to the drugstore every afternoon for an ice cream cone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a peculiar satisfaction , as he had profited by this circumstance and would often say , " Mirabelle is craving strawberry shortcake , " or some such delicacy , passing on his own desires to his pregnant daughter-in-law . Tactfully but firmly , his wife had kept the Judge within the three-hundred-pound weight range during her lifetime , although the words calorie or diet were never used . Secretly she read up on calorie lists and planned the meals accordingly , without the Judge 's knowledge . " Every baby doctor in town was consulted toward the end , "  |p59the  Judge said almost defensively , as though he was being reproached for not caring for his kin . " But it was some rare complication that had not been foreseen . To my dying day I will regret that we had not taken her to Johns Hopkins to begin with . They specialize in complications and rare complaints . If it had n't been for Johns Hopkins , I would be under the sod today . " Malone , who found solace in this talk of the sickness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rare ? " " Not so much complicated and rare , but curious , " the Judge said complacently . " When my beloved wife died I was so miserable I began digging my grave with my teeth . " Malone shuddered , having an instant , vivid image of his friend chewing gritty dirt in the graveyard , crying with misery . His own illness had left him defenseless against such sudden , random images , no matter how repellent . The subjectivity of illness was so acute that Malone responded violently to whole areas of the most placid and objective concepts . For instance , the mere mention of a commonplace thing such as Coca-Cola suggested shame and the disgrace of not being thought a good provider , just because his wife had some shares of CocaColastock which she had bought with her own money and kept in a safety deposit box at the Milan Bank and Trust . These reactions , cavernous and involuntary , were hardly realizedby Malone as they had the volatile vigor and backward grace of the unconscious . " There came a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and ten pounds . But that did n't bother me particularly , and I was only troubled by those falling-out spells . But something outlandish had to happen before I took much serious notice . And finally the outlandish thing happened . "  | " What ? " Malone asked . " It was the time when Jester was seven . " The Judge broke off his story to complain of those years . " Oh , the trouble for a man to raise a motherless child , and not only to raise but to rear him . Oh , the Clapps baby food , the sudden earaches in the night which I stopped with paregoric soaked in sugar and sweet oil dropped in his ear . Of course his nurse , Cleopatra , did most of the doing , but my grandson was my responsibility and no question about it . " He sighed before he continued his story . " Anyway , when Jester was still a little nipper I decided to teach him to play golf , so one fair Saturday afternoon we set out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and showing Jester the various holds and positions . We came to that . . . that little pond near the woods . . . you know it , J.T. " Malone , who had never played golf and was not a member of the Country Club , nodded with a certain pride . " Anyway , I was just swinging away when I suddenly had one of those falling-out spells . And I fell right spang into the pond . There I was drowning with nothing but a seven-yearoldboy and a little colored caddy to save me . How they hauled me out I do n't know , being too drenched and confused to help myself much . It must have been a job , my weighing over three hundred , but that colored caddy was both shrewd and smart and I was finally safe . However , that falling-out spell made me think seriously enough to consider going to a doctor . Since I did n't like or trust any doctor in Milan , it came to me in a divine flash . . . Johns Hopkins . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave the caddy who had saved me a solid gold watch engraved in Latin . " " Latin ? " " Mens sana in corpore sano , " the Judge said serenely , as that was the only Latin he knew.  | " Most appropriate , " said Malone , who did not know Latin either . " Unbeknownst to me , I had a peculiar and you might say tragic connection with the colored boy , " the Judge said slowly ; and he closed his eyes as a kind of curtain for the subject , leaving Malone 's curiosity unsatisfied . " Nonetheless , " he went on , " I 'm hiring him as a body servant . " The oldfashionedterm struck Malone . " When I fell in the pond , I was sufficiently alarmed to take myself to Johns Hopkins , knowing they studied rare and curious diseases . I took little Jester with me to broaden his education and as a reward for helping that caddy save me . " The Judge did not admit that he could not face such a horrendous experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day came I faced Dr. Hume . " Malone paled at the unconscious image of a doctor 's office with the smell of ether , the children 's cries , Dr. Hayden 's knife and a treatment table . " When Dr. Hume asked if I overate , I assured him I ate just an ordinary amount . Then his questions chiseled finer . He asked , for instance , how many biscuits I had at a meal and I said , Just the ordinary amount . ' Chiseling in closer in the way that doctors do , he inquired what was the ordinary amount . ' When I told him , Just a dozen or two , ' I felt right then and there I had met my Waterloo . " In a flash Malone saw soaked biscuits , disgrace , Napoleon . " The doctor said I had two choices . . . either to go on living as I had been , which would not be for long , or to go on a diet . I was shocked , I admit . And I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told him to let me think it over for twelve hours before my final decision . We wo n't find the diet too hard , judge . ' Do n't you loathe it when doctors use the word we ' when it applies only and solely to62yourself ? He could go home and gobble fifty biscuits and ten baked Alaskas . . . while me , I 'm starving on a diet , so I meditated in a furious way . " " I hate that we ' doctors use , " Malone agreed , feeling the sickening ricochet of his own emotions in Dr. Hayden 's office and the doomed words , " We have here a case of leukemia . " " Furthermore , " the Judge added , " I hate it , God damn it , when doctors presume to tell me the so-called truth . I was so angry meditating about that diet problem I might have then and there had a stroke . " The Judge hastily corrected himself , " A heart attack or a little seizure . ' " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had asked for the truth , but in asking , he had asked only for reassurance . How could he dream that an ordinary case of spring fever would be a fatal disease ? He had wanted sympathy and reassurance , and he got a death warrant . " Doctors , by God ; washing their hands , looking out windows , fiddling with dreadful things while you are stretched out on a table or half undressed on a chair . " He finished in a voice that wailed with weakness and fury : " I 'm glad I did n't finish medical school . I would n't have it on my soul nor conscience . " " I meditated the full twelve hours as I said I would do . One portion of me said to go on the diet while another portion said , to hell , you live only once . I quoted Shakespeare to myself , To be or not to be , ' and cogitated sadly . Then toward twilight a nurse came to the room with a tray . On the tray there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greens , lettuce and tomato salad . I looked at the nurse . She had dainty bosoms and a lovely neck . . . for a nurse , that is . I told her about my problem and asked her truthfully what that diet was . You could have struck me over with a feather when she said : This , Judge , is the diet . ' When I was sure it was no trick , I sent word to Dr. Hume that I was on thep63diet and I fell to . I had forgotten to mention liquor or little toddies . I managed that . " " How ? " asked Malone , who knew the Judge 's little weaknesses . " The Lord works in strange ways . When I took Jester out of school to accompany me to the hospital , everybody thought it was mighty strange . Sometimes I thought so too , but secretly I was afraid I would die up North in that hospital . I did n't know the design beforehand , but a seven-year-old boy is just right to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather . " The trick in life is to change a miserable experience into a happy one . Once my gut was shrunk , I got along fine in Johns Hopkins and I lost forty pounds in three months . " The Judge , seeing Malone 's long - eyed wistfulness , felt suddenlyguilty because he had talked so much about his own health . " You may think everything is roses and wine with me , J.T. , but it 's not and I 'm going to tell you a secret I never breathed to a soul in this world , a serious , awful secret . " " Why , what on earth ... " " I was pleased after the diet to lose all that corpulence , but that diet had got in my system and just a year later , on my annual visit to Johns Hopkins , I was told I had sugar in the blood and that means diabetes . " Malone , who had been selling him insulin for years , was not surprised but he did not comment . " Not a fatal disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threatened to bring suit but he reasoned with me and as a dyed-in-the-wool magistrate , I realized it would n't stand up in court . That brought certain problems . Do you know , J.T. , while it 's not a fatal disease , you have to , have an injection every day . There is nothing catching about it but I felt there were too many health marks against me to make it known to the general public . I 'm still in the zenith ofp64my political career whether anybody recognizes it or not . " Malone said , " I wo n't tell anybody , although it is no disgrace . " " Corpulence , that little seizure , and then on top of everything , diabetes . . . that 's too much for a politician . Although there was a cripple in the White House for thirteen years . " " I have every confidence in your political astuteness , Judge . " He said this , but that evening he had strangely lost faith in the old Judge . . . why he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years I put up with those public nurses for the injectionsand now chance has led me to another solution . I have found a boy who will look after me and give me those needles . He is the same boy you inquired about in the spring . " Malone , suddenly remembering , said , " Not the Nigra with the blue eyes . " " Yes , " the Judge said . " What do you know about him ? " Malone asked . The Judge was thinking about the tragedy of his life and how that boy had centered in it . But he only said to Malone , " He was the colored caddy who saved my life when I fell into that pond . " Then came about between the two friends that laughter of disaster . It was focused consciously on the image of the three-hundred-pound old man being dragged out of a golf pond , but the hysterical laughter was reverberated in the gloom of the evening . The laughter of disaster does not stop easily , and so they laughed for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped laughing first . " Seriously , I wanted to find someone I could trust , and who else could I trust more than that little caddy who saved my life ? Insulin is a very delicate , mysterious thing and has to be administered by someone who is mighty intelligent and conscientious , needles boiled and so forth . "  |p65Malone  thought the boy might be intelligent , but is n't there such a thing as a too intelligent colored boy ? He feared for the Judge , seeing those cold , blazing eyes and associating them with the pestle , rats and death . " I would n't have hired that colored boy , but maybe you know best , Judge . " The Judge was back with his own worries . " Jester does n't dance , he does n't drink liquor , he does n't even go with girls , as far as I know . Where is that Jester ? It 's getting late . J.T. , do you think I ought to call the police ? " The idea of calling the police and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry about , but I think I 'd better go home . " " J.T. , take a taxi at my expense and tomorrow we 'll talk more about Johns Hopkins because , seriously , I think you ought to go there . " Malone said , " Thanks , sir , but I do n't need a taxi  --  the fresh air will do me good . Do n't worry about Jester . He 'll be home soon . " Although Malone said the walk would do him good , and although the night was warm , he was cold and weak as he walked home . Noiselessly , he crept into the bed he shared with his wife . But when her warm buttocks touched his own , sick with the vibrance of their past livingncss , he jerked away  --  for how can the living go on living when there is death ? 65IT WAS scarcely nine when Jester and Sherman first met that midsummer evening and only two hours had passed . But in first youth two hours can be a crucial period that can warp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to Jester Clane that evening . When the emotion of the music and the first meeting steadied , Jester was aware of the room . The green plant growing in a corner . He steadied himself to realize the stranger had interrupted . The blue eyes challenged him to speak , but still Jester was silent . He blushed and his freckles darkened . " Excuse me , " he said in a voice that trembled . " Who are you and what was that song you were singing ? " The other youth , who was the same age as Jester , said in a voice meant to be creepy , " If you want the sober ice-coldp67truth , I do n't know who I am or any of my antecedents . " " You mean you are an orphan , " Jester said . " Why , so am I , " he added with enthusiasm . " Do n't you think that 's sort of a sign ? " " No . You know who you are . Did your grandfather send you here ? " Jester shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some message , then as the moments passed , some trick . " Then why did you come busting in here ? " Sherman said . " I did n't come busting in . I knocked and said Excuse me , ' and we got into a conversation . " Sherman 's suspicious mind was wondering what trick was being played on him , and he was very much on guard . " We did n't get into any conversation . " " You were saying how you did n't know about your parents . Mine died . Did yours ? " The dark boy with the blue eyes said , " The sober ice-cold truth is , I do n't know anything about them . I was left in a church pew and therefore I was named Pew , in that somewhat Negroid and literal manner , according to the Nigerian race . My first name is Sherman . " It would take a person far less sensitive than Jester to realize that the other youth was being deliberately rude to him . He knew he ought to go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue eyes set in the dark face . Then without a word , Sherman began to sing and play . It was the song Jester had heard in his own room and he felt that he had never been so moved . Sherman 's strong fingers seemed very dark against the ivory keyboard and his strong neck was thrown back as he sang . After the first stanza of the song , he jerked his head and neck toward the sofa as an indication for Jester to sit down . Jester sat down , listening.  |p68When  the song was finished Sherman made a playful glissando before he went to the kitchenette in the next room and returned with two drinks already poured . He offered one to Jester who asked what it was as he took his glass . " Lord Calvert 's , bottled in bond , ninety-eight per cent proof . " Although Sherman did not say it , he had bought this whiskey for the year he had been drinking because of the advertisement , " The Man of Distinction . " He had tried to dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But on him it only looked sloppy , and he was one of the sharpest dressers in town . He had two Hathaway shirts and wore a black patch on his eye , but it only made him look pathetic instead of distinguishedand he bumped into things . " The best , the most distinguished , " Sherman said . " I do n't serve rotgut to my guests . " But he was careful to decant the drinks in the kitchen in case some juicehead would gobble it up ; also he did not serve Lord Calvert 's to known juiceheads . His guest tonight was no juicehead ; in fact , he had never tasted whiskey before . Sherman began to think that there was no dark plot on the Judge 's behalf . Jester held out a package of cigarettes , which he proferred courteously . " I smoke like a chimney , " he said , " and drink wine practically every day . " " I only drink Lord Calvert 's , " Sherman said staunchly . " Why were you so rude and ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have to be mighty careful about skitzes these days . " " About what ? " Jester asked , feeling somewhat at a loss . " That means schizophrenics . " " But is n't that a medical disease ? " " No , mental , " said Sherman with authority . " A skitz is a crazy person . I actually knew one . " " Who ? "  | " Nobody you would know . He was a Golden Nigerian . " " A golden what ? " " That 's a club I belonged to . It was started as a kind of protest club protesting against racial discrimination and with the very highest aims . " " What highest aims ? " Jester asked . " First we registered for the vote in a body and if you do n't think that takes nerve in this county you do n't know nothing . Each member got a little cardboard coffin with his name in it and a printed sign , A voting reminder . ' That actually happened , " Sherman said with emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little phrase , but not until he knew more about Sherman and the facts and phantasies of his life . " I wish I had been there when you registered as a body , " Jester said wistfully . The phrase " as a body " particularly appealed to him and heroic tears came suddenly to his eyes . Sherman 's voice was raw and cold , " No you would n't . You would of been the first to chicken . Besides , you 're not old enough to vote . . . the first to chicken . " " I resent that , " Jester said . " How do you know ? " " Little Bo-Peep told me so . " Although Jester was hurt , he admired that answer , and thought he would use it himself very soon . " Did many club members chicken ? " " Well , " Sherman said hesitantly , " under the circumstances , with cardboard coffins slipped under doors . . . we continued our voting studies , learned the names and dates of all the Presidents , memorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aiming to vote , not aiming to be no Joan of Arc , so under the circumstances . . . " His voice trailed off . He did not tell Jester of the charges and countercharges exchangedas voting day neared , nor did he tell him that he wasp70a minor and could not have voted anyhow . And that autumn day , Sherman exactly , with such lingering and exact detail , voted . . . in phantasy . He was also lynched in that phantasy to the tune of " John Brown 's Body , " which always made him cry anyway and made him cry double that day , a martyr to his race . No Golden Nigerian voted and the subject of voting was never mentioned again . " We had Parliamentary Procedure and were active in the Christmas Club which delegated in charge of donations for poor children . That 's how we all knew Happy Henderson was a skitz . " " Who 's that ? " Jester inquired . " Happy was the chief active member in charge of the Christmas donations and he mugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skitz and did n't know what he was doing . " " I 've often wondered if crazy people know if they are crazy or not , " Jester said softly . " Happy did n't know , or any of the Golden Nigerians either , otherwise we would n't have voted him into the club . Mugging an old lady in a fit of insanity . " " I feel the sincerest sympathy for crazy people , " Jester said . " The profoundest sympathy , " Sherman corrected . " That 's what we said on the flowers . . . I mean wreath , we sent his folks when he was electrocuted in Atlanta . " " He was electrocuted ? " Jester asked , appalled . " Naturally , mugging an old white lady on Christmas Eve . Turned out Happy had been in institutions half of his life . There was no motive . In fact , he did n't snatch the old lady 's purse after he mugged her . He just suddenly blew a fuse and went skitz . . . the lawyer made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . the lawyer the state hired to defend him , I mean . . . but anyway in spite of everything , Happy was fried . "  | " Fried , " Jester exclaimed with horror . " Electrocuted in Atlanta , June sixth , nineteen fifty-one . " " I think it 's simply terrible for you to refer to a friend and fellow member as being fried . ' " " Well he was , " Sherman said flatly . " Let 's converse about something more cheerful . Would you like me to show you Zippo Mullins ' apartment ? " With pride he pointed out each piece in the crowded , fancy , dreary room . " This rug is pure Wilton and the hide-a-bed sofa cost one hundred and eight dollars secondhand . It can sleep four if necessary . " Jester eyed the three-quarter-size sofa , wondering how four people could sleep in it . Sherman was stroking an iron alligator with an electric light bulb in its gaping jaws . " A house-warming present from Zippo 's aunt , not too modern or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Absolutely , " Jester agreed , cheered by any spark of humannessin his new-found friend . " The end tables are genuine antique as you can see . The plant was a birthday gift for Zippo . " Sherman did not point out the red lamp with ragged fringes , two obviously broken chairs and other pieces of sad-looking furniture . " I would n't have anything to happen to this apt " ( he said the abbreviation ) . " You have n't seen the rest of the apt . . . just gorgeous . " Sherman 's voice was proud . " When I 'm alone here at night I do n't hardly open the door . " " Why ? " ? " Afraid I might be mugged and the muggers would haul off Zippo 's furniture . " He added , in a voice that almost broke with self-pride , " You see , I 'm Zippo 's house guest . " Until six months ago he had said he boarded with Zippo , then he heard the phrase " house guest " which enchanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed to the rest of the apt , " Sherman said with the air of a host . " Look at the kitchenette , " he said ecstatically , " see the most modern conveniences . " Reverentlyp72he opened the door of the refrigerator for Jester . " The bottom compartment is for crispies . . . crisp celery , carrots , lettuce , etc . " Sherman opened the door to the compartment , but there was only a head of wilted lettuce there . " We keep caviar in this section , " he said emptily . Sherman gestured to the other parts of the magical box . Jester saw only a dish of cold black-eyed peas jelled in their own grease , but Sherman said , " Last Christmas we had champagne iced in this compartment . " Jester , who seldom opened his own well-stocked refrigerator , was mystified . " You must eat caviar and drink loads of champagne at your grandpapa 's house , " Sherman said . " No , I never tasted caviar , nor champagne either . " " Never drank Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor eaten caviar . . . personally , I just guzzle it , " Sherman said , having tasted caviar once , and having wondered silently why it was supposed to be so high-class . " And look , " he said with enthusiasm , " a genuine electric beater . . . plugs in here . " Sherman plugged in the beater and it began to beat furiously . " A Christmas gift for Zippo Mullins from yours truly . I bought it on credit . I have the best credit record in town and can buy anything . " Jester was bored standing in the cramped dingy kitchenette , and Sherman soon sensed it , but his pride was undaunted ; so they went into the bedroom . Sherman indicated a trunk against the wall . " This is the trunk , " he said superfluously , " where we keep our valuables . " Then he added , " I should n't have told you that . " jester was naturally offended by that last remark , but he said nothing . In the room there were twin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spread appreciatively and said , " Pure rayon silk . " There were portraits over each ' of thep73beds , one of an elderly colored woman , the other of a dark young girl . " Zippo 's mother and sister . " Sherman was still stroking the bedspread and the Negro-colored hand against the rose gave Jester an inexplicable creepy thrill . But he dared not touch the silk , and he felt that if his own hand would touch the outspread one he would feel a shock like an electric eel , so carefully he placed both his own hands against the headboardof the bed . " Zippo 's sister is a nice-looking girl , " Jester remarked , as he felt that Sherman was expecting some comment about his friend 's relatives . " Jester Clane , " Sherman said , and though his voice was hard , Jester felt again the creepy thrill from the simple calling of his name , " if you ever , ever , " Sherman continued in a voice that lashed at Jester , " if you ever , ever have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll string you up by your heels , tie your hands , light fire to your face and stand there and watch you roast . " The sudden fury of the attack made Jester hold on tight to the headboard . " I only said . . . " " Shuddup , shuddup , " Sherman shouted . He added in a low hard voice , " When you looked at the picture I did n't like the look on your puss . " " What look ? " asked Jester , baffled . " You showed me the picture and I looked at it . What else could I have done ? Cry ? " . " Any further wisecrack and I will string you up and make the slowest barbecue that anybody ever made , smothering up the flames so it will last and keep on lasting . " " I do n't see why you talk so ugly , especially to somebody you just met . " " When it 's a question of Cinderella Mullins ' virtue , I talk how I please . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean ? " " Any further personal questions and I 'll have you fried in Atlanta . " " How silly , " Jester said . " How could you ? It 's a matter of legality . " Both boys were impressed by that last phrase , but Sherman only muttered , " I 'll turn the juice personally and set it for very slow . " " I think all this talk about electrocution and roasting people is childish . " Jester paused to deliver a stinging blow . " In fact , I suspect it 's because you have a limited vocabulary . " Sherman was properly stung . " Limited vocabulary , " he shouted with a little quiver of rage . Then he paused for a long time before he asked , belligerently , " What does the word stygian ' mean ? " After Jester thought for a while he had to admit , " I do n't know . " " ... and epizootical and pathologinical , " Sherman went on , making up phony words like crazy . " Is n't pathologinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherman said , " I just made it up . " " Made it up , " Jester said , shocked . " It 's utterly unfair to make up words when you are testing another person 's vocab-ulary . " " Anyway , " Sherman concluded , " you have a very limited and putrid vocabulary . " Jester was left in the situation of trying to prove his vocabulary ; he tried in vain to make up long fancy words but nothing that made sense occurred to him . " Forchrissake , " Sherman said , " less change the subject . You wish me to sweeten your Calvert 's ? " " Sweeten it ? "  | " Yes , goofy . " Jester sipped his whiskey and choked on it . " It 's kind of bitter and hot ... " " When I said sweeten it , did your dim mind suppose I was going to put sugar in this Calvert 's whiskey ? I wonder more and more if you come from Mars . " That was another remark Jester thought he would use later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove his vocabulary . " You are certainly fortunate , " he added . " You mean about Zippo 's apt ? " " No , I was just thinking . . . ruminating you might say .. . about how fortunate it is when you know what it is you 're going to do in life . If I had a voice like yours I would never have to worry about that particular headache any more . Whether you know it or not , you have a golden voice , where I do n't have any talent . . . ca n't sing or dance and the only thing I can draw is a Christmas tree . " " There are other things , " Sherman said in a superior voice , as Jester 's praise had been sweet to hear. " ... not too good at math , so nuclear physics are out . " " I suppose you could do construction work . " " I suppose so , " Jester said dolefully . Then he added in a suddenly cheerful voice : " Anyway , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just an advocation . I think every person ought to learn to fly . " " I utterly disagree with you , " said Sherman , who was afraid of heights . " Suppose your baby was dying , like say one of those blue babies you read about in the paper , and you have to fly to see him before the end , or suppose your crippled mother was sick and wanted to see you before she died ; besides , flying 's fun and I look on it as a kind of moral obligation that everyoneought to learn to fly . "  | " I utterly disagree with you , " said Sherman , who was sick about talking about something he could n't do . " Anyway , " Jester went on , " what was that song you were singing this evening ? " " This evening I was singing just plain jazz , but earlier this afternoon I was practicing genuine Simon-pure German lieder . " " What 's that ? " " I knew you would ask me that . " Sherman 's ego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goofy , means song in German and German means German , like in English . " Softly he began to play and sing and the new strange music throbbed in Jester 's body and he trembled . " In German , " Sherman boasted . " They tell me I do n't have a trace of accent in German , " he lied . " What does it mean in English ? " " It 's a kind of love song . This youth is singing to his maiden . . . goes something like this : The two blue eyes of my beloved , I 've never seen anything like them . ' " " Your eyes are blue . It sounds like a love song to yourself ; in fact , when I know the words of the song it makes me feel creepy . " " German lieder is creepy music . That 's why I specialize in it . " " What other music do you like ? Personally , I adore music , passionately , I mean . Last winter I learned the Winter Wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sherman said , unwilling to share his musical laurels with another . " Do you think I would sit here and tell you a lie about the Winter Wind ' etude ? " said Jester who never lied under any circumstances . " How would I know ? " answered Sherman who was one of the world 's worst liars.  | " I 'm out of practice . " As Jester went to the piano Sherman watched intently , hoping Jester could n't play . Loudly and furiously the " Winter Wind " etude thundered into the room . When , after the first few bars , Jester 's furiouslyplaying fingers faltered , he stopped . " Once you get off the track of the Winter Wind ' it 's hard to get back on . " Sherman , who had been listening jealously , was relieved when the music stopped . Furiously Jester attacked the etude at the beginning . " Stop it , " Sherman shouted , but Jester played on , the music punctured frantically with Sherman 's shouted protests . " Well that 's pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . " However , you do n't have tone . " " Did n't I tell you I could play it ? " " There are all kinds of ways of playing music . Personally , I do n't like yours . " " I know it 's just an advocation , but I enjoy it . " " That 's your privilege . " " I like the way you play jazz better than the way you play German lieder , " Jester said . " When I was a youth , " Sherman said , " for a while I played in this band . We had hot sessions . The leader was Bix Beiderbecke and he tooted a golden horn . " " Bix Beiderbecke , why , that impossible . " Sherman lamely tried to correct his lie . " No , his name was Rix Heiderhorn . Anyway , I really wanted to sing Tristan at the Metropolitan Opera House but the role is not adaptable to me . In fact , most of the roles of the Metropolitan are severely limited for people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can think of offhand is the role of Othello who was a Negro Moor . I like the music all right , but on the other hand , I do n't dig his feeling . How anybody can be that jealous over a white dame is beyond me . I would think about Desdemona .. .  |p78me  . . . Desdemona . . . me . . . ? No , I ca n't dig it . " He began to sing , " 0 ! now , for ever farewell the tranquil mind . " " It must give you a funny feeling , not to know who your mother was . " " No it do n't , " said Sherman , who had spent all his childhoodtrying to find his mother . He would pick out one woman after another who had a gentle touch and a soft voice . Is this my mother ? he would think in wordless expectancy that ended always in sorrow . " Once you get accustomed to it , it do n't bother you at all . " He said this because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved very much Mrs. Stevens , but she told me outright I was n't her son . " " Who is Mrs. Stevens ? " " A lady I was boarded out with five years . It was Mr. Stevens who boogered me . " " What does that mean ? " " Sexually assaulted , goofy . I was sexually assaulted when I was eleven years old . " Jester was speechless until he finally said , " I did n't know anybody ever sexually assaulted a boy . " " Well they do , and I was . " Jester , who always had been subject to propulsive vomiting , suddenly began to vomit . Sherman cried , " Oh , Zippo 's Wilton rug , " and took off his shirt to scrub the rug . " Get towels in the kitchen , " he said to Jester who was still vomiting , " or get out of this house . " Jester , still vomiting , stumbled out . Jester sat on the porch until he stopped vomiting , then he came back to help Shermanclean up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him feel sickish again . " I was just wondering , " he said , " since you do n't know who your mother is , and since you have a voice like yours , if your mother would n't be Marian Anderson ? "  |p79For  the first time Sherman , who soaked up compliments like a sponge because he had had so few , was truly impressed . In all of his search for his mother he had never thought about Marian Anderson . " Toscanini said she had a voice like once in a century . " Sherman , who felt it was almost too good to be true , wanted to think about it alone , and as a matter of fact , hug the idea to himself . Sherman changed the subject abruptly . " When I was boogered by Mr. Stevens "  --  Jester turned white and swallowed  --  " I could n't tell nobody . Mrs. Stevens asked why I was always hitting Mr. Stevens . I could n't tell her . It 's the kind of thing you ca n't tell a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jester said , " I do n't see how you can even bear to talk about it . " " Well , it happened , and I was just eleven years old . " " What a queer thing to do , " Jester said , who was still wipingthe iron alligator . " I 'll borrow a vacuum tomorrow and vacuum this rug , " Sherman said , who was still concerned about the furniture . He flung a towel at Jester : " If you feel anything like that is coming on again , kindly use this . . . Since I was stammering and always hitting Mr. Stevens , Reverend Wilson talked to me one day . At first he would not believe me , as Mr. Stevens was a deacon in the church and as I had made up so many things . " " What other things ? " " Lies I would tell people about my mother . " The thought of Marian Anderson returned to him and he wanted Jester to go home so he could brood about it . " When are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still feeling sorry for Sherman , did not want to take the hint . " Have you ever heard Marian Anderson singp80Were You There When They Crucified My Lord ' ? " he asked . " Spirituals , that 's another item that makes me blow a fuse . " " It occurs to me your fuses blow awfully easy . " " What 's that to you ? " " I was just commenting how I love Were You There When They Crucified My Lord ' sung by Marian Anderson . I practicallycry every time I hear it . " " Well , cry ahead . That 's your privilege . " " ... in fact , most spirituals make me cry . " " Me , I would n't waste my time and trouble . However , Marian Anderson sings a creepy species of German lieder . " " I cry when she sings spirituals . " " Cry ahead . " " I do n't understand your point of view . " Spirituals had always offended Sherman . First , they made him cry and make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , he had always lashed out that it was nigger music , but how could he say that if Marian Anderson was his true mother ? " What made you think up Marian Anderson ? " Since that worry-wart Jester would n't take the hint and go home to let him daydream in peace , he wanted to talk about her . " On account of your voices . Two golden , once-in-a-century voices are quite a coincidence . " " Well , why did she abandon me ? I read somewhere where she loves her own old mother , " he added cynically , unable to give up his marvelous dream . " She might have fallen in love , passionately , I mean , with this white prince , " Jester said , carried away with the story . " Jester Clane , " Sherman 's voice was mild but firm , " never say white ' just out like that . " " Why ? " ?  | " Say Caucasian , otherwise you would refer to my race as colored or even Negro , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded and swallowed. " ... otherwise you might hurt people 's feelings , and you 're such a tenderhearted sissy , I know you would n't like that . " " I resent you calling me a tenderhearted sissy , " Jester protested . " Well , you are one . " " How do you know ? " " Little Bo-Peep told me so . " Jester 's admiration for this remark was not lessened because he had heard it before . " Even if she had fallen for this Caucasian , I wonder why she left me in a church pew at the Holy Ascension Church in Milan , Georgia , of all places . " Jester , who had no way of sensing the anxious , fallow search which had lasted all Sherman 's childhood , was worried that a random suggestion on his part could have been blown up to such certainty . Jester said conscientiously , " Maybe she was n't exactly Marian Anderson ; if it was , she must have considered herself wedded to her career . Still it would be a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andersonas the least bit crummy . In fact , I adore her . Passionately , I mean . " " Why are you always using the word passionately ' ? " Jester , who had been drunk all evening and for the first time with passion , could not answer . For the passion of first youth is lightly sown but strong . It can spring into instant being by a song heard in the night , a voice , the sight of a stranger . Passion makes you daydream , destroys concentration on arithmetic , and at the time you most yearn to be witty , makes you feel like a fool . In early youth , love at first sight , that epitome of passion , turns you into a zombie so that youp82do n't realize if you 're sitting up or lying down and you ca n't remember what you have just eaten to save your life . Jester , who was just learning about passion , was very much afraid . He had never been intoxicated and never wanted to be . A boy who made A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B 's in geometry and chemistry , he daydreamed only when he was in bed and would not let himself daydream in the morning after the alarm clock went off , although sometimes he would have dearly liked to . Such a person is naturally afraid of love at first sight . Jester felt that if he touched Shermanit would lead to a mortal sin , but what the sin was , he did n't know . He was just careful not to touch him and watched him with the zombie eyes of passion . Suddenly Sherman began to pound on middle C , over and over . " What 's that ? " asked Jester , " just middle C ? " " How many vibrations are there in the treble ? " " What kind of vibrations are you talking about ? " " The teeny infinitesimal sounds that vibrate when you strike middle C or any other note . " " I did n't know that . " " Well , I 'm telling you . " Again Sherman pounded middle C , first with the right forefinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you hear in the bass ? " " Nothing , " Jester said . " There are sixty-four vibrations in the treble and another sixty-four in the bass , " Sherman said , magnificently unaware of his own ignorance . " What of it ? " " I 'm just telling you I hear every teeniest vibration in the whole diatonic scale from here , " Sherman struck the lowest bass note , " to here , " the highest treble note was sounded.  | " Why are you telling me all this ? Are you a piano tuner ? " " As a matter of fact , I used to be , smarty . But I 'm not talking about pianos . " " Well , what the hell are you talking about ? " " About my race and how I register every single vibration that happens to those of my race . I call it my black book . " " Black book ? . . . I see , you are talking of the piano as a sort of symbol , " Jester said , delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated Sherman , who had read the word but never used it , " yeah man , that 's right . . . when I was fourteen years old a crowd of us got in a rage against the Aunt Jemima signs , so we suddenly decided to tear them off . We scraped and chiseled away to get the sign off . Upshot . . . cops caught us in the middle and all four of the gang was sent to jail , sentenced to two years on the road for destroying public property . I was n't caught because I was just a lookout , but what happenedis in my black book . One guy died from overwork , anothercame back a living zombie . Have you heard of the Nigerians and that quarry in Atlanta , who broke their legs with hammers so they would n't be worked to death ? One of them was one that was caught on the Aunt Jemima signs . " " I read that in the paper and it made me sick , but is that the solemn truth , was he one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't say he was a Golden Nigerian , I just said he was somebody I knew , and that 's what I mean by vibrations . I vibrate with every injustice that is done to my race . Vibrate ... vibrate . . . and vibrate , see ? " " I would too , if I were of your race . " " No you would n't ... tenderhearted , chicken , sissy . " " I resent that . " " Well resent . . . resent . . . resent . When are you going home ? "  | " You do n't want me ? " " No . For the last time , no . . . no . . . NO . " He added lowly in a venomous voice , " You fatuous , fair , redheaded boy . Fatuous , " Sherman said , using a word that had been hurled at him by a brainy vocabulary-wise boy . Jester automatically ran his hand down his rib cage . " I 'm not a bit fat . " " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since you have such a putrid and limited vocabulary , that means fool . . . fool .. . fool . " Jester held up his hand as though warding off a blow as he backed out of the door . " Oh , sticks and stones , " he screamed as he ran away . He ran all the way to Reba 's house and when he reached the door he rapped with the firm rap of anger . The inside of the house was not like he had expected . It was an ordinary house , and a whore-lady asked him , " How old arc you boy ? " and Jester , who never lied , said desperately , " Twenty-one . " " What would you like to drink ? " " Thanks a million , but nothing , nothing at all , I 'm on the wagon tonight . " It was so easy he did not tremble when the whore-lady showed him upstairs , nor did he tremble when he lay in bed with a woman with orange hair and gold in her teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark face and blue flickering eyes , he was able to become a man . Meanwhile , Sherman Pew was writing a letter in ice-cold sober black ink ; the letter started , " Dear Madame Anderson . "  |p85ALTHOUGH  the Judge was up the night before until far past his bedtime and had spent a restless night , he awakened at four in the morning as usual . After sloshing in the bathtub so mightily that he waked his grandson , who was also having a restless night , he dried himself , dressed slowly , using mainly the right hand because of his infirmity . . . he could not managethe shoestrings so he left them flopping . . . and bathed , dressed and in command of himself , he tiptoed down to the kitchen . It promised to be a fair day ; the gray of the dawn sky was changing to the rose and yellow of sunrise . Although the kitchen was still gray , the Judge did not turn on the light , as he liked to look at the sky at this hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the coffee and began preparinghis breakfast . He selected the two brownest eggs inp86the icebox as he had convinced himself that brown eggs were more nourishing than the white ones . After months of practice , with many a gooey slip , he had learned to crack an egg and slip it carefully into the poacher . While the eggs were poaching he buttered his bread lightly and put it in the oven as he disliked toaster toast . Finally , he put a yellow cloth on the breakfast table and blue salt and pepper shakers . Althoughit was a solitary meal , the Judge did not want it to be a dismal one . The breakfast finished , he carried it item by item to the table , using only the good hand . Meanwhile the coffee was perking merrily . As a final touch he brought mayonnaisefrom the refrigerator and put a careful dollop on each poached egg . The mayonnaise was made of mineral oil and had , thank God , few calories . The Judge had found a wonderfulbook , Diet Without Despair , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was laxative and it behoovedyou to be careful not to eat too much for fear of sudden bathroom accidents , bathroom accidents which he knew were unbecoming to a magistrate . . . especially if it occurred in the courthouse office as it had two times . Being sensitive to his own dignity , the Judge was careful to ration the helpings of the delicious , low-calorie mayonnaise . The small yellow tablecloth and others of the same size which he used and cherished , having them carefully hand laundered , were the ones that had been used on his wife 's breakfast trays that he had brought up to her every morning . The robin's-egg blue salt and pepper set had been hers too , as well as the silver coffeepot the Judge now used for his own breakfast . In the old days when he became , little by little , an early riser , he would make his own breakfast , then lovingly prepare his wife 's tray , often stopping to go out into the garden and pick some posies to decorate the tray . Then he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wifep87was sleeping he would awaken her with kisses , as he was loath to start the day without her gentle voice and encouraging smile before he left for the office . ( Except when she became ill he did not waken her ; but he could not start out on his day until he saw her , which meant that sometimes toward the end he did not get to the office until afternoon . ) But surrounded by his wife 's possessions , his grief subduedby the years , the Judge seldom thought consciously of Miss Missy , especially at breakfast time . He just used her things and sometimes would stare at the blue salt and pepper set with the stun of grief in his eyes . Anxiety always put a keen edge on the Judge 's appetite , and he was especially hungry this morning . When his grandson had come in at nearly one the night before , he had gone straight to bed , and when the Judge had followed , the boy had said in a cold , angry voice , almost shouting : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bother me . Why ca n't I ever be left in peace ? " The explosion was so loud and suddenthat quietly , almost humbly , the Judge went away in his bare , pink feet and his dimity nightshirt . Even when he heard Jester sobbing in the night he was too timid to go in to him . So for these due and good reasons the Judge was ravenous this morning . He ate the whites of his eggs first . . . the least delicious part of his breakfast . . . then he carefully mashed upthe peppered and mayonnaised yolks and spread them delicatelyon his toast . He ate with careful relish , his maimed hand curved lovingly around the rationed food as though to defend it from some possible aggressor . His eggs and toast finished , he turned now to the coffee which he had carefully decanted into his wife 's silver pot . He loaded the coffee with saccharine , blew on it to cool it somewhat , and sipped it slowly , very slowly . After the first cup , he prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven and the sky was ap88pale tender blue that precedes a fair bright day . Lovingly , the judge alternated his attention between his coffee and his first cigar . When he had that little seizure and Doe Tatum took him off cigars and whiskey , the Judge had been worried to death at first . He slipped around smoking in the bathroom , drinking in the pantry . He argued with Doc , and then came the irony of Doc 's death . . . a confirmed teetotaler who never smoked and only enjoyed a chew on rare occasions . Although the Judge was overwhelmed by grief and an inconsolable mourner at the wake , when the shock of death was over , the Judge felt a secret , such a secret relief that he was almost unaware of what had happened and never acknowledged it . But within a month after Doc 's death he was smoking cigars in public and drinking openly as before , but prudently he cut down to seven cigars a day and a pint of bourbon . Breakfast over , the old Judge was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the kitchen shelf and commenced to read studiously , hungrily . It almost comforted him to know that anchovies , large-sized , were only twenty calories and a stalk of asparagus only five , and that a mediumsizedapple was a hundred . But though this knowledge almost comforted him , he was not quite soothed , for what he wanted was more toast , dripping with butter and spread with the homemade blackberry jam that Verily had made . He could see in his mind 's eye the delicately browned toast and feel in his mouth the sweet , grainy blackberries . Although he had no intention of digging his grave with his teeth , the anxiety that had sharpened his appetite had at the same time weakenedhis will ; stealthily he was limping to the breadbox when a low growl in his stomach made him stop , his hand outstretchedtoward the breadbox , and start toward the bathroom which had been put in for him after the little seizure . ' He veered on his way to pick up Diet Without Despair in case there should be any waiting. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his good hand and sat gingerly on the stool ; then when he was sure of himself , his great buttocks relaxed and he settled . There was not long to wait ; he had only time to read the recipe for lemon crustless pie ( only ninety-six calories when made with sucaryl ) thinking with satisfaction that he would have Verily make the dish for lunch that noon . He was also satisfied when he felt his bowels open noiselessly , and thinking of " mens sana in corpore nano , " he smiled a little . When the odor in the bathroom rose , he was not annoyed by this ; on the contrary , since he was pleased by anything that belonged to him , and his feces were no exception , the smell rather soothed him . So he sat there , relaxed and meditative , pleased with himself . When he heard a noise in the kitchen , he wiped himself hastily and put himself right before leaving the bathroom . His heart , suddenly light and volatile as a boy 's , had expectedJester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reached the kitchen no one was there . He could just hear Verily doing her Monday morning cleaning in the front part of the house . A little cheated ( he could have stayed longer in the bathroom ) he looked at the sky which now had the blaze of full morning , the blue unbroken by a cloud , and he smelled from the open window the fresh , faint smell of summerflowers . The old Judge regretted the fact that the routine of breakfast and bowels was over because there was nothing to do now but wait for the Milan Courier . Since waiting is as tedious in old age as it is in childhood , he found his kitchen spectacles ( he had spectacles in the library , the bedroom , aside from his pair at the courthouse ) and began to read the Ladies ' Home Journal . Not to read , really , but to look at the pictures . There , for instance , was a marvelous picture of a chocolate cake , and on the following page a mouth-watering picture of a coconut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge scrutinized wistfully . Then , as though ashamed for his greed , he reminded himself of the truth that , quite aside from the pictures , the Ladies ' Home Journal was a very superior magazine . ( Far , far superior to that dreadful Saturday Evening Post whose good-for-nothing editors had never read the story he had once sent them . ) There were serious articles about pregnancy and childbirth which he enjoyed , also sound essays on child rearing which the Judge knew were sound because of his own experience . Also articles on marriage and divorce which might well have benefited him as a magistrate if his mind had not been occupied by the plans of a great statesman . Finally , in the Ladies ' Home Journal there were little extra lines , blocked and inserted in the stories  --  sayings of Emerson , of Lin Yutang , and the great sages of the world . Several months ago he had read in these bylines the words : " How can the dead be truly dead when they are still walking in my heart ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not forget it . He had seen in his mind 's eye a barefooted , bronzed Indianwalking silently in the forest and heard the silent sound of a canoe . He never cried about his wife 's death , never even cried about the diet any more . When his nervous system and tear ducts made him cry , he thought of his brother Beau , and Beau was like a lightning rod that could ground and safely conduct his tears . Beau was two years older than he was and had died when he was eighteen years old . As a young boy , Fox Clane had worshiped his brother , yea , worshiped the ground he walked on . Beau acted , could recite , was the president of the Milan Players Club . Beau could have been anything . Then one night he had come in with a sore throat . The next morning he was delirious . It was an infected throat , and Beau was muttering , " I am dying , Egypt , dying , ebbs the crimson lifetide fast . " Then he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p91I  feel like the morning star ; I feel , I feel , I feel like the morning star . Shoo , fly , do n't bother me ; shoo , fly , do n't bother me . " At the end Beau had begun to laugh although it was n't laughter . The young Fox had shuddered so violently that his mother had sent him to the back room . It was a bare bleak room that was a sickroom playroom where the children had their measles , mumps and childhood diseases , and where they were free to roughhouse when they were well . The judge rememberedan old forgotten rocking horse , and a sixteen-yearoldboy had put his arms around the wooden horse and cried  --  and even as an eighty-five-year-old man he could cry whenever he wanted to , just thinking about that early sorrow . The Indian walking silently in the forest and the silent sound of the canoe . " How can the dead be truly dead when they are still walking in my heart ? " jester came clattering down the stairs . He opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Verily came to the kitchen and began to prepare jester 's breakfast . " I want three eggs this morning , " Jester said . " Hey , Grand-father . " " Are you all right today , Son ? " " Natch . " The Judge did not mention the crying in the night and neither did Jester . The judge even restrained himself from asking where Jester had been the night before . But when Jester 's breakfast was served , his will broke and he took a golden brown piece of toast , added more butter and spread it with blackberry jam . The forbidden extra toast broke his will even further so that he asked , " Where were you last night ? " well knowing as he spoke he should n't have asked the question . " Whether you realize it or not , I 'm a grown man now ,  |p92Jester  said in a voice that squeaked a little , " and there 's such a thing called sex . " The Judge , who was prudish about such topics , was relieved when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently , not knowing what to say . " Grandfather , have you ever read the Kinsey Report ? " The old Judge had read the book with salacious pleasure , first substituting for the jacket the dust cover of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . " It 's just tomfoolery and filth . " " It 's a scientific survey . " " Science , my foot . I have been an observer of human sin and nature for close on to ninety years , and I never saw anything like that . " " Maybe you ought to put on your glasses . " " How dare you sass me , John Jester Clane . " " Close to ninety years old , " the Judge repeated , for now he was a little coquettish about his advancing age , " I 've observedhuman sin as a magistrate and human nature as a man with natural curiosity . " " A bold invaluable scientific survey , " said Jester , quoting from a review . " Pornographic filth . " " A scientific survey of the sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an impotent , dirty old man , " said the old Judge who had relished the book as he marveled behind the covers of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , which he had never read but kept in his law office library for show . " It proves that boys my age have sexual affairs , boys even younger , but at my age it 's a necessity  --  if they 're passionate I mean . " Jester had read the book in the lending library and it had shocked him . He had read the report a second time and worried terribly . He was afraid , so terribly afraid , that hep93was not normal and the fear corkscrewed within him . No matter how many times he circled Reba 's house , he had never felt the normal sexual urge and his heart quaked with fear for himself , as more than anything else he yearned to be exactly like everyone else . He had read the words " jewel-eyed harlot " which had a beautiful sound that tingled his senses ; but the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spring afternoon were not " jewel-eyed " but only dull and baggy , and yearning to lust and be normal he could only see the gooey lipstick and the vacant smile . And the orangehairedlady he had slept with last night was not a bit " jeweleyed . " Secretly Jester thought sex was a fake , but this morning , now that he had become a man , he felt cocksure and free . " That 's all very well , " the Judge said , " but in my youth we went to church and attended B.Y.P.U. meetings and had a raring good time . We went courting and dancing . Believe it or not , Son , in those days I was one of the best dancers in Flowering Branch , limber as a willow and the very soul of grace . The waltz was fashionable those days . We danced to Tales of the Vienna Woods , " The Merry Widow , ' Tales of Hoffman ' . . . " The old , fat Judge broke off to wave his hands in waltz time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lovely night , oh , lo-o-vely night . " " You 're not a bit introverted , " Jester said when his grandfather had put down his waving hands and stopped that croaking singing . The Judge , who had felt this as a criticism , said , " Son , everybody has a right to sing . Every mortal has the right to sing . Lovely night , oh , lo-o-vely night . "  |p94That  was all the beautiful tune he could remember . " I danced like a willow and sang like an angel . " " Possibly . " " No possibly about it . In my youth I was as light and radiant as you and your father until the layers of corpulence began to hold me down , but I danced and sang and had a raring good time . I never moped around reading dirty books on the sly . " " That 's what I say . You 're not a born introvert . " Jester added , " Anyway I did n't read the Kinsey Report on the sly . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why ? " " Because I am not only the leading citizen in Milan but the most responsible one . I am responsible that innocent eyes are not offended nor the calm heart troubled by such a book . " " The more I listen to you the more I wonder if you came from Mars . " " Mars ? " The old Judge was bewildered and Jester let it go . " If you were more introverted you could understand me better . " " Why are you so hipped on that word ? " Jester , who had read the word and never spoken it , deeply regretted he had not used it the night before . " Lovely night , oh , lov-ely night . " Not being introverted , his grandfather had never wondered if he himself was normal or not . It had never entered his singingand dancing mind if he was normal or queer . If it turned out he was homosexual like men in the Kinsey Report , Jester had vowed that he would kill himself . No , his grandfather was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had used the word the night before . Extrovert ,  |p95that  was the opposite word . . . while he was an introvert . And Sherman ? Anyhow , he would use both words . " I could have written that book myself . " " You ? " " Why certainly . The truth is , Jester , I could have been a great , great writer if I had put my mind to it . " " You ? " " Do n't sit there saying , You ? You ? ' like an imbecile , Son . All you have to have to be a great writer is application , imagination , and a gift for language . " " You have imagination all right , Grandfather . " The Judge was thinking of Gone With the Wind which he could have written easily . He would n't have let Bonnie die and he would have changed Rhett Butler ; he would have written a better book . He could have written Forever Amber with his left foot . . . a much better book , more refined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw through that Becky as slick as a whistle . He could have written Tolstoy , for although he had not actually read the books , he had seen them in the picture shows . And Shakespeare ? He had read Shakespeareat law school and even seen Hamlet in Atlanta . An English cast , speaking with English accents , naturally . It was the first year of their marriage and Miss Missy had worn her pearls and her first wedding rings . After three performancesof the Atlanta Shakespeare Festival , Miss Missy had enjoyed it so much and was so impressed that she picked up an English accent which lasted a month after they had come home to Milan . But could he have made up " To be or not to be " ? Sometimes when he considered the question he thought so , and sometimes he thought not ; for after all , even a genius ca n't do everything and Shakespeare had never been a congressman . " There have been learned arguments about the authorshipp96of Shakespeare . It was argued that an illiterate strolling player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Ben Jonson who wrote the plays . I know darn well I could have written Drink to me only with thine eyes , and I will drink with mine . ' I 'm sure I could have done that . " " Oh , you can do wonders and eat rotten cucumbers , " Jester muttered . " What 's that ? " " Nothing . " " ... and if Ben Jonson wrote Drink to me only with thine eyes ' and wrote Shakespeare too , then . . . " After a great leap of the imagination , the Judge pondered . " You mean you are comparing yourself to Shakespeare ? " " Well , maybe not the Bard himself , but after all Ben Jonson was a mortal too . " Immortality , that was what the Judge was concerned with . It was inconceivable to him that he would actually die . He would live to a hundred years if he kept to his diet and controlled himself . . . deeply he regretted the extra toast . He did n't want to limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a South American Indian in the newspaper who lived to be a hundred and fifty . . . and would a hundred and fifty years be enough ? No . It was immortality he wanted . Immortality like Shakespeare , and if " push came to shovel , " even like Ben Jonson . In any case he wanted no ashes and dust for Fox Clane . " I always knew you were the biggest egotist in the round world , but in my wildest dreams it never occurred to me you could compare yourself to Shakespeare or Ben Jonson . " " I was not comparing myself to the Bard himself ; in fact , I have the proper humility . Anyway , I never set out to be a writer and you ca n't be everything . " Jester , who had been cruelly hurt the night before , was cruel to his grandfather , deliberately ignoring the fact that hep97was old . " Yes , the more I hear you , the more I wonder if you come from Mars . " Jester got up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grandson . " Mars , " he repeated , " you mean you think I 'm off on another planet ? " His voice was suddenly high , almost shrill . " Well , let me tell you this , John Jester Clane , I 'm not off on another planet , I 'm right here on this earth where I belong and want to be . I 'm rooted in the very center of the earth . I may not be immortal yet , but you wait and see , my name will be synonymous with George Washington or Abraham Lincoln . . . more beloved than Lincoln 's , for I am the one who will redress the wrongs in my country . " " Oh , the Confederate money . . . I 'm off now . " " Wait , Son , this colored boy is coming today and I thought you would screen him with me . " " I know about that , " Jester said . He did not want to be there when Sherman arrived . " He 's a responsible boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me with my diet , give me my injections , open my mail , and be my general amanuensis . He will be a comfort to me . " " If that Sherman Pew is a comfort to you , just let me know . " " He will read to me . . . an educated boy . . . immortal poetry . " His voice was suddenly shrill . " Not dirty trash like that book I banned at the public library . I had to ban it becauseas a responsible man I 'm determined that things in this town and state are going to be in order , and this country too , and the world if I can accomplish it . " Jester slammed out of the house . Although he had not set the alarm clock and could very well have daydreamed for a long time before getting out ofp99bed , the spring of energy and life stirred violently that morning . The golden summer was with him and he was still free . When he slammed out of the house , Jester did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was summer vacation and he was not going to any fire . He could stop to look at the world , he could imagine , he could look with summer vacation freedom at the border of verbena that lined the drive . He even stooped down and examined a vivid flower and joy was with him . Jester was dressed in his best clothes that morning , wearing a white duck suit and even a coat . He just wished his beard would get a hump on and grow so he could shave . But suppose he never grew a beard , what would people think of him ? For a moment the vacation joy darkened until he thought of something else . He had dressed fit to kill because he knew that Sherman was coming , and he had slammed out of the house because he did not want to meet Sherman that way . Last evening he had not been the least bit witty or sparkling ; in fact , he had just goofed off , and he did not want to meet Sherman until he could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning he did n't know , but he would talk about introverts and extroverts . . . where that would lead him , he wondered . In spite of the fact that Sherman utterly disagreed with him about his theories of flight and was unimpressedabout Jester 's flying , he walked automatically to J. T. Malone 's pharmacy and stood at the corner waiting for the bus that went to the airport . Happy , confident , free , he lifted his arms and flapped them for a moment . J. T. Malone , who saw that gesture through the window of the pharmacy , wondered if , after all , the boy was dotty . Jester was trying to be witty and sparkling and he thought that being alone in the airplane would help him in this . It was the sixth time that he had soloed . A great part of hisp99mind was taken up with the instruments . In the blue , windrushingair his spirits lifted , but witty and sparkling in his conversation . . . he did n't know . Of course it would depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have to hinge the conversation and he just dearly hoped that he would be witty and sparkling . It was an open Moth Jester was flying and the wind pulled his red hair backward from his scalp . He deliberately had not worn a helmet because he liked the sensation of wind and sun . He would put on the helmet when he went to the house and met Sherman there . Careless he would be , and busy , a helmeted aviator . After a half an hour of wind-rushing cobalt and sun , he began to think of landing . Zooming carefully , circling to get just the proper distance , he had no room in his thoughts for Sherman even , because he was responsible for his own life and for the training Moth . The landing was bumpy , but when he put on his helmet and jumped out with careful grace he wished somebody could have seen him . The bus ride back from the airport always made him feel squashed , and the old bus itself was plodding and terribly restrictedcompared to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was convinced that every adult had the moral obligation to fly , no matter what Sherman Pew 's convictions were about this matter . He left the bus at the corner of J. T. Malone 's drugstore which was in the center of town . He looked at the town . On the next block was the Wedwell Spinning Mill . From the open basement window the heat from the dye vats made wavy lines in the sweltering air . Just to stretch his legs , he strolled around the business section of town . Pedestrians stayed close to the awnings and it was the time of late morningwhen their shadows cast on the glittering sidewalk were blunt and dwarfed . His unaccustomed coat made him veryp100hot as he walked through town , waving to people he knew and blushing with surprise and pride when Hamilton Breedlove of the First National Bank tipped his hat at him  --  very likely because of the coat . Jester circled back to Malone 's drugstore thinking of a cherry coke with cool crushed ice . On the corner , near where he had waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shade of the awning with his cap on the sidewalk next to him . Wagon , a light-colored Negro who had lost both legs in a sawmill accident , was toted every day by Grown Boy and transported in the wagon where he would beg before awninged stores . Then when the stores closed , Grown Boy would wheel him back home in the wagon . When jester dropped a nickel in the cap , he noticed that quite a few coins were there , and even a fifty-cent piece . The fiftycentpiece was a decoy coin Wagon always used in hope of further generosity . " How you do today , Uncle ? " " Just tollable . " Grown Boy , who often showed up at dinnertime , was standing there just watching . Wagon today had fried chicken instead of his usual side-meat sandwich . He ate the chicken with the lingering delicate grace with which colored people eat chicken . Grown Boy asked , " Why don you gim me a piece of chicken ? " although he had already eaten dinner . " Go on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I ain payin no min to you . " " Or a nickel for a cone ? " " Go on , nigger . You come before me like a gnat . " So it would go on , jester knew . The hulking , dimwitted colored boy begging from the beggar . Tipped panama hats , the separate fountains for white and colored people in the courthouse square , the trough and hitching post for mules ,  |p101muslin  and white linen and raggedy overalls . Milan . Milan . Milan . As jester turned into the dim , fan-smelling drugstore , he faced Mr. Malone who stood behind the fountain in his shirtsleeves . " May I have a coke , sir ? " Fancy and overpolite the boy was , and Malone remembered the dotty way he flapped his arms when he was waiting for the airport bus . While Mr. Malone made up the Coca-Cola , Jester moseyed over to the scales and stood on them . " Those scales do n't work , " Mr. Malone said . " Excuse me , " Jester said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that , and was n't it a dotty thing to say , apologizing because the pharmacy scales did n't work . Dotty for sure . Milan . Some people were content to live and die in Milan with only brief visits to relatives and so forth in Flowering Branch , Goat Rock , or other smaller towns near by . Some people were content to live their mortal lives and die and be buried in Milan . Jester Clane was not one of those . Maybe a minority of one , but a definitely not one . Jester pranced with irritation as he waited and Malone watched him . The coke was frosty-beaded on the counter and Malone said , " Here you are . " " Thank you , sir . " When Malone went to the compounding room , Jester sipped his icy coke , still brooding about Milan . It was the broiling season when everybody wore shirtsleeves except dyed-in-the-wool sticklers who put on their coats when they went to lunch in the Cricket Tea Room or the New York Cafe . His Coca-Cola still in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few moments would be forever branded in his brain . They were kaleidoscopic , nightmare moments , toop102swift and violent to be fully understood at the time . Later Jester knew he was responsible for the murder and the knowledge of that fact brought further responsibility . Those were the moments when impulse and innocence were tarnished , the moments which end the end , and which , many months later , were to save him from another murder  --  in truth , to save his very soul . Meanwhile Jester , Coca-Cola in hand , was watching the flame-blue sky and the burning noonday sun . The noon whistle blew from the Wedwell Mill . The millworkers straggledout for lunch . " The emotional scum of the earth , " his grandfather had called them , although he had a great hunk of Wedwell Spinning Mill stock which had gone up very satisfactorily . Wages had increased , so that instead of bringinglunch pails the hands could afford to eat at luncheonettes . As a child , Jester had feared and abhorred " factory tags , " appalledby the squalor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't like those blue-denimed , tobacco-chewing mill hands . Meanwhile , Wagon had only two pieces of fried chicken left . . . the neck and the back . With loving delicacy he started on the neck which has as many stringy bones as a banjo and is just as sweet . " Just a teeny bit , " Grown Boy begged . He was looking yearningly at the back and his rusty black hand reached towardit a little . Wagon swallowed quickly and spat on the back to insure it for himself . The phlegmy spit on the crusty brown chicken angered Grown . As Jester watched him , he saw the dark , covetous eyes fix on the change in the begging cap . A sudden warning made him cry , " Do n't , do n't , " but his stifled warning was lost by the clanging of the town clock striking twelve . There were the scrambled sensations of glare and brassy gongs and the resonance of the static midday ; then it happened so instantly , so violently , that Jester couldp103not take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begging cap and ran . " Git him . Git him , " Wagon screamed , histing himself on his sawed-off legs with the leather " shoes " to protect them , and jumping from leg to leg in helpless fury . Meantime Jesterwas chasing Grown . And the hands from the mill , seeing a white-coated white man running after a nigger , joined in the chase . The cop on Twelfth and Broad saw the commotion and hastened to the scene . When Jester caught Grown Boy by the collar and was struggling to seize the money from Grown 's fist , more than half a dozen people had joined in the fray , although none of them knew what it was about . " Git the nigger . Git the nigger bastard . " The cop parted the melee with the use of his billy stick and finally cracked Grown Boy on the head as he struggled in terror . Few heard the blow , but Grown Boy limpened instantlyand fell . The crowd made way and watched . There was only a thin trickle of blood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The greedy , lively , wanting boy who had never had his share of sense lay on the Milan sidewalk . . . forever stilled . Jester threw himself on the black boy . " Grown ? " he pleaded . " He 's dead , " somebody in the crowd said . " Dead ? " " Yes , " said the cop after some minutes . " Break it up you all . " And doing his duty , he went to the telephone booth at the pharmacy and called an ambulance , although he had seen that look of death . When he came back to the scene , the crowd had drifted back closer to the awning and only Jester remainednear the body . " Is he really dead ? " Jester asked , and he touched the face that was still warm . " Do n't touch him , " the cop said.  |p104The  cop questioned Jester about what had happened and took out his notebook and paper . Jester began a dazed account . His head felt light like a gas balloon . The ambulance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white coat leaped out and put his stethoscope on Grown Boy 's chest . " Dead ? " the cop asked . " As a doornail , " the intern said . " Are you sure ? " Jester asked . The intern looked at Jester and noticed his panama hat that had been knocked off . " Is this your hat ? " Jester took the hat , which was grimy now . The white-coated interns carried the body to the ambulance . It was all so callous and swift and dreamlike that Jester turned slowly toward the drugstore , his hand on his head . The cop followed him . Wagon , who was still eating his spat-on back , said , " What happened ? " " Du n no , " said the cop . Jester felt lightheaded . Could it be possible he was going to faint ? " I feel funny . " The cop , glad to be doing something , steered him to a chair in the pharmacy and said , " Sit down here and hold your head between your legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his head he sat up , although he was very pale . " It was all my fault . If I had n't been chasing him and those people piling in on top of us , " he turned to the cop , " and why did you hit him so hard ? " " When you are breaking up a crowd with a billy stick youdo n't know how hard you are hitting . I do n't like violence any tl more than you do . Maybe I should n't even have joined the force . "  |p105Meantime  Malone had called the old Judge to come and get his grandson and Jester was crying with shock . When Sherman Pew drove up to bring him home , Jester , who was not thinking about impressing Sherman any more , was led to the car while the cop tried to explain what had happened . After listening , Sherman only commented , " Well , Grown Boy has always been just a feeb , and in my case , if I was just a feeb , I 'd be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people 's places . " " I do wish you would shut up , " Jester said . At the judge 's household there were tears and disorder when they arrived . Verily was sobbing for her nephew and the Judge patted her with awkward little pats . She was sent home to her own people to mourn over that sudden noonday death . Before the news came , the Judge had had a happy fruitful morning . He had been working joyfully ; there had been none of the idle tedium that day , that endlessness of time that is as hard to bear in old age as it is in early childhood . Sherman Pew was panning out to his utmost expectations . Not only was he an intelligent colored boy who understood about insulin and the needles as soon as he was told and sworn to secrecy , he also had imagination , talked of diet and substitutions for calories , and so forth . When the Judge had impressed on him that diabetes was not catching , Sherman had said : " I know all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weigh his food on a teensy little balancing scale . Every morsel of food . " The Judge , who suddenly recalled that Sherman was a foundling , wondered a second about this information but said nothing . " I know all about calories too , sir , on account of I am a house guest of Zippo Mullins and his sister went on a diet . I whipped the fluffy mashed potatoes with skimmed milk forp106her and made sucaryl jello . Yessireebob , I know all about diets . " " Do you think you would make me a good amanuensis ? " " A good what , Judge ? " " An amanuensis is a kind of secretary . " " Oh , a super-dooper secretary , " Sherman said , his voice soft with enchantment . " I would adore that . " " Harrumph , " said the Judge , to hide his pleasure . " I have quite a voluminous correspondence , serious , profound correspondenceand little niggling letters . " " I adore writing letters and write a lovely hand . " " Penmanship is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Where are the letters , sir ? " " In my steel file in my office at the courthouse . " " You want me to get them ? " " No , " the Judge said hastily , as he had answered every letter ; indeed , that was his chief occupation when he went in the morning to his office  --  that and the perusal of the Flowering Branch Ledger and the Milan Courier . Last week there had come a day when not a letter of moment had been received  --  only an advertisement for Kare Free Kaniping Equipment which was probably meant for Jester anyway . Cheated that there were no letters of moment , the Judge had answered the ad , posing trenchant questions about sleeping bags and the quality of frying pans . The static tedium of old age had troubled him so often . But not today ; this morning with Sherman he was on a high horse , his head literally teeming with plans . " Last night I wrote a letter that lasted to the wee hours , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " Sherman thought over the letter which he had posted on the way to work . At first the address had puzzledp107him , then he addressed it to : " Madame Marian Anderson , The steps of the Lincoln Memorial . " If she was n't right there , they would forward it . Mother . . . Mother . . . he was thinking , you are too famous to miss . " My beloved wife always said I wrote the most precious love letters in the world . " " I do n't waste time writing love letters . This long letter I wrote last night was a finding letter . " " Letter writing is an art in itself . " " What kind of letter do you wish me to write today ? " Sherman added , timidly , " Not a love letter , I presume . " " Of course not , silly . It 's a letter concerning my grandson . A letter of petition , you might say . " " Petition ? " " I am asking an old friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point . " " I see . " " I have to draft it carefully in my mind beforehand . They are the most delicate letters of all . . . petition letters . " The Judge closed his eyes and placed his thumb and forefinger over his eyelids , thinking profoundly . It was a gesture almost of pain , but that morning the Judge had no pain at all ; on the contrary , after the years of boredom and endless blank time , the utter joy of having important letters to compose and a genuine amanuensis at his disposal made the Judge as buoyantas a boy again . He sat furrowed and immobile so long that Sherman was concerned . " Head hurt ? " The Judge jerked and straightened himself . " Mercy no , I was just composing the structure of the letter . Thinking to whom I 'm writing and the various circumstances of his present and past life . I 'm just thinking of the individual I 'm writing to . " " Who is he ? "  | " Senator Thomas of Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pen in the inkwell three times and straightened the paper very carefully , thrilled at the thought of writing to a senator . " My Dear Friend and Colleague , Tip Thomas . " Again Sherman dipped the pen in ink and began to write with a flourish . " Yes , sir ? " " Be quiet , I 'm thinking . . . Proceed now . " Sherman was writing that when the Judge stopped him . " You do n't write that . Start again . When I say proceed ' and things like that , do n't actually write them . " " I was just taking dictation . " " But , by God , use common sense . " " I am using common sense , but when you dictate words I naturally write them . " " Let 's start at the very beginning . The salutation reads : My Dear Friend and Colleague , Tip Thomas . Get that ? " " I should n't write the get that , should I ? " " Of course not . " The Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first supposed , and Sherman was wondering privately if the old man was nuts . So both regarded each other with mutual suspicions of mental inadequacy . The work went badly at first . " Do n't write this in the letter . I just want to level with you personally . " " Well , level personally . " " The art of a true amanuensis is to write down everything in the letter or document , but not to record personal reflections or , in other words , things that go on in my mind that are more or less extraneous to the said letter . The trouble with me , boy , is my mind works too quick and so many randomp109thoughts come into it that are not pertinent to any particular train of thought . " " I understand , sir , " said Sherman , who was thinking that the job was not what he had imagined . " Not many people understand me , " the Judge said simply . " You mean you want me to read your mind about what to write in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read my mind , " the judge said indignantly , " but to gather from my intonations which is personal rumination and which is not . " " I 'm a wonderful mind reader . " " You mean you are intuitive ? Why so am I. " Sherman did not know what the word meant , but he was thinking that if he stayed on with the old Judge he would pick up a grand vocabulary . " Back to the letter , " the judge said sternly . " Write after the salutation , It has recently come to my attention that .. The Judge broke off and continued in a lower voice which Sherman , who was reading the Judge 's mind , did not write down . " How recently is recently , boy ? One  --  two  --  three years ? I guess it happened ten years ago . " " I would n't say recently in that case . " " You are quite correct , " the judge decided in a firm voice . " Start the letter on a completely different tack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's noon . " " Yea , " said Sherman , pen in hand and waiting . " At noon I interrupt my endeavors to have the first toddy of the day . The privilege of an old man . " " Do you wish me to prepare it for you ? " " That would be most kindly , boy . Would you like a little bourbon and branch water ? " " Bourbon and branch water ? "  | " I 'm not a solitary drinker . I do n't like to drink alone . " Indeed , in the old days he used to call in the yardman , Verily , or anyone else to drink with him . Since Verily did not drink and the yardman was dead , the Judge was many times forced to drink alone , but he did n't like it . " A little toddy to keep me company . " This was the delightful part of the job that Sherman had n't thought about . He said , " I 'd be very pleased , sir . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half , and do n't drown it . " Sherman bustled to the kitchen to make the drinks . He was already worrying about dinner . If they had the drink together and became friends , he would hate to be sent to the kitchen to have dinner with the cook . He knew it would happen , but he would hate it . He rehearsed carefully what he would say . " I never eat dinner , " or " I ate such a hearty breakfast I 'm not hungry . " He poured the half and halfs , both of them , and returned to the library . After the Judge had sipped his drink once and smacked his lips , he said , " This is ex cathedral . " " What ? " Sherman said . " That 's what the Pope says when he 's speaking frankly . I mean that nothing that I say to you now while we 're drinking is in the letter . My friend Tip Thomas took to himself a helpmeet ... or is it helpmate . I mean by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule I do n't approve of second marriages , but when I think about it I just think , Live and let live . ' You understand , boy ? " " No , sir . Not exactly , sir . " " I wonder if I should overlook the second marriage and talk about his first wife . Talk in praise about his first wife and not mention the second . " " Why mention either one of them ? "  |p111The  Judge leaned his head back . " The art of letter writing is like this ; you first make gracious personal remarks about health and wives and so forth , and then when that 's covered , you come plumb to the subject of what the letter is really about . " The Judge drank blissfully . As he drank a little miracle was happening . When the telephone rang , the Judge could not understand all at once . J. T. Malone was talking to him , but what he was saying seemed to make no sense . " Grown Boy killed in a street fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . " I 'll send somebody to get Jester at the drugstore . " He turned to Sherman . " Sherman , will you go drive to Mr. Malone 's drugstore and pick up my grandson ? " Sherman , who had never driven a car in his life , agreed with pleasure . He had watched people drive and thought he knew how it went . The Judge put down his drink and went to the kitchen . " Verily , " he started , " I have some serious news for you . " After one look at the old Judge 's face , Verily said , " Somebodydaid ? " When the Judge did not answer she said , " Sister Bula ? " When the Judge told her it was Grown Boy , she flung her apron over her head and sobbed loudly . " And in all these years he never had his share of sense . " She told this as though it was the most poignant and explicable truth about the unreasonablefact that was shattering her . The Judge tried to comfort her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finished his drink and the drink that Sherman had left unfinished and then went to the front porch to wait for jester . Then he realized the little miracle that had happened . Every morning for fifteen years he had waited so tediously for the delivery of the Milan Courier , waiting in the kitchen or inp112the library , his heart leaping up when he heard that little plop . But today , after all these years , his time was so occupied he had not even thought about the paper . Joyfully , the old Judge limped down the steps to pick up the Milan Courier.  |p113SINCE  livingness is made up of countless daily miracles , most of which are unnoticed , Malone , in that season of sadness , noticed a little miracle and was astonished . Each morning that summer he had waked up with an amorphous dread . What was the awful thing that was going to happen to him ? What was it ? When ? Where ? When consciousness finally formed , it was so merciless that he could lie still no longer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , roaming without purpose , just roaming , waiting . Waiting for what ? After his conversation with the Judge , he had filled the freezing compartmentof the refrigerator with calf liver and beef liver . So morning after morning , while the electric light fought with the dawn , he fried a slice of the terrible liver . He had always loathed liver , even the Sunday chicken liver that the childrenp114squabbled over . After it was cooked , smelling up the whole house like a stink bomb , Malone ate it , every loathsome bite . Just the fact that it was so loathsome comforted him a little . He swallowed even the gristly pieces that other people removed from their mouths and put on the sides of their plates . Castor oil also had a nasty taste , and it was effective . The trouble with Dr. Hayden , he had never suggested any cures , nasty or otherwise , for that . . . leukemia . Name a man a fatal disease and not recommend the faintest cure . . . Malone 's whole being was outraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had listened to and prescribed for trillions of complaints : constipation , kidney trouble , smuts in the eye , and so forth . It he honestly felt the case was beyond him he would tell the customer to consult a doctor , but that was not often ... Malone felt he was as good as any bona fide M.D. in Milan , and he prescribed for trillions of complaints . A good patient himself , dosing himself with nasty Sal Hepatica , using Sloan 's Liniment when needed , Malone would eat every living bite of the loathsome liver . Then he would wait in the brightly lighted kitchen . Waiting for what ? And when ? One morning toward the end of summer , Malone was wakening and fought against wakening . He struggled for the soft , sweet limbo of sleep , but he could not recapture it . The shrill birds were already up and at him , slicing to shreds his soft , sweet sleep . That morning he was exhausted . The terror of consciousness washed over his tired body and limpened spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of counting sheep  --  black sheep , white sheep , red sheep all hippity-hoppity and with plumping tails . Think of nothingness , oh , soft sweet sleep . He would not get up and turn on lights and roam the hall and kitchen , and roam and wait and dread . He would never fry that loathsome liver at dawn , smelling up the whole house like a stink bomb . Never nop115longer . Never no more . Malone switched on the bedside lamp and opened the drawer . There were the Tuinal capsules he had prescribed for himself . There were forty of them , he knew . His trembling fingers slid amongst the red and green capsules . Forty of them , he knew . He would no longer have to get up at dawn and roam the house in terror . No longer go to the pharmacy just because he had always gone to the pharmacy as it was his living and the support of his wife and family . If J. T. Malone was not the sole support , because of those shares of Coca-Cola stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the three houses she had inherited from her mother  --  dear old Mrs. Greenlove who had died fifteen years ago  --  if because of his wife 's various resources he was not the utter and sole provider , the pharmacy was the mainstay of the family and he was a good provider , no matter what people might think . The pharmacy was the first store open in Milan and the last to close . Standing faithfully , listening to complaints , prescribing medicine , making cokes and sundaes , compounding prescriptions . . . no more , no more ! Why had he done it so long ? Like a plodding old mule going round and round a sorghum mill . And going home every night . And sleeping in bed with his wife whom he had long since ceased to love . Why ? Because there was no fitting place to be except the pharmacy ? Because there was no other fitting place to sleep except in bed beside his wife ? Working at the pharmacy , sleeping with his wife , no more ! His drab livingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malone put one capsule in his mouth and drank half a glass of water . How much water would he have to drink to swallow the forty capsules ? After the first capsule he swallowed another , then a third . Then he stopped and refilled the water glass . When he camep116back to bed again he wanted a cigarette . As he smoked it he grew drowsy . While he was smoking his second cigarette it fell from between his lifeless fingers for J. T. Malone at last had gone to sleep again . He slept until seven that morning and the household was awake when he went into the busy kitchen . For one of the few times in his life he failed to bathe and shave , for fear of being late at the pharmacy . That morning he saw with his eyes the little miracle , but he was too swivetty and occupied to take it in . He took the short cut through the back yard and back gate , the miracle was there but his eyes were blind as he loped toward the gate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been hurryingso ; no one was there . But already he had begun his day . He let down the awnings with a slam and turned on the electric fan . When the first customer entered his day had begun , although the first customer was only Herman Klein , the jeweler next door . Herman Klein was always in and out of the drugstore all day long , drinking Coca-Colas . He also kept a bottle of liquor in the compounding room of the pharmacy , as his wife hated liquor and did not allow it in the home . So Herman Klein spent the whole day at his shop doing his watchwork and visiting the drugstore frequently . Herman Klein did not go home for noonday dinner as did most Milan businessmen ; he had a little snifter , then ate one of the neatly wrapped chicken sandwiches that Mrs. Malone supplied . After Herman Klein had been attended to , a flurry of customers came in all at once . A mother came in with a bed-wetting child , and Malone sold her a Eurotone , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet . He had sold Eurotones to many parents , but privately he wondered why the ring of the bell would really be effective . Privately he wondered if it might not scare the be-Jesus out of a sleepingp117child , and what good would it do if the whole house was alarmed just because little Johnny made some quiet little peepeein his sleep ? He thought privately it would be better to let Johnny just pee in peace . Malone advised the mothers sagely : " I 've sold a lot of these devices but the main thing I 've always felt about toilet training is the cooperation of the child . " Malone scrutinized the child , a squarish little girl who did not look at all cooperative . He fitted a woman who had varicose veins with a surgical stocking . He listened to complaintsof headaches , backaches and bowel trouble . He studied each customer carefully , made his diagnosis and sold the medicines . Nobody had leukemia , nobody went away empty handed . By one o'clock when that wife-ridden , hag-ridden , little Herman Klein came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also meditating . He wondered who else in the world was worse off than he was . He looked at that little Herman Klein munching his sandwich at the counter . Malone loathed him . Loathed him for being so spineless , for working so hard , for not going to the Cricket Tea Room or the New York Cafe like other decent businessmen who did not go home for dinner . He did not feel sorry for Herman Klein . He just despised him . I-le put on his coat to go home to dinner . It was a sweltering day , with a sky like white lightning . He walked slowly this time , feeling the weight of his white linen coat or a weight somehow on his shoulders . He always took his time and had a home-cooked dinner . Not like that mousy little Herman Klein . He went through the back-yard gate and then , though he was tired , he recognized the miracle . The vegetable garden , which he had sown so carelessly and forgotten in that long season of fear , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frills of carrots , the green , green turnip greens andp118tomatoes . He stood looking at the garden . Meanwhile , a crowd of children had entered the open gate . They were the Lank brood . It was a curious thing about the Lanks . They had one multiple birth after the other . Twins . Triplets . They rented one of his wife 's houses that she had inherited  --  a crummy , beatup house , as you would expect with all those hoards of children . Sammy Lank was a foreman at the Wedwell Spinning Mill . When at times he was laid off , Malone did not press him for the rent . Malone 's house , which Martha had also inherited from old Mrs. Greenlove , God bless her , was the corner house facing a very respectable street . The other three houses which adjoined each other were around the corner , and the neighborhood there was running down . The Lank family house was the last house , that is , the last house in the row of three that Mrs. Malone had inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sniffly-nosed , they just hung around since there was nothing at home to do . One especially cold winter when Mrs. Lank was confined with twins , Malone had sent some coal to their house because he was fond of children and knew they were cold . The children were called Nip and Tuck , Cyrily and Simon , and Rosemary , Rosamond , and Rosa . The children now were growing up . The eldest triplets , who were already married and having babies on their own , were born the night the Dionne quints were born and the Milan Courier had had a little article about " Our Milan Trio " which the Lanks framed and put in their sitting room . Malone looked again at the garden . " Sugar , " he called . " Yes , Hon , " Mrs. Malone answered . " Have you seen the vegetable garden ? " Malone went into the house . " What vegetable garden ? " Mrs. Malone asked . " Why , our vegetable garden . "  | " Of course I 've seen it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's the matter with you ? " Malone , who had no appetite these days and never remembered what he ate , said nothing , but it was indeed a miracle that that garden , planted so carelessly and never tended , had flourished . The collards were growing like crazy as collards will do . Plant a collard in the garden and they just grow like crazy , pushing out the other plants . The same as morningglories. . . a collard or a morning-glory . There was little conversation at the noonday dinner . They had meat loaf and double-trouble potatoes , but although the meal was well cooked , Malone did not taste it . " I 've been telling you all summer that the vegetables were home grown , " Mrs. Malone said . Malone heard the remark but paid no attention , let alone replied ; for years his wife 's voice had been like a sawmill to him , a sound you hear but pay no attention to . Young Ellen and Tommy bolted their dinner and were about to run . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intestinal trouble lies in wait for you . When I was a girl they had what they called the Fletcher cure , you were supposedto chew seven times before you actually swallowed . If you continue to eat like firehorses . . . " But already the Malone children had said " Excuse me , " and had run from the house . From then on the dinner was a silent one , and neither voiced their thoughts . Mrs. Malone was thinking about her " Mrs. Malone Sandwiches " ... plump kosher chickens ( it did not matter if the fowls were Jewish ) , the A &; P hens she prodded carefully , midget turkeys , twenty-pound turkeys . She labeled the turkey sandwiches " Mrs. Malone 's Turkey Salad Sandwich , " although it was an amazing thing how manyp120people could not taste the difference between turkey salad and chicken salad . Meanwhile , Malone was occupied with his own professional considerations ; should he have sold the Eurotonethis morning ? It had slipped his mind that a few months ago a woman had complained about the Eurotone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the bells of the Eurotone , but the family had waked up and stood around watching the quietly peeing and sound asleep little Eustis , while the Eurotone bells were ringing like mad . Finally , it seemed , the daddy had yanked the child out of the wet bed and warmed his behind in front of the whole family . Was that fair ? Malone pondered the subject and decided it was definitely not fair . He had never laid a hand on his children , whether they deserved it or not . Mrs. Malone disciplined the children , as Malone felt it was the wife 's duty , and she always cried when it was her clear duty to spank one of the children . The only time Malone felt impelled to act in such a manner was the time the four-year-old Ellen built a secret fire under her grandmother 's bed . How old Mrs. Greenlove had cried , both for her own terror and for the fact that her favorite grandchild was being chastised . But playing with fire was the only misbehavior that Malone dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust to a tenderhearted mother who invariably cried as she chastised . Yes , forbidden matches and fires were the only things he had to handle . And the Eurotone ? Althoughit was a recommended product , he regretted having sold it that morning . With a painful , final swallow that made his Adam 's apple struggle in his frail throat , Malone excused himself and rose from the table . " I 'm going to call Mr. Harris to take over the pharmacy for the balance of the day . " Anxiety flickered across Mrs. Malone 's placid face . " Are n't you feeling well , Hon ? "  |p121Rage  made Malone fist his hands until the knuckles whitened . A man with leukemia not feeling well ? What the hell did the woman think he had . . . chicken pox or spring fever ? But although his fisted knuckles were white with rage , he only said , " I feel no better nor no worse than I deserve . " " You work too hard , Hon. Altogether too hard . You 're a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A mule going round and round a cane mill . " " LT. , do n't you want me to put you in a tub of nice , tepid water ? " " I certainly do not want it . " " Do n't be mulish , Hon. I 'm just trying to comfort you . " " I can be mulish as I please in my own house , " Malone said stubbornly . " I was just trying to comfort you , but I see it 's no use . " " No use at all , " he answered bitterly . Malone took a steaming shower , washed his hair , shaved , and darkened the bedroom . But he was too angry to rest . From the kitchen he could hear Mrs. Malone beating batter for a wedding cake or something , and this made him still angrier . He went out into the glaring afternoon . He had lost the summer that year ; the vegetables had grown and been eaten unnoticed . The hard blaze of summer shriveled his spirit . The judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milan summer would not cure . Thinking of the old Judge , he went to the back porch and found a paper sack . Although he was free for the afternoon , there was no sense of freedom in him . Wearily he began to pick a mess of greens for the Judge , both turnip greens and collards . Then he added the largest tomato and stood for a moment weighing it in his hand.  | " Hon , " Mrs. Malone called from the kitchen window , " what are you doing ? " " What ? What ? " " What are you doing just standing there in the heat of the afternoon ? " Things had come to a pretty pass when a man has to account for himself for just standing alone in his own back yard . But though his thoughts were brutal he only answered , " Picking greens . " " You ought to have a hat on if you are going to linger longin this broiling sun . Might save you a sunstroke , Hon. " Malone 's face paled as he shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't swear , J.T. , for mercy 's sake . " So Malone stayed longer in the broiling heat , just because his wife had questioned and interfered . Then , hatless , and carrying the sack of vegetables , he trudged over to the Judge 's house . The Judge was in the darkened library and the nigger with the blue eyes was with him . " High-ho , J.T. , high-ho , my hearty . You 're just the man I was looking for . " " What for ? " For Malone was both pleased and taken aback by this hearty reception . " This is the hour for immortal poetry . My amanuensis reads to me . " " Your what ? " Malone asked sharply , as the word suggested to him Eurotone and bed-wetting . " My secretary here . Sherman Pew . He is an excellent reader , and the reading hour is one of the pleasantest portions of the day . Today we 're reading Longfellow . Read on , MacDuff , " the Judge said jovially . " What ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Shakespeare ? " Sherman felt out of his element , left outp123and cloddish . I-le hated Mr. Malone for coming in at the poetry hour . Why was n't that old sourpuss at the drugstore where he belonged ? " Go back to : By the shore of Gitche Gurnee , By the shining Big-Sea-Water , At the doorway of his wigwam ... " The Judge 's eyes were closed and his head gently wagged with the rhythm . " Proceed , Sherman . " " I do n't want to , " said Sherman sullenly . Why should he make a monkey of himself in front of that fuss-body Mr. Malone ? He 'd be damned if he would . The Judge felt something amiable was going amiss . " Well , just recite , I shot an and listened to the scene , his sack of greens still in his lap . The Judge , feeling that something very amiable was going amiss , and craving to finish the lovely poem , continued himself : " Daughter of the moon , Nakomis Dark behind it rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat the waterBeat the clear and sunny waterBeat the shining big sea water .. . My eyes are tired in this darkened room . Ca n't you take over , Sherman ? " " No , sir . " " Ewa yea , my little owletWho is this that lights the wigwamWith his great eyes lights the wigwam .. .  |p124Oh  the tenderness , the rhythm and tenderness of this . Why ca n't you feel it , Sherman ? You always read immortal poetry so beautifully . " Sherman scrooched up his behind and did not comment . Malone , still with the sack of greens in his lap , felt the tension in the room . It was apparent that this sort of thing went on every day . He wondered who was crazy . The old Judge ? The nigger with the blue eyes ? Himself ? Longfellow ? He said with careful tact , " I brought you a mess of turnip greens from my garden , and a mess of collards . " With arrogant rudeness Sherman said , " He ca n't eat them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sherman , " he said pleadingly , " I adore turnip greens and collards . " " It 's not on the diet , " Sherman insisted . " They belong to be cooked with side meat , streak of lean and streak of fat . And that 's not on the diet . " " How about just a slither of the lean portion of streak of lean , streak of fat ? " Sherman was still mad that Mr. Malone had come in at the reading hour which he loved , and the sourpuss old drugstore man had looked at the two of them like they were loony and spoiled the immortal poetry hour . However , he had not read Hiawatha aloud . He had not made himself a monkey ; he had left that to the old Judge who did not seem to care if people thought he had just escaped from Milledgeville or not . Malone said soothingly , " Yankees eat greens with butter or vinegar . " " While I 'm certainly no Yankee , I 'll try the greens with vinegar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One snail , " the old Judge added . From the parlor , there was the sound of the piano . Jester was playing the " Lindenbaum . " Sherman was furious because he played it so well.  | " I eat snails all the time . Picked up the habit when I was in France . " " I did n't know you were ever in France , " Malone said . " Why certainly . I had a brief stint in the service . " Zippo Mullins had been in the service , and that was the actual truth , and had told Sherman many stories , most of which Sherman took with a grain of salt . " J.T. , I 'm sure you need some refreshment after your broiling walk . How about some gin and quinine water ? " " That would be most acceptable , sir . " " Sherman , will you make Mr. Malone and me some gin and quinine water ? " " Quinine , Judge ? " His voice was incredulous , for even if that old Mr. Malone was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his day off . The Judge said in a bossy voice , as if to a servant , " It 's in the refrigerator . On the bottle it says tonic . ' " Sherman wondered why he had not said so at first . Tonic water was not the same as quinine . He knew because he had tasted little drinks ever since he had been with the Judge . " Put plenty of ice in it , " the Judge said . Sherman was fit to be tied , not only because the reading hour was spoiled but because he had been ordered around like a servant . He hurried in to take it out on Jester . " Is that Rockabye Baby ' you 're playing ? " " No , it is Lindenbaum ' ; I borrowed it from you . " " Well , it is the utter end in German lieder . " Jester , who had been playing with tears of emotion in his eyes , stopped playing , to Sherman 's content because he had been playing much too well , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fixed the drinks with very little ice . Who was he to be ordered around ? And how was itp126that that puny-faced Jester could play genuine German lieder so well , especially on a sight-reading job ? He had done everything for the old Judge . The afternoon when Grown Boy died , he had cooked supper himself , waiting on the table ; however , he would not eat the supper he had cooked . He would not eat the supper , even at the library table . He had found a cook for them . He had found CinderellaMullins to pinch-hit for them while that Verily was away . Meanwhile , the Judge was telling his friend Malone , " That boy is a veritable treasure , a jewel . Writes letters for me , reads for me , let alone giving me the injections and making me toe the line on my diet . " Malone 's skepticism showed on his face . " How did you happen to run across this paragon ? " " I did n't run across him . He has affected my very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitant even to conjecture about this mysteriousremark . Could it be that the snooty blue-eyed nigger was the Judge 's natural son ? Improbable as it seemed , it could be possible . " But was n't he found in a pew at one of the colored churches ? " " He was . " " But how does this affect your very life ? " " Not only my very life but my life 's blood  --  my ownson . Malone tried to think of Johnny having a sexual relation with a colored girl . The fair-haired , decent Johnny Clane with whom he had many times gone hunting at Sereno . It was highly improbable but again not impossible . The Judge seemed to read his puzzled mind . With his good hand he gripped his stick until the hand turned purple . " If you think for one single moment that my Johnny ever sleptp127with nigger wenches or such immoral doings . . . " The Judge could not finish for rage . " I never supposed any such thing , " Malone said soothingly . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mystery , if ever there was one . But it 's such a bad business that even a garrulous old man like myself can hardly discuss it . " Yet Malone knew he wanted to discuss it further , but at that moment Sherman Pew banged two glasses on the library table . When Sherman bolted out of the room , the Judge continued : " However , now that boy is a golden skein in my old age . Writes my letters with the calligraphy of an angel , gives me my injections and makes me toe the line on the diet . Reads to me in the afternoon . " Malone did not point out that the boy had refused to read that afternoon , so that the old Judge himself had had to finish Longfellow . " Sherman reads Dickens with such pathos . Sometimes I cry and cry . " " Does that boy ever cry ? " " No , but often he smiles at the humorous places . " Malone , puzzled , waited for the Judge to say something more pertinent about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well it only goes to show again that out of this nettle , danger , we pluck this flower , safety . ' " " Why , what 's the matter , sir ? Were you in danger ? " " Not exactly in danger . . . that 's just the expression of the Bard . But since my dear wife 's death I 've been so much alone . " Malone was not only puzzled about the Judge , but suddenly worried . " Alone , sir ? You have your grandson , and you 're the most revered citizen in all Milan . "  | " You can be the most revered citizen in town , or in all the state , and still feel alone . And be alone , by God ! " " But your grandson who is the apple of your eye ? " " It 's the nature of young boys to be selfish . I know boys through and through . The only thing that 's the matter with Jester is . . . adolescence . I have a profound knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . selfish , selfish , selfish . " Malone was pleased to hear Jester criticized , but very properlyhe said nothing . He only asked , " How long have you had the colored boy ? " " About two months . " " That 's a short time for him to be so well established in the household ... so cozily settled , one might say . " " Sherman is cozy , thank God . Although he 's an adolescent like my grandson , we have a quite different relationship . " Malone was thankful to hear this , but again very properly said nothing . Knowing the capriciousness of the Judge , his fits of instant delight and instant disappointment , he wondered how long this situation would last . " A veritable jewel , " the Judge was saying enthusiastically . " A treasure . " Meanwhile , " the veritable jewel " was reading a movie magazine and drinking gin and tonic with loads of ice . He was alone in the kitchen as that old Verily was cleaning upstairs . Although he was replete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a very good article about one of his favorite movie stars . . . he was very , very mad . Not only had his special hour of the day been spoiled by the fusspot Mr. Malone , he had lived for three months in suspense , suspense that little by little grew into anxiety . ' Why had n't Madame Anderson replied to his letter ? If it had been wrongly addressed , it could have been forwarded , for his mother was too famous to miss . When Jester 's dog , Tige , walked into the room , Sherman kicked him.  |p129Verily  came down from upstairs and looked at Sherman reading the magazine , drinking the gin and tonic . She was going to comment about him but the look of the fierce eyes in the dark face silenced her . She only said , " In my day I never sat around reading books and drinking liquor . " Sherman said , " You were probably born a slave , old woman . " " Slave I was not , my grandfather was . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . " Verily began to wash the dishes , turning on the water spigot very loud . Then she said , " If I knew who your mother was I would tell her to switch you to a frazzle . " Sherman went back into the parlor to rile Jester for a while , having nothing else to do . Jester was playing again , and he wished he knew what the name of the music was . Suppose he said something bad about the composer and it was the wrong composer . Was it Chopin , Beethoven , Schubert ? Becausehe did not know he could not trust himself to be insultingand that made him more furious . Suppose he said , " That 's terrible Beethoven you 're playing , " and Jester said , " It 's not Beethoven , it 's Chopin . " Sherman , out of pocket , did not know what to do . Then he heard the front door open and close and knew that that busybody , Mr. Malone , had gone . Having embarrassed himself , he went in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own accord he resumed Longfellow , starting with : " I shot an arrow into the air . " Malone had never felt the heat so much as he had this summer . As he walked he felt the blazing sky , the sun , weigh down his shoulders . An ordinary , practical man who seldom daydreamed , he was daydreaming now that in the autumn he was going to a northern country , to Vermont or Maine where again he would see snow . He was going alone without Mrs.p130Malone . He would ask Mr. Harris to take over the pharmacy and he would stay there for two weeks , or who knows , two months , alone and at peace . He saw in his mind 's eye the polar enchantment of snow and felt the cool of it . He would stay in a hotel by himself , which he had never done before , or would it be a ski resort ? As he thought of snow he felt a freedom , and a guilt gnawed him as he walked , shoulders bent , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , he had had the guilt of freedom . Twelve years ago he had sent his wife and the small Ellen to Tallulah Falls for a cool summer vacation , and while they were gone Malone chanced to meet Malone 's sin . At first he did not think it was a sin at all . It was just a young lady he met at the drugstore . She had come in with a cinder in her eye and very carefully he had removed the cinder with his clean linen handkerchief . He remembered her trembling body and the tears in her black eyes as he held her head to remove the cinder . She left and that night he thought of her , but that seemed to be the end . But it happened they met the next day when he was paying the dry goods bill . She was a clerk in the office . She had said , " You were so sweet to me yesterday . I wonder what I could do for you now ? " He said , " Why , why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had accepted , a little slip of a young thing , working in the dry goods store . They had lunch in the Cricket Tea Room , the most respectable place in town . He talked to her about his family and he never dreamed it would come to anything else . But it did , and at the end of two weeks he had sinned and the awful thing was , he was glad . Singing as he shaved and putting on his finest garments every day . They went to the picture show in town , and he even took her to Atlanta on the bus and took her to the cyclorama . They went to the Henry Grady Hotel for dinner and she ordered caviar . He was strangely happy in this trans/gression , although he knew it was soon to end . It ended in September when his wife and child came back to town , and Lola was very understanding . Maybe a thing like that had happened to her once before . After fifteen years he still dreamed of her although he had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that she had married he was sad , but in another portion of his soul , relieved . Thinking of freedom was like thinking of snow . Surely , in the autumn of that year , he would have Mr. Harris take over the pharmacy and he would take a vacation . He would know again the secret stealth of snow and feel the blessed cold . So Malone walked wearily to his own home . " When you have a vacation like this , Hon , I do n't think it 's a real vacation just to trudge around town , not in this heat . " " I was n't thinking of the heat , although this town in summeris hot as the hinges of hell . " " Well , Ellen 's been trying herself . " " What do you mean ? " Malone said alarmed . " Just trying herself , and crying , crying all afternoon in her bedroom . " Quickly Malone went up to Ellen 's bedroom and Mrs. Malone followed . Ellen was in the bed in her pretty little blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bear to see Ellen cry , for she was his heart . A little tremor came over his tired body . " Baby , baby , what is it ? " Ellen turned her face to him , " Oh , Daddy , I 'm so much in love . " " Well , why does that make my heart-child cry ? " " Because he does n't even know I 'm on the earth . We pass on the street and everywhere and he just waves in a casual way and goes on . " Mrs. Malone said , " That 's all right , darling , one of thesep132days when you are older you will meet Mr. Right and all will end well . " Ellen sobbed more vehemently and Malone hated his wife for it was the silliest thing a mother could say . " Baby , baby , who is it ? " " Jester . I 'm so much in love with Jester . " " Jester Clane ! " Malone thundered . " Yes , Jester . He is so handsome . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clane is not worth one inch of your little finger . " As Ellen still sobbed , he regrettedthat he had toted the turnip greens to the old Judge , although the old Judge was innocent of all this . Trying so much to make amends , he said , " And after all , heart-child , this is only puppy love , thank goodness . " But as he said these words he knew they were just as silly and comfortless as Mrs. Malone 's were . " Darling , in the cool of the afternoon , why do n't we go to the pharmacy and pick up a quart of that ripple-fudge ice cream for supper . " Ellen cried for a while , but later in the afternoon , which was not cool , they went in the family car to the pharmacy and picked up some ripple-fudge ice cream.  |p133J  . T. MALONE was not the only one who was worried about the Judge those months ; Jester had begun to be concerned about his grandfather . Selfish , selfish , selfish as he was , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his grandfather . The judge 's wild enthusiasm for his " amanuensis " just carried him away . It was Sherman this , Sherman that , all day long . His grandfather dictated letters in the morning , then at noon they had a drink together . Then when he and his grandfather had their dinner in the dining room , Sherman made himself a " slight sandwich " and ate it in the library . He had told the Judge that he wanted to think over the morning 's correspondence , that he did n't want to be distracted by conversations with Verily in the kitchen , and that a heavy noon dinner was bad for his work and concentration.  |p134The  Judge had agreed with this arrangement , pleased that his correspondence was pondered so seriously , pleased as pie about everything these days . He had always spoiled servants , giving them costly , but often very peculiar , gifts for Christmas and birthdays . ( A fancy dress nowhere near the right size or a hat nobody would be caught dead in or brand new shoes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been female churchgoers who never drank , a few had been in a different category . Yet whether they were teetotalers or the drinking kind , the Judge never checked his liquor shelf in the sideboard . Indeed , Paul , the old gardener ( a wizard with roses and border flowers ) , had died of cirrhosis of the liver after gardening and drinking twenty years at the Judge 's . Although Verily knew the Judge was a born spoiler , she was amazed at Sherman Pew and the liberties he took in the Judge 's household . " Wo n't eat in the kitchen because he says he wants to think about letters , " she grumbled . " It 's because he 's too uppity to eat with me in the kitchen as he belongs . Fixing himself party sandwiches and eating in the liberry , if you please ! He 's going to ruin the liberry table . " " How ? " the Judge asked . " Eating them party sandwiches on them trays , " Verily said stubbornly . Although the Judge was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive to the dignity of others . Sherman stifled his sudden rages in the Judge 's presence and took them out on Gus , the new yardman , Verily , and most of all on Jester . But although the actual rage fits were smothered , the anger remained , and indeed increased . For one thing he hated reading Dickens , there were so many orphans in Dickens , and Sherman loathed books about orphans , feeling in them a reflectionon himself . So when the Judge sobbed aloud over orphans , chimney sweeps , stepfathers , and all such horrors ,  |p135Sherman  read in a cold , inflexible voice , and glanced with cool superiority when the old fool acted up . The Judge , obtuseto the feelings of others , noticed none of this and was as pleased as pie . Laughing , drinking , sobbing at Dickens , writingwhole mailsacks of letters , and never an instant bored . Sherman continued to be a jewel , a treasure , and no word could be said against him in the house . Meanwhile , in Sherman'sdour but quailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the middle of autumn his feelings for the Judge were those of veiled but ever present hate . But in spite of the soft , clean , bossy job ; in spite of the fun of riling that soppy , chicken-outing Jester Clane , that autumn was the most miserable one in Sherman 's entire life . Day after day he waited , his very livingness suspended in the blank vacuum of suspense . Day after day he waited for the letter , and day after day , week after week , there was no answer . Then by chance one day he met a musician friend of Zippo Mullins ' who actually knew Marian Anderson , owned a signed photographof her and everything , and from this hideous stranger he learned the truth : Madame Anderson was not his mother . Not only was she wedded to her career and too busy studying to have had the time for love affairs with princes , let alone borning him and leaving him so peculiarly in a church pew , she had never once been to Milan and could not possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that had lifted and made so luminous his searching heart was shattered . Forevermore ? He thought so at that time . That evening he took down his records of German lieder sung by Marian Anderson and stomped on them , stomping with such despair and fury that not a groove of the records remained unshattered . Then , as the hope and the music could not be altogether silenced , he threw himself with his muddy shoes on the fine rayon bedspreadand scraped his body on it as he wailed aloud . Next morning he could not go to work as his fit had leftp136him exhausted and hoarse . But at noon when the Judge sent him a covered tray of fresh vegetable soup with piping hot cornsticks and a lemony dessert , he was sufficiently recovered to eat the food slowly , languidly . . . glad with the feeling-sick feeling and eating the cornsticks with his little finger delicately crooked . He stayed home a week and somebody else 's cookingand the rest restored him . But his smooth , round face hardened and , although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Anderson after a while , he yearned to rob as he had been robbed . The first of that fall was the happiest time Jester had ever known . At first lifted by the wings of song , his passion now had quieted to friendship . Sherman was in his home every day , and the security of constant presence alters passion which is fed by jeopardy and the dread of change , of loss . Sherman was at his house every day and there was no reason to believe it would not go on forever . True , Sherman went out of his way to insult him , which wounded Jester . But as the weeks passed he had learned not to let the wounding remarks be felt too deeply or too long ; indeed , lie was learning to defend himself . Hard as it was for Jester to make up jazzy hurtful remarks , he was learning to do it . Furthermore he was learning to understand Sherman , and understanding which conflicts with the ruthless violence of passion leads to both pity and love . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit relieved ; he did not have to be on his P 's and Q 's every instant and could relax without the fear of having to defend his pride at any moment . Another element of their relationship was Jester 's dim awareness that he was the chosen one ; that he was the one that Sherman used to lash out against when he wanted to lash out against the world . For Jester knew dimly that fury is unleashed more freely against those you are most close to . . . so close that there is the trustp137that anger and ugliness will be forgiven . Jester , himself , would be angry only with his grandfather as a child . . . his fits of head-banging temper were directed only toward his grandfather  --  not Verily , Paul , or anybody else  --  for he knew that his grandfather would forgive and love . So while Sherman'swounding remarks were certainly no blessing , he sensed in them a kind of trust for which he was grateful . He had bought the score of Tristan , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without fear of belittling wisecracks . However , when his grandfather roamed the house like a lost soul and almost could n't eat , Jester was concerned . " I just do n't see what you see in Sherman Pew . " " That boy 's a jewel , a veritable treasure , " the Judge said placidly . His voice changed when he added , " Besides , it 's not a short time I 've known the boy and I feel responsible for him . " " Responsible how ? " " It 's because of me that the boy is an orphan . " " I do n't dig it , " Jester protested . " Do n't talk in riddles . " " It 's too sorry a business to be discussed , especially between you and me . " Jester answered , " Anything I despise is for somebody to tell just half a story , work up a person 's interest and then do n't go on . " " Well , forget it , " his grandfather said . He added with a glib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the truth , " After all , he was the colored caddy who saved my life when I was flailing and drowning in the golf pond . " " That 's just a detail and not the real truth . " " Ask me no questions and I 'll tell you no lies , " the Judge said in a maddening voice . Deprived of the joys and the busyness of Sherman , the Judge wanted to rope in Jester , who was too busy with his ownp138life and school to be roped in . Jester would not read immortalpoetry , or play poker , and even the correspondence did not interest Jester a hoot . So the sadness and tedium returned to the Judge . After the manifold interests and activitiesof those months , solitaire bored him and he had read every speck of all the issues of the Ladies ' Home Journal and McCall 's . " Tell me , " Jester said suddenly , " since you imply you know so much about Sherman Pew , did you ever know his mother ? " " Unfortunately , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who she is . Naturally he wants to know . " " That is a pure case where ignorance is bliss . " " One time you say knowledge is power and another time you say ignorance is bliss . Which side are you on ? Anyway I do n't believe a particle in any of those old saws . " Absentmindedly Jester was tearing up the spongy rubber ball the Judge used to exercise his left hand . " Some people think it 's the act of a weakling . . . to commit suicide . . . and other people think it takes a lot of guts to do it . I still wonderwhy my father did it . And an all-around athlete , graduated with all honors from the University of Georgia , why did he do it ? " " It was just a fleeting depression , " the Judge said , copying J. T. Malone 's words of consolation . " It does n't seem an all-around athlete thing to do . " While his grandfather carefully laid out the cards for a game of solitaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play Tristan , his eyes half closed and his body swaying . He had already inscribed the score : For my dear friend Sherman Pew Ever faithfully , John Jester Clanep139The music gave Jester goose pimples , it was so violent yet shimmering . Nothing pleased Jester more than giving a fine present to Sherman , whom he loved . On the third day of Sherman 's absence Jester picked some mums and autumn leaves fromhis garden and bore them proudly to the lane . He put the flowers in an iced-tea pitcher . He hovered over Sherman as though he was dying , which annoyed Sherman . Sherman lay languidly on the bed and when Jester was arranging the flowers he said in a sassy , languid voice : " Have you ever stopped to consider how much your face resembles a baby 's behind ? " Jester was too shocked to take it in , let alone reply . " Innocent , dopey , the very living image of a baby 's behind . " " I 'm not innocent , " Jester protested . " You certainly are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like all young things , was a great one for gilding the lily . Hidden in his bouquet of flowers was a jar of caviar which he had bought from the A &; P that morning ; now with the violence and insolence of this new attack he did not know what to do with the hidden caviar which Sherman claimed to eat by the ton-fulls . Since his flowers had been set so peculiarly at nought . . . not a word of thanks or even an appreciative look . . . Jester did wonder what to do with the hidden caviar , for he could not stand to be humiliated further . He hid the caviar in his hip pocket . So he had to sit gingerly in a sidewaysposition . Sherman , with pretty flowers in the room which he appreciated but did n't bother to thank jester for or mention , well fed with somebody else 's cooking , and rested , felt well enough to tease Jester . ( Little did he know that he had already teased himself out of a jar of genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf in the frigidaire for many months before serving it to his most distinguished guests. )  | " You look like you have tertiary syphilis , " Sherman said as a starter . " Like what ? " " When you sit wonkensided like that it 's a sure sign of syphilis . " " I 'm just sitting on a jar . " Sherman did not ask why he was sitting on a jar and naturally Jester did not volunteer . Sherman only wisecracked : " Sitting on a jar . . . a slop jar ? " " Do n't be so crude . " " People in France sit like that a lot of times on account of they have syphilis . " " How do you know ? " " Because in my brief stint in the service I was in France . " Jester suspected this was one of Sherman 's lies but said nothing . " When I was in France I fell in love with this French girl . No syphilis or anything like that . Just this beautiful , lily-white French virgin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit long on a jar of caviar . He was always shocked by dirty stories and even the word " virgin " gave him a little thrill ; but shocked or no he was fascinated so he let Sherman go on and he listened . " We were engaged , this lily-white French girl and I. And I knocked her up . Then , like a woman , she wanted to marry me and the wedding was going to take place in this ancient old church called Notre Dame . " " A cathedral , " Jester corrected . " Well , church . . . cathedral . . . or however you call it , that 's where we were going to be married . There were loads of invited guests . French people have families like carloads . I stood outside the church and watched them coming in . Ip141did n't let anybody see me . I just wanted to see the show . This beautiful old cathedral and those French people dressed to kill . Everybody was chick . " " You pronounce the word sheik , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chick too . These carloads of relatives all waiting for me to come in . " " Why did n't you go in ? " Jester asked . " Oh , you innocent dope . Do n't you know I had no intention of marrying that lily-white French virgin ? I just stayed there the whole afternoon watching these dressed up French people who were waiting for me to marry the lilywhiteFrench virgin . She was my feancee ' you understand , and come night they realized I was not going to be there . My feancee ' fainted . The old mother had a heart attack . The old father committed suicide right there in the church . " " Sherman Pew , you 're the biggest liar who ever walked in shoe leather , " Jester said . Sherman , who had been carried away with his story , said nothing . " Why do you lie ? " Jester asked . " It 's not exactly lying , but sometimes I think up situations that could very well be true and tell ' em to baby-ass dopes like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make up stories because the real , actual was either too dull or too hard to take . " " Well , if you pretend to be my friend , why try to make me be a sucker ? " You 're what the original Barnum described . Barnum and Bailey Circus , in case you do n't remember . A sucker is born every minute on this earth . ' " He could not bear to think of Marian Anderson . And he wanted jester to stay but he did not know how to ask him . Sherman had on his best blue rayon pajamas with white piping , so he was glad to get outp142of bed to show them off . " Would you like a little Lord Calvert 's bottled in bond ? " But whiskey and best pajamas were far away from Jester . He was shocked by the dirty story , but he was touched by Sherman'sexplanation of why he lied . " Do n't you know that I 'm one friend you do n't have to lie to ? " But gloom and rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a friend ? " Jester had to ignore this and he only said , " I 'm going home . " " Do n't you want to see the fine food Zippo 's Aunt Carrie sent to me ? " Sherman walked to the kitchen and opened the icebox door . The frigidaire had a faintly sour smell . Sherman admired Aunt Carrie 's fancy food . " It 's a tomato aspic molded ring with cottage cheese in the middle . " Jester looked dubiously at the food and said , " Do you lie to Aunt Carrie , Cinderella Mullins , and Zippo Mullins ? " " No , " Sherman said simply . " They got my number . " " I 've got your number too , and I do wish you would n't lie to me . " " Why ? " " I hate stating obvious facts and the fact why I do n't like you to lie to me is too obvious for me to state . " Jester squatted by the side of the bed and Sherman lay in his best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease . " Have you ever heard the saying that truth is stranger than fiction ? " " Of course I 've heard it . " " When Mr. Stevens did that thing to me it was a few days before Halloween and it was my eleventh birthday . Mrs. Stevens had given me this wonderful birthday party . Many invited guests attended , some wearing party clothes and other people Halloween outfits . It was my first birthday party andp143was I thrilled . There were guests in witches ' costumes and in pirates ' outfits as well as party best clothes they wore to SundaySchool . I started the party wearing my first brand new pair of navy blue long trousers and a new white shirt . The state paid my board , but that did n't include birthday parties nor brand new birthday clothes . When the invited guests brought presents , I minded what Mrs. Stevens said , did n't snatch at the presents but said Thank you ' and opened them very slowly . Mrs. Stevens always said I had beautiful manners and I truly had beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of games . " Sherman 's voice trailed off and finally he said , " It 's a funny thing . " " What 's funny ? " " From the time the party began until in the evening after it was over I do n't remember hardly a single thing . For it was the evening of the fine party that Mr. Stevens boogered me . " In a swift unconscious gesture Jester half raised his right hand as though warding off a blow . " Even after it was done and over and the real Halloween had already gone , I remembered only snitches and snatches of my b-bi-birthday p-party . " " I wish you would n't talk about it . " Sherman waited until his stammer was under control , then went on fluently : " We played all kinds of games , then refreshmentswere served . Ice cream and white iced cake with eleven pink candles . I blew out the candles and cut the birthday cake as Mrs. Stevens said for me to do . But I did n't eat a bite on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the refreshments we played running and hollering games . I had put on a sheet like a ghost and a pirate hat . When Mr. Stevens called out behind the coal house I ran to him quickly , my ghost sheet flying . When he caught mep144I thought he was just playing and I was laughing fit to kill . I was still laughing fit to kill when I realized he was n't playing . Then I was too surprised to know what to do but I quit laughing . " Sherman lay on the pillow as if he were suddenly tired . " However , I have a charmed life , " he continued with a tone of zest that Jester found hard to believe at first . " From then on I never had it so good . Nobody ever had it so good . Mrs. Mullins adopted me . . . not a real adoption , the state still paid for me , but she took me to her bosom . I knew she was n't my mother , but she loved me . She would beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never laid a hand on me . So you see I almost had a mother . And a family too . Aunt Carrie , Mrs. Mullins ' sister , taught me singing . " " Where is Zippo 's mother ? " Jester asked . " Died , " Sherman said bitterly . " Passed on to glory . That 's what broke up the home . When Zippo 's father remarried , neither Zippo or I liked her a bit so we moved out and I 've been Zippo 's house guest ever since . But I did have a mother for a little while , " Sherman said , " I did have a mother even though that cheating creep of a Marian Anderson is not my mother . " " Why do you call her a cheating creep ? " " Because I prefer to . I 've ripped all thought away from her . And stomped on all her records . " Sherman 's voice broke . Jester , who was still squatting by the bed , steadied himself and suddenly kissed Sherman on the cheek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down for balance and slapped Jester , using his whole arm . Jester was not surprised although he had never been slapped before . " I only did that , " he said , " because I felt sorry for you . "  | " Save your peanuts for the zoo . " " I do n't see why we ca n't be serious and sincere , " Jester said . Sherman , who was half out of the bed , slapped him again on the other cheek so hard that Jester sat down on the floor . Sherman 's voice was strangled with rage . " I thought you were a friend and you turn out like Mr. Stevens . " The slap and his own emotions stunned Jester , but quickly he got up , his hands clenched , and billed Sherman straight in the jaw , which surprised Sherman so that he fell on the bed . Sherman muttered , " Sock a fellow when he 's down . " " You were n't down , you were sitting on the bed so 's you could slap me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sherman Pew , but I would n't take that . Besides you slapped me when I was squatting . " So they went on arguing about sitting up and squatting and which was a more sportsmanlike position to slap or to punch somebody . The argument went on so long that they quite forgot the words that had preceded the blows . But when Jester went home he was still thinking : I do n't see why we ca n't be serious and sincere . He opened the caviar , but it smelled like fish which he did n't like . Neither did his grandfather like fish , and Verily just said " Ugh " when she smelled it . The part-time yardman , Gus , who would eat anything , took it home.  |p146IN  NOVEMBER Malone had a remission and was admitted for a second time to the City Hospital . He was glad to be there . Although he had changed doctors , the diagnosis had not changed . He had changed from Dr. Hayden to Dr. Calloway and changed again to Dr. Milton . But though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist and Episcopal churches ) their medical verdict was the same . Having asked Dr. Hayden how long he would live , and having received the unexpected and terrifying answer , he was careful not to ask again . Indeed , when he changed to Dr. Milton , he had insisted he was a well man and just wanted a routine checkup and that one doctor had said that there was just a slight suspicion of leukemia . Dr. Milton confirmed the diagnosisand Malone asked no questions . Dr. Milton suggestedp147that he check in at the City Hospital for a few days . So Malone again watched the bright blood dripping drop by drop , and he was glad because something was being done and the transfusions strengthened him . On Mondays and Thursdays an aide wheeled in some shelves of books and the first book Malone selected was a murder mystery . But the mystery bored him and he could not keep track of the plot . The next time the aide came around with the books , Malone returned the mystery and glanced at the other titles ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hand had reached for the book when the aide said , " Are you sure you want this one ? It does n't sound very cheerful . " Her tone reminded him of his wife so that he immediately became determined and angry . " This is the book I want and I 'm not cheerful and do n't want to be cheerful . " Malone , after reading for a half hour , wondered why he had made such a fuss about the book and dozed for a while . When he awoke he opened the book at random and began to read just to be reading . From the wilderness of print some lines struck his mind so that he was instantly awake . He read the lines again and then again : The greatest danger , that of losing one 's own self , may pass off quietly as if it were nothing ; every other loss , that of an arm , a leg , five dollars , a wife , etc. , is sure to be noticed . If Malone had not had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would n't have reached for the book in the first place . But now the thought chilled him and he began to read the book from the first page . But again the book bored him so that he closed his eyes and thought only of the passage he had memorized . Unable to think of the reality of his own death , he was thrown back into the tedious labyrinth of his life . He had lost himself . . . he realized that surely . But how ? When ?  |p148His  father had been a wholesale druggist from Macon . He had been ambitious for J.T. , his eldest son . Those years of boyhoodwere good for the forty-year-old Malone to dwell on . He had not been lost then . But his father was ambitious for him , too ambitious it seemed later to Malone . He had decided that his son would be a doctor as that had been his own youthful ambition . So the eighteen-year-old Malone matriculatedat Columbia , and in November he saw snow . At that time he bought a pair of ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had had a fine time at Columbia , eating the chow mein he had never tasted before , learning to ice skate , and marveling at the city . He had not realized he had started to fail in his studies until he was already failing . He tried to bone up ... studying until two o'clock on examinationnights . . . but there were so many Jew grinds in the class who ran up the average . Malone finished the first year by the skin of his teeth and rested at home , a bona fide premedical student . When the fall came round again the snow , the ice , the city was not a shock to him . When he failed at the end of his second year at Columbia , he felt himself to be a no-good . His young man 's pride would not let him stay in Macon , so he moved to Milan and got a job as a clerk with Mr. Greenlove , in the Greenlove drugstore . Was it this first humiliation that made him fumble in the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only natural , or seemed natural , when he asked her to a dance . He was dressed up in his best blue suit and she had on a chiffondress . It was an Elk 's Club dance . He had just become an Elk . What had he felt as he touched her body and why had he asked her to the dance ? After the dance he had dated her a number of times because he knew few girls in Milan and her father was his boss . But still he never thought of love , let alone marriage , with Martha Greenlove . Then suddenly old Mr.p149Greenlove ( he was not old , he was only forty-five but the young Malone thought of him as old ) died of a heart attack . The drugstore was put up for sale . Malone borrowed fifteen hundred dollars from his mother and bought it on a fifteenyearmortgage . So he was saddled with a mortgage , and before he even realized it his own self , with a wife . Martha did not actually ask him to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malone would have felt an irresponsible man if he had not spoken . So he spoke to her brother who was now the head of the family , and they shook hands and had a drink of Blind Mule together . And it all happened so naturally that it seemed supernatural ; yet he was fascinated by Martha who wore afternoon dainty dresses and a chiffon dress for dances and who , above all , restored the pride he had lost when he failed at Columbia . But when they were married in the Greenloves ' living room in the presence of his mother , her mother , the Greenlove brothers , and an aunt or two , her mother had cried , and Malone felt like crying also . He did n't cry , but listened to the ceremony , bewildered . After the rice had been thrown they had gone on the train to their honeymoonin Blowing Rock , North Carolina . And ever afterward there was no particular time when he regretted marrying Martha , but regret , or disappointment was certainly there . There was no particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of life ? " but as he grew older he asked it wordlessly . No , he had not lost an arm , or a leg , or any particular five dollars , but little by little he had lost his own self . If Malone had not had a fatal disease he would not have brooded about this . But dying had quickened his livingness as he lay in the hospital bed , seeing the bright blood drop , drop by drop . He said to himself he did n't care about the hospital expenses , but even while he was there he was worried about the twenty-dollars-a-day bill.  | " Hon , " Martha said on one of her daily visits to the hospital , " why do n't we take a nice relaxing trip ? " Malone stiffened on his sweaty bed . " Even resting here at the hospital you always seem tense and worried up . We could go to Blowing Rock and breathe the nice mountain air . " " I do n't feel like it , " Malone said. " . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once in my life and that was when I was visiting my cousin , Sarah Greenlove , in Savannah . It 's a nice climate at Sea Island Beach , I hear . Not too hot , not too cold . And the little change might perk you up . " " I 've always felt that traveling is exhausting . " He did not tell his wife about the trip he was planning later on to Vermont or Maine where he could see snow . Malone had carefully hidden Sickness unto Death beneath the pillow for he did not want to share anything that was intimate with his wife . He did say fretfully , " I 'm sick of this hospital . " " One thing I 'm sure you ought to do , " Mrs. Malone said , " you ought to make a habit of turning the pharmacy over to Mr. Harris in the afternoons . All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy . " Home from the hospital with every afternoon off , Malone blundered through his days . He thought of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . thought of all the life he had spent unlived . He wondered how he could die since he had not yet lived . He took hot baths after his morning work and even darkenedthe bedroom to try to take a nap , but it had never been his habit to sleep in the middle of the day and he could not sleep . Instead of waking at four or five o'clock in the morning to roam the house in fear , the flashes of terror had flickered for a season , leaving boredom and a dread that he could notp151formulate . He hated the blank afternoons when Mr. Harris took over the pharmacy . He was always fearing that somethingmight go wrong , but what could go wrong ? The loss of another Kotex sale ? A bad judgment on a physical complaint ? He actually had no reason to advise in the first place , having never finished medical school . Other dilemmas plagued him . He was now so thin that his suits hung in baggy folds . Should he go to a tailor ? Though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tailor instead of going to Hart , Schaffner &; Marx , where he had always gone , and ordered an Oxford gray suit and a blue flannel suit . The fittings were tiresome . Another thing , he had paid so much on orthodontist'sbills for Ellen that he had neglected his own teeth , so that suddenly so many teeth had to be pulled that the dentist gave him a choice of pulling twelve teeth and having false teeth or making expensive bridges . Malone decided on the bridges , even knowing he could n't get the good of them . So dying , Malone took more care of himself than he had done in life . A new chain drugstore opened in Milan which did not have the quality and trustworthiness of Malone 's pharmacy , but it was a competitor which undercut fair prices and this annoyed Malone immoderately . Sometimes he even wondered if he should n't sell the pharmacy while he could supervise the sale . But the thought was more shocking and bewildering than the thought of his own death . So he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dispose of the property , includingstock , good will and reputation , when the occasion arose . Malone spent whole days with a pencil and paper , writing down his assets . Twenty-five thousand ( it comfortedMalone that his figures were conservative ) for the pharmacy , twenty thousand life insurance , ten thousand for the home , fifteen thousand for the three run-down housesp152Martha had inherited . . . while the combined assets were not a fortune , they were considerable when added up ; Malone totaled the figures several times with a fine-sharpened pencil and twice with a fountain pen . Deliberately he had not included his wife 's Coca-Cola stock . The mortgage on the pharmacy had been burned two years ago and the insurance policy converted from retirement insurance to plain life insurance , as it had been to begin with . There were no outstandingdebts or mortgages . Malone knew that his financial affairs were in better order than they had ever been before , but this comforted him little . Better , perhaps , if he had been harried by mortgages and unpaid bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt he had unfinished business which the ledgers and his figuring did not show . Although he had not talked more about his will with the judge , he felt that a man , a breadwinner , should not die intestate . Should he set five thousand legally aside for the children 's education , the residue going to his wife ? Or should he leave it all to Martha , who was a good mother if she was anything ? He had heard of widows buying Cadillac cars when their husbands had died and left them in full charge of the estate . Or widows being rooked into phony oil well deals . But he knew that Martha would neither breeze around in Cadillac cars nor buy any stock more chancy than Coca-Cola or A. T. &; T. The will would probably read : To my beloved wife , Martha GreenloveMalone , I bequeath all monies and properties that comprisemy entire estate . Although he had long since ceased loving his wife , he respected her judgment , and it was the ordinary will to make . Until that season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his fortieth year seemed a time for death . His brother from Macon died of cancer . His brother had been only thirty-eight years old and he was the head of the Malonep153Wholesale Drug Company . Also , Tom Malone had married a beautiful wife and J.T. had often envied him . But blood being thicker than jealousy , Malone began packing his suitcasewhen Tom 's wife telephoned he was failing . Martha objected to the trip because of his own ill health , and a long argument followed which made him miss the Macon train . So he was unable to see Tom again in life , and in death the body was too much rouged and terribly shrunken . Martha came the next day when she had arranged for someone to care for the children . Malone , as the elder brother , was the chief spokesman in financial matters . The affairs of the Malone Wholesale Drug Company were in worse shape than anyone had imagined . Tom had been a drinking man , Lucille extravagant , and the Malone Wholesale Drug Companywas faced with bankruptcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were two boys of high school age and Lucille , when faced with the necessity of earning a living , said vaguely that she would get a job in an antique shop . But there were no vacancies in an antique shop in Macon , and besides , Lucille did n't know scat about antiques . No longer a beautiful woman , she cried less for her husband 's death than that he had managed the Malone Wholesale Drug Company so badly , leaving her a widow with two growing children and no ideas about work or jobs . J.T. and Martha stayed for four days . After the funeral when they left , Malone gave Lucille a check for four hundred dollars to tide the family over . A month later Lucille got a job in a department store . Cab Bickerstaff died , and Malone had seen and talked with him that very same morning before he just fell over dead at his desk in the Milan Electric and Power Company . Malone tried to remember every act and word of Cab Bickerstaffthat morning . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not slumped at his desk at eleven o'clock , dying instantly of a stroke . He had seemed perfectly well and absolutely ordinary when Malone had served him the coke and some peanut butter crackers . Malone remembered that he had ordered an aspirin along with the coke , but there was nothing unusual about that . And he had said on entering the pharmacy , " Hot enough for you , J.T. ? " Again perfectly ordinary . But Cab Bickerstaff had died an hour later and the coke , the aspirin , the peanut butter crackers , the hackneyed phrase were fixed in an inlay of mystery that haunted Malone . Herman Klein 's wife died and his shop was closed for two full days . Herman Klein no longer had to hide his bottle in the compounding room at the pharmacy , but could drink at his own home . Mr. Beard , a deacon at the First Baptist Church , died also that summer . None of these people had been close to Malone , and in life he had not been interested in them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious inlay of mystery that compelled an attention that they had not exerted in life . So Malone 's last summer had passed in this way . Afraid to talk to the doctors , unable to speak of anything intimate with his own wife , Malone just blundered silently . Every Sunday he went to church , but Dr. Watson was a folksy preacher who spoke to the living and not to a man who was going to die . He compared the Holy Sacraments with a car . Saying that people had to be tanked up once in a while in order to proceed with their spiritual life . This service offended Malone , although he did not know why . The First Baptist Church was the largest church in town with a property worth , offhand , two million dollars . The deacons were men of substance . Pillars of the church , millionaires , rich doctors , owners of utility companies . But though Malone went every Sunday to church , and though they were holy men , in hisp155judgment , he felt strangely apart from them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every church service , he felt no communication with him , or any of the other worshipers . Yet he had been born and reared in the First Baptist Church , and there was no other spiritual solace he could think of , for he was ashamed and timid to speak of death . So one November afternoon , shortly after his second stay at the hospital , he dressed up in his new tailored Oxford gray suit and went to the parsonage . Dr. Watson greeted him with some surprise . " How well you are looking , Mr. Malone . " Malone 's body seemed to shrink in the new suit . " I 'm glad you 've come . I always like to see my parishioners . What can I do for you today ? Would you like a coke ? " " No thanks , Dr. Watson . I would like to talk . " " Talk about what ? " Malone 's reply was muted and almost indistinct . " About death . " " Ramona , " Dr. Watson bawled to the servant who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cokes with lemon . " As the cokes were served , Malone crossed and uncrossed his withered legs in their fine flannel pants . A flush of shame reddened his pale face . " I mean , " he said , " you are supposed to know about things like that . " " Things like what ? " Dr. Watson asked . Malone was brave , determined . " About the soul , and what happens in the afterlife . " In church , and after twenty years of experience , Dr. Watson could make glib sermons about the soul ; but in his own home , with only one man asking , his glibness turned to embarrassmentand he only said , " I do n't know what you mean , Mr. Malone . "  | " My brother died , Cab Bickerstaff died in this town , and Mr. Beard died all in the course of seven months . What happened to them after death ? " " We all have to die , " said the plump , pale Dr. Watson . " Other people never know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians should prepare for death . " Dr. Watsonthought the subject was getting morbid . " But how do you prepare for death ? " " By righteous living . " " What is righteous living ? " Malone had never stolen , had seldom lied , and the one episode in his life that he knew was a mortal sin had happened years ago and lasted only one summer . " Tell me , Dr. Watson , " he asked , " what is eternal life ? " " To me , " Dr. Watson said , " it is the extension of earthly life , but more intensified . Does that answer your question ? " Malone thought of the drabness of his life and wondered how it could be more intensified . Was afterlife continual tedium and was that why he struggled so in order to hold onto life ? He shivered although the parsonage was hot . " Do you believe in heaven and hell ? " Malone asked . " I 'm not a strict fundamentalist , but I believe that what a man does on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man does just the ordinary things , nothing good , nothing bad ? " " It 's not up to man 's judgment to decide what is good and what is bad . God sees the truth , and is our Saviour . " These days Malone had often prayed , but what he was praying to he did not know . There seemed no sense in continuingthe conversation , for he was getting no answer . Malone put the Coca-Cola glass carefully on the doily beside him and stood up . " Well , thanks very much , Dr. Watson , " he said bleakly . " I 'm glad you dropped in to talk with me . My home isp157always open to my parishioners who want to speak of spiritual things . " In a daze of weariness and vacuity , Malone walked through the November twilight . A bright woodpecker pecked hollowly at a telephone pole . The afternoon was silent except for the woodpecker . It was strange that Malone , who loved singsong poetry , would think of those memorized lines : The greatest danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass off quietly as if it were nothing ; every other loss , that of an arm , a leg , five dollars , a wife , etc. , is sure to be noticed . The incongruity of these ideas , fateful and ordinary as his own life , sounded like the brassy clamor of the city clock , uncadenced and flat.  |p158THAT  WINTER the Judge made a grave mistake about Shermanand Sherman made a still graver mistake about the Judge . Since both mistakes were phantasies which flowered as richly in the senile brain of the old man as they did in the heart of the thwarted boy , their human relationship was going very much amiss , choked as it were with the rank luxuriance of their separate dreams . So that the relationship which had begun with such joy and lucidity was , by the end of November , already tarnished . It was the old Judge who spoke first of his dream . One day with an air of secrecy and zest he opened his safety deposit box and handed Sherman a sheaf of papers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final contribution as a statesman to the South . "  |p159Sherman  read and was puzzled , less by the ornate and badly spelled manuscript than by the contents of what he read . " Do n't bother about the calligraphy or spelling , " the Judge said airily . " It 's the trenchancy of ideas that matters . " Shermanwas reading about the Confederate money while the Judge looked on , glowing with pride and anticipated compliments . Sherman 's delicately fluted nostrils widened and his lips fluttered but he said nothing . Passionately the old Judge began to speak . He described the history of devaluations of foreign monies and the rights of conquered nations to the redemption of their own currencies . " In every civilized nation the currencies of defeated nations have been redeemed . . . devaluated , to be sure , but redeemed . Look at the franc , the mark , the lira and look at , by God , even the yen . " This last redemption particularly infuriated the old man . Sherman 's slate-blue eyes stared at the deeper blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of all the foreign money , he wondered if the Judge was drunk . But it was not yet twelve o'clock and the Judge never started his toddies until noon . But the old Judge was speaking passionately , drunk with his dream , and Sherman responded . Knowing nothing about what the Judge was discussing , Sherman responded to rhetoric , repetition and rhythm , to the language of passionate demagoguery , senseless and high flown , of which the old Judge was a past master . So Sherman 's delicately fluted nostrils widened and he said nothing . The Judge , who had been hurt by his grandson 's casual indifference to his dream , knew a spellbound listener when he had one and pressed on triumphantly . And Sherman , who seldom believed a word that Jester said , listened to the Judge 's tirade , heedful and wondering.  |p160It  happened that some time ago the Judge received a letter from Senator Tip Thomas in reply to the first petition letter that Sherman had written concerning Jester 's admittance to West Point . The senator had replied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friend and fellow statesman 's grandson up at his first opportunity . Again the old judge and Sherman had struggled with a letter to Senator Tip Thomas . This time with the same cumbersome courtesy the old judge wrote of the dead Mrs. Thomas , as well as the living Mrs. Thomas . It always seemed a miracle to Sherman that the old Judge had actually been a congressmanin the House of Representatives in Washington , D.C. The glory was reflected in Sherman , the genuine amanuensis who had his trays on the library table . When Senator Thomas replied , referring to past favors the Judge had shown him and promising that Jester would get an appointment at West Point  --  playing footsie with the old judge  --  it seemed magical to Sherman . So magical that he even fought down his rebellious jealousy that his own letter to Washington had not been answered . The judge , in spite of his oratory , was a great one for putting his own foot in his mouth , and soon , sure enough , his foot was in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for burnt houses , burnt cotton , and to Sherman 's shame and horror , of reparation for slaves . " Slaves , " Sherman said in a voice almost inaudible with shock . " Why certainly , " the old Judge continued serenely . " The institution of slavery was the very cornerstone and pillar of the cotton economy . " " Well Abe Lincoln freed the slaves and another Sherman burnt the cotton . " The Judge , fixed in his dream , had forgotten that hisp161amanuensis was colored . " And a sad time that was , to be sure . The Judge wondered helplessly why he had lost his spellboundlistener , for Sherman , far from being spellbound , was now trembling with insult and fury . Deliberately , he picked up one of the pens and broke it in two . The judge did not even notice . " It will take a lot of statistical work , a pile of arithmetic , in fact a lot of doing . But my motto for my electioncampaign is rectify ' and justice is on my side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . And I 'm a born politician , know how to work with people and handle delicate situations . " The judge 's dream had flattened for Sherman , so he could see it in all its detail . The first flush of enthusiasm with which he had responded to the judge 's dream had faded utterly . " It would take a lot of doing , " he said in a dead voice . " What strikes me is the simplicity of the whole idea . " " Simplicity , " Sherman echoed in the same dead voice . " Yes , the simplicity of genius . Maybe I could n't have thought up To be or not to be , ' but my ideas of the restoration of the South are sheer genius . " The old voice quivered for confirmation . " Do n't you think so , Sherman ? " Sherman , who was looking round for a fast escape in case the judge did anything suddenly wild , said simply : " No . I do n't think it 's genius or even common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two different polaritiesof thought . " Sherman wrote down the word " polarities " thinking he would look it up later ; he was benefiting from the judge 's vocabulary if nothing else . " All I would say is that your plan would turn back the clock for a hundred years . " " I would like nothing better , " said the mad old foolhardy Judge . " And furthermore I think I can do it . I have in highp162places friends who are deadly sick of this so-called liberalism and who are only waiting for a rallying cry . I am after all one of the Senior Statesmen in the South and my voice shall be attended ; maybe some weak sisters will hesitate because of the details of statistics and bookkeeping involved . But , by God , if the Federal Government can screw every nickel out of me for income tax , my plan will be child 's play to carry out . " The Judge lowered his voice . " I never filed state income tax yet and never will . I would n't bruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictest confidence . And I pay the Federal Income Tax under the utmost duress and mighty unwillingly . As I say , many a Southerner in high power is in my same boots and they will harken to the rallying call . " " But what does your income tax have to do with this ? " " A lot , " the old man said . " A mighty lot . " " I do n't dig it . " " Of course the N.A.A.C.P. will be dead set against me . But the brave long for battle if the battle is just . For years I 've yearned to tangle with the N.A.A.C.P. , force them to a showdown , put them out of business . " Sherman just looked at the blue and passionate eyes of the old Judge . " All Southern patriots feel the same about the scurrilous pressure group that aims to destroy the very axioms of the South . " Sherman 's lips and nostrils fluttered with emotion when he said : " You talk like you believe in slavery . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on slavery . " The old Judge , who still thought of Sherman as a jewel , a treasure , continued to forget , in his passionate prejudice , that Sherman was colored . And when he saw his jewel so agitatedhe tried to make amends.  | " If not actual slavery at least a state of happy peonage . " " Happy for who ? " " For everybody . Do you believe for a single instant that the slaves wanted to be freed ? No , Sherman , many a slave remainedfaithful to his old master , would not be freed till the day he died . " " Bullshit . " " Beg your pardon , " said the old Judge , who was convenientlydeafer at times . " Now I 've been told that the conditions of the Negro in the North are appalling  --  mixed marriages , nowhere to live and lay his head , and just downright appalling misery . " " Still a nigger would rather be a lamppost in Harlem than the Governor of Georgia . " The Judge inclined his good ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly . All Sherman 's life he had thought that all white men were crazy , and the more prominent their positions the more lunatic were their words and behavior . In this matter , Sherman consideredhe had the sober ice-cold truth on his side . The politicians , from governors to congressmen , down to sheriffs and wardens , were alike in their bigotry and violence . Shermanbrooded over every lynching , bombing , or indignity that his race had suffered . In this Sherman had the vulnerability and sensitivity of an adolescent . Drawn to broodings on atrocities , he felt that every evil was reserved for him personally . So he lived in a stasis of dread and suspense . This attitude was supported by facts . No Negro in Peach County had ever voted . A schoolteacher had registered and been turned down at the polls . Two college graduates had been turned down likewise . The Fifteenth Amendment of the American Constitution had guaranteed the right to vote to the Negro race , yet no Negro Sherman had known or heardp164tell of had ever voted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if his story he had told Jester was not true , about the voting of the Golden Nigerians and the cardboard coffins , he had heard the actual story about a club in another county ; and if it had not actually happened to the Golden Nigerians of Milan , he knew it had happened to others somewhere else . Since his imagination enveloped all disasters , he felt that any evil he read or heard about could just as well have happened to himself . This state of anxiety made Sherman take the old Judge more seriously than he would have under calmer conditions . Slavery ! Was the old Judge planning to make slaves of his race ? It did not make sense . But what the fuckin hell made sense in the relation between the races ? The Fifteenth Amendment had been put at nought , the American Constitution was a fraud as far as Sherman was concerned . And justice ! Sherman knew of every lynching , every violence that had happened in his time and before his time , and he felt every abuse in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension and fear . Otherwise he would have thought of the plans of the old Judge as the product of a senile mind . But as a Negro in the South , an orphan at that , he had been exposed to such real horror and degradation that the wildest phantasies of the old Judge seemed not only possible , but in Sherman 's lawless land , almost inevitable . Facts combined to support his phantasies and fears . Sherman was convinced that all white Southerners were crazy . Lynching a Negro boy because a white woman said he had whistled at her . A Judge sentencing a Negro because a white woman said she did n't like the way he looked at her . Whistling ! Looking ! His prejudiced mind was inflamed and quivering like some tropical atmosphere that causes mirages . At noon Sherman made the drinks and neither he nor thep165old judge spoke . Then at dinnertime an hour later , Sherman was reaching for a can of lobster when Verily said : " You do n't need that , Sherman . " " Why not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tuna fish and made yourself a tuna fish sandwich mess . There 's ample plenty of the tuna fish to make a sandwich today . " Sherman kept right on opening the lobster can . " Besides , " Verily went on , " you ought to be eating collards and cornponesin the kitchen like anybody else . " " Nigger doings ! " " Well , who do you think you are ? The Queen of Sheba ? " Sherman was mashing the lobster with hunks of mayonnaise and chopped pickles . " Anyway I 'm not pure nigger like you are , " he said to Verily who was very dark . " Look at my eyes . " " I seen them . " Sherman was busily spreading his lobster sandwich . " That lobster was supposed to be for Sunday night supper when I 'm off . I got a good mind to tell the Judge on you . " But since Sherman was still the jewel , the treasure , the threat was an empty one and they both knew it . " Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sandwich with bread and butter pickles . " Just because you have them blue eyes is no reason to act so high and mighty . You nigger like the rest of us . You just had a white pappy who passed on them blue eyes to you , and that 's nothin to put on airs about . You nigger like the rest of us . " Sherman took his tray and stalked carefully through the hall to the library . But in spite of the party sandwiches he could not eat . He was thinking about what the Judge had said and his eyes were fixed and bleak in his dark face . His mind felt that most of the judge 's words were crazy , but Sherman , slanted by anxiety , could not think rationally ; he could onlyp166feel . He remembered the campaign addresses of certain Southerners , cunning , violent , menacing . To Sherman the Judge talked no crazier than many another Southern politician . Crazy , crazy , crazy . All of them ! Sherman did not forget that the Judge had once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices in the United States . And he knew people in high places . Just look at his answer from Senator Tip Thomas . The Judge was smart  --  mighty foxy  --  he could play a soft game of footsie . In dwelling on the power of the old Judge , he forgot his sicknesses ; it did not even occur to Sherman that the brain of the old man who had once been a congressman could have deteriorated in old age . Zippo Mullins had a grandfather who had lost his mind in his old age . Old Mr. Mullins ate with a towel around his neck , could not pick out the watermelon seeds but swallowed them whole ; he had no teeth and would gum his fried chicken ; at the end he had to go to the county home . The old Judge on the other hand carefully unfolded his napkin at the beginning of a meal and had beautiful table manners , asking Jester or Verily to cut up the food he could n't manage . Those were the only two very old men that Sherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between them . So Sherman never considered the possibility of brain-softening in the old Judge . Sherman stared for a long time at the fancy lobster sandwich , but anxiety would not let him eat . He did eat one bread and butter pickle before going back to the kitchen . He wanted a drink . Some gin and tonic , half and half , would settle his spirits so that he could eat . He knew he faced another run-in with Verily , but he went straight to the kitchen and grasped the gin bottle . " Look yonder , " she said , " look what the Queen of Sheba is up to now . " Sherman deliberately poured his gin and added cold tonic.  | " I try to be kind and pleasant to you , Sherman , but I knew from the first it was no use . What makes you so cold and airy ? Is it them blue eyes passed on from your pappy ? " Sherman walked stiffly from the kitchen , his drink in hand , and settled himself again at the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased . In his search for his true mother , Sherman had seldom thought about his father . Shermanthought only that he was a white man , he imagined that the unknown white father had raped his mother . For every boy 's mother is virtuous , especially if she is imaginary . Therefore , he hated his father , hated even to think about him . His father was a crazy white man who had raped his mother and left the evidence of bastardy in Sherman 's blue and alien eyes . He had never sought his father as he sought his mother , the dreams of his mother had lulled and solaced him , but he thought of his father with pure hate . After dinner when the Judge was taking his usual nap , Jester came into the library . Sherman was still sitting at the table , his tray of sandwiches untouched . " What 's the matter , Sherman ? " Jester noticed the gindrunksomnolence in the rapt eyes and he was uneasy . " Go fuck , " Sherman said brutally , for , Jester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words like that . But he was in a state where no words could relieve him now . I hate , I hate , I hate , he thought as his unseeing eyes fixed , brooding and drunk , at the open window . " I have often thought that if I had been born a Nigerian or colored , I could n't stand it . I admire you , Sherman , the way you stand up to it . I admire you more than I can say . " " Well save your peanuts for the zoo . " " I have thought often , " went on jester who had read the idea somewhere , " that if Christ was born now he would be colored . " " Well he wasn't. "  | " I 'm afraid . . . " Jester began and found it hard to finish . " What are you afraid of , chicken-out sissy ? " " I 'm afraid that if I were a Nigerian or colored , I would be neurotic . Awfully neurotic . " " No you would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a slashing gesture . " A neurotic nigger is a dead nigger . " Jester was wondering why it was so hard to make friends with Sherman . His grandfather had often said : " Black is black and white is white and never the two shall meet if I can preventit . " And the Atlanta Constitution wrote of Southerners of good will . How could he tell Sherman that he was not like his grandfather , but a Southerner of good will ? " I respect colored people every whit as much as I do white people . " " You 're one for the birds all right . " " Respect colored people even more than I do white people on account of what they have gone through . " " There 's plenty of bad niggers around , " Sherman said as he finished his gin drink . " Why do you say that to me ? " " Just warning the pop-eyed baby . " " I 'm trying to level with you about how I feel morally about the racial question . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression and rage accented by alcohol , Sherman only said in a threatening voice , " Bad niggers with police records and others without records like me . " " Why is it so hard to be friends with you ? " " Because I do n't want friends , " Sherman lied , because next to a mother , he wanted a friend the most . He admired and feared Zippo who was always insulting him , never washed a dish even when Sherman did the cooking , and treated him very much as he now treated Jester.  | " Well , I 'm going to the airport . Want to come along ? " " When I fly , I fly my own planes . None of those cheap , rented planes like you fly . " So Jester had to leave it at that ; and Sherman watched him , brooding and jealous , as he walked down the drive . The judge awoke from his nap at two o'clock , washed his sleep-wrinkled face , and felt joyful and refreshed . He did not remember any tensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humming . Sherman , hearing the ponderous tread and the tuneless voice , made a face toward the hall door . " My boy , " said the judge . " Do you know why I would rather be Fox Clane than Shakespeare or Julius Caesar ? " Sherman 's lips barely moved when he said , " No . " " Or Mark Twain or . Abraham Lincoln or Babe Ruth ? " Sherman just nodded no without speaking , wondering what the tack was about now . " I 'd rather be Fox Clane than all these great and famous people . Ca n't you guess why ? " This time Sherman only looked at him . " Because I 'm alive . And when you consider the trillions and trillions of dead people you realize what a privilege it is to be alive . " " Some people are dead from the neck up . " The judge ignored this and said , " To me it is simply marvelousto be alive . Is n't it to you , Sherman ? " " Not particularly , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleep off the gin . " Consider the dawn . The moon , the stars and heavenly firmaments , " the judge went on . " Consider shortcake and liquor . " Sherman 's cold eyes considered the universe and the comfortsof daily life with disdain and he did not answer.  | " When I had that little seizure , Doc Tatum told me , frankly , if the seizure had affected the left part of the brain instead of the right , I should have been mentally and permanentlyafflicted . " The judge 's voice had dropped with awe and horror . " Can you imagine living in such a condition ? " Sherman could : " I knew a man who had a stroke and it left him blind and with a mind like a two-year-old baby . The county home would n't even accept him . Not even the asylum . I do n't know what happened to him finally . Probably died . " N sell , nothing like that happened to me . I was just left with a slight motor impairment ... just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the mind intact . So I reasoned to myself : Fox Clane , ought you to cuss God , cuss the heavenly elements , cuss destiny , because of that little old impairment which did n't really bother me anyhow , or ought I to praise God , the elements , nature and destiny because I have nothing wrong with me , my mind being sound ? For after all , what is a little arm , what 's a leg , if the mind is sound and the spirit joyful . So I said to myself : Fox Clane , you better praise and keep on praising . " Sherman looked at the shrunken left arm and the hand permanently clenched . He felt sorry for the old judge and hated himself for feeling sorry . " I knew a little boy who had polio and had to wear heavy iron braces on both legs and use iron crutches ... crippled for life , " said Sherman who had seen a picture of such a boy in the newspapers . The judge was thinking that Sherman knew a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes as he murmured , " Poor child . " The judge did not hate himself for pitying others ; he did not pity himself , for by and large he was quite happy . Of course , he would love to eat forty baked Alaskas every day , but on the whole he was content . " I 'd rather stickp171to any diet than have to start shoveling coal or picking a harp . I never could manage even my own furnace and I 'm not the least bit musical . " " Yes , some people ca n't carry a tune in a basket . " The judge ignored this , as he was always singing and the tunes seemed all right to him . " Let 's proceed with the correspondence . " " What letters do you want me to write now ? " " A whole slew of them , to every congressman and senator I know personally and every politician who might cotton to my ideas . " " What kind of letters do you wish me to write ? " " In the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Confederate money and the general retribution of the South . " The zip of gin had turned to dour anger . Although he was emotionally keyed up , Sherman yawned and kept on yawningjust to be rude . IIe considered his soft , clean , bossy job and the shock of the morning 's conversation . When Sherman loved , he loved , when he admired , he admired , and there was no halfway emotional state . Until now he had both loved and admired the judge . Who else had been a congressman , a judge ; who else would give him a fine , dainty job as an amanuensis and let him eat party sandwiches at the library table ? So Sherman was in a quandary and his mobile features quivered as he spoke , " You mean that part even about slavery ? " The judge knew now that something had gone wrong . " Not slavery , Son , but restitution for slaves that the Yankees freed . Economic restitution . " Sherman 's nostrils and lips were quivering like butterflies . " I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom been said " no " to , as his requestsp172were usually reasonable . Now that his treasure , his jewel , had refused him , he sighed , " I do n't understand you , Son . " And Sherman , who was always pleased with any term of affection , especially since they were so seldom addressed to him , basked for a moment and almost smiled . " So you refuse to write this series of letters ? " " I do , " said Sherman , as the power of refusal was also sweet to him . " I wo n't be a party to turning the clock back almost a century . " " The clock wo n't be turned back , it will be turned forward for a century , Son . " It was the third time he had so called him and the suspicion that was always dormant in Sherman 's nature stirred wordlessly , inchoate . " Great change always turns forward the clock . Wars particularly . If it were n't for World War I , women would still be wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenters in overalls , even the prettiest , most well-bred girl . " The judge had noticed Ellen Malone going to her father 's pharmacy in overalls and he had been shocked and embarrassedon Malone 's behalf . " Poor J. T. Malone . " " Why do you say that ? " asked Sherman who was struck by the compassion and the tone of mystery in the judge 's voice . " I 'm afraid , my boy , that Mr. Malone is not long for this world . " Sherman , who did n't care about Mr. Malone one way or the next and was in no mood to pretend to feelings he did n't truly feel , only said , " Gon na die ? Too bad . " " Death is worse than too bad . In fact , no one on this earth knows what death is really about . "  | " Are you awfully religious ? " " No , I 'm not a bit religious . But I fear ... " " Why have you often referred to shoveling coal and picking harps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speech . If that 's all I feared and if I was sent to the bad place , I would shovel coal along with the rest of the sinners , a lot of whom I would have already known beforehand . And in case I 'm sent to heaven , by God I 'd learn to be as musical as Blind Tom or Caruso . It 's not that I fear . " " What is it you do fear ? " asked Sherman who had never thought much about death . " Blankness , " said the old man . " An infinite blankness and blackness where I 'd be all by myself . Without loving or eatingor nothing . Just lying in this infinite blankness and dark-ness . " " I would hate that too , " said Sherman casually . The judge was remembering his stroke , and his thoughts were stark and clear . Although he minimized his illness to others as a " little seizure " or " slight case of polio , " he was truthful to himself ; it was a stroke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling . His right hand felt the paralyzed one and there was no feeling , just a weighty clamminesswithout motion or sensation . The left leg was just as weighty and without feeling , so in the hysteria of those long hours he had believed that half of his body was mysteriously dead . Unable to wake jester , he had cried to Miss Missy , to his dead father , his brother Beau  --  not to join them , but for solace in his distress . He was found in the early morning and sent to the City Hospital where he began to live again . Day by day his paralyzed limbs awakened , but shock had dulled him , and cutting off liquor and tobacco added to his misery . Unable to walk or even raise his left hand , he busied himselfp174by working crossword puzzles , reading mysteries , and playing solitaire . There was nothing to look forward to but meals , and the hospital food also bored him although he ate every bite that was put on his tray . Then suddenly the idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it happenedlike the song a child might sing that was suddenly made up . And one idea brought the next idea , so that he was thinking , creating , dreaming . It was October and a sweet chill fell upon the town in the early morning and at twilight . The sunlight was pure and clear as honey after the heat and glare of the Milan summer . The energy of thought brought further thoughts . The judge explained to the dietitian how to make decent coffee , hospital or no , and soon he was able to lumber from the bed to the dresser and from there to the chair with the help of a nurse . His poker cronies came and they played poker , but the energy of his new life came from his thinking , his dream . He sheltered his ideas lovingly , telling them to no one . What would Poke Tatum or Bennie Weems know about the dreams of a great statesman ? When he went home he could walk , use his left hand a little , and carry on almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could he tell it to , and old age and shock had made his handwritingdeteriorate . " I would probably never have thought of those ideas if it had n't been for that stroke that paralyzed me so that I was half dead in the City Hospital for close on to two months . " Sherman rooted in his nostrils with a Kleenex but said nothing . " And paradoxically , if I had n't gone through the shadow of death I might never have seen the light . Do n't you understand why these ideas are precious beyond reason to me ? " Sherman looked at the Kleenex and put it slowly back in his pocket . Then he began to gaslight the judge , cupping hisp175chin in his right hand and looking into the pure blue eyes with his own creepy stare . " Do n't you see why it is important for you to write these letters I 'm going to dictate ? " Sherman still did not answer , and his silence irritated the old judge . " Are n't you going to write these letters ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling you no ' again . You want me to tattoo no ' on my chest ? " " At first you were such an amenable amanuensis , " the judge observed aloud . " But now you 're about as enthusiastic as a gravestone . " " Yeah , " said Sherman . " You are so contrary and secretive , " the judge complained . " So secretive you would n't give me the time of day if you were just in front of the town clock . " " I do n't blab-blah everything I know . I keep things to myself . " " You young folks are secretive  --  downright devious to the mature mind . " Sherman was thinking of the realities and dreams he had guarded . He had said nothing about what Mr. Stevens had done until he had stuttered so much that his words seemed to make no sense . He had told no one about his search for his mother , no one about his dreams about Marian Anderson . No one , nobody knew his secret world . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only person I 've discussed them with , " said the judge , " except in a glancing way with my grandson . " Secretly Sherman thought jester was a smart cookie , although he would never have admitted it . " What is his opinion ? " " He too is so self-centered and secretive he would n't givep176anyone the time of day even if he was just in front of the town clock . I had expected something better of you . " Sherman was weighing his soft , bossy job against the letters he was asked to write . " I will write other letters for you . Lettersof acceptance , invitations , and so forth . " " Those are insignificant , " said the judge , who never went anywhere . " A mere bagatelle . " " I will write other letters . " " No other letters interest me . " " If you are so hipped on the subject you can write the letters yourself , " Sherman said , well knowing the condition of the Judge 's handwriting . " Sherman , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a son , and sharper than a serpent 's tooth it is to have a thanklesschild . " Often the Judge quoted this line to jester , but with absolutelyno effect . When the boy was small he had plugged his ears with his fingers , and when he was older he had cut up in one way or another to show his grandfather he did n't care . But Sherman was deeply affected ; his gray-blue eyes fixed wonderingly on the blue eyes opposite him . Three times he had been called " Son , " and now the old Judge was speaking to him as though he was his own son . Never having had parents , Sherman had never heard the line that is the standardreproach of parents . Never had he sought his father , and now , as always , he kept the conjured image at a distance : blue-eyed Southerner , one among all the blue-eyed South . The judge had blue eyes and so had Mr. Malone . And so , as far as that goes , had Mr. Breedlove at the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-eyed men in Milan he could think of offhand , hundreds in the county nearby , thousands in the South . Yet the judge was the only white man who had singled out Sherman for kindness . And Sher/man , being suspicious of kindness , wondered : Why had the Judge given him a watch with foreign words , engraved with his name , when he had hauled him out of that golf pond years ago ? Why he had hired him for the cush job with the fancy eating arrangements haunted Sherman , although he kept his suspicions at arm 's length . Troubled , he could only skip to other troubles , so he said : " I wrote Zippo 's love letters . He can write , of course , but his letters do n't have much zip , they never sent Vivian Clay . Then I wrote The dawn of love steals over me ' and I will love thee in the sunset of our passion as much as I do now . ' The letters were long on words like dawn ' or sunset ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' often , and soon Vivian was not only sent but rolling in the aisles . " " Then why wo n't you write my letters about the South ? " " Because the idea is queer and would turn back the clock . " " I do n't mind being called queer or reactionary either . " " I just wrote myself out of a fine apartment , because after the love letters , Vivian herself popped the question and Zippo accepted very gladly . That means I will have to find another apartment ; I wrote the very planks out of the floor . " " You 'll just have to find another apartment . " " It 's hard . " " I do n't think I could endure moving . Although my grandsonand I racket around this big old house like two peas in a shoebox . " The Judge , when he thought of his ornate Victorian house with the colored windows and the stiff old furniture , sighed . It was a sigh of pride , although the people in Milan often referred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think I would rather be moved to the Milan Cemetery than have to move to another house . " The Judge considered what he had said and took it back quickly , vehemently :  | " Pshaw , I did n't mean that , Son . " He touched wood carefully . " What a foolish thing for a foolish old man to say . I was just thinking that I would find it mighty hard to live elsewhere on account of the memories . " The Judge 's voice was wavering , and Sherman said in a hard voice , " Do n't bawl about it . Nobody makin you move . " " I dare say I 'm sentimental about this house . A few people ca n't appreciate the architecture . But I love it , Miss Missy liked it , and my son Johnny was brought up in this house . My grandson , too . There are nights when I just lie in the bed and remember . Do you sometimes lie in the bed and re-member ? " " Naw . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have happened . I remember stories my mother told me about the War Between the States . I remember the years when I was a student at law school , and my youth , and my marriage to Miss Missy . Funny things . Sad things . I remember them all . In fact I remember the far-off past better than I recall yesterday . " " I 've heard that old people are like that . And I guess I heard right . " " Not everyone can remember exactly and clear as a pictureshow . " " Blah-blah , " said Sherman under his breath . But although he spoke toward the deaf ear , the old judge heard and his feelings were hurt . " I may be garrulous about the past , but to me it is just as real as the Milan Courier . And more interesting because it happened to me , or my relatives and friends . I know everything that has happened in the town of Milan since long before the day you were born . " " Do you know about how I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knowledge ; but since he found it difficult to lie , he said nothing . " Did you know my mother ? Did you know my father ? Do you know where they are ? " But the old man , lost in the meditations of the past , refused to answer . " You may think me an old man who tells everything , but as a jurist I keep my council and on some subjects I am as silent as a tomb . " So Sherman pleaded and pleaded , but the old Judge prepareda cigar and smoked in silence . " I have every right to know . " As the Judge still smoked on in silence , Sherman again began to gaslight . They sat like mortal enemies . After a long time , the Judge said , " Why what 's the matter with you , Sherman ? You look almost sinister . " " I feel sinister . " " Well , stop looking at me in that peculiar way . " Sherman kept right on gaslighting . " Furthermore , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit notice . And how would you like that ? " And on these words , in the middle of the afternoon , he stomped away , pleased that he had punished the judge and brushing aside the thought that he also punished himself.  |p180ALTHOUGH  the Judge seldom spoke about his son , he was with him often in his dreams . Only in the dream , that phoenix of remembrance and desire , could his memory live . And when he woke up he was always cross as two sticks . As he lived very much in the here and now except for pleasant daydreams just before he went to sleep , the Judge seldom brooded over the past in which , as a judge , he had almost unlimited power . . . even the power of life and death . His decisions always were preceded by long cogitations ; he never considered a death sentence without the aid of prayer . Not that he was religious , but it somehow siphoned the responsibilityaway from Fox Clane and dribbled it to God . Even so , he had sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rape , and afterp181his death another Nigra confessed to the crime . But how was he , as a judge , to be responsible ? The jury after due considerationhad found him guilty and had not recommended mercy ; his decision just followed the law and the customs of the state . How could he know when the boy kept saying , " I never done it , " that he was saying the God 's truth ? It was a mistake that might have put many a conscientious magistrate under the sod ; but although the Judge regretted it deeply , he kept reminding himself that the boy had been tried by twelve good men and true and that he , himself , was only an instrument of the law . So , no matter how grave the miscarriage was , he could not pine forever . The Nigra Jones was in another category . He had murdered a white man and his defense was self-defense . The witness of the murder was the white man 's wife , Mrs. Ossie Little . It had come about in this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm , close to Sereno . Ossie Little was twenty years older than his wife , a part-time preacher who was able to make his Holy Roller congregation talk in strange tongues when the spirit came upon them . Otherwisehe was a shambling , no-good tenant who let the farm rot . Trouble started as soon as he married a child-bride wife whose folks came up from around Jessup where their farm was in a ruined dust bowl area . They were traveling through Georgia in an old jalopy on the way to hope and California when they met up with Preacher Little and forced their daughter , Joy , to marry him . It was a simple , unsavory story of the depression years and nothing good could reasonably be expected , and surely nothing good came of any part of the sorry affair . The twelve-year-old child-bride had character seldom met with in one so young . The Judge remembered her as a pretty little thing , at first playing dolls with a cigar box of doll 's clothes , then having a little baby of her own top182bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then trouble , having started , compounded as trouble always does . First , it was rumored that young Mrs. Little was seeing more of the colored tenant on the adjacent farm than was right and proper . Then Bill Gentry , provoked by Little 's laziness , threatened to turn him off the farm and hand over his share to Jones . The Judge pulled up a blanket on his bed as the night was very cold . And how did his fair-born , darling son get mixed up with Nigra murderers , shiftless preachers , child-brides ? How ? Oh how ? And in what a mangled maw it was to lose his son ! Self-defense or no , the Nigra was doomed to die and Johnny knew it as well as anybody else . Why then did he persist in taking the case , which was a lost cause from the beginning ? The Judge had argued to dissuade him . What would it fetch him ? Nothing but failure . Yet , little had the Judge known that it would lead to more than a young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure  --  but that it would lead to obscure heartbreak and death . But how , oh how ? The Judge groaned aloud . Except for having to impose sentence , he had kept out of the case as much as possible . He knew that Johnny was all too deeply involved with the case , burned the midnight oil till daylight , and boned up on law as though in defending Jones he was defending his own blood brother . During the six months Johnny was working on the case , the Judge reproachedhimself , he should have known . But how could he have known , not being a mind reader ? In the courtroom Johnny was as nervous as any other fledgling lawyer at his first murder trial . The Judge had been distressed when Johnny agreed to take the case , was amazed at first at the way he handled it  --  hot potato that it was . Johnny was eloquent ,  |p183just  speaking the truth as he believed it . But how could you sway twelve good men and true like that ? His voice did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not shout , then sink to a whisper at the incriminating point . Johnny just talked quietly as though he was not in court at all  --  how could that sway twelve good men and true ? He was talking about justice with a voice that broke . He was also singing his swan song . The Judge wanted to think of something else  --  to daydreamof Miss Missy and to go to sleep , but most of all he wanted to see Jester . In old age or invalidism , stories once remembered cast a spell on the mind . Useless to think about the time he had a box at the Opera ; it was the first time the Atlanta Opera opened . He had invited his brother and sisterin-lawas well as Miss Missy and her father for the gala occasion . The Judge had invited a whole box of friends . The first performance was The Goose Girl , and well did he rememberGeraldine Farrar coming across the stage with two live geese on a kind of harness . The live geese said " Quack , quack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , had said , " First damned thing I 've understood this evening . " How embarrassed Miss Missy was , and how pleased he had been . He had listened to the Germans squalling their heads off in German  --  the geese quacking  --  while he just sat there lookingmusical and learned . Useless to think of all these things . His mind came back to Ossie Little , the woman , and Jones  --  it would not let him rest . He struggled against it . When was Jester ever coming home ? He had never been hard on the boy . True , there was a peach switch in a vase on the diningroom mantelpiece , but he had never used it on Jester . Once when Johnny had been cutting up and throwing bread at the servant and his parents , he had lost his temper , taken down the peach switch , and dragged hisp184young son to the library where , amid the wails of the entire household , he had cut him two or three times on his bare and jumping legs . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mantelpiece as a threat but never once used from that day to this . Yet the Scripture itself said : " Spare the rod and spoil the child . " If the peach switch had been used more often , would Johnny still be alive ? He doubted it , but still he wondered . Johnny was too passionate ; although it was not the passion he could readily recognize  --  the passion of the posse , the passion of the Southerner who defends his womankind against the black and alien invader  --  it was passion nonetheless , as strange as it had seemed to him and other Milan citizens . Like a tedious tune that pounds in a fevered brain , the story insisted . The judge turned mountainlike in his huge bed . When was jester coming home ? It was so late . Yet when he turned on the light he saw that it was still not nine o'clock . So Jester was not out so late after all . On the mantel to the left of the clock there was Johnny 's photograph . The vigor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp light . On Johnny 's left chin there was a small birthmark . This imperfection served only to sum up the beauty of Johnny 's face , and when he noticed it the judge felt closer to heartbreak . Yet in spite of the spasm of grief that always came when he looked at the little birthmark , the judge could not cry for his son . For underneath his emotions there was always resentment  --  a resentment that had been lulled at Jester 's birth , softened a little by the passage of time , but always and foreverthere . It was as though his son had cheated him by deprivinghim of his beloved presence , the sweet and treacherous thief had plundered his heart . If Johnny had died in any other way , cancer or leukemia  --  the judge knew more of Malone 's illness than he let on  --  he could have grieved **26;2501;TOOLONG gained the law ! He had it with him in soul and intellect . Law could be spread across the riverside hills , could lace the prairies , new communities might rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Surely a lone hawk rose up and cried for justice from the skies ! ) There must be equability , cleanliness , the newcomers themselves must yield to discipline and fact of the law ; dedicated fresh legislators must be bound by it . But not too forcibly ; you could n't bind humanity with the iron tautness of shrinking rawhide , then they 'd all be crippled . You must widen the law , enlarge it , exert it decently , tailor or extend it into a tent to cover new demands . Charley Flandrau 's fine gaze sparkled with the notion of subsidies of esteem to be awarded to all who deserved them ; and he thought that the deserving were many . He did not venture beyond this clear scheme of merits and responsibilities . Most people were good at heart : see that they be treated so . Wickedness was demonstrated in an unholy minority ; thus the wicked must be restrained ; build a jail !  --  but make it not a pit of horrors , else men might be shamed . Like the hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that he knew credible solutions for most problems , would folks but listen to him . The doctor was expected to cure  --  so he should , he must cure ! The pedagogue was commissionedto conduct and explain , the minister had the obligation of cleansing the spirit ( or at least of using soap and water supplied by the Almighty ) . And he who carried sword or truncheon , by desire and by choice and through competent training , should erect a security for all ; t was his bounden duty , he was sworn to it . And the lawyer would be a counselor and a judge . He 'd say : We 'll exert in this fashion or that fashion , because that is the law ; and without our good law there would be no tolerance , no safety , no confidence , no eventual fulfillment . ... The Minnesota Territory has been acquired . . Quo Warranto ? ... By right of purchase . . Did the manner of purchase constitute a malfeasance ? . In my opinion , most assuredly ! ...

You have expressed a unilateral . attitude . Indeed we whites have paid for the Minnesota Territory , , quantum valebat . ... Ah , so say you . But Mr. Flandrau was pliant enough to manage a shrug ; he was no longer a stripling , he 'd learned that it was impossible to reform.  |p401the  past . You could bring order to the present , and thus pray for a fairer year to come . Truly he felt very sorry for the Indians . Most of them did not as yet know what had happened to them : they were confused and resentful ; still they did not understand . Future generations might know the truth . T would not be his appointed task to explain to them .. Naturally he believed that before too long he would be on the Bench . Once on the Bench , t would become his enterprise to administer justice , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it remainedfor the law itself to tell him which was right and which was wrong . His proficient strong young mind found no disharmony between the schemes laid on for the management of men , and the nature of men themselves . . . . Not consciously , at least . Oh , there were a few puzzles , there were moments ( he 'd experienced them already , with a trifle of wriggling ) when nothing seemed to fit and nothing seemed to suffice . But seriously Charley Flandrau ascribed such temporary bewilderment to his own inexperience . With accumulation of observation , and thus an accumulation of proof , he would be able to find the answers . Of this he was heartily confident . Why , how efficacious could be the advice and preachings of a priest who doubted ? Of what effect might be the lecture of a mentor insecure in his knowledge ? ( Knowledgewas a definite commodity : you went and searched for it , quarried it , picked it , plucked it , shot it down , packed it up , took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge stored , no one could steal it from you , knowledge could not be robbed away . ) Would you feel trust beneath fingers and instruments of a surgeon who confessed : Frankly , I 'm not sure whether I should ligate or suture ? And if a soldier were insecure in his estimate of a situation , and hesitated about whether to press his attack on the morrow , or to order immediatewithdrawal from an untenable position ?  --  What then ? How now ? Charles Flandrau was charmed to feel that he could separate the chalk from the cheese , the shoddy from the substantial , the true from the untrue , most of the time . He did not wish to wade through unsolvedriddles . He pitied those flounderers who were compelled to do so , solely through ineptitude or lack of decision . Ha  --  how fortunate that almost always the world was vivid instead of vague ! But he did pity the Indians . Sometimes his heart made a weeping in their behalf , because his heart was open and cordial . In the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States agent for the Sioux for three months , he entertained a visitor in the person of his friend the Scotsman . One sunlit day the new agent arrived at the Lower Agency  --  named by the Dakota as Chan/duta , or Redwood . It was situated near that point where the Redwood River ran purposeful and dark out of a gulley fenced by narrow shelving cliffs , and lost itself in steady flow of the Minnesota . Scarcely had Charley stepped ashore when he was greeted by a Christianized youth who admired him and who wished to be the first to utter good tidings . Major , koda kin hi ! Come , come , Simeon . I 'm still struggling hopelessly with Dakota . Speak to me in English . Simeon He-Gets-Up-And-Stands translated : Major , friend comes . What friend is that ? Friend of you . Hair of him is gitkatka  --  hair is pink . On his face many hdeshkash ! ca gitkatka also !  --  and Simeon began to jab his own face with rapid strokes of his finger . By cracky . Stuart Garvie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was soon pleased to see a wide-shouldered freckled-faced Garvie moving down the path . Charley , lad , I thought you were no to hame . Well , I 've got two homes these days , if you can call ' em that . Here , at the Lower Agency ; and the Upper Agency at Pezihutazizi . Garvie blinked his blue eyes . Aye , the Yellow Medicine River . Correct , sir . How 'm I progressing linguistically ? You 've made a wee bit progress , said Garvie with caution . Give us a report . Did you shoot any wolves the nicht ? Garvie was tasting better fare in Minnesota Territory than he 'd enjoyed in his native Kilmarnock . There he began as a bobbin boy and progressed drearily through apprenticeship until he 'd learned to weave . He owned a mildly horrifying storybook fairy-tale background which included grim attic lodgings , a cholera epidemic , scourgings inflicted by a fanatically religious stepfather , and later the witnessing of drunken murder committed by a fellow craftsman in Paisley . He 'd emigrated in 1851 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had run away from Kilmarnock and made himself a secret den under a stone wall beside the ruins of Dean castle , north of town . There he subsisted for a fortnight , feeding mainly on blackbirds which he killed with a slingshot , until stormy weather drove him back to thralldom among the tenements and looms . But such independent venture had given him desire to lead sometime a hunter 's life in a more salubrious region ; and at the age of twenty-two he 'd found serene if not too remunerativefreedom among the frontier uplands of America . ) He was an easy-moving bullock of a man whose freckles plastered like orange scars over face , neck , and shoulders . Besides his Bible he possessed but one book  --  Burns , naturally  --  and most of the poems he had learned verbatim . He 'd put Charley Flandrau to sleep on more than one stormy penned-up afternoon with , But now the supper crowns their simple board , the halesome parritch , chief o ' Scotia 's food ; the soupe their only hawkie does afford , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dame brings forth , in complimental mood , to grace the lad , her well-hained kebbuck fell . Flandrau could be excused for coming to the firm conviction that there was nothing in this world more boringto the non-Scot than Robert Burns . But , putting The Cotter aside , he was very fond of Garvie ; partly because they had shared short commonsand rough dangers , and partly because he found in Stuart Garvie an excellent listener , who was gifted in giving him , by word or hint or mere silent attitude , the exact stimulation which Flandrau needed to send him into a powerful summation and reassortment of his  --  Flandrau 's  --  own ideas , and even into very passable oratory . Stuart lounged about while the agent worked ( bristling with responsibilities , and consciously aware that a white man watched  --  and more than that , a friend , but a friend perhaps critical and shrewdly evaluating ) . It seemed that some of the Indians above the Yellow Medicine were late in coming in for their payments ; goods had been distributed accordingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such transactions , but these items must now be incorporated in master ledgers here at Redwood . Also there were bales , boxes , and barrels to be housed at the Lower Agency ; it was difficult to maintain two points of distribution , but that was the way of it : always goods were being juggled back and forth between the depots . Missionaries up yonder at Lac-qui-Parle and Yellow Medicine had sent two packets of letters to be mailed back East ; these must be dispatched downriverto Traverse des Sioux without delay , and thence they would be carried to St. Paul and the steamboats . Charley kept up a running fire of comment and explanation while supervising these details ... . He had a bag of gold coins to be locked in the strongbox under his bed . There were two fresh-killed deer sent down as a gift to MissionaryJohn P. Williamson and his flock  --  Get some boys , Simeon  --  And you , Titus , and you , John  --  Deliver the deer to Doctor WilliamsonpromptlyGarvie knew something of the Dakota , he had hunted among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was late for the payments , Charley ? Sisitonwanna . The Dryers-on-the-Shoulder crowd . You must realize that the bulk of them have moved northwest now , up around Lake Traverse and the Coteau des Prairies . But yon Indians have aye been greedy for their gifts . Not gifts , Mr. Garvie . Payments ! Aw richt , payments . Why  --  ? Ah , they were hunting . Rumors of buffalo to the west . But the buffalo had moved on down between the Big Sioux and the Jamesp404before the Isanties ever caught up with them . Likely the Yanktonais killed the buffalo instead . Are the Wahpetonwanna now dwelling far in the northwest as well ? No , they 're closer to hand  --  Lac-qui-Parle and Big Stone . Many Christians among them . And the Wahpekute ? Flandrau gestured toward the south . They come here for the payments , those bands which were signatory to the treaties five years ago . But not all are entitled to participate in any distribution . Charley , ye ken the big Wahpekute ? The bad one ? Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting  --  that winter of Flandrau 's arrival in the Territory  --  the two had traveled almost to headwaters of the Blue Earth , the Le Sueur , the Watonwan . Charley , flat of pocketbook and also appalled by slim legal pickings in St. Paul , was engaged for a modest free to go tramping on a tour of exploration . Several well-to-do men were interested in the project : they wished to have the region surveyed with a view to accessibility , agricultural possibilities , potential townsites . Garvie went with Flandrau , he knew the country better than most . Far up the Watonwan , in a grove beside the lake , the young men made a comfortable snow-camp ; they spent two nights there , snug beneath a lean-to , and sleeping pleasantly on mounds of balsam ; they returned on the third evening to find the place plundered  --  fir burned , blankets and venison stolen , windbreak destroyed . Furiously they began to follow tracks which unknown marauders had left behind them , but a storm came up . The explorers were compelled to return and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At dawn , with winds lessened and snow no longer descending , they traveled south once more and walked into the camp of Inkpaduta 's people . Vigorously Inkpaduta and his companions deniedthat they had been the despoilers ; but Garvie held a cocked shotgun upon them while Charley Flandrau roved on a tour of inspection . Promptly he discovered the missing blankets and a few other articles which had been borne to this place by the thieves . Actually the Indians seemed more amused than discomfited at being caught red-handed in their naughtiness . Garvie made signs about soldiers coming down from Fort Snelling ; and Flandrau gave a demonstration of marksmanship by fastening a stray playing card against a cottonwood and shooting out the single big spot with his pistol ( ace of diamonds : half the pack had blown away in a high wind  --  he did n't know how or why he happened to have three cards still carried in his pocket ) ! The Wahpekute pretended to be little stirred by this demonstration , though actually they were much impressed , according to Garvie . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had never seen one before . The two white men went away , leaving Indians still gathered together , passing the card fromp405hand to hand , mumbling about it . Flandrau and Garvie did not think that the robbers attempted to follow them , but they made hasty tracks out of the country for all that ... . The bad one ? I wish there were but one . I refer to Inkpaduta . Gad , Garvie , I feared I 'd miss that ace of diamonds ! Father and I used to hold pistol competitions , in camera as it were , when I was reading law at Whitesboro ; and I learned not to miss  --  he was somewhatsensitive about the notion of poor marksmanship  --  the BurrHamiltonbusiness , you see  --  he 'd been Burr 's law partner , as I 've told you . But I was nervous when faced by Inkpaduta and his rapscal-lionsDidhe have aught to say of yon incident , when he came this year to the payments ? Ah , he did n't come , praise be . The superintendent informs me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand nuisance of himself  --  threats and attempted bullying  --  demanded an annuity which was in no way his . . Speaking of the superintendent , let me tell you that alteration in the manner of distribution is now in the offing . This is projected by some wiseacre in Washington , for reasons best known to himself . I will receive , from the Superintendent of Indian Affairs at St. Paul , the money  --  Mint boxes , of course . In silver and gold , twill probably amount to a full wagonload ! This I must convey up here to the agencies . In the meantime , appropriate stocks of goods will be delivered by the contractors , by boat . A new census of the Indians will be taken andWith Charley Flandrau still talking spiritedly , final chores were performed , and the two young men sought Charley 's private room behind the office . One of the first things which Flandrau had learned in this pursuit was that he must not be seen drinking , either at Redwoodor at Yellow Medicine . No liquors were included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although many Indiansalways asked for whiskey or rum , and expressed disappointment when none was forthcoming . Also the missionaries , now active at both agencies as well as at Lac-qui-Parle , would have been deeply disturbed  --  they would have considered the slightest bibulous demonstrationas an offense against their teachings , against all churchly deportment . This situation Charley Flandrau explained to Garvie as he fastened the chamber door , drew a demijohn from its hiding place , and poured out fresh spring water from a jar . And an overt act against their safety as well , man ! We must have no liquor flowing in these parts  --  officially . Williamson and Riggs and all the rest are dwelling on top of a powder keg , and they know it ! Here 's to ye , Garvie.  |p406To  ye . Pity we 've no a carcass of a wee pony . We 'd slay more wolves the nicht . They chuckled , recalling a lone cabin against the woods near Traverse  --  slinking shapes , the howls and snarling , boom of guns , the tedious job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolfhair , stench of blood  --  These sips of whiskey and water made the men feel slightly ceremonious , drawn apart from others by affection and the ropes of common experience . Tin cups in hand , they drifted to the small window and stood looking down the valley as it shimmered in sun of afternoon . A bonnie day ootbye , Charley . Beautiful ! The warmest November , on the whole , that I 've witnessed since coming to the Territory . Only a few brief intervals of rain or chillStill , we ken what winter can be like . Remember the day you went through the ice on Okaman Lake ? Aye ! Shall we tilt the joog once more ? Quantum meruit . ( Haze was smoke and smoke was haze , you could not tell where the one mingled its existence with the other . The river ran brownsilverand beckoning , hiding away into southeasterly regions where each bold hill dreamed of the feathered people who had dwelt upon it . Scrapped amid rolling bare forests were surviving dabs of color  --  a brilliance of conifers jutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always dust which rose in blue blush from fires real or fancied ; always the notion of sweet-kerneled nuts , of small wild apples bitten by frost , of furry beasts asleep in the brush , waiting to rise and prowl by night . ) Simeon Nazinhannazin trotted pad-pad through the office and tried the latch of Flandrau 's bedroom door . Finding that the door was bolted he began to beat rapidly with his flat hands . Yes , yes , what 's ado ? yelled Flandrau . He hid the whiskey behind his strongbox under the bed . Major , comes That OnelFlandrau unbolted the door and flung it open . Comes who ? Simeon He-Gets-Up-And-Stands breathed heavily and glowered into space . He was a thick-bodied youth with a face like a fresh-cured flitch of bacon ; he had allowed the missionaries to cut his hair , had been called a woman by old friends because he wore hand-me-downs of the whites ; he had been soldier-killed ( suffered the loss of his blankets : his family cut them into ribbons ) ; he used to own a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouse was stamped to death by Simeon 's own father . This young man had suffered rebuke and ostracism because of his affiliation with the whites ; he was in this season a minor Christian martyr .

What 's that you 're yammering , Simeon ? asked the mystified Flandrau . Stuart Garvie translated tardily , after consideration . And what ugly-bad from us-deliverAh , the Lord 's Prayer . Deliver us from evil . Is that it , Sim ? Echahe , Major . Comes That One of bad death ! Simeon edged past the two white men and , with care , and standingwell aside from the window itself , he peered out at an angle toward the gate . Shi ! he whispered , and signaled for Flandrau to join him . Shi ! That Old One of smallpox , and loving not Heavenly Father , and love many evil  --  Comes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Come here and speak of the devil , Garvie ! Whit  --  ? Inkpaduta , said Flandrau . The huge hard-faced outlaw stood pompously near a well which was curbed up about thirty yards beyond the office door . An Indian child had fallen into that well during the first week when the new agent appeared at Redwood , in August ; and Flandrau himself had sprung down in order to make the rescue . ( He found the boy treadingwater fiercely , and hauled Chashke up into the light of day , apparentlylittle the worse for his experience . ) Charles Flandrau decreed that a fence be built in order to minimize future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , although his twin sons had stepped over the low barrier ; one was peering into the depths , the other examined the rope . Flandrau did not know that these men were Roaring-Cloud and Fire-Cloud ; he would learn their identity a few minutes later . The twins had accompanied their father on his angry quest , but no others of the band were here . Roaring-Cloud looked especially barbarous and menacing . He was not as tall as his father or brother but possessed his sire 's wide thick mouth , with the same deep creases slanting alongside it . When you stood close to him you could see that his eyes were slightly crossed , and thus his expression was perhaps more intently baleful than either of the others ' . His father and brother wore their hair in braids , and so did he ; butp408Roaring-Cloud 's braids were firmest , they swung like solid clubs ; and oily black hair on top of his head was parted so tightly that it seemed painted into place .

Now , Sim , said Flandrau . They 've got guns , all three of them . Any Indian knows blame well that he 's not to approach this Agency office whilst carrying weapons . That 's the rule , and I insist on keeping it . Aye , Major ! There 's shelves under that shed roof out beyond the gate , high up , out of reach of children . Tell them to leave their weapons there . Nobody 'll take them . Wakan ! Aye , Major . But Simeon threw a nervous glance over his shoulder . Maybe That One say he leave guns notThen That One can precious well go flouncing off where he came from ! Aye , Major . When I ring Agent 's Bell , they come in . Not until . You understand ? Aye . God made us all , he added piously . With some reluctance he went to relay the instructions . Charley Flandrau opened a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which accompanied him in the boat each time he moved . He took out a bandsman 's tunic , of United States Army blue , replete with bars of worsted lace in artillery red ; there were tarnished gilt epaulets sewn incongruously onto the shoulders . As he removed his buckskin shirt and buttoned himself into this gaudy coat he saw a look of amazement on Stuart Garvie 's face , and began to laugh . My friend Captain Sherman , up at Snelling , has provided me with this adornment . Handsome , eh ? T is daft , Charley ! Not so crazy as you might believe . A wise soldier told me that no officer of the Government , civil or military , should ever appear among savages in less than a major general 's uniform . Ha  --  I ca n't literally follow his advice , but my toggery will be as imposing as glittering colors can make it ! Do they no give soldiers for guard duty ? Certainly , at the payments . We had them at Yellow Medicine , but they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular payment . In any event , I ca n't give these vagabonds as much as a quarter dollar . They 've got no business appearing here ; and that I must tell them ! A picket barrier with a wide counter on top was lined squarely across the log-walled office . Behind this fence stood two tables and a big walnut secretaire . There were fireplaces at both ends of the room  --  wide-mouthed edifices , built of hill stone  --  but they yawned sooty and cobwebbed . No fires had burned therein since the fantastic unseasonablechill of Friday , June thirteenth : the coldest summer 's day which most folks ever witnessed . Everything seemed topsy-turvy this year insofar as weather was concerned . Here it was , late November , and almost as warm as August ! One of the missionaries ' little girls had picked a nosegay of violets for Flandrau when he was at Yellow Medicine , three days before ... . The agent settled himself between secretaire and table in a big chair with panther-skin cushions on seat and back . He opened two ledgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he should be discovered while performing impressive mysteries with his pen . On the opposite side of the table Stuart Garvie sat in a smaller chair . He turned partially away from his host , and slid a hand within loose skirts of his greasy jacket . With no enthusiasm did he contemplate the advent of Inkpaduta and others of that scrofulous gang  --  not when soldiers were absent . Charley Flandrau seemed dismayingly casual about this intrusion ; there was n't a rifle in sight ; who knew what knives or tomahawks the Indians might tote beneath their blankets , whether they 'd put by their guns or not ? Garvie 's hairy hand found the small round butt of his Allen and Thurber pepperbox ( it had a double-action mechanism ) . I 'll call them in  --  and Charley lifted a battered bronze bell and rang it vigorously . Faintly from the yard outside the open door sounded an immediate answering jingle . The Dakota were coming . Inkpaduta blocked the doorway first , followed closely by FireCloudand Roaring-Cloud . They seemed a stagnant but still moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringes gashed by wear and tear , thudding blackened moccasins , sweat , oils , stained bent feathers , twisted cords and straps from which their pouches swung . . . yes , yes , all were wearing knives !  --  the two younger men had clubs or hatchets lumping beneath their robes . That jingle rose from a skunk-skin bag slung over the tallest Indian 's shoulder : t was made from the whole hide of the animal , legs and head and dried paws and all . . . the white stripe was marred with old blood , old ash . Attached to feet and nose and tail of the dried critter were six tiny sleigh bells , and these gave forth a mild disarming melody with each movement of the man who wore them . Inkpaduta had his revolverholster belted on , but as he halted before the counter he lifted the wide curling flap to show that the holster was empty . Flandrau stood up , conscious of his own bright trappings , feeling that he was in masquerade . ( He could not accustom himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act ; he had a lurkingnotion that a sergeant and a file of soldiers should arrest him for getting himself up falsely in such rig . ) Garvie remained seated ,  |p410he  clutched the concealed revolver more tightly . The Christian boy , Simeon , paused immediately inside the doorway . His eyes snapped from Flandrau to the big dangerous figures in front , and back again . Good day , said Charles Flandrau . Why  --  come  --  you ? The ugly mouth of the pocked-faced Wahpekute worked and twisted but no sound came forth . He lifted his right hand and brought it well out in front of his body , neck-high . His fingers pointed upward . He drew in the huge scarred hand toward himself , at the same time lowering it slightly . The gaze of the scornful rheumy eyes was held steadily on the agent 's face ; in manner Inkpaduta was oblivious to the existence of the two men who accompanied him . Again and again he repeated the gesture . Give  --  me , Flandrau said in a low voice . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Should you no send for yon missionary , to interpretfor you ? I think we 'll make out , twixt the three of us . But do you rise , Garvie , and stand near me . Simeon , please to come closer . . . Flandrau was returningInkpaduta 's steady stare as he spoke . He indicated the two younger Indians , and made a quick question sign , holding his right hand forth , palm outward , fingers separated , moving the hand back and forth slightly as he twisted his wrist . What  --  men ? he demanded in English . Who ? Who  --  men ? Simeon He-Gets-Up-And-Stands felt that since signs were being employedhe too would use them . Giving the Wahpekute a wide berth , he came up to the slatted gate ; thus the agent might see his signs , some of which would have been hidden by the counter . Simeon put the palmar surface of his left hand in front of his abdomen , with indexand second fingers extended , separated , and other fingers and thumb closed . With his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand away from his body , down past his crotch . Flandrau was confused , he knew a few signs , he knew not many . Oh , said Garvie , behind him . Twins ! I ken that one . Ilokshichekpapi ! Simeon cried . Two , two , son two ! Inkpaduta son two , Major . Two son of he . Tall one name Cloud-Fire , Fire-Cloud . Blanket Blue man name Cloud-Roar , Mahpiyahoton , Roar-Cloud . No heavenly twins , not by a damned sight ! But we 're making little progress this way . Stay where you be , Sim . And , Garvie , will you move over alongside of me . We 'll employ English , Dakota , signs , whatever we can : beat the thing to pieces , hang it up to dry ! I 've a lead pencil here , and shall keep a complete record of the exchange , for practicality 's sake . I do n't wish to have this big thief hanging about the premises , here or at Yellow Medicine . My manifold record book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flandrau squared his shoulders , and held the notebook ready with pencil poised . Pray proceed , Garvie , Simeon . You 've both more signsp411and more Dakota than I. Sim 's English is rudimentary but he can pronounce 1 and g  --  He fixed his vivid gaze upon the face of Inkpaduta. 0 Inkpaduta , he asked clearly . Why come ? As each question was received , as each reply was made understandable , Flandrau wrote it down . ( He studied the pages that night by candlelight before he slept , he thought about this meeting from time to time during the winter , would think of it even more poignantlyin later months . ) ... Why do you come ? . . . Get annuity . To collect money and goods . ... But you have no annuity due you ! You and your people have none . You did not sign the treaty when other Wahpekute sign treaty . ... I was not there . . You go many places . I go many places . Do you remember me ? One time here is Man-With-White-Whiskers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prairie ? No answer . . . . And this man with hair red . Do you remember ? No answer . . . . One time , in winter , you steal our blankets . One time you steal our deermeat . One time you burn our camp . Do you remember ? . . . Ho . You , man , shoot pistol ! You shoot wakan thing . ( Simeon had some difficulty with this , and for the moment Garvie and Flandrau were amused . Inkpaduta did remember the playing card . There sounded a grunt from Fire-Cloud and he fumbled deep in his skunk-skin pouch while all watched curiously . He slid out a miniature parfieche , slid it back ; he produced two membranewrappedpouches , put them back . Finally he drew forth a crumpled mildewed wad , and held it up to exhibit to all . It was the playing card which Flandrau had drilled , or at least the remains of it . Quite evidently the outcast Wahpekute had awarded an opinion of significanceto the thing ; at least it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag , then folded his arms and stood impassive . This was the only evidence of interest displayed by either twin throughout the interview . ) ... You ask for annuity . There is none for you . These words have been spoken before . ... Aye . These words spoken before . ... Two seasons ago , you came , asking for annuity . The other agent , the **27;2529;TOOLONG , tells me this . ... Aye . Man-With-White-Whiskers . I come . Two winters since . You receive no annuity.  | ... That is true . Man-With-White-Whiskers does not give . My people starve . ... Other Wahpekute do not starve . . That is true . Other Wahpekute do not starve . . . . Many months ago , you kill He-Resembles-His-Father . No answer . . . . Is this not true ? No answer . ... Do you not talk , we can not talk . No answer . ... You kill He-Resembles-His-Father ! All people know of this . You kill him because he does not give to you part of his annuity . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ask for , it is not yours , you have no annuity . This man you kill . ... My people give to his people ten ponies . Now his people cannotkill me . .. . Your people steal many ponies from the white settlers , to give to the family of He-Resembles-His-Father and to the good Wahpekute . No answer . ... You are bad Wahpekute , because you steal and kill . ( Sim translated this last into Dakota very fearfully indeed . Inkpadutagave him a ferocious look , and cried an insult ; he said that Simeon was a woman . Garvie heard this , he understood it . Garvie cuddled his concealed revolver , and was cheered at the thought of the loaded capped barrels and the double-action mechanism . ) ... I come for annuity . Give me ! ... You did not sign a treaty . Your father did not sign a treaty . Some Wahpekute signed treaty . But they say you have been cast away from your people , many winters since . I have no goods , no money for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no powder , no calico for you , no money for you . . . . Next year ? Not next year , no year , never ! ... My people starve . ... You must hunt . Why do you not hunt ? No answer . ... In this world are many Indians who do not receive annuities . They fish , they grow corn , they hunt , they eat , they do not starve . These things you too must do . . . . Give to me my annuity . . . . Go away ! . Then I will steal . ... Go ! ... I will kill again.  | ... Then you shall be punished . Go away ! Flandrau and Garvie stood inside the wide doorway of the office and watched Inkpaduta and his sons crossing the open ground , watched children fleeing in all directions in front of them , saw women catching up their children and scuttling to shelter . Dakota men withdrew , they looked the other way . Perhaps a third of the local Dakota ( mixed bands , drifters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful were of Wahpekute stock ) professed to be Christians . But the rest , whether or not they deplored the introduction of white men 's attire and white men 's hymns and prayers , maintainedat least a surface cordiality with agent and nearby traders . They had no desire to consort with these notorious visitors ; they I cared even to be seen looking at them . Inkpaduta and the twins retrieved their weapons from under the shed roof , and went tramping into the south without once looking back . Thick brush grew along a trail which curved up the rising ground . Soon the outlaws were beyond view , hidden by hazel bushes and a stockade of trees ; they came into sight once more in an open area  --  three distinct figures at first , then a crawling disordered blot of dull color softened by haze , softened eventually into vanishment . Sim ?  --  called Flandrau sharply , seeing him nowhere about . Aye , Major . Simeon had withdrawn into the farthest corner of officespace outside the little fence , and was kneeling in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a session of prayer . I 'm sorry , SimFinish pray now , Major . God bless  --  you ! Very well , God bless you as well . Simeon , that last sign Inkpaduta made , when he turned before going out through this door  --  Did you see it ? Aye . See . He held his hands  --  like this  --  index fingers pointing up ? Then he made a fast twisting of his wrists  --  like this . Right finger pointing at left finger , left finger pointing at right finger , back and forth  --  fastlikethis . What means it ? I 've ne'er witnessed it before , said Garvie . Mean bad , Major . Bad talk , bad thing . Mean quarrel ! Ah . Very well , Sim . You were of excellent assistance at the translating . We should have been whipped without you . The puzzled boy asked , Whip ? Never mind . I have a gift for you . A present . Good ! Here t is  --  a half dollarThank , Major , thank ! I give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just a fair tithe  --  ten per cent . Possiblyp414that 's all the Lord 's entitled to , in this instance . You give Lord five cents on Sunday , spend forty-five cents in trade store . Lo , heart ! mumbled Simeon , still considering the Prodigal Son . Wegoodand we-rejoice . Fare-well . Farewell , Simeon . With the departure of the young Dakota , Flandrau ripped at fasteningsof the ornate tunic and went to toss the garment upon his bed . He reappeared , pulling on the stitched hide shirt which was more to his taste . Were you to give me the lend of a rod , said Garvie , I 'd seek to tempt a pickerel . Rods up under the eaves yonder ; and I 've hooks and lines in plenty . Do you wish to try a spear , as our brown friends do ? Muckle fortune have I with a spear ! I 'll take the rod . Will you accompany me , Charley ? You tempt me . But I 've all my ledger work . Neglected to take my master ledger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all transactions must be entered from my notes . IIe dropped into the chair beside the table , and thumbed at pages for a moment . But not for long : he twisted impatiently , slammed the covers of the book together . He sat frowning , biting on the tip of his black wooden penholder , wiggling the pen point up and down by pressure of his strong even teeth . He removed the penholder from his mouth . They should fish . Or hunt . But they 'll never do it . Who ? Inkpaduta and his sons and all the rest of their miserable herd . Indians are a lazy lot . Flandrau cried as if suffering personal affront : No they 're not ! Hunting is hard work , as you know full well  --  why , you 're a hunter by trade !  --  and t is but one of their difficult chores . In order to exist , you see . All , I 'm not speaking now of Inkpaduta and his kind . They are worthless ; but their own tribes deemed them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I refer to the bulk of the Dakota . Sometimes I venture to believe that a better race of aboriginal men never inhabitedthe earth ! These remarks were typical of Charles Flandrau 's passion and enthusiasm . Stuart Garvie nodded in tolerance . IIe could imagine that he had known the impetuous boy long before he skipped away from school at Georgetown and went to sea . He imagined his rebelling once more at being forced back to his studies , pictured his attempt at mahogany-cutting , saw him recoiling from an artisan 's life , and quickly embracing the legal profession with fanatic zeal ; and wearyingonce more of the hidebound , the absolute ; and plunging restlesslyoff to the frontier.  | Garvie inquired : But are yon Indians no deceitful ? By gum , sir , they 're human ! Like all savages , they 'll deceive when they expect to be deceived . In their relationships with the whites , they expect to be overreached . Flandrau added wryly , And generally they 're not disappointed . His friend felt uncomfortable at the implied accusation against the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're to be Indian agent , your duty must lie in representing the Government , not the Indian ! By gum , I do n't see why I ca n't represent them both ! I 'm glad I 'm no an agent . I couldna thole it . The Indian had to sell his land , sir ! He knew as well as anyone that he had to retire before the advance of a superior force . Twas n't a case of inducement , t was compulsion . All the Indian could hope for was to make the best bargain he could ! If the Indian didna wish to sign a treaty , he should no hae signed it . Aw , damn it , Garvie ! By this time Flandrau had come through the gate and was planted before the open door , knotting the hands clasped behind his back . He stood for long impolite moments , presenting his back to his friend  --  stood with strong legs set firmly apart , as if glaring after the vanishedInkpaduta and sending a message which might reach the monsterand draw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect an apology  --  not to the stubborn grasping murderous Wahpekute , but to those people who had given him birth , and had offered a decency and discipline which he had not the grace to accept . Charley Flandrau turned , smiled , held out his hand to the other man . Forgive my bridling , sir . Ah , you 're an old blether , Charley . And aye a tawpy . What 's that ? It means you 're  --  Soft-hearted , lad . An innocent . I 'm nothing of the kind ! Let 's return to this matter of treaties for the moment . These transactions are called treaties , but they are treatiesin name only . The superior power demands the land and offers compensation ; the inferior power knows perfectly well that , if it does not accept the terms , it will be forced out of its domains ultimately . So it accepts . This comprises the elements of all Indian treaties . He stood in silence , reviewing the significance of his own words . . Despite the gravity inherent in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flandrau was young enough to revel in the awareness of a thing well said . He felt a glow of childish selfesteem . This was correct , this was honest , he had said it , he was proud to have said it ! He would say more ( he wished that his audience was not limited to a lone Garvie ) . He said : It is natural , under these conditions , that there should beillip416discontented Indians . Assuredly I could not justify their rising in bloody rebellion , and would resist them if they tried . Nevertheless , were I a Dakota , I should feel very rebellious ! There are some seventy-fivehundred of them , by the best estimate , who come under the administration of this Agency . I doubt that one hundred of them will ever become satisfactory farmers . Weel , lad , as you said to that wicked one , they can always take a wheen prairie hens . OrAh , Garvie , for how long , how long ? T is the result of a superior race colliding with an inferior one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parceled . One day the deer and the turkeys and doves will be frazzled out . These lands are wanted by the whites , and will be had . And , in the majority of cases , you might as well attempt to put a hoe into the hands of a deposed monarch of France , as to make a husbandman of a Sioux warrior ! .. . Garvie trudged away to the river with his fishing gear ( oh , go upstream , above the mouth of the Redwood if you can wade it  --  there 's that big rock near the south bank , and a fine quiet pool just below ; with any luck you 'll take a splendid mess ! ) and one side of Charles Flandrau 's brain became devoted to the mechanical task of copying the annuity entries ; but the other portion went speeding off above leafless hills , and visited in scattered cabins and lodges . He 'd spoken of an Indian uprising , and so that might occur . The onrush of whites was suddenly grown too speedy , too thick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians moved to Lake Traverse and beyond , but to what length might they find refuge there ? A single Messiah towering among them , when the time was right ... Flandrau sat motionless , appalled by a vision of crackling haystacks , bellowing cattle , limp bodies dragged out ; and over all he thought he heard the screaming of women . ( Indian children they were , they made those screams , they were playing at war near the well-fence . ) Oho  --  Simeon Iie-Gets-Up-And-Stands had prayed this afternoon , but how long would he keep praying ? Flandrau turned Page Forty-seven of his ledger . When Stuart Garvie came back , just before sunset , he met a sticky Simeon who walked proudly with a tube of red cinnamon candy protrudingfrom his mouth . Garvie nodded amiably , and Simeon Nazinhannazinsaid again , We-good and we-rejoice . There was nothing fey in Garvie 's nature , he was not born with a veil across his face , had no second sight . This was just as well . Less than six years ahead waited the rudeness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this same Lower Agency , by quick gunshot and slicing knife , and effected by this same Simeon , with all God Blesses and Prodal Sons thoroughly forgotten or at least put aside.  |p416William  and Margaret Ann Marble had reached Spirit Lake on a bright windy forenoon in the middle of September . The first thing William did on his arrival was to go down and examine rocks along the shore . Peggy Ann would have been surprised had he not gone for such purpose . He was a brown-red rock of a man . With her shoes on , she stood slightly taller than he . They met in a church in Michigan , he was with his cousins as she was with hers . His thick neck seemed ready to split the blue stock tightened around it for Sunday ; the Collingwood tribe sat small besidethis bulk of a stranger cousin . Margaret Ann Phipps 's own Cousin Lettie sensed a question from the quiet widow sitting beside her . Although Peggy Ann still wore her weeds for the deceased Phipps , she would put them off in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrath , that dreadful day , when heav'n and earth shall pass away , and thus Cousin Lettie was able to whisper behind her mutilated hymnbook , with pages falling out of it even as her words had fallen from the singing . He 's Dorcas Collingwood 's cousin . Name of Marble . Where from ? Do n't know . He 's come to visit , folks say . She added later : They say by trade he 's a stonecutter . Peggy Ann went home thinking it appropriate that there could be a stonecutter named Marble . Lettie 's spouse , Abner Dale , invited the stonecutter to take supper with them , come Saturday . Abner must have been instigated in this by Lettie herself , since Abner seldom displayed social acumen or initiative . But William Marble did come , looking more like a rock than ever , and ate largely of the salt fish and baked beans which sustained the Dales as former New Englanders each Saturday evening . When they were done with their meal , Abner said that he had to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small fry to bed , and Aunt Precious announced that she had to do up the dishes ; thus they left Peggy to the task of entertaining the guest . There was a book bound in black with a gold-stamped cover whichp418Cousin Lettie was talked into buying by a subscription agent , much against her husband 's wishes . Now it had been delivered , and lay importantly upon the parlor table . The Lives of the Sachems . Together with Descriptive Accounts of Their Personalities , Tribal Histories , and Manner of Waging Warfare , with Added Reminiscences by Travelers at the West . It boasted a hand-painted frontispiece , together with several hand-painted illustrations scattered throughout the text , illustrationsin which reds flowed easily into blues and greens . The young people studied this work meticulously . William Marble announced that he had long intended to go to the West and soon meant to do so . Of course the West to which the book had reference was actually and mainly Michigan , Ohio , and such local regions . Marble talked of a West which lay farther on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Thinking of the Ioway country . T is a new State , and ought to afford a chance to one of my trade . He seemed about to say more , but clamped his jaws shut . His jaws were beardless , wide , building into a solidly protruding chin . His nose sloped back against a low broad forehead . His eyes were hazel , small amiable eyes ; they disappeared in his head on those rare occasions when he laughed . Abner Dale , who had wrestled throughout several counties before he was married  --  but now was permitted by Cousin Lettie to wrestle no longer  --  announced later that he should hate to wrestle with William Marble . Not much neck . Could n't get a lock around it . And did you notice them arms ? And I warrant you also them thighs . Cousin Lettie cried , Mr. Dale ! and Aunt Precious cried Abner ! in a shocked chorus which sounded as one word . Well , I warrant you , just the same , he could take a fall out of any man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seen him yesterday in Mr. Maltby 's yard next the shop , when he come to chat with the masons there . One of the prentices let go a hammer and it sailed square at Marble . He ducked , easy as could be . I swear he caught the thing in his hand ! First he gives the prentice such a tongue-lashing that I thought the younger would weep . And then he was kindly  --  he come over and showed him how to hold the handle proper ... . Soon there was a berry social given by Iadies of the church , and following that there were several walks home together from prayer meeting . On the fourth of these occasions , William Marble lingered with wide hands fastened around the tops of the fence pickets . He lingered until Aunt Precious , a much slower walker , had come along with neighbor friends , and had left them and gone into the house , after talking brightly about what a fine night it was , when of course the sky was soaked with clouds.  |p419Marble  bulked dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon go into the house , or neighbors might be scandalized . You going to the Sons of Temperance picnic a-Tuesday ? I had n't thought to , Mr. Marble . Wish to go ? 1 'd be pleased to scort you . I calculate to set forthfrom here a-Thursday . There was emptiness around them in that moment . Mr. Marble , you intend to set forth for the West , the Ioway country ? That I do ! I 've stayed here long enough . . . . Then massively , stolidly , he told her more : he had saved over nine hundred dollars . Then he stopped talking again , and stood regarding her silently through the gloom . Mr. Marble , she said with trembling voice , would you choose to come in and set awhile ? Without another word he opened the gate for her , and they went in where the lamp was lighted but all the people were gone to bed . He placed himself on the edge of the settee brought from Massachu setts ; he was not comfortable on a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In chiseled phrases and sentences he gave her the story of his life . Poor boy , he said , born in Monroe County . Never had much schooling . Apprenticed to a stonecutter at the age of ten . Thought maybe he 'd like to be a doctor some time  --  the cutting kind  --  but there was no chance for him to work for any doctor and learn the doctor business . It did n't pay to start , and he had to earn money . His folks died when The Cholery struck , and there were three younger sisters to look after . Well , they were married now  --  two of them well-married . He had them off his hands , and he had been working hard this past year or so . But then came a quarrel with his former employer  --  later his partner  --  in Detroit . The man was always busy with the bottle , so William Marble pulled up stakes and left . Had n't known just where he would go , but now had settled definitely on the Ioway country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose , rubbed his prematurely thinned hair , and smiled . He reached for his hat and said that he must go . I 'll be around at ten a-Tuesday , to scort you to the picnic . Hope it does n't rain . He went tramping out . Peggy lay long awake that night with Aunt Precious snoring beside her . She wondered whether she should regard Mr. Marble 's autobiographical sketch in the manner of a pointless declaration of fact , or as a proposal . When the late Mr. Phipps proposedmarriage he quoted poetry , but that was his way . Phipps was sad , confused , nervous , forever quoting poetry . Consumption carriedp420him off . She feared at first that the consumption might be catching ( people argued about that ) but she had never felt in better health in her life than now . Here was a strength flowing from William Marble ; but that strength moved heavily , solidly , like a quarried slab swaying in chains . They attended the Temperance picnic . It did rain right in the middle of things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's barn , and part beneath his implement and vehicle shed . Mr. Windhorn was a wagonmaker by trade and there were many vehicles to sit upon or in . Peggy Ann found herself with Mr. Marble on the high seat of a spring wagon . The wagon smelled cleanly and aromatically of fresh paint , and she hoped that the paint was not too fresh , and kept sliding her fingers beneath her skirts to see if she were sticking . Marble said , At the West they travel in these things . Only way to go . No railroads yet in most spots . Yes , I 've heard tell . Care to try ? he asked . That was his proposal . No wonder that the first thing he did after arriving at Spirit Lake was to go and examine rocks on the shore , to be one with boulders for a time ... . The Marbles ' initial Iowa experience in Linn County had been the merest incident . William said that he was by no means a rolling stone , and certainly he did n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled ; but this could not be in Linn County . He had made an error : the community held no need of his services ; other craftsmen of his trade were already ensconced . Of these , one was elderly and also addicted to the bottle ( this might have been an occupational failing among stonecutters and masons ) . Peggy argued mildly with her husband  --  hesitantly , as befitted a bride . She said that the communitymight soon reshape itself and offer them an opportunity not available just now . You mean set here and wait for that man to die ? Not my way ! I made a mistake , and 'll be the first to say so . Waited a little too long to come to this place . Got to get to a newer place . Got to start from scratch with a place growing up around us . Only way to do ! Once again Peggy Ann lay awake , but for a different reason . There was no snoring beside her in this life , William Marble did not snore like Aunt Precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reflected light from the dying fire touched the boulder of his fuzzy head which would so soon grow bald . She wanted to smile and reach over and touch that fuzz , and take strength from solidity underneath , although she never felt that his brain was frozen  --  only his manner and his habits . He did not have a stone for a brain or a stone for a heart  --  he just appeared to have them . She should accept courage from hisp421solemnity , from the quiet force of him , and never dread a move to a new location . But she shivered , thinking of bears and Indians . Still , on consideration , she felt that William Marble , chisel or mallet or hammer in hand , would be a fair match for any panther or any Indian , any live creature offering threat . We 're moving , he told her one day . Our money is going fast , I do n't like to see it go . Ruther store it up . We 're moving to Spirit Lake . Where 's Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dickinson County . That 's mainly just on paper . But I 've talked twice this week with some folks who 've been there  --  yes , actually been there  --  kind of hunting and exploring about . They say that land is being taken up in the next county ; settlements are growing . Just the way it was not too long ago , right here in Linn County . We 'd have to buy a team , husband . Oxen would do . Yes , butSecondhand wagon , good and substantial ! Bought it already . Fellow stops by ; he 's leaving for the East ; got enough of this country ; his folks perished in a prairie fire . He was selling off his goods . Said he did n't need the wagon no longer ; planned to go East a-horseback . I 'm to cut stones for his family graves , so we made a trade . She had hoped to find a niche in some such small community as those they saw on the way : first , little towns with piles of yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . poundings all about , the grate of saws . . . they left the sawmills behind them . They found fresher places where people were chopping at logs , and then came sod houses with flowers not yet growing on their new-cut roofs . But no ( William affirmed to her time and again , not in the manner of a repeated confession , but as something understood all along ) there was no one  --  no other family  --  no one at Spirit Lake , not yet . There would be . Marble wore a belt of gold around his waist . It was heavy , but he wore the gold for safety 's sake ( outlaws on the frontier ? They 'd heard stories ) . At least in the wagon ; he might not wear it when he set to work . Five hundred dollars in the belt ; William had the rest in a pouch  --  what was left after their ill-fated venture in Linn County . He said that they could buy supplies enough to last until people started to move in ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shape the stones for their doorsteps . He regarded scornfully those log houses going up along the way . William said that stone houses would be superior , and he 'd show these people a thing or two . He pointed out great glacial boulders bulging from the prairie , and he left the wagon often to examine them , to see how they would split . William wished to hunt game for their larder . He had never huntedp422in his life , but now he would learn . He had bought a rifle , he practiced with it assiduously as they journeyed . Soon he became an excellent shot . A stonecutter 's eyes and a stonecutter 's nerveless hands turned the trick  --  he had thought so all along , now he proved it . At first William would shoot only at a mark until he felt that he had learned . He said that he did n't want to cripple any animal and have it creep away to die . The first creature which he killed was a prairie cock , strutting boldly and making queer sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty yards away . William Marble took steady aim and shot the head off the bird . Peggy Ann saw the head fly in a bloody spray . she squealed , she shut her eyes and beat her hands together . All William said was , Got him ! Want to pick him up whilst I 'm busy with the team ? You can pluck him when we make camp . Spirit Lake seemed an excessively lonely region as the Marbles gazed at torn brown waters spangling before them . West side 'll be better . Cause we wo n't get prevailing wind cross solid ice when the lake freezes ... . Coming thus to an unpopulated shore and facing winter , Peggy Ann shivered in her soul , and feared that face and body would show it . She wondered if other women at the West felt the same way . Not more than four hours later her husband had selected the site for their dwelling , and was down by the shore eagerly appraising boulders . They lay massed where pushing ice of centuries placed them  --  installed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . higher or lower at other places . The stones ' children had been carved off , long since , from the bodies of mother boulders . Slammed or caressed by ceaseless water , they were now smooth ; they lay headsizedand bean-sized along the shore , they made the shore . Here scrambled the broad man , his scratched peeling boots busy and slipping as he sought to evaluate the treasure he would claim . Build a house ! he crowed . Woman , I could build a tabernacle out of these ! He wanted to go to no other distance ; here he would stay , and take up the land in legality . A city was bound to erect itself within these precincts . One mile , two miles , five miles away ? It did n't matter . He was here first . But later , when Peggy Ann had a fire going , and the inevitable chunks of prairie hen were browning in her spider ( she had learned a crude camp cookery while on the road from Linn County ) William 's bounding enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He sat morosely upon a keg . Husband , she pleaded , what 's ado ? Cat got your tongue ? No , not a cat . He said presently : But I was a-studying . T is mighty late in the year . First off I 'd have to seek out limestone and make a kiln and burn the stone , order to get sufficient lime for my mortar . So that 's a mortar problem of the very first sort . And then : labor of dressing the stone , cause I should n't want to build unless I built right . Likely we 'd be deep in snow fore we had a roof on . Much as I hate it , I ca n't see us in nothing but a log shack . Peggy Ann grew to share his depression . She had entertained the vision of an ample stone house where wind and sleet screamed at the outside while a gossiping fire burned within . There were such houses in Darke County , Ohio , where she was born . William had no training as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overwhelming chore . He learned soberly from experience , however , as indeed he could learn any task wherein a combination of visual and manual skills was essential . Soon the work went faster . He selected a size of log which he hoped might not be beyond his strength to manage , and stubbornly sought and felled only trees which would adhere to this pattern . There were frantic beauty and terror at Spirit Lake , a terror dwellingalso in the beauty . Most of the days were warm , but light frail frost spoke uncompromisingly of winter when it came down at night to glisten the trodden green around their wagon . The oxen licked at that same silver melting down their rumps . Peggy Ann spoke brightly of Jack Frost when they crept out from under the dirty wagon cover in each dawn ; but William knit his russet brows , shook his head , made a smacking sound with his lipsIt behooved them , he announced by word and example , to step lively . He must cut , rain or shine , wet or dry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him through , and even extinguished the fire on several occasions . Sometimes the couple had to wring out their wet duds and hang them at the other end of the wagon to avoid a melancholy dripping on the comforters . They learned to build a very small cooking fire under the wagon between the wheels , with blaze at a feeble minimum ; but smoke filled Peggy Ann 's eyes whenever she tended the fire or dumped potatoes into the ashes . For four solid days of blowing rain , the Marbles lived upon burned potatoes and scorched raw pork ; and both of them sniffled and rubbed their raw wet noses . On the fifth day their store of potatoes was finished , they ate nothing but pork . Come Sunday , the young wife had a resourceful notion . She improvised an oven with spider and skillet , and baked corncakes while the rain still blew . Come Monday , clouds lifted and scudded across the lake and carried the polluting rain with them . It had brought down many bright leaves , but autumn began to gleam again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer moist , their colds dried up . The only direct skill which the woman might contribute to the building of the house was in peeling bark from logs to hasten theirp424bleaching . Her husband kept well ahead of her with his chopping and toting of timber . Peggy Ann could hit nothing with the rifle . William tried to teach her , but she insisted on squeezing her eyes shut when she pulled the trigger , purely because this gun was a rifle , and had been designed to kill Mexicans and Indians in battle , or white people in feuds . A shotgun was something else , and seemed somehow more domestic and neighborly ; she had fired a shotgun at birds a few times when she was younger ; one of her brothers owned such a gun . William fetched along an old shotgun from Michigan : the stock was bound with wire , split halfway up , but it still hung together . The gun was very dangerous to use , but neither of them realized this . William loaded it for Peggy Ann and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it half to pieces . She made a small stew of the remains , but shot lodged in the Marbles ' teeth . Peggy Ann felt that she was a lamentable failure as a huntress . She looked at the vast spread piles of logs upended and drying  --  seasoning , was what William called it . He said that he should n't put green timber into a house ; but still most of this would be partly green , he feared . Her heart sank . How would he ever roll up one log upon another , how would he be able to get them as high as the rooftree ? ... What about the roof ? One man . . . and she dared not strain herself trying to help . She had had female troubles frequently ever since she was a girl ; perhaps that was the reason that she conceived no children  --  had conceived none with Phipps , seemed unable to conceivenow . Husband , she said timidly , I would n't want you to get a  --  what they call it ? A  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you wherrit yourself . I wo n't get none . She imagined William straining with tautness , pushing the log high , higher . . . he held it balanced in a crotch-pole , muscles stood ont on his neck and shoulders , he gasped . . . the log slipped and came down and smote him on the head , and oh , dear good Lord , where was he now , where was she ? .. . You was a-grunting , he said kindly in the night , shaking her . Guess I just had a bad dream .... She turned over and put her face against his smelly shirt , put her nose there , smelled the smell of him , found relief and reassurance . Please , no more such dreams . . . . Around them beauty flared though rains had brought part of it down and painted the earth . These linden leaves were coined by God , yellow as golden money . Wild ivy turned blazing scarlet or blushed with lavender in deeper woods . Red oak leaves mixed their crimson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the leaves . A blue haze dwelt in that encircling endless grove acrossp425the lake  --  a grove which lay otherwise untenanted . It was so close that , with a spyglass , if you had one , you could have seen people walking there , were there people to walk . When first William said Spirit Lake , his wife considered the new location in terms of Lake Huron ; once she had lived a while near that shore . Lake Huron was apt to become a turbulent ocean where ships careened in distress and men were drowned , where waves tore harshly down from Mackinac in certain weathers and made the toss-inghorizon as keen and sharp as if it had been drawn with a steel pen . Without conscious thought on the subject Peggy Ann had supposed that perhaps Spirit Lake would be like that , and so a place to be dreaded . She considered it now as cozy  --  almost cozy  --  and it would bear the serene innocence of babyhood if you lived here a whip and understoodmore about it . Oh , yes  --  perhaps people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white men wandering out in canoes ) . Where were the spirits in the lake , and who were they the spirits of ? These yearning worries and wonders remained with the young woman only briefly , for there was too much else demanding her attention : the treading to and fro , and bending , and gathering of firewood , and walking in weeds . Her skirts grew ragged as an old hen 's feathers . Her shoes , uncobbled for such work , burst at the seams . She toiled long by the fire trying to sew them up , while William was dozing even before he climbed into the wagon . Several times during those brief weeks of wagon-dwelling existence they heard guns being fired ; once a shot sounded quite close at hand . William Marble was concerned about the possible approach of hostile Indians . He carried his rifle with him when he went out to chop , because now he had to go a considerable distance away from the shore in order to find young trees of proper dimension . He bade Peggy Ann keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning against a stump while she worked at her bark-stripping . She carried the shotgun with her whenever she went down for water , an awkward thing to do . She wondered whether she might be able to shoot an Indian if required . At least she had shot a squirrel ! Three times during the last days before they reached Spirit Lake they 'd encountered groups of Indians . Peggy could not have found it in her heart to shoot any one of these : they were such pitiful offscourings . Their moccasins were worn to shreds , sometimes they had their feet tied up in rags , but many were barefoot . They trod like wilderness tramps in faded stained remnants of blue goods called trade calico which was kept by storekeepers especially for sale to Indians . Some had scraps of blanket around their shoulders : Beneath the crusted dirt their faces were graven by poverty , illness , every discouragement , every privation ; every disappointment and bereave/ment . Never again would they find a joy ; their eyes told the story . Children were shockheaded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave out their own pitiful cough . Indian men remained at a distance , holding guns ( but not in manner of threat ) , keeping their skeletal-ribbed dogs close . They were staring not at , but past , the movers ; they let the women do the begging . Peggy Ann pressed a handful of sugar into one filthy palm after another . But the palms kept flapping back at her , more and more , the children were reaching too . At last William said , Enough of this , and touched the lead ox with his goad ; off the Marbles went . Indian women moved after them , still begging , and of course the children came along . They all keep saying the same thing , husband ! Whisk , whisk , whisk  --  what do they mean ? Whiskey , that 's what they want . We 've none to give them , and never will have ! Have you forgot ? He smiled back across the flank of a nigh ox , in one of his rare humors . I 'm a Temperance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what manner of Indians these might be . As a girl she had read tales of Pontiac 's War . . . of Catherine , the beautiful Ojibway girl , who warned the handsome English commander . . . of how warriors sawed off their rifles and hid them beneath blankets . She felt that such Indians must have been made of sterner cleaner stuff than these . Probably they took good care of their feathers , washed them when necessary , kept their knives properly sharpened ; probably they smelled no worse than honest cattle ; perhaps they even bathed a-Saturday night . She wondered what sort of tubs they might have in their wigwams , and how ever did they heat the water ? But a stench of these tousled scabrous modern paupers came up across the tailboard of the wagon , and smote her nostrils , and fairly made her sick while they trotted there . She kept calling back severely : No , no more ! No , go away ! Finally the women stopped , stood irresolute , turned back . Children scampered for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made derisive gestures . Some were thumbing their noses . It was the rankest ingratitude . Husband , what are they ? ( She had heard of Sioux Indians , and knew that there were some in the Iowa country , and she believed that Sioux was a name to fear ) . Are these Sioux ? Do n't know what they might be . Maybe Mesquakies . Member other night when we stopped near that inn after we forded the river , and the lady sold you some bacon ? Well , I was talking with a feller inside , and he spoke of Mesquakies . Said that was the name for a certain tribe of them hereabouts somewhere , who would n't join the other Indians in a war . So they called them that , and it means deserters . Do n't know what these are . They stink bad enough to be anything bad !  |p427On  the Marbles went , swaying , grinding through interlacing wet ruts where other people had gone . Peggy craned her neck and looked back : the little cluster of beggars was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , loose wild clouds . Now , at Spirit Lake , Indians were not her principal worry . She grew to hold increasing concern with the problem of William and his log-pile : how would the logs be put up ? How ever might the cabin be raised , especially in its uppermost portions ? Again , though not in midnight delusion , but in actual consideration during the daytime , she shuddered at her notion of the forked stick slipping ( no matter how William 's struggling muscles sought to hold it aloft ) and the log pounding down . In torment she asked him again and again , until he grew annoyed with repeated questions , and cried : Well , I 'll manage !  --  I tolt you so afore , did n't I ? She dared not ask again . It was on the forty-seventh day of their static residence in the wagon at their new homesite ( according to the stubby-penciled check marks in William Marble 's almanac ) that they heard an outcry rising through woods behind them in the evening . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unpleasant  --  calling : Oh . . . arr . . . oh . . . ar .. , oh . Soon the voice grew more distinct A man was calling , Hello the fire ! Hello ! William had grasped his rifle . Peggy could not have reached the shotgun or any other weapon  --  she was so mystified and yet delighted at hearing the voice of one who was undeniably a white man . She gasped , Hai n't no Indian , husband ! They say there 's gangs of robbers out here ! He kept gripping his gun , and looking toward woods away from the lake ; firelight prevented his seeing anything beyond . Belatedly he whirled and whispered , Best get away from the fire ! They both crept from the blaze and stood in half-light amid the underbrush , straining their ears and eyes . Presently there came the thrust of feet moving through drifted dryness . And in that sound of approach rose all the recollection of other autumns and other feet walking in Michigan leaves , or in fallen pungent scraps from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unformed but quite unvexed came smoking into Peggy 's mind as if drawn through her nostrils with the powder of crushed leaves , and an image of little folks building bonfires . Firelight shone intently , they saw a face and eyes , here was a man ducking toward them . He carried a gun , he appeared to have a dead animal hanging over his shoulder , maybe two . Hello to you , newcomers , sounded that same easy vibrant voice.  |p428My  name 's Morris Markham . Set down your gun , Mr. I ai n't a-going to shoot . Slowly William obeyed . What 's the name , stranger ? Marble . William Marble . Been here long ? The man smiled ; he was young , his eyes glittered like eyes of a snake or a bird . He was an uncaught thing before them , elusive yet somehow friendly . Peggy Ann thought : What was that critter Aunt Precious had in a picture ? She said t was a heathen god , not to be admired . A faun ! He threw down two chunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There existed a tan smell about this man which spoke of kinshipprofound but exasperating : the relationship to horns and tails and hoofs , not belonging to any variety of devils , but particular to a woolly four-footed population . Peggy Ann thought of untamed sheep and goats she had heard mentioned ; they did not dwell , she believed , in Iowa , but farther west somewhere . Yet here the man Markham stood goatlike . ( Also he seemed to have the twist of a mink 's body within his own . ) His scanty beard bore a dust of leaves gleaned from some thicket where he had pushed his way through , watching . His hair was stiffeneddown with grease like an Indian 's , and his eyes , as later he sat by the Marbles ' sober domestic blaze , seemed to say in their glitter : Ah-ha , I might arise stealthily and run away amid the oaks , and you should try to catch me . . . try oh try , but you ca n't ! No one can ever catch me or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort in having him come to them  --  a fellow white , but one patently invulnerable to arrows of the wild . Peggy offered shyly a crumbling wedge of journeycake . She put the warm skillet back upon the coals and fried a little more pork  --  all the newcomer wanted  --  he sopped his chunks of cornbread in the grease . He said , appreciatively yet lightly  --  He said that he had eaten a bird at noon . He talked in brief phrases as William Marble talked , but there was a difference . Whereas Marble 's truncated statements seemed to have been lopped and sawed off , this man Markham went like an insect from topic to topic , poised lightly . Lean-to , he said . That was where he dwelt when he was to home . Lean-to smack up against the new cabin of his friends Noble and Thatcher . All from Howard County , Indiana . He thought he had smelled smoke two-three times when he passed near the western shore of Spirit Lake , but he had n't seen no smoke . Reckoned t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish . So he had n't troubled to come nigh before . Oh , yes , lots of folksp429there  --  not on their lake , no other settler that he knew of  --  but on the two lakes below . . . . He called himself a hunter and trapper by trade . Course he could n't do no real trapping till snow flew . Pelts would spoil . Nobles , Thatchers . . . yep , each couple had a little tyke . Then there was the Howes , not much more than a mile distant . Whole raft of youngers they had . . . . Over yonder , near the straits , betwixt East and West Okoboji , there was the Mattocks ; they had a raft of youngers as well . Then four men from Red Wing , Minnesota ( the Red Wing Company , neighbors called them ) . And the Gardners and Luces . Oh , t was quite a settlement . Though kind of thun out . I shoot for the pot , he said . Strictly kill to eat . Then trapping later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap lines now . Seeking good sites , looking for beaver sign . First real snowfall , out go the traps ! How could he determine what was a real snowfall ? Oh , he said . My uncle in Ohio and Indiana : he come from the hills in Vermont long ago , where there was more snow . He said the first snow was a snow you could track a cat through . . . . But here ( his eyes grew brighter with a fancied deviltry )  --  we 've got no cats . So a bobcat will have to do . First snow I can track a bobcat through , out go the traps ! His shrewd gaze had made out the shape of a neatly finished stone chimney built up with loving labor by William . . . peeled logs roosting in their thick V 's alongside , unpeeled logs beyond . How do you calculate to raise your house single-handed ? He glanced briefly at Peggy Ann , saw that she was neither horse nor peasant . He repeated firmly : Single-handed ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if I so elected . Many hands make a milder task . I 'll fetch some folks . William rattled fingers against his tired knee in what was , for him , excessive nervousness . Ca n't pay much . Markham regarded him with surprise . Nobody pays in these parts ! We just help out . Like I hunt for the pot ; then maybe some of the womenfolk can stitch me a new jacket , when I need one and have got the hides . He wore jeans and buckskin , he wore moccasins of an Indian . He went to sleep by their fire with the ease of a limber-legged puppy , even before they had climbed into the wagon . When they looked out in the first grayness of morning , he was gone . He had left them a gift : a quarter of venison , one of the two small quarters he was carrying tied with rawhide strings when he came , and which had looked like two separate animals . All raw and bloodylookingas they were , Peggy Ann appreciated the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limb of a small bur oakp430before he came to the fireside . Beefsteak was weeks and weeks behind them . . . in quiet glee the Marbles stood regarding the slowly swaying gift , with a few ants crawling on it . . . later there would come flies , even in this chilly weather there would be a few flies : great polished greenish-goldish things , to dart and buzz like bees in any warming of the day . Morris Markham returned the next week to warn them in advance of neighborly invasion . Hard-working men would need to eat a lot ; Markham knew a pair of greenhorns when he saw them . Calmly he spoke those very words to Peggy Ann , winking one eye and raising his eyebrow lightly as he laughed . The Marbles had only a keg and a half of pork left , and there was the winter coming on . Markham motioned with his thumb . You got a pretty good larder . Spirit Lake . Show you . He ran down the steep bank along a path worn visibly by Peggy Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line and hook from his pouch , and had cut a young poplar for a pole . He removed his moccasins , rolled up his breeches , waded out into the jouncing water . Markham snapped up some minnows with his hat ( or were they minnows ?  --  small fish of some sort , driven into shallows by enemies , where waves were torn beyond the weeds ) . Markham split a shot with his knife , bit it tight upon the line , and tossed the hook far out . When it was struck and when the bait was gorged down , he battled a large pike , by use of pole in his left hand , and right hand clutching the line . He lost the first fish , it ran like a thin wolf in the water and tore loose against a tangle of weed . But the man merely shrugged , bent the hook again between his fingers , looked at it critically , whetted it with a pebble and spittle ; then on went another minnow , out went the bait again . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said . Notice how those eyes bug out ? He caught a second , smaller , and then a third fish , an enormous creature . It champed wide tooth-laden jaws , and flopped and twisted after Markham had swung it in past the boulders . Oh , that must go nine or ten ! Reckon we 've got enough fish . Peggy Ann was wondering how she 'd ever clean them ; she had cleaned only small trout , in all her life before . Same way , said Morris Markham . They 're easier , if anything , big like this . Club them on the head . Scale them fore they 're gutted . Easier to hold ; then just slit the meat off outside the ribs . He put away his hook and line , and again laughed at the lake and said it was a larder which never would fail ( except when the crossgrainedfish grew ornery and would n't bite at all ) . Kindly he scaled one fish and left Peggy Ann to do the others . Perspiring and trembling happily at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marble called down a Thank-You from his scaffold of saplings built against the chimney top . He said that he would have gone out to hunt  --  yes , he could shoot , a little  --  but he thought it wiser to dress off the chimney first . Said Markham , We 'll just see what 's skittering around . He shook his head at the old shotgun which was offered , and patted his own rifle . He faded deftly away through the brush , making much less noise now than he had made when he walked toward their fire the first time . Twice they heard the sound of his rifle , then he was back . He had two turkeys , both with the heads shot off cleanly . They just set up and begged ! Encouraged by Peggy Ann 's praise and by Marble 's terse appreciation , Morris Markham now reckoned that he would kill a deer . He went to the woods again and prowled until dusk , but was forced to return empty-handed . He said he reckoned the two shots of his rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer away from the vicinity . Again he slept by the Marble fire , and what a reassurance it was to have him there . And what a reassurance it must be to the Nobles and Thatchers , to be aware of him in his lean-to built against their cabin wall  --  whatever sort of people they were , whatever fears they might have entertained if Markham had not been there . It turned cooler in the middle of the night , it drizzled for hours , the fire almost went out . Markham awakened , brought to his feet by drifting wetness . He found nearby a great claw-bottom stump which Marble had shunned for fuel because it was half rotten , and also infested with ants . The ants did not seem to bite Markham as he carried the thing . . . he knew how fire would eat into the punk inside the stump 's shell and hold and glow in the face of almost any downpour . He staggered up with the weight of the thing clamped against his chest by the grip of bent steely arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered the stump fairly atop the fire . Flames were smothered for a time , and smoke poured out all around ; but soon there was a sly jet of color from one internal hollow , then from another ; so the fire caught and held , the fire was saved , rain still fell and hissed . All this Peggy Ann witnessed because she had Gone Out ; she had to Go Out ; she could not use the vessel in the wagon for fear the stranger lying so close would hear the gush . So , with great effort to proceed in silence , she made her way past her husband 's feet and under lines of hanging clothes , to the front of the wagon ; she slipped out over the wheel , stepped down to the hub , withdrew into bushes . Then she returned , saw the hunter rising , and she watched , wound in her shawl , while he worked at keeping a comfort for them . . . . Oh , mercy !  --  now , stained blanket and all , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scatter of embers where the storm-time cooking fire had burned ! Of course there were nothing but scattered bits of charcoal left ; they had not had a fire there for some time ; but Peggy quailed to think of any individual bedding himself with such aplomb amid ashes and charcoal . At last , shivering in petticoat and shawl , she had to return to the wagon willy-nilly . She prayed that Markham would not stir , and that , if not asleep , he would pretend to be asleep . He did not move , his bundle did not twitch . The young woman soared up over the wheel like a flicker going to her home in a stub , and quickly was safe beside William . . . . She did not know it , but under the wagon Morris Markham smiled compassionately before he returned to sleep . Next forenoon the sound of a wagon came banging . Markham heard it first and went to guide the neighbors . It was thought that perhaps five neighbors would come , and now appeared only two , accompaniedhowever by another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the Noble-Thatcher house to rest his teams for a few days . Skelton was bound from Minnesota to the Woodbury County country where friends of his were planning to take up land . He claimed to be a joiner by trade , and was not averse to lending his services for a day or so ( this he kept saying in firm tones , as if calling attention to his own generosity ) . Joseph Thatcher could not come . His wife was lying sick again  --  it seemed that she was often ill since the birth of her child ; nor could Doctor Harriott come , he was attending her . But here was Alvin Noble ( and , as a youth in Indiana years before had held the same opinion , Peggy Ann thought that Noble was appropriately named ) . Bertell Snyder and the Grangers were far behind in the accumulation of a winter 's wood supply , so they did not appear ; and Bill Granger must return to Red Wing soon . Harvey Luce came . . . he had been designated by Markham as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Markham amended cautiously , I guess instead it 's God-dreading . ) The narrow wagon was piled with tools which the helpers thought they might need . Peggy Ann Marble observed that these people had neglected to fetch any blankets .... And that dreadful Skelton man ... she was glad to learn that he was not a neighbor , would not be settled nearby . He reminded her of a blacksmith she had known back in Michigan . ( The smith was a garrulous monster possessed of many misinformations concerning judges , Members of Congress , the Presidenthimself . He always Had It On Good Authority , or , Somebody Told Him But He was n't At Liberty To Give The Name . ) Emory Skelton displayed the same loose smile , the same pendulous lower lip turning out to reveal large yellow teeth . Young Mrs. Marble suspected that he might be filled with gossip and opinions no more substantial than those of Blacksmith Rath . He kept telling William Marble , forp433instance , that Marble had the posts for his house laid out mistakenly : the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Harvey Luce grew silent and appeared . to show a hurt whenever one of the others chanted any fragment of a secular song while working that day . Mr. Luce sang , but his songs were all Hymns of Praise . Instead of cursing , as any ordinary human would have done when his finger was pinched between two logs , Harvey only shook the wounded member , blinked with humility , let his hymn arise again . It was apparent that he enjoyed being a beast of burden , enjoyed being put upon by others , if they would only be willing to take advantage of him . He accepted severe bumps and squeezes ( he suffered three that first day ) as a Saint might have welcomed stigmata . ... T was confusing to have so many people about , and all at once and all together . They seemed like a herd . T was odd , and a little aggravating , and a little frightening as well . Peggy Ann wished that the distance from their homes was not so great : then some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seemed like a throng , and now five men stood here together , and four of them were strangers  --  that is , Morris Markham was still a stranger , although not a complete one . The settlers were all big  --  two tall , and two thick  --  and all were hairy , or at least stubbly . They sounded like men , they ate like men , they talked like men , they smelled like men . Oh , dear ! . . . They had been polite enough on arrival . They said , Howdy Ma'am , Howdy Mrs. , Good day to you , or at least mumbled something . But soon they paid not as much attention to her as they might have paid to a squaw , and Mrs. Marble was indignant proportionately . She had first risen that morning when the sky above the eastern shore of Spirit Lake was a fading hollow strip of cherry and purple . But there was not enough light ; she went back under the covers again ; her husband only grunted and turned , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work . Then she was up again when the cherry had paled to color of the mild cosmos in a garden , when the purple had paled to warmhearted blue . Then she could see . She had been busy with fire and turkeys and cornbread ever since . She took several small onions from their precious soggy store and sacrificed them into a queer stuffing she made of corn meal and pork fat . One of the turkeys was overcooked and almost fell apart before it was pulled apart , and some of the stuffing did land in the fire . The other bird was scorched seemingly on all sides , but actually one side was almost raw underneath the charring ; and on the other side the bird had burned clear through until the bones blackened . At home , and when younger , Peggy Ann might have been in tears . But this wild lakeside , she thought , was no place for tears . She clamped her jaws together until a loose tooth throbbed at the pressure . She reset thep434precious brass pins which hiked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went on serving food . She had no platter ; both of her platters had been broken between Linn County and Spirit Lake , as had many other dishes , because of improper packing . She had not known how to pack things in a wagon for prairie travel where there were no roads . She did not realize the extent of the jolting and jouncing  --  enoughto bump a body 's teeth from her head !  --  and she was positive that was how she had loosened one tooth of her lower jaw  --  by biting down savagely , when they almost upset in that ford on the Boone River . She served out food on an oblong tin tray , and it did look too distressing ; what would her cousins have thought ? The tray had been advertised as a genuine japanned article , but most of the japanning was gone by now ; and so of course were the figments of daisies which adorned it . The Marbles owned two three-tined forks and two two-tined forks ; those were all the forks they had , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men preferred to eat with their hands . They sucked loose flesh . from the fowl , licked their lips , licked their fingers . . . . She strove to forget that Mr. Markham had , early that morning , inquired so innocently about her stuffing preparations for the turkeys that it seemed he was twitting her . He said that the Indians were reputed to roast birds , guts and all , whenever they had a mind to . And when Peggy Ann expressed horror , he said that the Indians actually ate the guts . She was almost sick on the spot  --  and how could she cook ?  --  but cook she did . And how might five men ever consume the bulk of two turkeys at a single meal ? But they did . She saw them do it , she shuddered in the seeing . They stood in dirty flannels , dirty jeans , dirty coats , with dirty hats on the backs of their tousled heads ( Morris Markham looked out of place among them in shine and wrinkle of grimed deerskins ) . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarseness , making him into some kind of frontier vagabond along with themselves . They stood waving scorched drumsticks or chunks of corn pone as they talked . They talked of logs , and of a settlement which was building up near at hand . They called it Springfield . There were said to be six or seven families at Springfield already . No , Mr. Skelton insisted , there were nine families ; and they had a store too . ... It was only eighteen miles across the prairie . The Wood brothers , said Markham . I been there afore this . There 's some brothers , name of Wood , have got that store . Traded some traps off to them . Shot a young bear near at hand , backed the meat over there ; we made the trade . William Marble inquired enviously : Sell them the pelt too ? ( IIe would have liked very much to shoot a bear . ) Alvin Noble said with appreciation : No , Mr. He gave the pelt to my wife . It 's real nice for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes smiled across at Morris Markham . Peggy Ann sensed a sympathy and indulgence between the two men , and felt better becauseof it . Still it seemed that for a good hour and a half after their arrival , the neighbors did much talking , much eating , and no building whatsoever . Then , while she was sorting the greasy remnants of turkey , and saving what she could from the wreckage , she looked up ; and all in a minute they had fallen to work . They knew just how they were going to proceed , and where . William had marked the area in front of the chimney with stakes . Emory Skelton insisted volubly that a puncheon floor should be laid first , but Marble explained that he had no puncheons split for the purpose ; he did n't want that sort of wood floor  --  to trip and fall upon , to have things go down between the cracks . He was going to build a stone floor . And next season ( time allowing , he added cautiously ) he 'd be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had plenty of rocks to hand , the way he did . Logs were laid out encompassing the rectangular barren patch of earth which Marble had leveled , between a large oak and a larger basswood , near the brink of the lakeside precipice . It was Mr. Noble 's task to stand with sharp axe ready , notching the logs evenly and cleanly as fast as they were set down , and in between times smoothing off the ends  --  dovetailing , he called it  --  while the other men strained , lifted , carried . Mind me tomorrow , said Noble to William . Before we start home , I 'll show you how to split shakes . With these willing people actually beginning to produce the house before her eyes , Peggy felt a lessening of annoyance with them ... Soon she was almost abject in a secret but emphatic shame . The neighbors were to collect no wage for this chore ; Markham had been very definite about that . Here they were , chopping and pinching and grunting , and saying , Hold on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up we go ! Ah.hh . . . uhhh ! They performed the task of slaves or of friends ; but they were not actuated by dread of a penalty which shirking slaves must hold , nor spurred by love of her and her husband ( for three of them had never seen the Marbles before ) . There was something more than that . She tried to decide what it might be , she could not decide . By this time Peggy Ann was disgusted thoroughly with her own earlier prim aversions . She must try to make it up to the men somehow . She smiled upon them shyly when she went to the lake and came from it . They were so busy that they did not even look at her . She had a broad red burn across three fingers , and little smarting peppery burns scattered all over her nose and cheeks , and on her lips , where the grease had come spattering . She thought it a light price to pay for benefits awarded . No longer need she be plagued by thep436notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log . Bone and muscle and solid wits of generous strangers had spared him such suffering , and she should be grateful forever . Peggy took a glowing sacrificial pride in her domestic ordeal . With a chip and handfuls of leaves she had scrubbed out most of the slime adhering to the inside of the pork keg , and  --  with top pressed down firmly , and weighted by a heavy stone  --  she 'd used the thing for safekeeping the fish which Markham caught the day before . He had shown her how to make a little cairn of stones , and set the keg firmly in the shallows . .. Course , some large animal might come along and steal your fish ! But there 's small animals could come a-thieving too , if you kept the fish on land . So take your choice . No bear or other creature had raided during the night ; naturally they expected none to come during the day . The pike were firm , cool , in fine condition . Some day , she thought , they would have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The men were of a will to work as long as daylight sustained them . Sweet colors of sunset reminded Peggy of nothing so much as petunias grown in her mother 's garden , far back at the East . There was an associated comfort in recognizing that her mother had had a house ; and now she too would have a house of her own  --  even in this lonely reckless place . In time ( she looked through smoke of cooking at the wall of mortised logs , and men climbing there ) she too would have petunias . Her husband could saw an old keg in half , and thus they would have a petunia bucket on each side of the front door ; and the mystery of other sunsets long to come would rise from behind the cabin and find their tints reflected ; dawns would discover the flowers . She thought benignly of the growing house and all that it might hold . But at this moment it bulked harsh , a stranger thing , and was an actual encumbrance to the woodland , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never cooked fish before , as no woman had ever cooked fish before . She longed to see stars of pleasure quickeningin the eyes of her assorted heroes , she longed to listen to their delighted exclamations . She soaked fragments of turkey stuffing left from noon , made a paste of the mixture , got the paste too thin , poured in more meal . She had no eggs to form her batter  --  she longed for eggs  --  considered that perhaps Mr. Markham could find eggs for her somewhere amid prairie grass , or hidden in thickets  --  wild birds ' eggs . Yet winter was not far away . T was likely that even untamed undomesticateduneducated hens knew better than to build nests and start laying in such a season . . . . She sifted in a little more meal , prayed that the stuff would stick . . . . Vinegar , that 's what Aunt Precious had used the year before . Peggy Ann remembered : a peddler came by , pushing a two-wheeled cart , crying that he had taken fish from the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Precious considered that the price was dear , and told the man so , as she stood counting coins out of her purse . But Aunt put the little speckled fish to bake , and now her niece recalled with joy a spicy odor  --  vinegar , t was  --  each slab of fish anointed lightly as it lay steaming . Aunt Precious sprinkled black peppercorns into the pan , added two leaves of bay . . . Oh , joy !  --  in the little basket tied high in the wagon , the basket which held her few papers of spices , Peggy Ann had both peppercorns and bay leaves ! William stood above her as she knelt in the dusk . He asked tersely : Bout ready to feed us again , woman ? Her hot face turned with indignation ; but his eyes had disappeared in their deep sockets , he was grinning under his new beard . This was a joke designed to show the other men who trooped behind him that commonly he did not address his wife as a slave or as an inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lay inverted as a lid for the deep spider , and found steam and aroma , and the usual volley of grease specks trying to maim her . First batch is done , husband . Please to fetch the tray off the wagon 's tail . He brought the tray . With care she ladled out a cargo of juicy chunks . The other men sniffed appreciatively . There 's journeycake ; here t is , hot in this tin . Alvin Noble cleared his throat politely . His mild dreamy voice asked : You 're not a-going to set and eat with us , Mrs. Marble ? She laughed . This spider 's only so big ; got to put in a fresh batch of fish , and watch it . Twill be done in a jiffy . The men were very tired . They had worked without ceasing since the sun was high ; now the sun was gone . Last metal of its reflection sparkled amid tree trunks on the slope toward the west . The workers did not stand to eat their night meal as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking with hope at the tray and a large pie tin which William placed on a log among them . The broken whining voice of Harvey Luce spoke : If no man raises objection , might you be so good as to let me ask a Blessing on this food ? We did n't ask none at noon !  --  he added accusingly . Go ahead , Mr. Luce , said Markham agreeably . But do n't take too long . Luce stood with eyes squeezed shut . Already it was dark enough under the trees for firelight to wash unevenly across his broad childish face . Dear Lord , we ask Thy indulgence upon this provender , and those of us who would eat of it . Grant that it may nourish us to do Thy will , and serve Thee eternally , and sing Thy praises  --   |p438All  the men had their heads bowed , and Peggy Ann bowed also beside the fire . But she stole a glance at Morris Markham  --  he seemed restive , stirring on his haunches as he crouched , but twisting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned down . She thought of a small boy condemned to a dreary session of church : ritual , prayers , sermons which he did not understand . She could not help smiling at the notion. - Grant that he who is without sin among us shall cast the first stone ( At whom , it was not clear. )  --  And thus no stones shall forever be cast . Let us feed forever only in the Garden of Mercy , and only on the fruits which Thou hast put before usThere was coughing , swaying . Reluctantly Harvey Luce clenched his fists , then opened his hands  --  defeated and thwarted almost as much as he longed to be . He was the sort of man , thought Peggy ( and with a consciousness far removed from Holiness ) , for whom one felt contempt and affection in the same moment . You longed to do something to help him . If you were wise you knew that you never could.  --  We ask this indulgence and we petition Thy loving-kindness in the name of Christ Jesus . Amen . Never did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Luce turned away from him . The others drew close to the log ; then impelled by starvation , Harvey Luce swung lamely round to join them . . . . There was a gesturing , a reaching forth , a pulling back . Go ahead , Mr.No , after you , Brother . Let Marble go ahead , he 's boss . No , IMarkham cried in amusement : Tarnation !  --  and grabbed with both hands . Dog-tired from bending , lifting , kneeling , stirring , trudging  --  feeling more witch than woman , her face and fingers smeared with goose grease against the soreness of burns  --  Margaret Ann Marble felt a joy as she observed the diners ' voracity even in their silence . She was aware that man after man turned to look at her curiously while he ate . They lifted tiny pike bones from between their lips  --  they did not throw them carelessly on the ground , as some of them had tossed turkey bones . They put their bones in the corner of the japanned tray . The new batch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done now ! Please to fetch the platter again ! She scraped jackstraw bones into the fire before she heaped more pike from the spider . Man alive ... she heard Noble saying it , heard him with glee . . . . I do wish Mrs. Noble could learn to cook fish like this !  |p439That  night there were four wrapped sausages beside the fire instead of one . In the wagon , against her inert husband , Peggy Ann slept the sleep of the weary , the burnt , the satisfied . Steel of late autumn entered into invisible framework of night air . The more talkative wild population had gone away into the South , or had had their voices stilled by maturity . A weasel slew a careless young owl in the basswood beside the newborn cabin . An hour later that same weasel was slain by an older wiser owl of another species . A wolf , not gaunt by any means , came padding from the prairie , smelled distrustfully the smells of man and man 's cookery , withdrew as daintily and hauntingly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought to fetch a blanket  --  except Markham , of course , who always carried his ; he never knew just when he would sleep in the woods , or probably where . But Peggy had producedcomforters and home-woven woolen blankets from their small supply . She quailed at the thought of her precious bedclothing being mixed with boots and embers and fresh clay upon the trodden ground , but there was no help for it . These people had given much  --  she must give as well , no matter how much sousing she would have to manage in the tub which had been tied on the back of their wagon all the way from Linn County . With morning she forgot such small woes . Morris Markham came to offer a fresh string of fish before ever she had the tea a-boiling . A new kind  --  he called these silver bass  --  and said they were very good for the pan ; and he went down to the shore and cleaned and scaled the whole catch himself when he saw that she had so much to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spider was hot , and they asked however did she do such things with fish , and what was the magic she worked . Just a mite of vinegar and some peppercorns and bay Ieaves . I 'd he glad to spare you some , she said eagerly . We got plenty vinegar in our wagon , said Skelton . But what did you say ?  --  Corns ? Peggy Ann felt rich and courtly , like the storied benevolent lady of a brick mansion , as she prepared tiny packets of spices for all three men  --  quite ignoring Morris Markham , who preferred to be ignored where the exigencies of civilized households were concerned . Noble admitted also to owning vinegar at home ; but Harvey Luce only shook his head and smiled sadly when he was asked the same question . Peggy Ann insisted on escorting this persecuted saint to the wagon and getting out her brown jug . She poured vinegar into the old wooden canteen which he carried , until the canteen was quite full . It was for his wife , she kept saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Prides himself on being a lay preacher !  --  Markham came top440whisper to her , in late afternoon when the cabin 's final rafter had been fastened in place . Reckon he 'd like it , if you asked him to say a prayer on this new house ere we leave . Course I shall ; we 'd be humbly grateful ! Peggy Ann looked with awe at the pile of peeled ugliness which had not been there a day and a night and a day before . Houses do n't just grow , she thought . Takes men to make them . She would not care how endlessly Harvey Luce prayed , nor how fulsomely . Alvin Noble was long in teaching William Marble to split shakes . They worked at some distance in the woods where proper lumber was at hand ; the others trailed to their side to listen and observe . Then the builders tramped back from the grove , and stood looking at the house , in some ways admiring their handiwork , but already critical of it , finding things which were wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there was- no need for a cabin of such size , just for the two of them . T would be mean to heat ; the chinking would take a long time ; take a nine-by-twelve  --  that should be ample for any couple . Emory Skelton knew loads of folks in Minnesota who had no larger . Some with big familiesThe woman and I , said Marble slowly . We do n't want to be bumping into each other . Twelve-by-fourteen hai n't none too big . ... Yes , he would get the roof on promptly . He was deeply appreciativeof the lesson he 'd had in splitting the long thin shingles . Roof first , then chinking . Chips first , driven in by a mallet , then plaster to fill and cover . Floor could wait for the last . You got your windies to think about , cried Skelton . Now , some uses greased paper , some uses buckskin . Paper lets in more light but two n't last . I did know some folks up Mendota way who had their windies et by varmintsMarble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage . Peggy Ann , listening as belatedly she scrubbed the noonday skillets , knew that already he was considering the stone floor-imagininghow his chisel would feel , going into the solid rock  --  delighting in the clever shaping , the tessellatingBrothers , warned Harvey Luce . He bared his dark-quilled head to the clear windy sky and closed his eyes against distractions of this world . The men all looked at their boots or at the ground . Peggy Ann left the fireside to come and stand devoutly downcast behind them . This time no one made sounds or writhings . There was no food waiting to be eaten . For all the plaintive slavishness with which he faced existence , Harvey Luce had an illusion . . . it was not necessarily original ; probablyhe had borrowed it from someone else whom he admired ; but the illusion prevailed , he could voice it . He spoke of Hebrew children in the wilderness , he mentioned Biblical rivers and deserts , and inp441effect likened them to this pretty little series of lakes beside which the settlers stood . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sincerity was ruling . He implored that they be spared from Philistines , roaring lions , adders , the snare of the fowler . He practically demanded manna , and in that strange confusion of the zealous layman he seemed to threaten God Himself with the wrath of Christ , if no manna were forthcoming . He kept referring to the new cabin as a hearthside  --  which Peggy Ann thought must please her husband well enough , since William considered that the stone hearth was the most important thing about the structure . There came a round of solemn handshaking . Peggy Ann offered her hand and her thanks to each of the men . Morris Markham gave his foxy grin , and went gliding along the lake toward Minnesota , while the other three yoked up and turned on their southward trail . Before they left , Peggy Ann Marble presented to Harvey Luce the two turkey wishbones which she had saved and cleaned . The Noble child was an infant ; but Luce was said to have a boy of four or so , and a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Peggy Ann sent the wishbones , adorned with tufts of pink and blue yarn to make them festive , and wrapped in a scrap of an old copy of the Burlington Hawkeye . Day after day tight-clinging oaken foliage shriveled and curled beneath the sun . Squirrels gargled a staccato chorus , and straying winds whirled loose leaves with a smell like cinnamon . Peggy trudged with a basket , picking up black walnuts . She mashed off their tarry hulls upon a rock which was soon painted to the same rich umber of seeming permanency as were her hands . The nuts were placed in the new loft to dry . William said that they would have decent planks up there if anyone ever started a sawmill in the vicinity ; meanwhile he regretted that he could not build a loft of stone . The new house took every second of Marble 's waking time . It did not take all his strength , it could not take all his strength , he had power enough and to spare . But days grew shorter  --  there was so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shakes for the roof and the anchoring thereof  --  the longer split pieces , not much longer or wider or thicker than shakes , for the loft floor  --  the ladder to be built against the wall  --  the one-legged bedstead in a corner ( Morris Markham came by , and he called the one-legged bed a Prairie Rascal  --  he said that 's what they were called )  --  WindowsGrinning and enthused , William took down three milled window frames , each patterned to admit six separate panes of glass . He took these down from where they had been tied beneath the wagon bows . Peggy Ann had seen them all along and had not realized what they were ; she thought that they were swinging racks to put things on ; theyp442had served so during the journey . But now he lifted out also a small solid box which had been at the back end of the wagon , alongside his stonecutter 's tools . What was that ? Oh , lead , he 'd said carelessly . Lead for running bullets , woman . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence she believed him . Now he unpacked the box with a devotion like fear . Windowpanes , two dozens of them . Eighteen for the three windows  --  six for spares , or perhaps for another window if William ever decided to cut one and could build the sash and frame . Peggy Ann got down on her knees to watch . Not one broken thus far !  --  he kept crying . No . . . intact ! . . . no .. intact ! When he lifted delighted gaze she saw sweat on his forehead ... . Every one survived . That glazier in Linn knew how to pack ! Better'n me , said the wife sadly . With my dishes . Well , you ai n't no glazier . Ai n't supposed to be . Have we putty , too , husband ? He give me a man-sized daub of it ; I can work it up with oil if it 's too dried out ; he tolt me how . When one considered the perils and complications of this enterprise , the stone floor was quite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to construct a primitive furnace and burn some lime in order to make the proper mortar . He did not need much mortar , for the cracks were not wide . He had put his stones together as a jeweler might have arranged gems . But all stones were precious to this man , they were as sacred to him as they were rumored to be to some Indians . In a November daybreak , with the lake as gray as the sky , the sky as wind-torn and threatening as the lake , William Marble climbed into the wagon and awakened his wife . Thought 1 'd tell you . Want to come see ? She 's dry and set ! He had been up for the better part of an hour , and Peggy Ann had never heard him dress and go . She arose on one elbow , reaching the other hand to push back wisps of hair which had strayed from nightcapconfinement . William , she said . ( Sometimes she addressed him thus , especially when awakened suddenly from sleep , or perhaps in passion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The floor . I just tried it . I could n't rest no longer but had to get up and see . This is the day she should be set , mortar and all . And she is . I could n't even hammer her loose with a billet . . Weather threats were a jest  --  the fakery of dawn which prevailedoften in this region . Clouds flew away , the pure windy sky shone clear as a knife blade . Peggy could not understand why the first thing she wanted to do in their house was to make the bed . With some sense of shame she tried to explore this impulse and the motive prompting it . Inner delicacy , if not wisdom , prevented her from suggesting to her husband that she entertained what he would have called queer notions . She supposed in a way that it was because all people were born in beds ; and their initial remembrance , usually , was of snuggling up to a warm body . While busy through the hours , planning with conscious brain , and directing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she grasped at the skirts of a wispy idea which she feared was born in shame and nourished on lustful juices . This was the thought that there was more to beds than the mere fact of children being born in them . The children had to be made first . Father and mother had to get together , and they did that in bed . Peggy Ann 's cheeks grew hot as she considered the deviltry of such a thought ; yet stubbornly she persisted in countenancing it . Husband , you know we talked : we 've got only the two feather beds , and no pad nor mattress to go underneath . I member when I was maybe ten or twelve : t was at Aunt Precious 's house , when I was little . Pa lay failing at home , and I had to stay there with her , count of the sickness . Well , she kept nothing beneath her feather beds . She held that it was n't healthy to do so . And no matter how I plumped them up when I made my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fair sawing into my back  --  little as I was , light as a featherI planned on straw , replied William , but there ai n't no straw hereabouts . I could go cut some more prairie hay . But that would leave you sole alone ; and there 's all the heavy lifting , and you could n't get chests and boxes and kegs out of that wagon thout hurting yourself . We did talk of leaves , husband . I think leaves would serve . They 're just so thick under all the trees , and I could get big armloads in a jiffy . And they 'd pack down solid but not too solid . You try it . But I aim to cut some extra prairie hay later . And delay your leaf-gathering till the sun has dried the leaves sufficient . Twould n't do to put them in the bed trough while they 're damp . All morning the two of them hauled and trotted . Peggy Ann kept looking up at the sky , numbering new-formed clouds , hoping that none would cover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen foliage throughout the grove seemed warm , springy . Then she filled the trough of the one-legged bed with a pungent harvest . She guessed that before long the leaves would crumble to dust ; yet she thought their veins and stems would still provide a degree of cushioning . In nervous ritual she placed her feather beds atop the heap , plumping them repeatedly until it seemed that every goose feather must stand alive and quivering . She tucked in smoothly the yellowish linenp444sheets which her Cousin Lettie had stitched for her as a matrimonial gift , and which she had never used before . Then came light woolen blankets , then comforters . Hai n't dead of winter yet . Woman , we 'll roast . I just want us comfy .... She puffed up the pillows . Earlier she had held hope of a mystic fire lighted by her own hands for the first time upon that hearth , but this could never be ; already paler stones showed their scorching . William had lighted fire after fire while lie was completing the chimney , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reasoned , perhaps it was better that way . What could be more sacred than fires built , actually , during the long birth of the structure ? Before nightfall they were installed . The wagon was drawn up beside a rough pole pen wherein the oxen stood chewing , and soon lay chewing . At first the Marbles had let their critters roam but they strayed far . Either William or Peggy had to waste time searching them out and driving them back . Yet the animals must be turned loose to graze , and had to wander to some distance in order to feed well . No form of tethering or hobbling was practicable because of the profusion of bushes and trees and resulting entanglements . Already the heaviest ox had been brought to his knees violently , with strain and injury resulting .... The Marbles had brought no bells . But with resource William sacrificed a portion of a tin spout which he kept tied under the wagon , and which had suffered various squeezings and bendings on the journey . This spout , hammered into workable conditionagain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain into a barrel from the eaves , as in Michigan . But of course they had not been able to fetch along a barrel big enough to do any good ; there was no cooper 's shop in the neighborhood as yet ; and just how might anyone construct eaves spouts beneath a shake roof ? Maybe William could devise a series of wooden troughs later on , if he found time . ( He had dreams of a stone cistern to receive water . ) At Spirit Lake he held little compunction about cutting off the end of the tin spout and hammering out four crude bells for the oxen to wear . The clappers were made of bullets : the oxen gave forth a jolly tinny muting as they moved soberly among trees . They always stayed togetherbecause they were friends . Come late afternoon , they were herded leisurely homeward . By the time snow fell thick , Marble proposed to have finished an adequate stable , made roughly of poles insulated with grass and leaves , with a sod roof above the poles . Again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cut prairie hay until the wagon was piled high . That hay was a joy : brilliantlittle flowers of autumn tangled amidst the grasses when first the Marbles arrived , and now were dessicated like spices by the frosts.  |p445Was  it often in time , Peggy Ann wondered , that men fed their cattle on flowers ? In the first coming of dusk there was no sound save the crackling of a new fire at a new hearthside ( almost lovingly the woman rememberedHarvey Luce and his prayer ; it would have affected Luce to know of her thought ) and the occasional crinkling melody of oxen bells which William had forgotten to remove for the night . Also steam forced from the iron pot with a sound . Peggy Ann took her hooked poker and lifted the heavy lid to see whether beans were done . They had bubbled there for hours after soaking through the night ; and she had put in the pork and sorghum and vinegar an hour earlier . Ready yet ? asked the hungry man . What you think ? She offered a spoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cautiously he sucked and tasted . Seems first-rate to me ! Let us give the corncake another few minutes ; then I 'll serve us . At last they sat on their stools at the little puncheon table , two surviving plates of rose-and-cream ironware before them , the one surviving dish of blue-and-white ironware in the middle , corncake hot upon the japanned tray . William was professedly a religious man ( true  --  he and Peggy Ann had first seen each other in church , and had courted in religious shadow ) but always he was reluctant to voice prayers or graces . Nevertheless tonight he ducked his head hastily over his plate . Dear God , he blurted , for this we thank Thee ! He took his wife by such surprise that barely did she have time to turn her face down , and realize that he was asking a Blessing ; then he was reaching for the beans . When they finished eating , William went to see after the critters , to remove their bells belatedly , and to fetch more wood for morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodpile right up against this door , he said . Snow might fall deep . T was printed in Mr. Plumbe 's book , cried Peggy Ann accusingly , that this country never has more than a foot of snow . Indians say different . Well , what Indians do you know , husband ? That Morris Markham , he 's met up with them . He says that sometimesthere 's awful snows . I mean to have a mountain of wood where we can put our hands on it . .. In firelight the Marbles prepared themselves for the night . They were disconcerted by unfamiliar brightness : flames fell lower and lower , but still there was more light than they were accustomed to in the wagon . I smell something , said William , in bed.  |p446Must  be the sheets . Why would they smell queer ? Count of the lavender . They were old sheets first , and in the family , but when she made us the gift of them Cousin Lettie had cut them down more to modern size , and she sewed new hems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's the way I left them folded in the little chest . Course , I just took them out today . Do you think  --  ? Her whisper fell lower . But his question had burnt a new whimsy into her brain.  --  Think they smell bad ? No , just queer . But kind ofSweet ? Yes , he replied decisively . Sweet . Peggy lay staring up at unfamiliar designs of stiff light and shadow where spread the loft floor , their ceiling . Later she thought that William must be sleeping ; yet there rose no sound of heavy breathing . Then he began to wriggle around in bed , he turned and put his back against her . He was the first one into bed that night . . . and she did not know . . . in the wagon box which had been their bed ever since leaving Linn County , usually William had worn his shirt , the heavy shirt of daytime occupation . So it smelt of him , of his days , of his sweat . He was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smells she had known she liked his the better . . . . It was distressingly indelicate even to consider a comparison of smells of men . She wondered if any other woman had ever done so . Probably only wicked women had . ... Sometimes . . . yes . . . sometimes she felt very wicked . Could be the leaves , she said softly , not as if to disturb him . What say ? I thought maybe you was asleep . I meant that smell : could be leaves , too , as well as lavender . Soon his broad hard hand came to slide across her bosom , to exploreand blend with the breast farthest away from him , her right breast . She began to stiffen and thrill to his touch . How wonderful !  --  she thought with the first little lights flashing before her closed eyes . How remarkable ! His hand , forever so tough and firm with rocks and tools , so gentle with me . She murmured , Ca n't stand it breathed his question close to her ear  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question . I mean  --  t is the feather bed , I guess . She giggled nervously . . . . William , she whispered , using the rare name . We 're not customed to a bed . Seems so soft , and sinking way down , kind of . We been in that wagon so long , just on comforters . Well  --  I mean  --  We did have these feather beds . But they went so hard , gainst the floor of the wagonYep , they did . His durable voice had grown tender in this beginning of intimacy , along with the smoothness , the provocative touch of his fingers . William , she gasped . Could we  --  ? Do you spose t would be all right  --  could we get out of bed , and  --  ? I mean  --  down on the floor  --  ? He was silent for so long , considering the notion  --  and even withdrawinghis hand  --  that she feared he was disgusted or offended . You mean on the stones ? he asked doubtfully . I could pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft enough . T is just  --  Oh , this going way deep into the leaves ! She giggledwildly again . Agreeable to me . He started to push himself into a position to climb across her , if necessary , from the corner where the bed was built . William . . . again . . . so tiny and furry she made the word , it becameonly a kitten 's sound . Would you humor me ? He was resting half upright , his arm extended down , his hand braced in bedclothing . Words tumbled furiously from her mouth , tumbled out of heart and soul . . . because of guilt she contemplated , a sensual deed she would perform . Would you mind going outside whilst I got things ready ? He chuckled . You 're a funny one . We 've always took off our clothes together in the wagon , hai n't we ? And when we had our cottage down in Linn . I know . But now  --  this night  --  the fire 's still giving off so much light  --  We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that explained everything . Whatever you say . So she pushed her feet and legs out of bed , and drew the long nightgown to cover them . William crept around past her and stepped down to the stones . She saw that he was wearing a nightshirt ; she had n't observed this before , yet of course the material had felt different , different from his shirt . He jammed his bare feet into boots , threw an old gray shawl around his shoulders ( only of late , or in chilly rains , had it been cold enough for him to use that shawl when he walked forth ) . He withdrew the stout iron pipe he had brought from Linn County to bar the door ; and so it had been barred on this first night . But he lifted it from flanges , stood it in the doorside corner , and went calmly into a frosty world without looking back . Moonlight was admitted for a moment  --  Peggy Ann had forgotten about that wide new-risen moon , she hadp448been watching the fire  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole house was built solidly , substantially . The young woman leaped from bed and scooted to her round-lidded trunk in the corner ; she called it her chest , although it was scarce big enough for a chest . Her fingers flew , seeking and doing ( this was in preparation for an act of erotic intensity . She held that quivering pathetic fear of the erotic worn by those who have experienced little such fulfillment , but who have dreamed long and in fierce fascination ; and whose souls are perpetual secret fugitives from the dictum of the ordinary , the accepted , the proper , the prim ) . Then she remembered that she must prepare their couch first ; and so she did , growing more excited in the task , tearing fiercely at the bed . She folded two comforters to make a thickness . . . it was at one side of the fireplace , half in shadow , half in ruddiness . . . there she built the little pallet , and spread blankets atop for smoothness  --  light soft blankets ; often she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crinkly feeling when she stroked them , she loved to stroke them . . She was prepared at last . . . ah , no : a pillow or two , those would be necessary , the lovers might fall asleep eventually close to pleasant watching coals , the first night fire to burn upon that hearth . She fetched pillows , and put herself upon the pallet , and turned half a loose flimsy blanket across her body . She tried to assemble her voice and send it out to summon her lover , but it was a weak cry at first , embarrassed and fretful ; she had to call several times before William heard her and came and brought the moonlight for another moment . She turned her face toward the fire , she watched only the fire now , dared watch only the fire . She heard portentous metallic settling of the bar within flanges ( set as firmly into wood beside the door as if they had grown there ) and she smothered her face against the tossed border of the blanket , feeling abandoned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapprove ? She had always feared that he might disapprove fundamentally of licentious antics . William Marblewas not like Phipps , yet she loved William more than ever she had loved Phipps . But Phipps was given to madness : a madness she had learned to share with untrammeled delight ( as if gone dementedlya-whoring ) in the short time before his advancing illness kept them apart . No , she 'd not caught the consumption , it seemed strange , doctors and grannies seemed to think it might be catching , but she had not come down with it , she must be very strongly constituted . . . no frail and anaemic young thing , a victim of palpitations and wanness ; just violent cramps every twenty-six days . She felt and heard her man coming closer through involved shadows , heard the snap of his knees as he knelt in preparation to lie beside her . William . . . mumble from extremity of space , it seemed to comep449from outside the tight walls of this large new-smelling house , all **32;2558;TOOLONG feet of it . William , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed of the w sound and the m ; she seemed to say Wim . Do something else , husband , please do ! He waited , halted in motions of kneeling and sliding close to her . He was saying nothing , waiting for her adjuration . Please , Wim , to take off your  --  nightshirt . The last word ripped forth with an explosion of her breath , she lay glad that her face was hidden . His answering voice grated flatly . You mean  --  ? ( This night he called her Margaret before they were entwined ; seldom did he command her name . It was not the custom , not among people who had reared him or among others whom they knew . But now he spoke of her as Margaret . . . . There was , or should be , no great problem at hand ! They were married folks , they had a right  --  They had  --  She did not even lie within his arms as yet ; still he spoke her name . ) Margaret . You mean  --  be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was so frantic . ) You have , William , you have ! Times , you most got mad . I  --  I was most scared of you once . You  --  you used a cuss word . You said  --  You said , This damn nightshirtgets in my way ! And you took it off . And  --  and a couple of other timesMargaret ! He spoke with the tone of minister , the tone of judge . You said Damn . Well , you did . You said it too . Now I 'm no better than you are . We both said it . Perhaps it was only half a minute that he remained motionless ; it seemed much longer . She thought that she could hear wooden machineryof his mind at work like a mill 's machinery . She had never heard of machinery fashioned from stone . . . well , partly from stone : the burr of a mill . . . yes , millstones grinding together . That was what was going on within him . Suddenly , with confused joy in victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across his skin and hair . . . he was rolling close . She waited , congealed , as he lifted the edge of the blankets , pushed under , pushed himself against her . Then quickly he too was stiff  --  not stiff with ardor but with astonishment . Margaret . . . . T was not a reprimand , t was a statement . . . . You hai n't got any nightgown on , either . But what  --  ? Ah , William , put your arms around me , my William , put your arms around me ! He succumbed dutifully  --  dutifully , yea !  --  too overwhelmed , too shocked to remain austere.  |p450Ah  , she loved his smell : t was a better smell than her other man had worn . What is it ? he asked again and again . What  --  ? Not yet could she build the four syllables to answer him , to tell the story of her descent into carnality . What is it , Margaret ? Tai n't lavender . No , she chirped . Per-fume-er-y ! Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four parts . As if saying : Now you can see for a fact , you can see what a vile woman I am at heart . And all along you had thought me decent . Wim ... words pouring , the smooth intent touch of his great hand had done it . And so she could not restrain her explanation , tossed out like long broken waves reaching against the lake shore when pike were dancing , when Morris Markham was pulling out the pike . ( Oh , never think of Markham now . ) Wim . T is perfumery , French perfumery , I had a bottle , a little bottle , I had it all along , t was given to me long ago ! His right arm lived beneath her , it had slid all the way and come around , his mighty hand was cupping gently above her breast . I reckon you 're just a strumpet at heart , said William Marble . Yes , yes , I am ! Blindly she swung her head up from the pillow , twisted her neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be another lewdness , she thought , in fresh consuming flood of anguish ) ; then she shut her eyes , her nose and cheeks were crushed against the man 's hairy breast . Her tongue came out , seeking through contact the very mixture of her body and his . Little wet words were mumbled , a mumble made purely of the flesh , the flesh of both . William ... . Love me ... William . . . . Oh , dear William , love me ... . A moment more and he was beginning to love her ; in later moments he was loving her hard , and harder than ever , oh , dear God , than ever before , oh , so hard , and all the warmth of it , and oh , the toughness , and the iron and buckskin of the male , and the perfume and silk of femininity , even the most rampant outrageous portion and type of femininity . She was all woman and all women , oh utterly a woman at last , at last , she had waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , he knew all , and oh , and oh , and oh , and oh , and William , William , William , and long she 'd thought to scream , she had forced the scream back from her lips and into her throat before , when first they slept together after their marriage , and then later , when they were in Linn , and then all the time in the wagon , and when they did it in the wagon she wanted to scream , she wantedp451sometimes to let forth her exhausted and exulting passion in a single cry , but now she was crying almost as loudly as she wished to cry , and he was demanding fiercely boyishly amidst the spasmodic twitchingand striving of their encounter , he was saying , Margaret , we got to have a child !  --  Margaret , you hear me , a child , a child !  --  and Yes , and Yes , and Oh , and Oh , and William , give me a child , give me a child , give me a child ! and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she screamed to the new house in its glory , she screamed to walls and ceilings , stones beneath them , the comforters underneath them and atop the stones , she screamed to shameless scent with which she 'd bathed her skin and hair , screamed to all the desperate wildernesswhere they were installed , screamed to moon out yonder , the sheer mild tawny moon awaiting and a-watching upon that roof and o'er that designated hearthside , and so it was a hearthside , and so they were in it , they were making a hearthside now . Ah ! she screamed . Ahhh ! and in the same almighty instant his breath burst in a roar . There was only the once this night , could be only the once . Long she lay watching the fire color , smelling chemical fragrance of logs which dissolved in their last ripeness close at hand . Any wise wife , she considered , would have slipped from the arms of the sleepingman who loved her , and who had awarded her this joy and this supremacy . . . would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood so carefully placed ( and oh , he was dependable in every way , was William ) and would have taken sticks and fetched them in and put them on the fire and built it up again . But she did not move , could only watch the toughening coals . . . be female in the knowledge that when it was necessary , William would build a fire again . The night was not so cold . Later , far later ( remote on prairies beyond their woods the wolves must be howling again . . . some few wolves talking of colder weather to follow , and maybe famine ; but Peggy Ann could not hear them . Only if she were to go outside would she hear them , and thank goodnessshe would n't have to go outside for any purpose any more : there was the vessel beneath the bed ) she was wraith and giantess . She slipped easily , soft as soot , from the loose sleeping clutch of William 's arms , and rose and dutifully donned her nightdress . Chill began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chill of sickness , nor chill of frightening future . Ah , maybe . . . she did believe it sincerely , and prayed a million prayers simultaneously , that this might be true . . . . She felt it . . . had never felt this way before .. . even at this moment there might be the beginnings of a child deep within that sacred snuggled place where children grew ? Majestic as a goddess . . . there were pictures , she had seen them , goddesses so strong , and they carried shields , and wore flowing draperies , and had crowns or helmets to suggest their might , and somep452of them bore swords or tridents or other weapons of authority . So that was the sort of goddess she was , but weaponless . The only weapon she bore was her own self , the self she 'd upheld and used as she wished to use it . Wound up in the shawl at last ( the shawl which William had worn ) she put down her nose and smelled the sweat and wood-ash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found . There was new light coming to her now , coming through shiny sparkling panes of the windows  --  the first time she 'd seen moonlight through those panes installed last week . It had shone in nights before , but she had not been there to see the silver and neither had William . This new-risen moonlight was a part of them and their abode . ( She did not think consciously : My house , my husband , my child to come , perhaps ; yet mingling of the thought was all around her , awarded by Holy God within the moon . ) She stood up by the window and put her cheek against the pane ; it was chill enough outside for mist to form there , and so she moved her cheek against a fresh pane , and held her breath that she might see . Tallow , she considered , the tallow of white tallow dips . . . and so it looked like tallow dips a-slanting loosely , twisted . . oh , bent dips , they were . . . and coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the largest basswood trunk , and so more of its light came down , slanting on the window , and she could see the little pools of tallow . . . no , no , she must not so designate it , for tallow was a dead and clammy thing . She 'd thought of tallow as the texture of the Dead , perhaps . . . but this was something else . . . had more of metal in it , more of frost . There was a limp and kindly treasure in the moon . Our house , she thought . Our place , our lake . Down through trees she saw a lakeside ripple break , and so the moonlight made its spattering. . . t was over all , a hush throughout the trees . It said , I 'm lingering , lingering , here as always , lingering . She thought : And moonlight lay upon this place when there were only Indians , and it will spread and melt eternally . . . and people come , and others yet unborn . Unborn within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For always there 's a fold within the folded humankindwhich has not yet been turned ; and so in time that fold untwists itself . . . and so you find  --  another fold . She thought she felt a microscopic morsel squirming delicately among those secret glossy drops which hid within her . Who and what are we , she wondered , to accomplish such nobility ' : ' ... How strange !  --  nobility arises from a sinful act ! ... Not for one moment do I now believe that we are doomed ID torment !  | ... Yes , yes , we are still young , so very young ( as years are reckoned ) . ... We 've built our house . ... The love of living , love of husband , sudden new love of a place and time and gracious walls encompassing . Peggy Ann wiped off her tears with fringe of the old shawl . Once more she witnessed only moonlight , pacifying under and among the great tree trunks , and coming loose to blend upon the ground . Thickness , mat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frost upon them ! Now what was that ? A twitching ? There was naught to fear . It could not be a beast or villain stalking down upon them ; none would be allowed on such a night . A poem of the past . . . a little book , and they were reading it aloud . The master said , Miss Margaret Ann , will you please to read the next ? She read it dutifully .. it came in fragment form to haunt her , and to blend with age and place and night . By midnight moons , o'er moistening dews . . . it was that poet , and she 'd loved the readingof his poetry . What was his name ? Freneau ? It chanted , stayed with her , amid the wonder of this Spirit Lake , the new life that was theirs . By midnight moons , o'er moistening dews , the hunter still the deer pursues , the hunter and the deer , a shade . Now she could witnessIndians fairly , they were there . And long shall timorous Fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed gliding and waiting but she could not call them a menace . She watched the phantasms , considered them with affection.  |p454Through  the autumn days which marched in spicy procession there was excitement in hearing a wheel creak , a neigh , the sound of voices rising . Strangers might be coming ! Abbie Gardner was jubilant at the advent of strangers ; she would rush heedlessly , hoping to be the first to greet anyone who rode in that direction . She prayed to find a new girl , one of her own age , journeying in ; but none appeared . There came instead the Messrs . Wheelock , Parmenter , Wiltfong , and Howe . Wiltfong was guiding the other three . He was a trapper whom Morris Markham had encountered on a trip to the south ; the three young men whom he conducted were all brothers-in-law , and made jolly sport of the fact . Sissy , we 'd expected to find only Indians ; but instead , here 's a pretty miss like you ... . We got a Mr. Howe up here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wealthy one ? Abbie reckoned that few in the Okoboji region were very wealthy . ... His name is Old Joel Howe , and he comes from Indiana , and he 's got a whole scad of boys , and the Mrs. , and he 's got Sardis too . But she 's already growed into young ladyhood . Ah , said Lawyer Howe , the years are fleeting , my dear damsel . Ternpusfugit !  --  and in almost no time at all you yourself will be in young ladyhood  --  and kneeling at the altar ! Us Methodists do n't do much kneeling . Sister Mary says it 's acting like Catholics to do so . Good heavens , lass ! Then I shall be very chary about kneeling !  --  and Mr. Howe tweaked Abbie 's sun-bleached hair lightly , and she colored to have him do it . She led the men on to the house , where Rowland Gardner walked to meet them . They had taken up land at the foot of Spirit Lake , not too far below the Marble place . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned to return in the spring ; and later , when they had houses prepared , would fetch their families . They congratulated the Red Wing Company on their choice of a town site . Isaac Harriott withdrewa deep-driven splinter which had lodged under Mr. Wiltfong ' s fingernail , and the three brothers-in-law discoursed learnedly on Eng/land with Carl Granger , and on France with Bertell Snyder . Successivelythey called on Mattocks , Howes , and the Noble and Thatcher families . Then they galloped off , and everyone at the lakes was brighter for their visit , and felt a breath of prosperity in the breeze . Rowland Gardner had met one Doctor Strong when he traveled down the Des Moines River to purchase a last load of supplies for winter . At Fort Dodge he was bearing a sack of meal out of the mill , when he was confronted by an individual who affected a pointed beard , a staccato manner of speech , a nervous handshake . Permit me to introduce myself . The name is Strong  --  E. B. N. Strong  --  and I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken up property in the Okoboji country ... . The doctor went on to fire many questions about land and living conditions at the lakes , about current denizens of the region , and prospects of a town . Gardner felt somewhat confounded because he could not answer every question put to him . Strong said that he had visited Springfield , across the Minnesota line , and halfway intended to settle there ; a house was already available for his family . However , favorable descriptions of Okoboji reached his ears . He thought he might have a look at the place . . . . Doctor Strong was in his late thirties , growing a little paunchy around the middle . His pale eyes held forever an intense stare , and yet the stare was not directed at you when he spoke to you : it was turned in some odd way past your head . His mouth was full and firm , uncompromising , the staring eyes were more protuberant than most ... . Halfway home on his solitary journey , Rowland Gardner was smitten suddenly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend him in illness than Doctor Strong . He could not quite understand his feeling in the matter , for obviously Strong was Harry 's senior in years , experience , and no doubt in education as well . Actually Gardner never expected to see Strong again , and was much surprised when the doctor appeared at Okoboji , driving in a heavily laden Concord wagon with his wife and a tiny daughter . The doctor 's wife was in poor health  --  her complexion pasty , her nostrils thin , a plaintive quality in her voice . She confessed to Frances Gardner and Mary Luce that she had never known a well day since little Prudence was born . And here she was , in the family way again . Why , you poor thing ! whispered Frances Gardner warmly . Ca n't the doctor offer nothing to give you strength ? Actually , droned the weary voice , female complaints are n't in his line . He 's good at using the knife , and he 's specially skilled at amputations . But something happened to my internals when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cure is beyond his powers . I only pray I wo n't miscarry now. h ! .  |p456Why  , you poor thing ! No  --  you 're not to stir a hand . You set right down here and rest . Mary and the girls and me  --  we 'll do all the supperfixings that 's to be done . You poor thing ! .. . Mary Luce and Harvey gave up their bed to the Strongs that night . Mary slept with her sisters , Harvey slept on the floor beside his fatherin-law . There was not much bedclothing available . Abbie and Eliza had been set to the task of washing comforters and blankets , only a few hours before the Strongs ' arrival ; everything was wet . ( Frances Gardner said that there was no help for it : they had to start the winter with clean things . The weather was so bright now : things would dry in no time ! The system called for use of the large iron kettle and two wooden tubs . Rowland Gardner swung the kettle from its tripod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended the fire . Tubs were filled with batches of quilts , hot water and soft soap were put in , the trampling ensued . . . . I always did like to tromp quilts ! . . . But it makes your feet and limbs all pink ! . . . The little boys demanded their turn , they climbed into one tub and danced furiously about ; inevitably they became engaged in a fight . Bertie cried that his uncle had splashed soap into his eyes deliberately , Rowly cried that he had n't . . . shrieks and swatting . . . the boys were banished . Eliza and Abbie proceeded with the work . ) Next noon , at dinner , people seemed looking at Eliza Gardner searchingly , and she could not imagine what was wrong . When the meal was done there ensued a family council . Liza , child . You 've got an invite . What  --  ? Doctor and Mrs. Strong  --  they desire you to go on to Springfield . Spend a while with them . Eliza was bewildered . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rowland Gardner put in quickly . Springfield ! gasped Eliza . Mrs. Strong explained weakly : See , child , I feel poorly so much of the time . If you choose to come up and live with us awhile , twou i c I help out . With little Prudence and all . There 's a fine house we 're going to be living in , there  --  house half again as big as thisSpringfield ! I know what , said Abbie suddenly . Her sister turned with cold menace . Abbie Gardner , if you dast -- -But I knowAbigail Gardner ! I 'll pull your hair ! Abbie , said the mother , this hai n't no concern of yourn . It 's Liza 's got the invite  --  not you . I know why she wants to go !  --  and Abbie skipped delightedly out of the house . From a safe distance she began caroling : Liza 's mad , and I am glad , and I know what will please her . In dusk that evening , Rowland Gardner was coming away from the oxen when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended each day as Gardner and Luce fed it . ( They were determined not to be cold in the winter ; the work on Harvey 's house must wait until an adequate supply of wood was effected . What indeed was an adequate supply ? Nobody seemed to know . It would n't take too much wood in winter if the weather continued like this . ) Husband . He stopped and surveyed Frances mutely . You think it 's all right ? Well , she seems to want to go . Course she does . But its account of that young Tretz she got acquainted with , back at Clear Lake . Oh , yes , there was that party of Germans come throughHe 's up there to Springfield , Mr. Harshman told of it . And Doctor Strong says he knows him : lives with another family there , working on the place . Rowland said guardedly : Our Liza 's a good Christian girl . She would n't be up to no tricksThat young man : he might be up to tricks . The parents looked at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dab . Dime a day , they said . And twill help us , not having so many to feed here . Oh , it 's so far away : a whole day 's trip ! We would n't be like to see her often , specially if the weather turned bad . But she wants to go . Yes , I know she doesSo I say , let her go . Husband  --  Rowland  --  she 's a young girl , and  --  That man  --  the doctor . Do you spose he means well by her ? Pears like a gentleman to me : well-spoken , educatedI know , but  --  Oh , I want to be sure . Frances . We ca n't be sure about anything in this life . No .... Actually there was no reason to fear for Eliza . Doctor Strong would have been properly offended at any doubt pertaining to his conduct toward a young girl domiciled with him . He had never sinned in such respect , and was heartless in his condemnation of people who did demonstrate such vices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , use what he called The Weed , or allow profanity to soil his lips . He had been accepted early into the Congregationalist faith . But he was one of those inherent weaklings who , from the cradle ,  |p458stand  embittered against stronger gayer humans . His own faith in himself was meager although he made sanctimonious pretense of dedicationto his profession . He had performed any number of irrational amputations and other excisions . When he held the knife he felt a gratifying sense of might . When a patient wailed or snarled under Strong 's ministration he experienced momentary enchantment at knowing that he possessed such power . In most other categories of conduct he was cowering , resentful , disappointed . He measured everyone by the inaccurate tape of his own shoddy personality . For example , when at school at the East , he had consortedfrequently with a youth named Willie Wastrom who , before he reached the age of thirty , was said to have piled up at least twenty thousand dollars profit from the business of manufacturing iron for railroads . Edwin Benjamin Nodworth Strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or , if he did believe it , pretended not to . He never missed an opportunity to say something slighting about Mr. William Wastrom , the alleged genius of the rails ; and he hinted often that chicanery was involved in Mr. Wastrom 's supposed success . This was partially because Noddy Strong had not saved twenty thousand dollars , or even twenty thousand cents . But the tree of his contempt did not have its roots in a soil of jealousy alone . He was actuated also by the fact that he and Willie Wastrom had once evaded classes together and gone to a puppet show ; and Doctor Strong felt that no one who had shared such boyhood intimacy with himself could really amount to much .... Besides Willie and many other lads , there was , at the Albany Classical School which Noddy Strong attended before he went to medical college , a student named Herman . Herman published a sensationally successful book , his very first book , while he was still in his twenties ; and a number of other distinguished works followed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of Herman , greeted each favorable comment with snorts . Flatly did he refuse to read a line which the man had written : Herman had had a wooden locker immediately next to his own , in the Albany school , and anyone who had had a locker next to that of E. B. N. Strong could be no acceptable author , because E. B. N. Strong could scarcely write a coherent note to aunt or creditor , could entertain or affect or influence no one  --  No one would have paid a cent for anything which he set down on paper !  --  this he recognized , secretly but soundly . If he were to write doggerel ( and he could not write even doggerel ) a village newspaper would have refused to print it ; and recognition of this fact caused him to scout the merest mention of Herman 's name . Herman 's name was Melville .... When Noddy Strong was very young he spent two summersat a farm owned by his uncle . Across the orchard stood another farmhouse occupied by a sturdy dairyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Freck used to go fishing together in a nearby creek , and Freck was not the most successful fisherman in York State but neither was Noddy Strong . Nearly twenty years later Noddy becamemuch annoyed at learning that Freck , a graduate West Pointer , had been brevetted captain for gallantry displayed during the attack on Chapultepec . Doctor Strong thought it ludicrous to be asked to believe that anyone with whom he had fished unrewardingly for trout , with whom he had crushed caterpillars , with whom he had munched **32;2592;TOOLONG , could perform a bold deed in battleor even attend the United States Military Academy , let alone graduate from it . Doctor Strong would not have lasted out two days at West Point , and he knew it ; he would have fled Mexico at the first cannon-blast or bullet-whine , and he knew it  --  with a mixture of selfpity , self-loathing , self-excuse . Therefore he smiled wisely and wryly when the brave young soldierwas mentioned . He said : The Army may think him to be a hero , butEh , what say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed . ButYou mean that it may have been a matter of deception ? That  --  perhaps someone else  --  ? And this man received credit to which he was not actually entitled ? Why , that 's dreadful , Doctor Strong , dread-ful ! Ah , well , let 's not discuss it !  --  but Doctor Strong would look very knowing , and he would compress his lips , raise his eyebrows , and shrug once more . ( He was that most unhappy and persistent detractor of all : the starveling who scents hot gravy-laden meats , but cries that the feast is inedible for the reason that he has not been invited to partake of it , and knows that he will never be allowed to do so . ) ... Eliza Gardner 's few duds were packed and she prepared to drive happily into slavey-hood with the Strongs . Her father 's beard filled her face as he put his farewell kiss upon her shiny pink forehead . Goodbye , Pa . Now , you be a good girl , Liza . Yes , Pa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again , Eliza Gardner . ) She accepted a moist kiss from Harvey Luce . I trust , dear sister , that you will sing forever the glad tidings of Salvation ! Oh , yes , Brother Harvey , I will . When the Master calls , may the shock of corn be fully ripe . Yes , yes ! I mean ( Goodbye to him . You will not whisper it another time. ) 4p460Abbie had no longer the heart to twit Eliza about her lovelorn condition , to chant gibing references to Henry Tretz . She feared vaguely that when she saw Eliza again , her sister would be already wedded to Henry Tretz . In the paleness of dawn Abbie had realized the gravity of this departure . Quickly she wrapped her arms around the slumberingEliza and dripped tears against her neck . She would lose , as of this day , the companion nearest her  --  would lose playmate , fellow gossip , sparring partner , rival , fellow giggler and whisperer , fellow teaser and squealer , enemy and friend . See . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . cut . . . ah-huh , ah-huh , ah-huh . . . this nnnnnut . I carved ... ah-huh . . . this heart o n't . See ? . . . T is in . . . two halves .

( For always , Eliza Gardner . Say it , t is the truth . For always . ) Hugs from the boys , their grins turned up to her . The squeezing of Baby Mandy . Who 's going to look after my little Rowly and my little Bertie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ah , who indeed ? Wild men ? Yes , dear girl . Wild men . ) The clutch of mother , the feeling and smell of mother  --  the mother scent , mother warmth , mother sound , mother pressure . Heaven bless you , dear daughter ElizaHeaven bbbbbless you , Ma . Goodbye . ( T is such a long time , such a long long time . Forever takes so long to happen . ) Voices calling back and forth along a track between the solemn trees . Goodbye . Bye .... Bye .. . Until faintly the last remembrance dies out , and only unseen birds seem echoing it . There came the last warm day and night of the year , the year 's final thunder . Thunder talked down to Abbie through the roof . It said in a mutter of many low voices that a storm was distant , but strolling closer . Thunder had not one voice but a chorus , all deep/chested and ( she thought suddenly ) feminine . . . . Why not a chorus of men ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She thought of a sewing circle of swarthy women gossiping , passing judgment , nodding their heads more or less in unison ; one of them would laugh with heavy cynicism ; then another would say something unkind ; then another of the thick-chested fat-breasted women would voice a direct threat ; again they would all nod . . . thunder . . . she saw them . They wore their hair in braids ; their skins were dark and oily . She thought of a neighbor her family had known in actuality , a neighbor woman with a black mustache ( and when the woman perspired how the little globules of oil would hang around each hair of that defacement ) ! It was of women like Mrs. Groan that the convocation was made . Or were they squaws  --  the consorts of wild men  --  squat brick-faced women in Agency calico , women with old grease on their frayed gowns ? The thunder . Was it Indian talk , or English ? Abbie had feared storms when she was small . Now she feared them even more acutely because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed in a wagon when lightning seemed to pierce the ground all around , when lightning was not a shaft but actual exploding balls of fire to bounce . Once again on hearing ugly sullen voices of storm , she imagined that she was a mere urchin , she was screaming . ... Frances Gardner said , Children . Hush that silly noise . Eliza , hush ! ... Tai n't me that 's crying  --  t is Abbie . She 's just yelling her head off ! .. . Abigail Gardner , you stop it ! . .. I ca n't , I ca n't , it gets right in my eyes ! ... Her mother came and brought a dark yarn stocking and put it across her eyes , and gave her a little spank ; Abbie burrowed deeper into the feather bed . Her sister complained that Abbie 's foot was sticking her ; Abbie shoved with both feet , and Eliza inched away , snarling , then fell asleep again . Thunder thudded and rolled , still the flash came cursing , but Abbie could not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . Thunder bumped to extinction across empty low ridges beyond the woods ; no longer lived there a panic , or images concerning it . But the young girl 's thoughts kept waking and straying . She loved this lakesidegrove in which the new home had been made , she touched and handled a memory of summer as she lay among the crowded sleepers .. Summer and the colored autumn so long prevailing . . . she 'd found steady confidence , idyllic benevolence among these Iowa forests even when it was hard work or a doleful errand which took her into them . Rhododendrons and laurel grew back East , a thick stand of bushes through which fierce beasts might be believed to wander . Hero itp462seemed that there should be only sheep . In Iowa the tough dry wires of blackberry and raspberry vines appeared curving from a tangle reserved especially for their propagation ; the very gooseberry bushes were rounded , ornate ; surely they had been set out . Picturesque mats of lawn wore short grass between the bushes as if grazed over by contenteddomestic animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two doors away from them , a small brown house . A sign swung out from the porch : Mrs. A. T. A. Hubbard . Seamstress . Aprons a Specialty . Abbie learned her first letters from that sign ( a , b , c , d , e . Mary taught them to her ; but Abbie did not learn the letter f because there was no f on the sign ) . Old Mrs. Hubbard was a kindly woman in a cap with a pink frill ; Abbie liked nothing so well as to go a-calling on her , for Mrs. Hubbard could and did make gumdrops  --  whenever she had the wherewithal , and could purchase gum arabic . But even sweets did not afford the same sensuous delight which arose when Abbie stood before a certain picture which hung in its dust directly beneath the high shelf where Mrs. Hubbard kept her spools . It was an oil painting , brought from England when Mrs. Hubbard herself was young . Doubtless it was not even a moderately expensive painting , or poor Mrs. Hubbard would have sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live on skim milk and porridge when customers were few . ) The painting depicted oak trees , and there were creatures under them which the child thought must be sheep , spotted ones ; but old Mrs Hubbard told her that they were fawns . Calm oaks which held up the sky in these groves about Okoboji were very like the English oaks in that remote oil painting . They were as substantial uncles and grandfathers , trustworthy preachers and schoolmasters . Some were shaggy , serenely bold as the trapper who strolled past the Gardner cabin . . . they recognized their own age , but bore it beautifully . Abbie did not pretend that her new woodland was an English one , yet she heard solemn winds conversing in the picturesque branches . She 'd seen , in summer heat , leaves turning their pale sides outward and upward , as they had been painted in her memory . . . the gentle wind and the leaves said that everything had happened centuries before ; there was nothing left to happen now . Abigail walked dreaming when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have little value as food ; they were looked upon as a confection , yet her father doted on them . Times when . he was not too sleepy , when the family sat sharing a comfort near the fire before bedtime , he would say , Could n't somebody crack me a nut ? So she should have been seeking the fruit of hickories , not acorns ; she should have been counting the nuts , surveying and prospecting against frost , learning which nuts were nearer at hand , easier to get at . She had been told to do this whenever she went searching for the oxp463which strayed , whenever she went picking up kindling . She loved to fade off down cozy aisles because in doing so she was walking into the painting she had admired ( and in a way she was smelling the clean smell of the dimity on which Mrs. Hubbard sewed , hearing the snip of her shears , tasting once more a gumdrop softening slowly , homemade , melting upon the tongue ) . Oh , sheep never came , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident that there must be some about  --  there were so many deer . ( Twice her father shot deer from their very doorstep , without budging off of it . ) Yet the fawns Abbie did not witness ; and if she had come upon them lying in some secret covert , she would have noted at once that they were wild American fawns , kin of the wild men . She would have feared that they were not placid , there 'd be no comfort in them , they 'd not be docile and ordered in their habits . She looked at the gooseberry bushes , the seemingly clipped glades between them , and thought of small fabrics which she had seen worked there , very early in the morning , when first she walked that way . Fairy tablecloths , she told her little brother . They must of been having folks to tea . They was n't there yesterday ! No , they come during the night . What 's folks a-doing , having tea in the night ? . . . Rowly could not share the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly vanished by sun and wind , stricken away by their own treading feet . The fairy tablecloths were all a joy to Abbie and they suggested simple civilized pleasures to be realized sometime under these very oaks . Grass so green , so thick , yet not long enough to be twisted and beaten down into bunches . Grass for a shepherd to walk across , a shepherd as in Mrs. Hubbard 's painting , a man carrying a crook in his hand . There was another man , a huntsman ( but of a mild sort ) . And far beyond lifted some chimneys , and Mrs. Hubbard said that they marked the manor house . She could n't think of the name of the family , but she was sure that that picture had been painted near the village of her childhood , a place named Boughton Aluph . A park , she called it : something-or-other park . So here was this Iowa park , strung along the lakeside as if ruled and surveyed for young lovers to walk over , for children to frolic in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . You thought of homely matters like sun-warmed wooden benches li and rocking chairs with cross-stitched cushions ; you thought of pale butter gleaming freshly made in a big applewood bowl ; you thought of puppies tumbling , and cows mooing peacefully to say that they were ready to be milked . And you thought of a milkmaid , and maybep464that was you , yourself , in one of Mrs. Hubbard 's blue aprons , going out to pail a cow . Abbie sang in her heart if not with her lips .. . oh ! Lilly , sweet Lilly , dear Lilly Dale . . . she felt that sadness which might hasten when aprons could no longer be worn , or butter tasted ; when flails could no longer beat , or shepherds go hunting lambs ; when there was naught but the wild rose that blossomed on the little green grave . She never saw that grave as her own . It was always Lilly Dale 's grave or someone else 's . Abbie lingered beside it , wept tenderly , and then went home , filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the woods she saw and loved , and lived among , and cherished in recollection as cold weather drew near . Sometimes secretlyshe guessed that far in advance of wagons one lone artist came walking . He had halted to paint these woods , then had discarded them . Less illusory were factual recollections of the Gardners ' meanderingsacross summertime prairies . With flowers now fallen prey to evening frosts it was delicious to consider the profusion of an earlier June . . . . Where were they traveling ? Abbie could n't remember , but t was a day when the flowers were a riot all around them . Abbie and Eliza kept climbing down from the wagon , saying , Here 's a new one , oh , see , oh , look , oh , sister , I want that , oh , sis , look there ! So their mother cautioned them , she said that they would disturb their oxen while the animals were drinking . Rowland Gardner sat and smiled ; once he laughed out loud with some strange joy , sharing their excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragged frock . Please , Pa , what 's this ? He took up a wisp between his fingers and rolled the stem gently , and peered into the face of the flower as if the wee blueness might answer  --  give answer to a question he was asking , yet which he dared not voice . Reckon this is a lupine . Oh , Pa , did n't you say that about the pinkish one ? Well , it might have been . Eliza giggled and whispered to her sister that their father called every strange flower a lupine . Now see here , daughters . He cleared his throat . Once I read a little botany , and I do remember some things . Now , here  --  this petal part  --  this is called the corollaAnd what 's them three green things underneath , on the back side ? That , he said importantly , is the calyx . And them pretty little fuzzy things right smack in the middle , Pa ? They got yellow on the tips , and they 're all fuzz.  |p465I  reckon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Little Rowly pricked up his ears at the delightful mention of firearms . This here is a flower kind of pistil ; tai n't even spelt the same way . It 's what makes the flower grow , I guess  --  got the little seeds in it to start a new one . No  --  His forehead wrinkled as he thought about it . No . Them ai n't pistils a-tall . Them are stamens . I think the pistil is this green thing in the middle . Well , one or the other of them has got to be ! And that 's why we 'll have new flowers again ... . Pa , look at these luscious ones I 've got . I found ' em , Abbie did n't get any ! Look , they 're kind of pinkish and red . Could these be sort of phlox , like we had in the garden back East ? Could be , he said judiciously . He lifted this new flower to examine it . Could be . Reckon it 's a kind of wild phlox . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flocks , flocks , chanted Rowly . Flocks-of-sheep , flocks-of-sheepBubby , you hush up whilst I try to splain this to the girls . . . . Again his face scrolled sadly . . . . Only I guess there is n't much more I can say . That 's about the sum total of my botany knowledge ! Well , let 's get the critters out of here and get back on the road . The prairie was all width , all warmth , all pleasure . Larks went crazy around them , crying about the gifts of June , they came down again , came close to show their gold , the black upon their chests , the little dab of white . Abbie thought , Just one big flower garden ! . . . Mystery of thunder , illusion of ordered park and English oil painting , recollection of flowers . Why should you lie dormant and unheeding , when the active mind could take you roving amid wonders ? Eliza was long since gone to Springfield ( some folks spoke of the place as Des Moines City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on upper reaches of the river of that name ) and Abbie slept now with Ma . Rowland Gardner groaned or whistled in exhausted slumber on his pallet , the Luces were in their own bed , Mandy in her cradle , the two small boys  --  uncle and nephew  --  squeezed into a trundle bed . Seven other folks , all lost , gone , unresponsive , druggedNot one of them ever wakened to share with Abigail a marvel which befell . T was on one of the rare chilly nights . . . in the uncertainty of adolescence , an odd experience called her . Rowland Gardner had left a fire lapping , spitting on the hearth . Abbie did not know what time it was , she was not accustomed to tellingtime except by the sun . ( There was only one watch in the family , and that would not work . Her father kept it in a cigar box with other keepsakes . The family clock had been stolen out of their wagon dur/ing the flight to the Shell Rock . ) So Abigail awoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , conscious of the nudge of her mother in the bed , yet lifted somehow beyond , suspended above shabby covers . She lay warm , shrouded ; she looked toward the fire . There sat a little girl . This was no child of the family nor child of any neighbor . T was not Agnes Mattock . Abbie had never seen the girl before ; she remembered , would remember long , a sheen of firelight on the child 's smooth-brushed hair . The visitor leaned forward , never turning her head , regarding intently the blaze . Ever and anon she lifted her hands from her aproned lap and held them out as if they needed momentarywarmth , and then drew her hands into her lap again . The child might have been a real child who wandered from God knows where ; she might have been no child at all , might have been a ghost . But she was there , Abbie saw her clearly . She saw frail pale arms go out , watched the palms extend and lift and spread their fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no specter equipped with malformations ; she had a normal complementof fingers , she warmed her hands . It was as if she sensed the waking girl nearby , yet was stubborn and would not turn her head , but leaned closer to the fire with each fearful breath that Abbie drew . It was as if she said , I am here , you see me in my calico , my clean gown . I have wandered from somewhere , have come out of space , I sit by your fire . Do you mind ? If you mind , twill do you no good . I shall sit by your fire ! Abbie boosted herself upright but Frances Gardner did not stir . Never before had Abbie seen anything to tempt her into an expression of mortal disbelief . The stranger child . . . light danced with charm and caution upon delicate wood-grained hair which cased her head . Abbie thought : I am so afraid of her , I dare not speak , where does she come from ? Is she human , or a fairy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians we hear storied about , far beneath the texture of the lake ? Someone hidden down there and kept tied ? Maybe she has loosed her bonds and run away ? No longer does she need to listen to a thudding drum beneath the water . She has come free . Illusion ( if it were illusion ) persisted long , and with such striking force that finally , under impact of the repeated blows of realization , Abbie lay back and covered her face . She stared within the cornforters , fearing to look out again to prove whether or not she was bereft of wits . She counseled herself weakly : Now you are a big girl , you are almost a young lady . You have Made the Change , which Ma spoke about in whispers . Yes , you are grown  --  not to be frighted ! You are bold ; you killed a snake ; you plucked Rowly from the mire when hep467 fell in ; you gave warning of the fire which approached  --  a whole prairie was seething , and even the critters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you were , you pretended not to be . You were stout enough to cope with such things ! Pray rise , stare at the little girl . Challenge her ... . She managed to get her claws on the edge of the covers . Wriggling slyly , she rose aloft once more . She sat up in bed . Lo and behold !  --  no child was to be seen  --  only the empty stool  --  a chunk of oak which Rowland Gardner had axed , and into which he had inserted three whittled legs . It was there by the fire , but the child was gone , the caging door was shut . How had the little girl got in or gone out ? This was something Abbie would never dare to relate to her parents , or to Eliza or Mary . Long did she wonder , later that same night and on subsequent nights , about the advent of the little girl . Where did she come from , why had she come , why were only Abbie 's eyes open to see her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . . . she wondered how old she was . The girl did not appear to be above ten or twelve  --  not as old as Abbie . Yet there were serenity and fortitude about her . Abbie saw her so clearly in recollection  --  she could have drawn a picture , had she been sufficiently talented with her pencil . Before dawn she found courage to sneak up and try the door . No , t was not barred ; no one had remembered to slide the bar into place , it did n't slide well . It was held by a crotch at one end and by an awkward notch , cut into thick wood , at the other . T was not a good bar ; and often enough her parents neglected completely to put it in place , when they were very tired . So the door had not been barred , and that might have been the way in which a stranger could have crept inside . But why did the Gardners and Luces not hear the creak of hinges ? Was the child a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some malevolence in the outside world , to lure Abbie or other children , to guide them into treachery ? Was she but a family wraith , stealing from past or future ? ( Ah , the hidden , the inscrutable , the never-to-be-told ! ) ... Where did you come from , Other Little Girl ? Were you real ? Were you merely a trick of my mind , because we are in a lonely place , and lead a lonely existence ? Did a mover 's wagon stop nearby , and did you wander from it ? Were you walking in your sleep , and did you return to your wagon again ? Did wheels revolve , come morning , and did you and all the other people go wrenching off into western space ? . . . Lonely child , lonely fire , lonely souls asleep and awake . . . . Anp468unidentified poet 's voice lived within Abbie and reiterated these things . There was nothing in her surroundings to stimulate the psalm , the truant verses she made . Yet worship lived on . A secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months , and brutalities came , with horror enough to wipe from recollection any truant perfume of a dream , any calico figure who danced therein or sat motionless by the fire , warming her hands . Rowland Gardner owned his private consideration of wraiths , his private love of them . If Abbie 's fancies had been reported to him ( by process unknown ) he would have been too shy and restrained to question her further , to discuss or speculate . Had he perceived that his neighbor Mrs. Marble  --  miles away on the Spirit Lake margin  --  witnessed that spectacle recorded by the poet Freneau , he might even have greeted the idea with humor . Like most primitive visionaries , he thought that his spooks were the only ones . He became acquainted with them during one morning of the previous summer when he walked on a solitary ramble  --  to prospect for log-trees of the proper size , he 'd announced ; but actually he went to rid himself temporarily of his son-in-law 's company . There was constant light rain . Mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight chill . You could hear wind speaking amid old oaks high above ; young oaks gave their own reply , they mingled in conversation , waved downturned branches restlessly . Gardner strolled the woods for perhaps fifty rods , and then turned toward the shore line , climbing as he went . There was a shapeless mound running along much of the shore , formed he did not know how : perhaps by erosion , perhaps by original retreat of the glacier which had left these wide wet pockets on the landscape ; or possibly it resulted from the extended pushing of ice cakes , with rocks washed up by storms through the centuries . The mound spread higher and became a hill . When Gardner reached the summit he was standing twenty or thirty feet above the water . Here again were young trees ; their leaves were different , their sleek green acorns different , many of them , from the few he had seen and remembered back East . He thought of the names of trees which he had read in one of the emigrants ' guidebooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black oak ; there were many , he did n't know thew all . And all would be hard to cut . He stood in the low drift of sumac which spilled up over thicketed cliffsides , and saw that some sumac leaves were already coloring . Best get about it , wind said above his ears . Twill be different in December . He tried to dramatize his own position to himself and thus take a courage he might not have possessed otherwise . He tried to tell him/ self that he was standing on his native heath ( but he had done that before , and always he left that native heath to find another ) . The opposite shores did not mock him , they remained placid under touch of thickening rain , and under light breezes which must be meltingamong those distant mist-drenched trees . He could not see them tossing , the wind was not strong enough for that ; but surely breezes moved there , as they moved about the tall sad lonely man here  --  where they walked with the cool importance of breezes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was pelting him now . He turned out the brim of his old hat so that water would drip free from his body and not run down his neck . The lake itself was made of zinc , soft zinc , the mere thought of zinc . Coves were many and mysterious , and which of them harbored an enemy ? Rowland Gardner felt his hands empty of any gun , and shook his head : it was unwise to wander thus unarmed . He thought of wicked forms stealing up through the brush , those same mad shapes he had glimpsed in his dream , and whom he had seen do ill to his family and to himself . He shook his head again . Might have been better off back in Rexville ? . . . No , no , this was right ! This was the place ! Everything must be here ; richness fought its way , tangling up the steep hillside ; there were a few reeds in the lake , a few willows at the edge , and then began the tangle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red showing there , like Indian feathers . . . and this seemed to be some kind of light young cherry . It had bark like a cherry tree , although so small and slender . And here was one of the cherries , dangling before his eyes . Gardner picked it off , bit into the small orb , and instantly the portion of his mouth and tongue which touched it felt puckered . Ah , no good , no black cherry . The choke variety , he said aloud . Now the lake seemed truly to mock him , it grew glassy when the wind slowed . Then it rifted and puckered , like tissue of his own mouth on nibbling the cherry . And what was behind all that mist , and where were the wild people whom he dreaded ? There had been a story about Spirit Lake : the wandering trapper Jo Harshman told it  --  Yes , Spirit Lake , but might it not apply to the Okobojis as well , since all were part of the same pattern ? Indians said that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that half of their people were dwelling underneath the surface still . In a faraway age all the tribes had dwelt down there ; and then one young man , more explorative than the rest , had approached the edge of this underwater paradise and seen a great root hanging down . He grasped the root as he might grasp a rope . He climbed and climbed , and burst forth into the day , the sunshine above . He shook the water off his body , and stood drying in the sun , and then calledp470his excitement back to his mates . So the rest of the folks started climbing , one after another  --  man and squaw and little child  --  they ascended , until a goodly portion of the nation had progressed into dry daylight , all shaking the water off them , and laughing because they stood in the sun . And then another woman tried to climb up the root . She was a pregnant woman ; her weight was too much , the root snapped in two , and back she fell , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay motionless , unblemished by emerging figures ; and underneath the tribes remained , the others left there . So they were there today ; this the Indians said . The root had broken , there was no other link , no way for them to emerge . But , said the Indians , if you went back , if you dared to go back and abide by the water at night and in certain seasons , you could hear the others underneath . Sometimes they were calling up , sometimesblaming their freed brethren for leaving ; sometimes they were saying , Come back ! Sometimes they were saying , We are dancing , but you can not dance with us because you do not dwell beneath the waves . Oh , yes , and the sound of their drums could be heard when there was a storm , they were drumming and yelling . And who was the better off ?  --  Gardner wondered , perusing this legendry . The ones who had emerged ?  --  or those or were soaked and sodden , far down in the depths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting up tipis ? What did they fashion them out of  --  the skins of fish ? And dancing , always dancing when the time was right ... . Gardner declared that he heard the percussive thud of a distant drum , a submerged and wet one . He turned away from the shore . He thought , Ah , no drum ! What this country needs is the sound of axes going into wood . Leave us make that sound ! As he returned to the wagons his imagination was haunted by a notion of those aborigines beneath the water . Only from gleanings in picture books could he imagine how they might dance . He knew that they shuffled in a circle ... he had seen the pictures , he had heard stories . He knew so little about Indians . He knew so little , yet he felt so much . And the very dampness of the lake had reached out and infected him , and made him different from the Gardner who came driving hither two weeks before . He concocted a mixed-up confusion of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictured , or who had populated his nightmares . He saw them with shaven heads , long braids , long black unrestrained hair hanging loose . He saw them with shells around their necks , and bear claws . He saw them barefoot , or wearing many types of moccasins , and fringed leggings with scalp-hair on the seams . He saw them stark naked , or dressed in white men 's breeches , orp471wrapped in blankets . . . still dancing , far underneath . . . and the fish sped away from them , the frogs were numbed and humbled . Deep tone of their throbbing tom-toms was like a chorus of monster bullfrogs , and when the whitecaps blew free , as they must in more violent storms  --  Well , that would be the feathers a-blowing ! Now they had buffalo horns fashioned in some way so that they might adorn their heads ; they had their weapons in their hands : stone axes , sharp metallic axes bought from traders . They waved arrows and guns and spears , and lances with decorations , they circled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could you see the gleam of their fire coming up  --  a dull redness ? Could you make out shapes passing the blaze , and hear the screams of captives they tortured ? Was it a war dance , or was it an imploring for some benefit to be given by the gods ? He did not know . But all the way back to the wagon he heard them pounding and jumping in the lake alongside him.  |p472In  desperation Inkpaduta had announced to Charles Flandrau that he would steal and he would kill again . It was bluster on his part ; at this time actually he had no intention of making war or even effecting a sneaky murder . He could recall vividly his brief captivity of a few years before , when he had been a prisoner of the white soldiers , held as a hostage in order to accelerate the return of some property stolen from settlers in the Boyer River country . The sight of an ornate blue jacket worn by Flandrau had awakened unpleasant recollections of the Fort Dodge outhouse in which Inkpaduta was locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captives for two or three days on end , and even then there was very little meat offered : they were given scraps from the common mess , which seemed to include cooked grass and other things which the captives did not relish . There was a guard who often amused himself by spitting tobacco between the crude bars of the window . Soldiers laughed and talked to each other about this as they gathered outside . Inkpaduta did not understand what they said , but he felt the sting of the juice in his eye . He remembered how voices had sounded . ... What you up to , Casey ? . . . Trying to hit that smaller one in there . Already hit the big one . . Hell , you ai n't half the ex-pec-tor-at-or that I am ! ... I 'll lay you two bits . ... Hell , you ai n't got two bits . . Lay you a glass at the sutler 's . ... Done ' Splah ' ... Ah ha , you missed , Lew . ... Son-of-a-bitch dodged , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three tries . Do n't I get two more tries ? ... You take two more tries , then I 'll take my three . Splah ! ... Missed the little one , by God . You hit the big one again ! Inkpaduta planned to steal at the first opportunity , however . He should not steal while he was anywhere near the Lower Agency : Fortp473Ridgely lay too close , and those soldiers traveled rapidly , on good horses or on long-legged mules . When he and his sons reached an area less occupied by bands of law-abiding Wahpekute ( these he wished to avoid , because they despised him so roundly ) they planned to steal  --  steal anything  --  chickens , beeves , food of any kind  --  or more especially , horses . The outlaws had journeyed up to the Minnesota on foot for it was essential that they leave their horses behind . There were but a handful of ponies now owned by Inkpaduta 's people , and most of those ponies were in poor condition ; still they would be needed for hauling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) lay a short distance south and west of the Okobojis ; a warm spring gave the place its name . It had long been a favorite camping ground during late autumn and early winter if the season were a mild one , as this was being mild . Rattle-Strike and the others were directed to remove there . And few good lodgepoles could be found in the **30;2658;TOOLONG region  --  Echahe !  --  ponies were essential to make the move . Inkpaduta and his sons tramped long and hard , as recently the father had tramped those plains west of the Missouri River . Anyone observing them might have thought that they traveled tirelessly , but in fact they grew very weary . It was the weariness of frustration . The fact that long-sought annuities had again been refused them lay like soggy rags around Inkpaduta 's heart . His sons were slightly more philosophical about the matter : almost they had no recollection of any life except that of outlawry and privation . Their father might entertain a memory of beaded elk-skin shirts , many horses , droves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , decorated pipe bags , feathered lances with obsidian points  --  Hehehe !  --  it was difficult to believe now , but once Inkpaduta had carried a shield of buffalo hide garnished with eagle feathers ; once he possessed three wives , all young ; one time he gave feasts , and wore an otter-skin robe for fine dress ; in gambling he staked two or even three ponies on the single lifting of a moccasin !  --  None of these glories could be remembered by the twins . They had grown up in mendicancy , they had inherited little except the scorn of adjacent tribesmen and an addiction to violence . Somehow a terror of the elder gods was still theirs ( as such terror was embraced stubbornly by their father ) but they had been trained in none of the ancient courtesies . If they were aware of traditional deportment it was but to flout all custom . Their wives showed no reluctance to speak coarsely and directly to Inkpaduta , never hesitated to look him in the face , except perhaps when he threatened them overtly . Boldly their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their husbands ; the wives did not say , This child 's father , as other Wahpekute would have done . And in his turn Inkpaduta addressed his daughters-in-law directly ,  |p474heedlessly  , and did not hesitate to use their names . Rattle-Strike , his son-in-law , talked crudely to Inkpaduta , looking on his face as he did so . No one in the band hesitated at using the names of others , or in revealing their own names . Ceremonial feasts went uncelebrated as a rule . The twins had never known the discipline of a soldier society . Their women stole from each other ; so did other women of their dirty herd ; children died of neglect , or went undisciplined and uninstructed if they managed to survive . The night after leaving the Redwood region the three disgruntled travelers slept supperless . At least they could know the comfort of a fire , for in this country it was safe for them to sleep beside the flames . With empty stomachs sour and protesting , they renewed their march at the scratch of dawn . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brothers railed at each other ; Inkpaduta stalked silently , hating his sons , jealous of their youth , wishing to find horses he might steal . In a belated glaring sunrise two smokes were discerned to the southeast , smokes which they had not seen on their upward journey . They studied those faint low streamers and decided that they came from houses built recently by white settlers : clearly they were not a sign of Wahpekute camps , there was not enough smoke , the wisps arose singly and seemed shaped by chimneys . Accordingly the men altered the direction of their tramping , and soon were rewarded by encountering a yellow dog , lop-eared and whining , which had strayed away from house or wagon . This dog was hungry , and desperately seeking human companionship . It ran straightway into their hands , and was brained in an instant . Inkpaduta munched raw heart and liver while his sons built a weed fire and roasted , more or less , the rest of the carcass . . . . They went on toward the nearest smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled Germans . These people were stricken by the advent of three armed Indians ; the only Indians whom they 'd met previously were of the Christianized variety and did not at all resemble Inkpaduta and Fire-Cloud and Roaring-Cloud . Responsive to the growling of their visitors , the tremblingGermans fetched out fried cakes and pork which they 'd just prepared for their own meal . Five pairs of round blue eyes ( eyes of a young man and woman , eyes of their two little girls , eyes of the baby boy ) watched as the precious food was swallowed down ... . Ach ! was it now that all of them would be tortured to death ? Otto Rager clenched his big fists ; but his gun was unloaded , and the Indians had thrown his axe out into the grass , and his shovel lay up on the sod roof . Would now he be able to fight with his bare hands ? Sweat pearled out on Otto 's peeling forehead  --  And Uncle Klaus and his brothers and sisters had warned of just such dangers , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful cottage near Plauen , in Saxony  --   |p475  Ate , said Roaring-Cloud , sniffing happily as he glared at the terrifiedyoung Mrs. Rager . Ate ! We take woman ? Nay . It is too near . Soldiers come . You say you kill !  --  sneered Roaring-Cloud . You do not kill . You do not even take woman ! It is too near Agency , too near Fort . You are Head Man ? Nay , father . I am not Head Man . . . . We kill oxen ? Inkpaduta debated the question with himself briefly . Cattle-killing , this close to Fort Ridgely , might bring a summary penalty . Nay ! Break gun , he said . Accordingly they ruined Mr. Rager 's musket by pounding off the hammer , and then performed a mild plundering of the shanty . There was not much for them to take ; they took a bag of coffee and a box of gun caps and whatever sugar they could find ; they did not wish to load themselves heavily . Inkpaduta , past master at this sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pursued across dry easily traveled prairies if their depredations were considered too relentless . Soldiers would not deign to follow them , prompted merely by the theft of food from these poor settlers , the mere spoiling of a gun . If they shot oxen , soldiers might come . If they took woman , soldiers might come . If they killed whites , most surely soldiers would come . He said Witkotkoka ! Fool ! In winter we steal more , we take women in winter . It is hard for soldiers to follow us in winter ! Never now ! We are not one full sleep away from the Agency ! He said , We go . They left this petrified family and went on toward the second smoke . It was very close ; you could even see the sod cabin , a wad against a ridge , when you looked south from the breaking which had been plowed around the **40;2690;TOOLONG . As they bore steadily down , prepared for a fresh victimizing , they received a disconcerting surprise . Two tall men moved out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . The approach had been witnessed ; and these men would fight , they might even shoot while the Dakota were approaching . We go , ordered Inkpaduta again . They changed their course , bearing to the west . They could feel the white men gazing after them . The three Indians did not once turn their heads , they ignored the place as if they had not seen it , did not care to see it ( they had killed and eaten the lost puppy of these white men , but they did not know that . Nor did the white men know , nor would they ever learn of the summary butchering and breakfast . They would wonder what on earth had happened to Bowser , they would not know that Bowser passed his own dooryard with no farewell salute , lurching half digested within fierce brown bellies ) . ... Just hunters , I guess , Elmo.  |p476  ... Maybe so . I did n't like their looks . ... Aw , most of these dusty-noses wo n't bother no one . They even got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . But let 's hustle over to the Dutchman 's , see if everything 's all right . ... Naw , hell . I 'm holler . Less finish eating first . Many hours ' journey to the south , somewhere between headwaters of the Watonwan and the big bend of the upper Des Moines River , the Indians observed a bundle of insect shapes progressing sluggishly across a ridge before them . Shuktanka ! they whispered , and that would have been enough to bring them out of doze and monotony of weary pacing in any season , but especially now . Aye , horses !  --  three horses ! The Wahpekute went down into a prairie hollow to mumble about it .. , horses and a wagon , two horses drawing the wagon , a led horse behind . And they moved slowly , slowly  --  it would be a simple matter to overtake them . But Inkpaduta , whose wars or raids were plotted to incur the least possible risk to himself , ruled that the wagon 's occupants must be scrutinized with care . Accordingly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and gave opportunity for them to take up a station further along the route which it seemed was being traversed . From time to time he sent one of the others up to higher prairie , to crouch concealed amid the grass , and observe . Inyun ! Truly !  --  still the wagon poked along toward the east . It seemed that two people rode on the seat ; no one else accompanied the wagon either mounted or afoot . At last , from a brake of dry willows , the Dakota heard a plaint of ungreased wheels , the snorting , the clank and harness-song approaching . The wagon came up over a lip of prairie , halted , turned left , went on at a lurch , halted again , and nearly upset as it turned back to the right . Now there appeared to be but one person on the seat , a woman ; and she was baffled as to how to proceed . The bandits trotted downhill and caught up with the wagon before it reached the creek . Awareness of their presence came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bridles , and Inkpaduta himself climbed up to peer into the box and glower at her . She screamed long and loud . But even her shrieks could not awaken a man who lay amid kegs and bundles of blankets , with one boot still caught up on the leather-cushioned board from which he had fallen over backward . Witko ! Inkpaduta cried with delight . He is drunk . Good , good . Then there is spirit water in this wagon ? Aye , if he drinks not all of it ! The woman yells much . You hit her on the head ? Nay . We will not . We do not need to kill . . . . She yells , she yells loudly ! No one hears.  |p477The  wagon belonged to the sot who lay in it , one Payton Lorimer , who was known on the frontier as Honest Pay , because he had been run out of at least a half-dozen communities for forgery , larceny , wifebeating , sodomy , and other demonstrations of solid virtue . Honest Pay 's latest venture had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to sell whiskey to those tribes who , he 'd learned , visited this sacred but popular quarry frequently . Physical anguish overwhelmed Mr. Lorimer before he reached his goal . These days he had a gnawing nagging fiery sensation in his middle which he feared to be cancer , and it was assuaged only by copious draughts of vinegar . Two jugs of vinegar had been smashed to smithereens in an upsetting of the wagon ; thus he ran short in supply . Bereft of vinegar , he began on his own stock of whiskey . This was unfortunate , since the kegs had been filled according to a common formula which included not only cheap trade whiskey but spring water , tobacco plugs , and cayenne pepper as well . Honest Pay had heard that the Indians preferred strong liquor and had been determined to gratify their taste . His consort , a woebegone trull named Lulu ( they 'd met some years earlier when he became her visitor in a bawdyhouse on the edge of Galena ) was not actually his wife by bell-and-book ; but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suffered . She 'd wailed at Lorimer to return to the settlements ; Honest Pay did n't wish to go back , he was sure he 'd make a fortune out of selling his horrid concoction to unsophisticated Indians of the plains ; but internal agonies compelled him finally to yield . The Lorimers were in the second day of their eastbound about-face journey when the Wahpekute spied them . Honest Pay had been drunk since noon , and unable to drive ; but he was able to roost on the seat until the past few minutes , then he toppled back upon the load . Inkpaduta ignored the woman . In exhaustion she ceased her wails , and shrank away , chewing her hand , as the old Indian peered into her husband 's face and even gave him a tentative shake or two . Witko ! he affirmed to the others . This is true ! He drinks much . He hauled around at the man 's clothing until he found a pocket containing the wallet which most white men carried . Inkpaduta ripped open the pocket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins and some silver and pennies . Mon-ee , he growled . Mazaska ! He rebuttoned the wallet and jammed it under his belt . His sons were unfastening harness from the team . These horses are old , they reported to their father . But they are strong . We take ? Aye , we take . Is old also other horse behind ? He is younger . Nay , it is shuktanka wive , it is a mare . She is mine ? asked Roaring-Cloud , although knowing very well what the answer would be.  |p478I  take mare . I am Head Man . Roaring-Cloud and Fire-Cloud were not too familiar with the harness of white men , so with their knives they cut most of it away ; they tied the team to the sides of the wagon , and crawled up to rummage along with their father . Whiskey they found in two barrels ; and now the twins regretted that they had cut the harness ; were this team still hitched to the wagon , they would be able to carry off the entire cargo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inkpaduta had no wish to be so burdened . Who knew who these people were ? They might have friends among the soldiers ! They might have companions who traveled behind and were even now drawing close . Unimpeded by the wagon , the robbers could travel hastily , freely , toward their new camp below West Okoboji . None of them wished to possess this woman ... . She is old ! Aye , old . She is ugly ! Aye , ugly . Shicha ! They found seven Army canteens which Honest Pay had procured from a corrupt sergeant at Fort Snelling . They filled these canteens from a barrel in which the bung had already been loosed . A rusty tin cup was handy . They began to drink , grunting and gasping with stimulation as the stuff burned them . There was a stone jug from which the inert Lorimer dosed himself ; they filled that up again . Fire-Cloud labored seriously to tie this jug snugly on one of the horses with scraps of harness . No second jug could be discovered , nor any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some raw bacon was found , they consumed that ; they found brown sugar , and ate it all ; there was nothing else in the meager store of eatables to tempt them , although the twins achieved a sport in flinging handfuls of cornmeal about . Roaring-Cloud lifted his hatchet , preparing to burst open the whiskey barrels and thus destroy what they might not carry off , but Inkpaduta roared at him to desist . We take horses ! Who pulls wagon ? This woman ? Nay , woman can not pull wagon ... . She walks ! When the man awakens , he walks also . They can not carry barrels of spirit water with them ! They must leave it behind , it is here , we know where it lies , no other person knows ! And one day we come again , for more spirit water ! cried the enchanted sons . Ate , thou knowest much ! Okiksamya waun , said Inkpaduta modestly . I am acting wisely . They had not harmed the woman to any serious extent , they had but cuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little about bits , had seen bits on other occasions when they stole horses from white people ; thus they left bits in the horses ' mouths as they lashedp479 the demoralized creatures away from that pillaged wagon . All but Inkpaduta 's mare ; she wore a simple halter , he would handle her so . A slightly battered Lulu huddled on the wagon seat , wringing her hands and attempting to pray . The Wahpekute had no pity for her ( though her appearance might have extracted at least a few squirts of pity from almost any other dry hearts : her torn dirty frock , hard wings of shoulder blades squeezing out against colorless fabric , the grayinghair like cords , yellowish eyes in pale pink sockets , the blubbering lip g pand reedy voice ) . They spat in her general direction as they left . Owanyah shicha ! Roaring-Cloud sneered in parting . How ugly you are ! No one fucks you ! cried his brother . No one fucks her , no one wishes to , she is a bone , she is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ugly ! Aye , agreed their father , riding ahead . Shicha ! This was the only charity befalling poor Lulu on this day : the fact that she could not know what was said . Their abuse and condemnation , mouthed thus unintelligibly , might in no way affect the hopeless drab , might in no way increase her destitution . She retained memories still , though they squatted unexamined and unsavored in the back of her brain . But there had been a time when a man gave her a gold locket , a time when another man gave her real pearl earrings , a time when she had a stuffed reticule hidden under her mound of sweaty feather beds . . . there 'd been seasons of her first youth in New Orleans when she knew the taste of oysters , . and pigeon breasts poached in wine . . . in St. Louis she was the veritable queen of Paul Essart 's Pleasure Parlors , and had four silk dresses and God knew how many satin petticoats , and a chemise edged in pink lace , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamboat men as Leaping Lulu . Now she was sickly , bruised , foodless , horseless , moneyless . Her ' I papery hands ached from the reins , they were wounded from adjustingthose buckles which Honest Pay had been too incompetent to fasten . She did not know how to rouse her husband , she did not know when he would awaken , did not know if he would awaken . Where was 11 , the nearest house , the nearest white people ? She did not know . She kept crying . Mocking voices floated back to her . Shicha ! Shicha ! ( You are old , said the vast impervious November sky . You are old , and you are not well , and you are bereft of sustenance and opportunity , and you are out here , and you are alone . And winter will descend . And you have nothing . Nothing , said the silent sky . ) The Wahpekute hustled away toward the Iowa border , drinking as they rode . When they reached the Des Moines River it was consideredsensible to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break their trail . Then over hills and on down prairies , withp480spirit water speaking in wet voices within the canteens , spirit water hot inside them and knifing their gullets each time they swallowed . They halted before dusk , made a fire ; drank more spirit water , were not hungry because they drank ; they bragged and squawked and sang , they drank again . Roaring-Cloud fell across the edge of the fire and burnt his left arm ; next morning his forearm was huge with blisters . That day they found the new abode of their people on the **29;2732;TOOLONG , and rode into camp in a mutually poisonous mood . Corn-Sucker came timidly to greet Inkpaduta and received a kick in the face before he 'd dismounted . Every man of the group and one woman also lay drunk when winter struck , on the day which followed . The cross-grained wife of He-HasDone-Walking , who was always tormenting and twitting Corn-Sucker , and trying to steal from her  --  This harridan had tumbled in a posture of abandon ( skirt pulled up and legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own lodge . The Hidatsa woman saved the harpy 's life soon after snow howled over them all . She caught the big body by its shoulders and dragged the monster into her own tipi ; but still this woman had lain outside long enough to be half-frozen , and when she roused it was to mourn about her throbbing hands and feet , and to condemn Corn-Sucker for leaving her exposed for so long . Three other wives were not completely drunk , but might be considered tipsy , and were not good for much when it came to making a belated defense against disaster . The brunt fell upon Corn-Sucker and upon Cloud-Woman , the wife of He-Wears-Anything ; and upon WomanShakes-With-Cold , Inkpaduta 's daughter . This unfortunate had seen her father stupefied on scores of other occasions , had seen her husband and her twin brothers in the same condition , as they were fallen now . She bore a corrugated scar extending from her left eye socket up into her hair  --  a souvenir of Inkpaduta 's tenderness when , at the age of twelve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran berserk , or were heaped whining for food among liceriddenrobes , in the lodges . Hay ! We must cut hay , more and more ! cried Corn-Sucker . Have thee knife , my sister ? Aye , Cloud-Woman gasped , I have knife . Hasten , hasten , we must cut ! 0 daughter of That Old One , do thou bring logs and branches to cover hay  --  Else we die ! Unkinyankapi ! shrieked the unhappy and aptly named WomanShakes-With-Cold . We run ! They toiled savagely in screaming wind on the prairie above their narrow creek valley , chopping hay . They crammed it into sacks fashioned quickly of trade blankets . Howling air tried to dash and swirl the cut grasses away from them , the bent toiling women tussled against fine snow which struck with the velocity of bullets , theyp481stumbled back down to the six lodges and dumped their loads against pegged tipi covers . Woman-Shakes piled brush , stones , broken logs over the hay to hold it down ; fierce bitter sleet helped to cement this banked insulation . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they served the lodge of Corn-Sucker and Woman-Shakes the first of all , for that was where Inkpaduta dwelt nowadays . Next the lodge of Cloud-Woman ; next , the lodge of the twins ' wives .. . they were scarcely able to circle this with torn grass and debris before snow was gashing too thickly , violently ; t was too deep up on the prairie , they could cut no more hay . Three and four and five miles away , in homes protected for the moment by lakeside timber , white people were cowed by this ice and screech , and some of them marked it down in their almanacs : Monday , the very first day of December . That was when it began , that was not when it ended . The snow was a pale woman whom you might have loved one time , but now she was dead . Still she came haunting and walking and licking , so you identified her as a vampire . She was all around you ; you had little strength to avoid her murderous caresses , scarcely did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned charms and pleasantries ; she 'd danced before you in her bangles , she 'd rippled frosty skirts in the wind to provoke you , exhibited her white satin flounces ; and had made you feel vigorous and capable as you witnessed . But now her hollow teeth went into you . Maybe you suffered fever but she drained you of it promptly . With serene clammy confidence she sought to make you one with the frigidity of her own teats and talons . This she knew she would do , and she sang about it in your ears .. . steel wind humming far across the prairies , and wiring around your head and going into your ears and coming bitterly out of your nose . Your blood pulsed , chilling away and freezing and vanishing under drainage established by the snow 's white fangs , the snow 's white syringes . There had been states in which you had admired snow , felt snow to be a benefit . You could remember those conditions now ... . First off there were watery cracked windowpanes ; on these the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You put up a tiny finger and made messes of the ferns , and then a hole appeared  --  aporthole in frost . Through this aperture you saw the snow beyond . It was cake and icing , a wide-extended comfit , arching smooth and rounded and sugary , with pines black-green beyond the border . It was cut into delightful candy drifts . . . the wan candles gleamed in Mr. Mansfield 's distant house . You could see them yellow over the paleness when it was only midafternoon and the sky clung dark above . A wild small bird flew , hunting shelter from storms ; and another ! 4ip482came to join him , and they teetered and danced amid the pines , and twitched their little crests as they peeped at you and at the window . You heard your mother talk about putting out crumbs for the birds . She put them out ; fugitive birds descended whirling to fetch the crumbs away . A jay came too ( you thought he was a bluebird ) , you heard the rasp of jays ' voices bickering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longed to go and roll in it . In a later winter you were wound in flannel scarves . Barely could you remember that box sled : a cubical green box , fastened atop Big Brother 's sled . Granther was dragging you , and turning around to leer delightedly at the swaddled child he hauled along , his faded wet eyes throwing out a joyous flame from beneath the ragged fur of his cap . You rode and rode with a heavy knitted cap of your own shoved down around your ears , breath freezing on the flannel in front of your face , your nose running ; but forever you were loving the snow . When you were older you tried to make a sliding sleigh of your own ; but Granther helped you with the runners because you could not get them right . T was done at last : a low sleek thing , scarce more than six inches high from bottom of the runners to top of the sled . Wooden runners they were , with holes bored out to make them lighter , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was really Mephibosheth , because he was the son of Granther Jonathan , and was lame in both his feet , as related in Second Samuel ) was sparking one of the Kimball spinsters , when a new storm came , a heavy one . Uncle Mephib could n't get home on his clubfeet , and had to sleep on the floor for two nights in front of the Kimball fire , and how he was teased about it later ! So you did Uncle Mephib 's chores-his morning chores and his evening chores in addition to your own . Very wearying tasks they were : so much feed to be got down , so much milking , so much feeding of the pigs ; all in addition to your own wood-splitting and chopping and lugging of wood , and cutting of the ice , and fetching in of water . So Uncle Mephib appeared limping , two days late , sheepish and full of explanations and apologies . When he saw the way you had done his work , he said , By cracky , boy , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him in the pung , and carried it down to Mr. Dill the blacksmith . Both Mr. Dill and Uncle Mephib had been in battle one time , fighting the British from behind barricades at a place called Sackett 's Harbor . Mr. Dill would do just about anything that Uncle Mephib wanted him to do . So when Unk brought back your sled it had been freshly painted : a pale red , almost pink , and the letters across the top of the sled said Fly Away , and had little wiggly lines , intended to be wings , arching out from them . Best of all , Mr. Dill had put iron runners on the bottom of the woodenp488 ones , and honed them up until they were sharp . How you could tear , if the hills were the least bit icy ! You flew away , away , snow loving you , you loving it . Down you bounded ; you whipped round the curve in the old steep lane , not the tortuous shallow lane . . . woods were fuzzy on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . you throwing your weight to one side of the sled , curving your legs around , kicking your boots in the air as you went , to balance and turn and guide . There were two deer , stark in the middle of the lane , cast in metal like images of deer watching you ; you gave a yell which was only a sigh to warn them ; they went bounding away through and over the deadfalls ; you did n't hit the deer , you merely frightened them . On you went , on you soared , on you glided more tractably when you came to a level place , then speeded on the next slope . Your Fly Away could flee farther than any other sled on the mountain . Over the sharp edge of the road you went  --  bounced down into the Clarks ' garden and plunged into a snowdrift . You like to broke your neck ! Mr. Clark came out , pulling at his beard , and asked did you drop from Mars . You felt very silly , with old hollyhock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the numb tingle of your chin ... you put up your hand . Blood was beginning to come , because it was a scrape as well as a bruise ; you rubbed blood on the back of your hand and looked at the back of your hand . Blood seemed freezing into splintery bits ; and your bare hand might have frozen , too , had it not been for the Clarks : you 'd lost a mitten on the way . In you went , with a handful of snow to rub across your chin , though Mrs. Clark insisted on dousing it with arnica . What a face you made ! And how you gritted your teeth , and the whistle went through them when the arnica stung ! But you could n't make much of a yell , because Reba Clark was watching from the kitchen door . . . long brown braids hanging Indian fashion down the sides of her round cheeks , down along her smooth neck ( again , you thought of snow ) . Inside that neat house was the glow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smell of pease porridge  --  the pungency of a frosted cheese nubbin from the shanty and the half-frozen slab of minced pie which Mrs. Clark gave you for a snack . Then you were going up the mountain again , touching your chin with tentative fingers in the unfamiliar mitten with which they had provided you . . . dragging the Fly Away sled , and thinking a little of Reba Clark , because you were thirteen now and could think of girls . And rememberingwilder and wilder that long soaring seeking flight down the mountain . . . deer rigid , watching you , then spilling away through the snow . Oh , pure the snow , and decent and good , and promising to the taste even when it hurt you.  |p484But  those were light-minded joys , savored by a childish soul as round and pink as a striped winter apple put away in a barrel . She came like a witch , this snow , now in your maturity ; she would not let you have maturity for long , she intended to stifle and terminate your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had every fang , every claw , every weapon for her freezing hideous program ; she laughed in your teeth and in her own . 0 termagant storm , with knives for grinning , and light salty rustle for her laughing !  --  she had her own joke and would never share it ; and the dead leaves and birds went blowing down without your seeing them and without her caring  --  there was no remorse or explanation left  --  only the storm and bitter cold , only thickening persistent snow . The tempest drove against a once tender world for three days , three nights , into the fourth day . It stunned the Wahpekute in their tiny village . No one of them , not even the eldest ( when at last all the spirit water was consumed , Inkpaduta emerged into frantic consciousness . . . he tried to remember . . . ) could recall readily a winter storm of such intensity . As it ceased the world lay gagged , there was no whisper in woodlands , only a groan of dying wind from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starchy deposit reached nearly to Corn-Sucker 's shoulders . She and the other women fought stubbornly , mauling and bucking to reach a sparse island of willows with sentinel cottonwoods above . Wood must be fetched , no matter what the price , no matter if they perished as they floundered . Every scrap of wood in the camp was used up  --  the fingered limbs of brush which had been dragged to hold the banking of prairie grass  --  the talons of stump-roots  --  These had been clawed out long since and fed to the fires . The outcasts pressed together under their robes , suffering drearily in mutual stench as children mourned , as last morsels of muskrat disappeared . ... Why come you to this lodge ? We have no food . .. Unkiye unchuwitapi . We are cold . Our fire is small ! .. We have no fire , we have no wood . Our fire dies ! We are cold . . . we come . .. . Plated over the landscape was a crust of white iron ; it could slice into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contour of slopes was altered , the creek had disappeared , a Iow valley glared hard and lifeless up against a taunting sun . Fathom by fathom the women hacked their path to the willows , they ripped and whittled to gather precious fragments . In wood there was life . You could not eat wood , but the lean flames ate it . Spirits in the flames cried for wood , spirits reached out their shredded hands . More fuel , more fuel ! said spiritsliving-in-flames . Feed us or we die !  |p485  ( Leagues away into the north , the decent Wahpekute reposed snugly in their homes . . . you held a vague thought of such comfort . Ice had bound them tight as it bound all the world ; but they had wood because they worked for it , they had meat because they worked at hunting ; their lodge covers were tightly banked , the decorated dew-cloths made second canopies inside to retain the heat . Pots would be bubbling , no matter how winds raved outside . No matter how deep the whiteness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games among themselves or  --  tiring of trivial gaieties  --  they listened owlishly as the elders talked of once-upon-a-time elk hunting , onceupon-a-timewars against Chippeway or Sauk . At night the stars flashed in a hard sky , the Way of the Souls seemed snapping with life , you could hear those spangled points of light singing . Solid coldness bit against a face pushed out from a tipi , coldness smote the face , slapped it , sent it into hasty withdrawal . Back into warmth of the lodge . . . forget the spite outside , think only of corn to crack between your teeth , the good hot broth to be sucked up if you did hunger . Tobacco smoke hung like cobwebs ; it matted in shadows and breathed back the powdery cedar of its flavor . A Very Old One recited a myth . Each child held his breath , for they had heard the story before , and loved it , as children love the fancied terrors . Now , in night , SharpGrassdoes take his knife , and finding Boy-Beloved sleeping with the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intake of breath . . . all are listening . When people know that Boy-Beloved lies without his head , there is tumult ! So to the house of the Teal they go , but his grandmother places him on top of tipi . They enter , but only a little brown heron comes flying out . Hence the fowl that is called hokagichana , the Little-Brown-Heron , is the grandmother of the Teal-Duck ! It flies away , it alights in the corner of a marsh . The ancient voice goes on , cold seems whirring outside . It is good to be in a cozy lodge , it is good to have food , good to smell tobacco , look long upon the fire , feel the kindness and family blessing . ) Inkpaduta influenced his people but only into destruction . He would not hunt for a living any longer , or cause others to hunt ; he said that it was better to steal , or to send women begging ; and if begging was to be accomplished , they must take up tenancy near houses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Minikata , other women led the way to a lodge-of-whites , and Corn-Sucker followed along . She had seen so few whites . She had never begged from them , did not know how to proceed . They reached the Gardner cabin and stood in the dooryard . The Dakota women gestured and uttered strange words . Peeeeez . . . eeeeet ? They made these sounds and were rewarded with salt , potatoes , a piece of venison . Corn-Sucker was frightened , her heart beat rapidly as she looked upon the whites . She was glad whenp486at last they were departed and shambling back home again between the sloughs . She asked , Do all white people give ? Nay , Hidatsa woman . All do not give ! Some give ? Only some ? When you speak strange wordsSome give . One does not know , one never knows . This One never knows ! Inkpaduta could hunt and hunt well  --  this was known by CornSucker , she had seen . And when faced with a multitude of opportunitiesto secure food which they favored especially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Witness the constant feasting on the sinkpe , the muskrats , until all which the Wahpekute could find had been killed . But the edge of hunters ' husbandry was dulled  --  not by borrowing , but by sheer laziness and reprobation . As boys they had learned many skills of the hunt . It took effort to employ such skills . Now they felt it easier to steal a horse , and later sell it for food if necessary ; easier to pilfer from an unguarded wagon ; easier ( and giving more pleasure ) to pillage an unguarded camp . Had they hunted through the long mild autumn when weather was fair , they might have had much food stored . Corn-Sucker was appalled by their improvidence . She 'd even heard the men referring to the fact that fur of the muskrats was especially heavy this season !  --  yet they had disregarded such obvious warning , had failed to demand that firewoodshould be gathered and hoarded against any sudden need . To demand that food be secured and stored . Now what could they eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white pony which appeared magically with that other spotted horse , when Inkpaduta returned to Corn-Sucker by night in bare ridged wildernesses far beyond the village of the Ihanktonwanna . Hao !  --  she had grown fond of the little horse . But after the storm it lay dead . Its eyeballs were not bulged out as had been the eyeballs of the **35;2763;TOOLONG ; its eyes were shut , and the mane was frozen stiff , and snow was blown away from the wan blankness of its broad head , and a portion of the pony 's tail was frozen up through ice crust like a clump of weeds . The animal had been stabled in a sheltering thicket with the other horses , where they might put their butts to the wind , and hold their heads down ; might squeeze close for whatever warmth each yielded to the others ; and munch twigs , chew bark off the few sad saplings . No wolves had crept in to assault the carcass  --  There were no wolves about . They were gone into woods below the southern folds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along watercourses ; deer and wolves , bait and predators alike , both were departed . That should have been additional sign and warning of furious whirls , cruelp487temperatures to come ; but the idle and the unworthy declined to pay heed . ( There would be not a wolf in the Okoboji region until spring . They 'd prowl the settlements of Woodbury County instead , linger hungrily along the Little Sioux and the Raccoon , tear throats out of house dogs on the Soldier River and the Boyer and the Boone , gobble up stray travelers or wood choppers now and then , follow children who trod their path toward a slab-sided school . The wolves knew that starvation was pressing from empty spaces north and west . They knew that the Spirit Lake country would become as bald as pottery , devoid of meat as a cold licked platter . Miles to the south , now , they talked of these matters by night . Their scream went up in frost in Webster County ; but here was only a suspended dome of silence . ) **38;2800;TOOLONG , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now your bones are ice . My-Good-White-Pony , one time you chewed grasses . Now your teeth are ice . My-Pony , had you been of the Hidatsa , you would have been shelteredin an earthen lodge . These people have no room for ponies in their lodges ! But we did have room , we did make room for our ponies . When I was a child we heard our ponies breathing and stamping in lodges , and it was good to hear our ponies . They said : We are with you , and our breath is your breath , and we keep you warm . Then was I warm , now am I cold . Pony , mutimiha ! We will eat you . And this thing came to be : the pony was eaten . Women chopped down through the tough whitish hide , and there was no fat beneath this hide , but the exploring blades went on and on . They used their squaw axes , they cut under the ribs , they smashed the ribs one by one , and bent them upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into unnatural positions so that they may be broken off . And later these broken bones could be stewed into soup , and then the cooked bones would be gnawed to nothingness . All was eaten . Inkpadutaate the tongue of this white pony . Rattle-Strike and his wife ate liver and kidney and stringy horseflesh ; and also Corn-Sucker did eat of this flesh , and Woman-Shakes did eat , and children were given some of this same horse-beef , this tado . The twin sons did eat of the heart , and also their wives and their children , for all were hungry . Hams of the pony were eaten , and its long-strung muscles were boiled and chewed , boiled and chewed again . I-lushan ate of the chonicha , the fresh thawed meat , and his wife ate ; and thus also did Kechonmani and the ugly wife of him ; and He-Wears-Anything and his wife CloudWomanate this pony meat . And all children in the village ate . Sometimes at night and sometimes in fierce staring sunlight thep488winds tore at loose snow , and whirled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of snow which fell away and died and rose up again . By morning shone the dogs-of-the-sun , the pechuza , blurred glaring marks of yellow in the hazy sky . Only when it is very cold do the pechuza come to sit beside the sun , their master . It was not a large pony ; it had been large enough for Corn-Sucker and her packs , or for Inkpaduta to ride upon ; that was all the larger it was . It was large when you 'd looked at it , alive and walking ; but dead and shaved and torn into food , it did not seem large . There were twenty-more-six people in these lodges and all were hungry . It is not good to starve . Everyone did wish that the pony might have been taller and might have carried more fat . Men were compelled to go and do the work of women , for snow was too deep , and the women were not as strong as men ; and it was necessary that women cut up the pony 's body , and melt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So wood was brought by the men ; all of them were taller and stronger than the women , and there were twelve men and only seven women , and twelve men can fetch more wood than seven women ( though bringing wood is the work of women ) . But it is not good to freeze . When new winds came they caught all the loose snow and tossed it into small mountains ; thus in some places the snow was as high as a tipi , and in some places higher ; for more snow fell each time the skies went dark . In some places the wind scoured snow away from the earth until reeds and fuzz of grass and other dead dried plants showed through , and the snow was not as deep as is high a moccasin , and one walked without wading in snow . Then suddenly the drifts began once more , and they were deep and tall , and men might not surmount them ; but men could go around . It had been summer before , it was a dread winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , piling on top of each other , one winter above the other , and all crushing down at once . The bowels of the pony were chewed , and all the bones were cooked ; the brain was long since eaten ; the eyes had been boiled . The teeth alone were left ; you can not make a soup out of pony 's teeth , out of any teeth . The skull was split and chopped ; all the pieces were boiled . Men brought wood , and thus the boiling went on and on ; for there was the skin of the pony to be boiled as well . It is a soup which is made from skin and **27;2840;TOOLONG ; and if you starve you think that it is a good soup ; but you can not chew the skin because it is tough . You try to chew the skin . It is too tough . . . . And all the men who were unmarried did also eat of the pony and all its parts which could be chewed or gnawed : Bahata ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was **27;2869;TOOLONG  --  he did eat ; but he said that this was not the good meat of the buffalo on which he had been nourished in his own country many sleeps to the west , and it was not the meat of a cow . Makes-Fat-Bad said that horse meat was too sweet , and so did all ; but they were hungry and they ate . His-Curly-Sacred-Penis fed on the remains of the white pony . And once his name had been River-Boy , and he was tall and young ; and he was a Wahpekute from far to the east . Bursts-Frog-Open ate , along with him ; and one time the name of this young man was MySoldier , and he was the youth whom Jim Dickirson had struck with his piece of grindstone , he carried the scar . He did not like white men . Truly he did not like many men . Of this band of people with Inkpaduta , few did like anyone . Bursts-Frog-Open was a thief even when others were not thieves . One time , when all were cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her robe the small membrane which containedthose precious nine kernels of corn which she had carried with her all the way from her Hidatsa home ( corn was her medicine ; and each of these kernels was of a color different from the others ) . The young man Bursts-Frog-Open knew that corn was precious to CornSucker . But he hid those kernels away . Later he ate them all . CornSuckerdid not know what had happened to the hoarded seeds . She mourned , she thought that a mahopamiis might have taken them . The bitter cold continued . It was thought to kill another horse ; but how could they travel later if they had no horses ? A dog was killed . When there are twenty-more-six people , tall and small , to be fed  --  A dog is not much meat . Another dog was killed , and another dog . Many deeds done by the young My-Soldier were crimes in the reckoningof other people . But in his own mind he never found himself guilty of a wickedness : these were things which he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief interfere in any way ? He thought of himself as above regulation . His admiration of himself was immeasurable , he was braggart as well as sneak . When very young , and thinking first of lying with a girl , he told the comrades of his own group that he had indeed lain with a girl . They asked him which girl , and he named a certain girl ; but it was not true , he had never lain with her . Rumor soon conveyed the story to the little girl 's parents ; and her father went to the father of My-Soldier and said , Should I not punish thy son ? Do you not punish him ? Should I not slay thy son ? . . . But the women of the family said , Nay , it was untrue , no one had lain with this girl . Thus the youth was apprehended in a barefaced lie . He was said to have spoken loosely on both sidesp490of his mouth , he was said to have spoken like a white man ( although at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were said to speak loosely ) . All the village remarked on this , and fingers were snapped at My-Soldier , and other gestures of contempt were made in his direction wherever he walked . Had he been older he might have been soldier-killed  --  his blanket and his coat would then have been cut to pieces ! But men said that he was hokshika , not grown tall enough for a soldier-killing , he had no status as hunter or warrior . While people discussed the matter of his punishment , and while he moved unpunished , My-Soldier took matters into his own hands by running away . He went to the east until he found himself in a village of the whites , near the Wakpatanka , the great river . There he hung about , begging and stealing by turns , and he had enough , he did not starve . A family of Winnebago trooped into the settlement . My-Soldierwatched them with curiosity and a studied hatred , for he had been taught that the Winnebago were the enemies of all Dakota . There was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not as many winters as were had by My-Soldier , who had ten-again-three winters . These people were poor and sad , for they had no tipi and no ponies and no gun , and they lived in a lodge made of **46;2898;TOOLONG . With other families of the Winnebago , they had been removed from this country which they knew and where always they had lived , and they were taken under guard to a new place ; but they did not like the place to which they were removed . So toilsomely they made their way back into the country which they knew and loved , but now they found that a village of whites had been built . My-Soldier lay motionless in thick willows and wet grasses ; he watched the family of squatters . Most of all he watched the little girl . He watched for hours . Finally he saw the child sent forth with a basket and a knife ; it was evident that she had been ordered to dig the **48;2946;TOOLONG . These roots could be eaten , and the Winnebago were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from her lodge , and was engaged in solitary splashings and diggings . She had a few of the long porous roots gathered when the youth caught up with her . He leaped upon the child , once she emerged from the water and stood upon solid earth , and he kept her from screaming by stuffing a portion of those same glutinous roots into her thin little mouth . He did not wish her to scream , for then the cries might be heard by her . father and her grown brother , and they might come and kill MySoldier . He did what he pleased with the girl , in damp quivering grass ( at the time he did not know well how to do the thing he sought most to do ; but he tried to do the thing ; and he was emboldened in protracting the attempt by sight of blood upon the little girl 's thighs , and all the resistance which she made against him with . her writhingp491 body ) . Then , when desire burst loose from him , he left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled toward the north . He thought later that he should have struck the girl upon the head with a stone or a club , but he had no stone or club , and anyway did not think of doing such a thing at the time when it might have been done . But she was Hotanke , she was Winnebago . So he should have killed her . ( Later he told other Wahpekute that he had indeed killed a Winnebago . ) The girl 's father and brother did not pursue My-Soldierlong . He was a good hour ahead of them , and he decided also to walk in a stream ; they were not exceptional at tracking , so eventually they turned back . The next day the fugitive encountered white familiesjourneying with wagons , and he trotted after the wagons for miles , wearing the people down with his reiterated plea of , Eeeeet ? and his constant reapplication of a hunger sign . They gave him hard crackers and sugar , hoping to be rid of him . But he slipped up to their camp when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no one was on watch because these whites were newly come to the prairies and did not suspect that any threat would be poised against them . They owned no dog , My-Soldier had quickly observed that they owned no dog . In the middle of the night My-Soldier crept on his raid . It was as often he had played at warring and pilfering and huntingand horse-stealing with other boys . But this was no play , this was a raid . He was soon richer by a short-handled axe and a brassmountedpistol ( the flint came loose from the pistol 's hammer , and was lost , and the pistol would not shoot ; but later My-Soldier stole flints from his father , and made the weapon to shoot ) . He stole also a black pony although it was a lame pony and traveled slowly . . . perhaps the whites might have caught up with him had they awakened suddenly , but they did not awaken . Thus , filled with vainglory which found ready expression from his quick-running mouth , did My-Soldier return to his village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man . Because had he not stolen a horse and weapons from the whites , had he not taken a Winnebago girl , had he not also ( he said ) slain her ? Instead of being feted he was punished . Adjacent families of the Wahpekute said that My-Soldier had fled away to escape whatever penalty was to be meted out in recognition of his previous fault . They said that if his father did not punish him the soldiers would be called upon to do so . The Head Man of their village was a grim-faced elder warrior named Matotanzani or Healthy-Gray-Bear , who had long distinguishedhimself in wars against the Sauk ( also his brother was the father of the girl about whom My-Soldier had lied , and Healthy-GrayBearhad little patience with My-Soldier 's behavior ) . My-Soldier had not done penance for his misdeed , had given no gifts to the father of the girl , had observed no tribal ceremonies pursuant to his establish/ing himself as a man . He was thought to be too young to be accepted into manhood . Yet My-Soldier had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thus guilty of flouting holy custom ! Healthy-Gray-Bear expressed an opinion that the youth should be treated as a bad boy , he should be ducked in cold water as sometimes bad boys were punished . So he was thrown into cold water five times . Each time he scrambled out , asking for mercy ; he was flung back again ; but five times were enough . Also the pony which My-Soldier had stolen from whites was given to the family of the girl whose name was scandalized . The black pony was lame , it was decided to kill the black pony . . . . The injured family ate the pony , and they gave no part of the meat to My-Soldier 's family , but gave some of the meat to other families . My-Soldier thought it wrong that they should do this . He was oversized , taller and stronger than most boys his age , and he bullied the other boys incessantly ; they loathed him . The next year several boys whom he knew were permitted to go into solitary retreat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive signs and know mysteries . It was stated frankly that those who qualified might be allowed to dance the Sun Dance on their return , and thus be received into a society of full-grown men and warriors . The father of My-Soldier said to his son : You do not go . It is said that you are too young ; you do not go in this summer ; perhaps in the next summer . My-Soldier said to his father : I know a boy named Three-GoodSticks , and Three-Good-Sticks is to go ; and I have as many winters as he ! But the Head Man does say that you shall not go ! All are agreed on this . All men of the Little-Fox Society say this same thing . So other boys went , and My-Soldier did not go . His heart turned dark . In that same summer the youth seduced or overpowered ( no one ever quite knew how the thing was accomplished ) his female cousin , a girl named Little-Fire-Woman . He did this thing not once but many times . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juneberries and My-Soldier followed her there . Once having been taught the act of intimacy , it may have been that the girl desired very much to repeat it ; and it may have been that MySoldierdid not necessarily employ force to cause her to submit again . She was a stupid creature , a willing but incompetent worker . She was of an age to marry , but no man offered presents to her father . Little-Fire-Woman was excessively fat . . . also she had a habit of indulging in meaningless titterings which most people considered ridiculous . When witnesses came upon My-Soldier and Little-FireWomanlying together , and told later of what they had seen , no onep493knew quite what to do about it . The pair could not be made to marry , because this cousin was hanka-shi and thus forbidden to My-Soldier ... no man might marry his female cousin ! But still , My-Soldier was not yet a man . What should be done ? While deliberations were being held , the burly boy solved the problem , for the moment at least , by running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but went north across high wide prairies until he found the village of the Makatooze Wahpekute , those who dwelt on the River of the Blue Earth . This was the occasion of his first meeting with River-Boy , whose name became His-Curly-Sacred-Penis later on . Their lives were mingled after that , they shared an almost studious deviltry . When they stole , they stole not only from whites who happened to be moving through the region , but they stole from people of their own Wahpekute gentes . My-Soldier stole from his own lodge , from his own father . He stole gun flints and later a rifle . He stole from his father 's medicine bundle ; so beyond doubt he was mad . No sane person , be he ever so debased , might think to withstand the force exerted by four species of medicine : fowls , quadrupeds , medicinal herbs , medicinal trees . The demented My-Soldier had failed of admittanceinto true manhood and into the Order of the Sacred Dance . He was too dronish to contrive medicine of his own : thus he stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and the wakan sack must consist necessarily of either weasel-hide , raccoonhide , squirrel-hide , otter-hide , loon-skin . . . some men said that one variety of fishskin might be permitted ; and of course the skin of serpents . This was as ordained in a remote past by the great Unktehi , whose bones were found rarely , washed out of gravel ; and one of the noble monster 's bones might be taller than a tall man ) . The wakan sack of My-Soldier 's father was made cunningly of the hide of a red squirrel . From this holy pouch the evil youth stole the down of a female swan , a kinky mass of buffalo hair , some boneset roots , slivers chipped from roots of a walnut tree . ( Toko ! He would not enjoy a long life . His life would be very short . There was no hope for him . He should be killed . He would be killed if ever he came within sight of his own kin or villagers again . And My-Soldier would have no red dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come ; for red dishes and spoons were a fine thing to have , and would be awarded only to the brave , the honorable , the circumspect . He deserved none and would receive none ! ) He robbed the bundle also of a dried human ear which had wonderful properties , and of a corroded medal given to his grandfather by the English king of long ago . He thought that it would make him greater than his father , greater even than HealthyGray-Bear , to have these trophies in his possession . He had no scruples , he much preferred to do the thing that other folk held it wrong to do . Thus he was ruled away from respect or consideration ,  |p494and  at seventeen he drifted into the little legion of the hated and scorned and feared . River-Boy came along with him . Now the name of My-Soldier was become Bursts-Frog-Open . Why was this ? Because his hand was strong . ... He said , My hand is strongest ! Others of the outlaws denied that his hand was strongest . The twins said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So said One-Staggering , the man without a nose . But the former River-Boy , who had lately been given the name of His-Curly-Sacred-Penis , declared that it was true : the hand of his friend must be the strongest . He urged that his friend demonstrate the power of his hand . This was done by My-Soldier . He went down to a marsh near which the few lodges were establishedat this time , and he lay amid summery reeds beside a pool where green flowers lay like flecks of green ice upon the blackness of the water . When the moment was right and ripe , the hand of MySoldierwent forward quickly , and closed . When he arose he held , caught tightly by the legs , the tontontanka , the fat heavy bullfrog with the deep voice . When he returned to the Wahpekute there were those who laughed , and said , What means this ? It means nothing ! Anyone  --  a mere boy , for instance  --  can catch a frog ! This does not mean that the hand of this young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand is swift ; and many hands are swift . But His-Curly-Sacred , knowing the strength of his friend 's hand , said only , Watch . All stood watching . The hand of My-Soldier began to close around the body of the frog , and the frog was very large , and its skin was tough . Tighter , tighter closed the hand of My-Soldier as he stood with arm extended , holding the frog far out in front of him . The mouth of the frog was wide open , and bright bulging eyes were thrusting out of its head . First one eye popped loose from the head with a small sound , and then the other eye popped loose with a small sound , and the two eyes swung by their attached strings as crab apples swing when a breeze rushes hard against them . The mouth of the frog was very wide now , its sticky tongue hung free , the colored portions of its inner body began to appear within those distended jaws . Then appeared the stomach of the frog , and also appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frog had eaten not long before it was caught . Then appeared other entrails of the frog ; and people exclaimed aloud , for it was a strange thing to see the mere squeezing of a single hand doing all this to the body of a frog , and a tontontanka at that , and not a mere nashka , an ordinary frog . ( Yet when they gave the youth his new name they did not name him Tontontankakamdaskiya but they named him Nashkakamdaskivap495 which means Bursts-Frog-Open ; because it was easier to say this than to say Bursts-Bullfrog-Open . The young man did not mind , he was glad to have a new name . ) And when he had finished squeezing , all the entrails of the frog had come out of its body , and the tough warty skin was empty and flat as a parfleche from which pemmican has been taken out , to eat , in time of famine ; and then the dry worn hide of the parfleche itself must be boiled , to make a soup ; but it is not a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not good to starve ) . When that thing come screeching , and I listened to the howl of it , I thought : I 'm better off in here than out there , or my name ai n't Sil Waggoner . Old Bill Dog he thought the same . He did n't have much tail  --  somebody 'd whacked it off when he was a pup , fore I acquired him or he acquired me , or whatever  --  Did n't have much tail , but what he did have he 'd plant right tight over his bunghole , and try to press it between his hind legs , every time I opened the door . Like to say , Gracious , Mr. ! Do n't put me out in that plagued wind and snow  --  do n't make me go ! And I 'd say to him , Hai n't you lucky ? How 'd you like to be out there , hey ? And t was like he said he did n't want to be , no way . So I stretched front the fire and congratulated myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing as I thought of my logrolling . There hai n't a white neighbor within thirty mile , not that I know of ; but mine 's a timber claim in part , and t was easy to cut enough to make a Ten-by-Twelve , eight foot high on the walls . ( Slim logs , naturally , for a double wall to be banked solid with sod in between . Snugness was what I craved . ) Had them logs stacked for drying in no time at all . Been a fur man and even mountain man in my time , and timber man as well . In such pursuits you learn to use an axe , or else you ai n't going to be no kind of man for long . But , working sole alone , I could n't get them twelve-foot logs up to the top , even slender as they was . So I figured like this : I 'd got the logs cut , I 'd let them weather  --  even choose some good chunks of long-grain which would split for shingles , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to speak , to be put together . If folks come round that might help with the raising of the house , fine enough . If they did n't come , I 'd just set tight until they did . Built myself a neat little soddy in two three days , and Bill Dog and I was cozy in that . Dug her in , deep enough and high enough so 's I could use her for a stable if I was ever fortunate to get that cabin up . Well . Chance come along in the shape of a three-striper and four army privates . They 'd rode down from Ridgely looking for some Indin horse thieves , but the Indins had skun out ; though I guess the soldiers did recover three stolen horses and deliver them back to the rightful owners . They was on their wayp497returning to the fort when they seen my smoke and come to learn what was what . When I seen who was nearing , I went to meet them with a bottle . We had a nip or two , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . ( Did n't tell them that I had more'n one jug buried , to last me through the winter if t was bad , and sure as shooting she looked like she was going to be . ) Gentlemen , I tell you : let 's raise up my house , and when it 's up I 'll then produce my jug and a quartereagleapiece . You ca n't earn money that fast in the Army . Or leastwaysI could n't when I was youthful and served under Colonel Henry Dodge in the old First Dragoons ! We had this house up so fast t would make your head spin ; and then our heads really did spin a little , count of the jug . They took their sore heads on to Ridgely next morning , and here I was a-chuckling beside my new mansion , with only the fireplace to go . Time of the storm , though , in December : you 've heard folks say t was cold as a witch 's teat , but that cold would of froze the teats clean off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow and the snow did pile ! Clean to my ridgepole at that there side the cabin ! Man congratulateshimself if he 's snug amid such matters , and Bill Dog and I was snug enough . Had pemmican , jerked venison in plenty ; smoked fish by the quintal , or so it seemed ; two kegs fat salt pork I 'd freighted in behind my critters and had n't even touched ; barrel of flour , nother of meal ; plenty salt , sorghum , vinegar , sugar , and such fixings . Did n't need no candles  --  Bill Dog and I went to bed with the prairie birds and rose in the same good company . Pine knots around if we had to make a glim . For recreation I owned a Bible that belonged to my dead mother . I 'd treasured that little Book my whole life through , though strayed from many of its teachings . I 'd lain with many 's the woman , but I stayed away from bats and cows , and did n't go around breaking the legs of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my time , but both of them was tawny  --  one Arapaho and one Pawnee  --  and both was long since departed . . . . Still I liked to read my mother 's Book , times . Reading mighty slow , howsomever  --  we didn't. catch much schooling down in the Femme Osage where I was born . I 'd busted the Third , Fourth , Sixth , and Seventh Commandments wide open : Kind of preened myself that I 'd been able to keep the First , Second , Eighth , Ninth , and Tenth . Fifth always bewildered me . Man I knew up the Missouri had committed what he called the Shorter Catechism when he was a younger  --  Oh , I do n't know bow much he 'd committedbut he 'd committed a great share . And he said it like this : Fifth Commandment requireth the preserving the honor of , and performingthe duties belonging to , every one in their several places and relations , as superiors , inferiors , or equals . Again and again I 'd wheedle him into saying it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man to know whether he 'd broke the Fifth or not ? Was n't no way I could savvy it , so I just give up . Well . Bible was all I had for reading matter , cept a raggy New-York Daily Times , date of September first . Some mover give it to me , passingin October . I could trick my eyesight any time I figured t was worth it , and that was seldom . Kansas is realizing all the horrors of anarchy and civil war . . . . Murder of eight pro-Slavery men on PottowatomieCreek , by a party of Free State men . The victims were most horribly mutilated . In some instances , after their throats had been cut , their legs and arms had been chopped off and their eyes gouged out . All the pro-Slavery families at Hickory Point were driven off at the point of the bayonet , and their horses and provisions stolen by the Free State men . Says I to Bill Dog , Hai n't you glad that you and me 's settled down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't things like that a-happening ? And Bill he lowed he was glad . And do n't , he says , read me no more of them ass-in-ine bulletins bout such doings , or bout Newport that also it tolt in the same paper . The Great Ball At Newport . . . . It has given to the Bellevue an eclat which no other house in Newport can boast of , and will be closely followed up by a series of hops , charades , concerts , masquerades , tableaux , and other social amusements , that will end the season in a most brilliant manner . Says I to Bill Dog , And hai n't you pleasured that you got no necessity for putting on white tar-le-ton and crimson bro-cade and flounces of black lace , and going peer-oh-etting like Mrs. Woodville from Baltimore or Miss Schaumbergfrom Philadelphia or Mrs. Morgan Livingston from New-York , with a white lace man-till-a and blue feathers in your hair ? And Bill he lowed he did n't want no part of it . He who runs may read , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read no way . Just set happied with a notion of our blessings : everything from saleratus to dried peaches and back again . Potatoes down in the potato hole to keep them far below frost ; turnips also ; onions ; name it , Mr. , and we 'll feed ! Whole big keg of prairie hens that I put down in salt , out in the solid lean-to that I tacked against the cabin 's end , to say nothing of four fresh deer a-hanging inside there , and now they 'd be froze solid for the season , and thus preserved . Lean-to chinked and rocked right tight : could n't ary a rat get inside , let alone a larger varmint . Bear might come , try to rip off the door , but I 've met bears afore this  --  and bigger ones than they got here , and grayer , by gad . That 's how come these pink wads on the side of my head , and my left ear tore half off . Grizzly . But he 's laying out , up past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of either ear . Long ago , that was ... . One kind of varmints was around here , howsomever , but they madep499 tracks and I reckon are still making them . T was maybe a fortnight fore the storm began . I 'd seen elk sign ; went to some distance to followit up , but fortune did n't smile . Bill Dog was minding the manse , and minding it loudly as I thought , for I could hear him when I topped that rise of prairie out yonder . Two varmints they were , both bent on making solution of the big brass padlock and heavy chain I 'd tinkered to the slab door of that lean-to . I 've learnt , the mean way , that t was wise to lock up when there was movers going through the country , and every once in awhile some movers did come through . But these varmints was n't movers  --  not for the moment , anyways . I had my double-barreled Kaintuck , and put the first ball into the logs smack betwixt their heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  did n't want to have a bunch of yellowbellies waiting for me in the weeds every time I stepped outside to make my water . T is kind of like a boys ' game with Indins : they like to steal , but if you tag an ordinary Indin at it , he just thinks he 's tagged , and then he laughs , and maybe starts right in to beg instead . They was n't none from hereabouts . I had n't seen their like afore ; and all the local Wapakoots had left me strictly minding my own business , for I would n't even yield a nipperkin of whiskey ; they knew it well . . . . I turned up the second barrel , and locked it , and let drive again ; but by this time the bastards was halfway to the crick and going hard . I creased that ball acrost , maybe two foot or so above them ; oh , yes , Mr.  --  they heard it make its music , and it was like putting a fresh charge in a can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean enough ) . They fairly soared ! I was loaded up again , by the time they stopped to make a few insulting signs . They did n't know my old Kaintuck would take six fingers in a load  --  thought that they was well beyond my range . So I put another ball above their heads  --  t was right down by that little draw , behint that single cottonwood . You ought to seen the tracks they made , with one more ball a-singing on its way , and me a-whooping and a-hollering like I was gone demented , and Bill Dog a-trying to tear down the house door to join in . . . . No , no , they hai n't been here again , and I do n't reckon that they 'll come . I figure there 's one old white-shockheadedturkey cock that they ai n't going to wherrit any more , whether I affix that padlock or I do n't . So here come some of the poisonest weather that a man could meet . I would n't have give a mouse-pelt for ary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . That 's the worst : the air truly turns to blue , and there is a kind of whining sound like a gang of fiddlers was standing back yonder somewheres , all drawing their long bows acrost their strings , keeping steady , drawing on and on , but always playing that same note . And if you try to face it , you think it 's bees or yellow jackets that have got around you in a mass ; but actually t is only pebblesof the snow , driving like salt-and-pepper from a shotgun that'sp500fired square in your face , and stinging all the while . You ca n't breathe , you ca n't see , the air 's solid with it , you ca n't hear nothing but that screech of mighty unseen fiddlers and the wild strings that they 're a-playing on ; and it all pours like angry needle tips a-jabbing at your hide , and itching up your nose until the snot flows out and freezes so you got twin icicles a-hanging . . . and forcing through your lids against your eyeballs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is freezing there as well ; but still it all looks dark and blue ! I 'd planned my wood and thought I planned it well . Two stacks on either side the door , starting in as high as I could reach , and stretching out a couple rods on either side . No matter now which quarter marked the storm , I 'd have the shelter of one pile or other . Thus I made it my business to see that I started taking wood from off the furthest end away ; and thus there 'd always be some fuel for evil days , right next the door . But , pshaw ! The going to the stable  --  that was something else . I had my critters there in the old soddy ; two yoke was all I had  --  I 'd sold the rest  --  but they was all I 'd need for any future hauling . . . . Pshaw !  --  when I stepped out from shelter of that woodpile I liked to choke to death . Worse than that , I could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulphur !  --  they 'd abide right where they was , those oxen . They 'd had plenty hay the last time I seen to ' em , and the snow was bound to blow inside , and they 'd eat that  --  You could n't teach an ox that he should build a fire , melt the snow , boil the water , and then drink that , rather than munch snow firsthand . They 'd suffer slightly if the snow kept up , but only slightly ; and I never seen an ox that was n't built for suffering . So now my problem was to find my house again . Would you believe it ? I had n't gone a rod beyond the woodpiles ' end  --  I 'd swear to that  --  and yet my house was gone . Yes , sir , clean gone . I ducked my head against my chest , and lifted up my fists to half protect my face , and started back through all that rush of sand and fleas and pepper , salt , and emptiness , and lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But twas n't . Now , this will be a caution ( what I says ) if I fall down to die right here in my front yard ! But Bill Dog saved the day . He did n't like to be alone , and so he made protest gainst the whole idee . I heard him bark , just faint , but I heard him ; and t was quite the other way around ; seemed like my gol damn house had moved around the compass ; but there he was , a-barking in the wrong direction , so I started working toward him . Next thing I knew I stumbled fair against my woodpile ; and I fought my way along that jagged pile . But I was on the wrong side  --  had to climb back to the other end , and round the corner of it  --  and there I was , quite sheltered , but my mouth was open wide and I was crying tears of ice . Had n't been for that blame dog , I 'd ended upp501down by the crick somewheres ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if ever it did thaw . . . . We had a little nip on that ; leastways I did . And then a-setting through those hours , with one window darkened steady as the snow went mounting , until finally it blotted out ; there was n't even paleness in the window any more . But Bill and I were contented as two ticks in a fox 's ear , pleased and fat . I had corn biscuitswith a splash of sorghum ; fried a plate of pork and onions ; my Bill Dog he had a piece of venison complete with bone , and he licked the last fried onion off my tin . Spread myself on robes before the fire , old Bill a-laying close . I tried to read my mother 's Bible , but I could n't spell it out to suit  --  the print is mighty small , the flames and light was jumpy , and I went to sleep on Better is a dinner of herbs where love is . . . and so I dreamt about it . Dreamt about another fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years agone . Dreamt about an old man talking , telling tales ; and that old man he was n't me , his name was Daniel Boone . We called him Colonel . And he 'd let the neighbor kids come in and listen whilst he yarned . He set there with white-braided locks , and he told of being took by Indins years before , when he was hunting on the Green ( that 's in Kentucky ) . The women , Colonel Boone was saying in his quiet elder voice , they fell a-searching of my hunting-shirt , to see what I was toting ... Then I waked again  --  not Daniel Boone , but me , Silvanus Waggoner  --  and there I was alone in Minnesota Territory ; and I was getting long in years . Once in awhile I could n't help but brood . Now , take Bill Dog : I reckoned him as five or six , in age , and how much longer would he be with me ? Five year , if I was lucky . And then I 'd be alone ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than the men they 're wedded to ) . And Little-Woman-Never-Cries was buried under rocks so long before ( she died in trying to bear the only son I ever might have had ) and Pretty-Gopher-Running , she was gone nigh onto fifteen years , of the consump . Oh , after that I batched it strictly , seeking femalesonly when I felt the need . But there was more to lonesomeness than seeking females , or forgetting them . There was the times I 'd look down at that brindled dog and want to scream at him : Gol damn it , talk ! Why ca n't you talk ? . . . For I 'd gone talking to myself , and answering as well ; t was quite a habit , growing steadily ; and that 's the way a lone man gets a name for lunacy so frequent . And more than that : the wish to have another form within those walls ; the times when you were weary , wearier than any slave that ever worked , because you 'd drove yourself so hard ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots , extend your feet , just set and stare into that fire ... would n't it be a wonder if you dozed , and then awakened smart , with smells of cooking all around ?  --  and heard a kindly light/formed laugh , a woman 's laugh , with pride and all appreciation flowingin her tone  --  And heard her say : Pull up now , Sil . I got the meat well-cooked ; and here 's the hot-bread fresh . . . I want that you should taste this wild grape jam I made whilst you was hunting ! Well . Nothing in the Bible matches that for lonesomeness ( the feel within you , worse than any words ) . And then you 'd mutter : Aw , tarnation . . . and pick up them softened fuzzy scraps of New-York Daily Times again , and try to fix your smoky eyes upon the lines of print , and try to spell it out again . The disease was undoubtedly introduced on Yellow Hook and along that shore from infected vessels anchored for awhile in the Channel between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't care how many people died of it . And reach around and twist the banjo from the peg where it was hung , push back the rawhide loop to get it clear , and feel the fingers tightening and loosening , and hear the strings make little clinks and jinks ; then start a-whacking soft and slow . . . not knowing what to sing , trying to sing something lately popular that I 'd heard sung on a steamboat when I come up the Mississip some months before . I 'm dreaming of sweet Hallie . . . listen to that mockingbird , listen to that mockingbird . . . but t was a new song , and I did n't know the words , and was n't certain of the tune . Home to me his trumpets peal , and at my side he 'll softly kneel , with a gold distaff and a golden reel . Ko-mell-a-lolla-boo , shy-doorah . ... Now , Bill Dog , why you fretting ? ... Do n't you like my music ? Frog went a-wooing , he did ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol by his side ! Kemo , kimo , kay-ro ! ... By gol , you do n't pay me grace nor heed . ...

When I was last out for wood , you went along . Stood about two foot from the door , and sprayed them logs ; and then you hiked it for the fireside . You sure do n't need to go again . So he led us down to cypress swamp ; the ground was low and mucky . There stood John Bull in martial pomp , and here was old Kentucky ! 0 Kentucky . . . ye hunters of Kentucky ! 0 Kentucky ... . ... Howling , are you ? By dad , that 's adding insult !

Oh , they puffed and they died . . . mother , make my bed soon , for I 'm wearied of hunting , and fain would lie . doon . By God . That damn dog . Could n't be anyone out there . He 's plumb crazy ! Just scairt of the storm , I reckon . Ca n't blame him . Oh , I fear you are poisoned , Lord Ronald , my son ! Oh , I fear you are poisoned , my pretty one ! . . . Oh , yes , I am poisonedWell , that 's enough for me ! Could n't be anybody out there . ButAfter I 'd carried her inside she kept mumbling : Light . . . light .. . through her frozen lips ; which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of firelight that kind of skittered crost the drifts . Oh , yes , that 's what she must of seen , although she could n't see it fur . This looked like quite a chore , and right at first I never thought to save her . But I had one tub and one big bucket , so I started in . Tried to prop her on a mound of robes , propped high on her side , with both arms hanging off into the bucket of icy water , and both limbs pushed down into the tub . I pulped up a bunch of onions and spread the wet sauce over her face and ears  --  she had n't looked like much to start with , poor old thing , and did n't look like nothing human or female now , with all that onion mess a-pasted over her and fairly in her hair . But still she owned gumption , and she 'd try to talk . Kept saying weakly : Light ... and after while she says , My man . . . went down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and I says , Lady , if your man 's out there , and drunk , he ai n't , that 's all , he ai n't ! He 's down in hell this minute , and will be the drunkest that he 's ever been fore he gets out of hell ! I says , part way to answer all her mumblings , and part way to give me comfort whilst I toiled , a-rubbing them poor limbs of her'n with ice , one at a time  --  I says : If he 's out there somewheresbehint where you was laying , there could n't fifty Bill Dogs locate him . I 'll dig him out sometime next spring . Just get yourself all customed up to widowhood ! . . . I might have added also : And customed up to life without two hands and without any feet !  --  but could n't bring myself to even say the words , and hated much to think them . But in another hour I could take a little heart ; I watched the solid ice a-coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever see the like , you 'd ne'er forget . Just solid casings , solid ice , a-rising through the raw skin where I 'd rubbed and worn it red with rubbing  --  solid blocks of ice around both feet  --  And solid gloves  --  ice , you know  --  around both handsShe 'd moan like a sick cat at times , and other hours she would be so silent that I thought her dead . And helpless as a baby wren ; I hadp504to tend her every way . I stowed her in the bed , she got it wet right off ; and finally I had sense enough to employ a wide flat pan I 'd bought when I was fitting out : t was meant for cooking maple sap , but it would serve . I 'd put my hands within her armpits , hoist her up in bed , and set her on the panShe was n't conscious much until the second day that followed . And now I turn away from recollecting all the agonizing that she had , when blood was flowing once again into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I nursed and tussled , whilst she raved or whilst she mumbled . . . Indins . . . ah , they 'd took the team her husbanddrove ... took a led horse that her husband bought from movers that he met . . . vinegar , she talked about , and whiskey too . . . and gutachesthat her husband sobbed of . . . and just the way I 'd thought her dead , she thought that she was dead herself . And who was I , if that befell ? If she was dead  --  Who was I ? Angel , devil , spook ? She did n't know . And for some reason Bill Dog liked to lay beside her bed . He would n't move for hours : just lay quiet , beating tail against puncheons of the floor , like he was saying she belonged to him . He was the one who 'd sensed that she was in the snow . Feel better , lady ? Yes . Limbs still a-hurting pretty bad , I reckon . Yes . . . it hurts so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady . Two n't do no good . I 'm . . . crying . . . cause my limbs . . . they 'll have to cut them off . . . now , wo n't they ? Nope . You mean  --  I wo n't be crippled ? Oh , kind of , for awhile . But I 've seen frosted limbs as bad or worse than your'n , and seen the people get the use of them again . Your hands and feet are better by the hour . Where is this ? What say ? I mean  --  where am I ? Is this  --  in a town ? Hell no , madam . Hai n't another shack in thirty mile . We 're nigh the South Fork of the Watonwan . But not too nigh . What 's  --  your name ? Sil Waggoner . Silvanus , if I want to sound important . Is  --  there  --  anybody else  --  ? Nobody else . I 'm wifeless , childless . But I ai n't Bill Dog-less .

I guess I was . . . asleep again . Three hours , more or less . Now , how 'd you like a little broth ? Oh , yes . . . please .. . That taste right good ? Oh , yes . What is it ? Well , if I was one kind of Indin , I 'd say hupa . If I was another kind I 'd say wahanpi . And thus t would go . But I ai n't any kind of Indin , so we 'll just call it any kind of soup you want to say . . . . What 's that ? Oh , it 's got deermeat , bones , and onions , prairie hen , a smidge of turnip and potato  --  Right good , ai n't it ? Bill Dog likes it too . Where is he ? Bill Dog ? Right beside you . See ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing better now . So you are . Ai n't so fat-faced as before . You know , t was Bill that found you . Yes . I member when you tolt me . . . seems so long ago .

No , no , he could n't  --  Could n't go ! Not there . Just to  --  the Bad Place . Cause he 's . . . bad . . . like me . That 's where I 'll go . Where ? The Bad Place . I do n't think you 're going nowhere right away . But why the Bad Place ? Cause I was bad . My whole life long .

" Hey now . " " The difference between the rich and poor is that the poor still believe in heaven , " she said , and let his hand take the glass from hers . " If you were born in heaven , and know it 's a fraud , there 's no place to go but hell . I 'd give anything to have been born poor , so I could have tried to become something .

He went softly into the kitchen to renew her glass , and for an instant she was dressing a faceless but beautiful child for a party , and ragged nerves , crumbling certainties , hysterical discussions , ridiculous posturingswere all washed over in a sentimental glow , and she was no longer a distracted Katherine Mansfield heroine crying , " Oh , what 's it all about ?

" Stretching the laugh , she made herself busy with a cigarette . They were really watching her now  --  did they expect her to fly apart ? A look of warning passed between them . Abruptly rising into her own smoke , she said , " I 've got to go . I 've kept you up all night as it is . " They protested , but she ignored their protests . She saw that they were dismayed by her sudden move ; they felt that they had somehow failed her . Oddly , she was content that they should feel so . She laughed a good deal , pulling her sweater over her shoulders . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you both , even if you are so self-satisfied . " Her face felt the cool wet fog . Leonard grabbed her elbow as her ankle turned on the edge of one of the walkstones . " Good night , " she cried again . " Bobbie , bring the girls over to swim tomorrow . How 's three o'clock ? Do n't bother calling , just come . " She waved . From their safe doorway , standing together , they watched her go . Now again dark roads , late cars , lanes overtaken and violated in their after-midnight quiet , and the MacDonalds abruptly blotted out by the returned memory of Bernard and the Skyline . Was this how thesituation began that she had seen other women get into ? If Bernard 11took an apartment , would she live in it , or meet him there ? She miserablydid not know . How many times , unwilling , dead for sleep , had she driven , this late or later , these lanes and this gateway , to find her mother waiting up , the hall lights on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And right now she had no house key ; she would have to ring j dand waken Lizardo . The entrance light was on . She parked before the garage doors , found the doors locked , and left the car where it stood . Coming back to the house she walked on the wet lawn rather than on the gravel , and she tried the door stealthily in the hope that Lizardo might have left itp104open for her . Locked . But instantly , almost with the same depression of the latch which her thumb made , the door clicked open and Lizardo stood there . He must have been waiting on the hall bench . She gave him not even the parody of a smile , saying only , " Could n't you have left it unlocked ? " She stopped . Out of the web of wrinkles his black eyes looked at her soberly . He backed up , swinging the door wide , and scowled some meaning or warning . His lips pursed in a whisper she did not catch . " What is it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of the stairs she heard the steps and saw the shadow that came to the library door down the left-hand hall . Mother ? Not that , not as if she were fourteen years old ! She squinted angrily , trying to see . The shadow spoke . " Sabrina ? " " Burke , " she said . The leap that her heart had given when he spoke began to shudder down into a hard slugging pound . She laid a hand , suddenly gentle , on Lizardo 's white arm . " Go to bed , " she said , and went on down the hall.  |p105URKE  did not offer to kiss her , and the impulse or habit of affectionin herself was no more than a moment 's hesitation , a flickB of the eyes and a readiness in the muscles . Then she had gone past him without any greeting beyond her first startled naming of his name , and seated herself in the padded desk chair . She drew a deep , cautious breath to quiet her pulse , and wished instantly she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In her ear the electric clock made its dry whirring . Its hands pointed to twenty past one . Her mind , leaping twenty guilty miles , imagined Bernard lying beside his wife , and she wondered if mistrust had yet begun to divide them , if suspicion had popped on its little red light in the woman 's mind . Looking at Burke , she thought , My husband  --  my ex-husband , but torpor and fatigue prevented her from feeling anything more acute than a sort of apprehensive breathlessness . She said , " When did you get in ? If I 'd known you were coming I 'd have been home . " " I came up on the ten-o'clock flight . " His voice was as dry as the whirring of the clock . His face , not tanned enough , gone sallow in offices and examination rooms , wore a look of almost prissy reserve ; his eyes were very watchful . Beyond the clock 's noise it was unhealthily quiet . She had a perception of how in allp106the dark house everything slept  --  her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family hoards  --  while in this deep room , Rembrandt-lighted , went on something lurid , by every inherited prejudicedisreputable and unclean . She said , " You 've had a long wait . I 'm sorry . " His watchful eyes seemed to estimate the depth and reach of her apology . He had always walked with an exaggerated stiffness of the spine , almost leaning backward , even on a golf course , and he stood now as if relaxation would have been immoral . As much a puritan as herself  --  a Spanish-Californian puritan with a little Inquisition relentlessness left over in him . She knew his contempt for weakness ; she feared him as she feared her conscience . But all he said , and that in the voice of commonplace , was , " Not long . It was after midnight before the cab got me here . " As the silence between them lengthened , spun out by the whirring clock , what had been shame and embarrassment began to swell in Sabrina into angry bitterness . Was he simply going to stand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had left off the night before , when someone 's stomach ache called him away ? Why did n't he ask where she had been ? He was obviously wondering . Or force the talk to where it had to go , to the question of their future ? Or curse her , beat her to death with the fireplace poker . Anything . Harshly she burst out , " Why did n't you call again ? I waited all eve-ning . " He was not so composed as he pretended ; she saw something happen around his eyes , some expression subtly change there . But as so often when he was outraged or angry , his feelings showed principally as an excessive , impenetrable politeness . She saw him put it on , and she heard in his words the iron of an unyielding self-justification . " Why , " he said , " I was waiting for you to call me . " Anger , a sheet of it like white lightning , dazzled her view of him where he stood stiffly above her , judging her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be wonderful to feel so blameless ! " He stared at her hard-mouthed , and she saw in his eyes the flare of cold anger like the reflection of her own . But he only said quietly , " Dop107you always have to lash out at somebody else when you 're in the wrong ? Why would n't I feel blameless ? " Turning her head away , playing with the silver desk set , her cheeks stiff with the will to hurt him , she said , " Do n't you generally ? " " I do in this . " " Well , I do n't , " she said . " Is that what you wanted to make me say ? " He moved then  --  she heard him cross the room and take a book from the bookcase with a slur of sound , and a second later slide it back again . Then he returned and stood across the desk from her until she shoved the pen stand furiously aside and flung up her head and cried , " Oh , take your eyes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ! " But he would not let himself be pushed toward anger again . He had the advantage of her , he had been able to prepare an attitude for this interview . She had only her emotional disarray to cover her . Every word of their talk would emphasize his control and her lack of it , his probity and her disreputable collapse . Blameless ? Of course he was , by any standard anyone would understand . Of course he had every right to look at her in fury and disgust : she granted it even while she resented it . And listen to his voice , dispassionate as if he were interpreting an X-ray . Could he have any idea how much he had become a doctor even outside the office ? " We wo n't get anywhere if we start out like this , " she heard him say . " And we have to talk . Do n't we ? " She bent her head to let her spread hand cup and support her forehead . " I suppose . " " Are we splitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you intend to do ? " One flitting look  --  there he stood , judicial , courteous . " Is it up to me ? " she said . " Is n't it ? " " If it is , " she made herself say , " you 're being magnanimous , as usual . " And cold ! she wanted to cry . Icy , as usual ! How can we talk about this as if we were deciding whether or not to hire a gardener ? We ought to be in tears  --  I am in tears , I 'm drowning in tears inside . And there you stand . If you were the man I married , if you were my husband , if youp108were anything but a graven image , you 'd slap me . " Have n't you anything to say about it ? " she asked . " As the . . . wronged party ? " He was like tennis players she had known , the kind who returned everything until they forced you into errors . Stonily he said , " I might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash my hands of you . Or I might even ask you to come back . " " Why ? " she said , in a voice that sounded as hoarse in her own ears as a crow 's cawing . " Why ? So you could always hold it over me ? So you could enjoy the penance you 'd put me through ? " But he dominated her with his eyes and his stiff , polite face  --  the face of a man being courteous under provocation  --  and he said , " If you 've got anything to say I 'm bound to listen . You said last night you wanted this affair to be over . Is it ? " Her moment 's spiteful resistance already spent , she put her hands fingertip to fingertip on the desk blotter and studied the light shaking in them . She was all to pieces , all to pieces . " I do n't know , " she said . " Where were you tonight ? " She saw the opportunity and its impossibility at the same time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had brought herself to tell truthfully ; tonight 's gave her no alternative but a lie . Withoutlooking up she said , " Over at Bobbie 's . Before that I was driving around . " " Alone ? " " Alone . Does it matter ? " " It matters a great deal . " " You do n't have to cross-examine me , " she said stiffly . " I told you , without your ever asking , about Oaxaca . It all happened . " " You did n't come up here to see him ? " " No . " The pulse beat like a little life between the taut cords of her wrist . It beat five times before he said , " Are you in love with him ? " The life in her wrist went three ticks toward its death . " I do n't know , " she said , very low . She was aware of his height above her , straight and severe ; she knew the way his teeth would show under the tight lips . He would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Bernard would and as she herself just had . And yet his gray eyesp109were chilly where Bernard 's were brown and alive , and his voice had long ago forgotten warmth . There was a sadistic streak in him . She had an almost irresistible impulse to glance up sharply , sure she would catch some expression like enjoyment in his face . " If you 're not in love with him , " Burke said steadily , " then what is all this about ? " She shivered her shoulders . " Is it that you 're just sick of me ? " " No ! " she said . " Oh no ! Not . . . anything like that . " " Have I done something ? " She shook her head . No , nothing you have done . Only something you have been , or become , or not done . Something I 've become . " Then what ? " She could not answer . She heard the breath whistle between his teeth . " There must be some reason why you disgrace yourselfand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Or I hope it is n't . Maybe I 've been deceiving myself . " Without strength left to combat him or even resent him she sat inspectinga chipped nail and let the lash fall on her , accepting its justice . She had admired and respected and slightly feared him for a long time . Huddled and submissive , she was thinking irrelevantly to herself , Tonightwas the night I lost my father , too . With a hopeless movement of the shoulders , she said , " I do n't know , I 've just come all apart . " " People do n't come apart without some cause . " " Oh , you 're so . . . " Her eyes were up . He had not moved , his expression had not changed . " Cause ! " she said . " The same old cause , I suppose . There has n't been any room for me in your life for years . What if I was tired of going to waste ? " For once she had stung him , she had stung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his knuckles came down on the desk , he glared at her with his face full of outrage . " No room in my life ? Going to waste ? You 're out of your mind . What do you mean , no room in my life ? That I 'm busy ? " " That 's part of it . " " Then it 's hopeless , " Burke said , and planted his knuckles with a hard wooden sound , once , on the desk . " I 'm a doctor , I 'm bound to be a doctor , I 've got an obligation to my patients , and the profession , andp110myself . Would you respect me if I shirked it ? I would n't respect myself . We 've been over this fifty times . " " Yes , " she said . " Many times . And you 're absolutely right . " " But you still hold it against me . " " Not that , " she said . " Just . . . Oh , I do n't know ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You 're thinking about the clinic or some patient all the time . You keep yourself wearing that bedside manner , you 've always got on your crisis mouth . Even when I drag you out to something , you do n't enjoy it . I do n't think you enjoy anythingany more but work . You do n't enjoy me , I 'm sure . You never let yourself have a strong emotion or even an affectionate impulse ... . If I had n't had to go all bottled up for ten years I might not have come apart . You freeze everything .... " Their eyes were hard now , locked like wrestlers . She had said more to him than she had ever managed to say ; and it struck her as a hopelesscorroboration of her own tirade that his face showed no sign of comprehension , but only stubbornness and resentment . " I 've paid you the compliment of thinking you did n't need to be patted like a lapdog , " he said . " I thought we had a relationship that let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources , Sabrina . You have n't had to sit around pitching cards in a hat . Even if I 've been as occupied as you seem to think , you 've still had a beautiful house , money , position , looks , youth , health , interests , friends , everything you needed to make a  --  " " Life of my own ? " she said . " Oh , God , Burke ! The same old life I was brought up to , only without Saint Matthew 's Church . Bridge luncheons and cocktail parties and charity balls and lying around pools . " " A lot of your friends seem to find things to absorb them . " " Sure . Pottery kilns in the back yard . Studios for the writing they hope to get around to . Anti-Income Tax agitations . Planned Parenthood . Neighborhood racial councils . Junior League theatricals . " " You 've been marvelous in every one of those you 've acted in . As you know . " " Yes , " she said . " I could probably make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Los Angeles Examiner would print . "  | " Well ? " he said , impenetrable . She made a weary gesture . " The Intelligent Woman 's Guide to TimeKilling , " she said . " I could write it without notes . " " A lot of people would call it a satisfying life . " " With a lot of people I have never agreed , " Sabrina said . " A lot of people probably envy Mother 's combination of ancestor worship and charity and self-indulgence , too . But if you recall , I never wanted it . " " You 're saying I 've only substituted one kind of jail for another . " Propping her forehead with her hand , she stared at the desk 's inlaid intricate edge . " If you 've been going to waste , " Burke said  --  a voice as unmodulated , as disengaged from personality and feeling , as the crackling of a paper bag  --  " if you 've been going to waste , you chose an odd way to become useful . " Eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She was too tired to quarrel or defend , she was too sick and sad . But however he or her conscience might shame her , neither could shame away the thing that lay coiled as real as a worm at the heart of her discontent . She did not even brush Burke 's words away , she ignored them . " You remember Bobbie , " she said . " She married this Leonard MacDonald , strictly from nowhere , and typed theses to help him through graduate school . Now he 's teaching , and they 're still as poor as mice . She 's got a crackerbox house and one good dress and two children and another coming , and how fast I 'd trade her ! " The clock whirred out another raveled length of Time . At last Burke said  --  and she heard the impatience as a sharper , challenging note in his voice  --  " It wo n't do you any good to manufacture artificial responsibilities . You would n't seriously want to teach , would you ? " The thought made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Maybe the last resort of the blind is to lead , though . " " Or adopt a child ? " She sat still . Careful , careful . She had always backed away from that decision ; maybe she would always back away from what she most wanted or needed . Or maybe she still had hope . " You get such lemons sometimes , " she said . " It would n't be like your own . I still do n't think I 'd ever feel right about having one without the pain . "  |p112They  had run down ; anger and recrimination had petered out together , expedients had proved too heavy to lift . She watched Burke examinethe palm of one hand as if for blisters . He glanced up , squinting ; his lips tightened and loosened again ; he looked like a man weighing a bargain in his head , balancing advantage against disadvantage . His shoulders moved . " Well , " he said , " I seem to have failed you somehow , or you seem to think so . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I could have done much differently . I ca n't be someone I 'm not . " He sounded not self-righteous but hopeless , he spoke obviously less in accusation than in bewilderment . The stiff watchfulness and politenessof his face had dissolved into something twisted and pained . Wildly her eyes clung to his gray glance , and she saw the spasm contractat the outer corners of his eyes . For a moment he glared out like a man from behind bars , and instantly she was flooded with a contrition so terrible that she wanted to claw her face and scream . " Burke , I ... " " Sabrina ... " " I 'm the one ! " she burst out . " Oh , I hate myself for what I 've done to you ! " He watched her with eyes that glittered ; his severe outline melted and ran with the massing of her own tears . " Please ! " she said . " Can you believe that I would n't deliberately ... " Abruptly he moved , he came around the desk behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling close to horror , intensely recalling having done the same thing with another hand only a few hours before , she bent her head sideward until her cheek touched his knuckles . He said thickly , " They gave you a difficult temperament , Sabrina . " To that she agreed with a choked laugh . The horror remained , but like a wind that blew past a corner and did not touch her . Sometime she would have to come out into it , but not yet , not now . Her face turned further until her lips touched his hand . What was the matter with her that she could not make a life out of what was the envy of every outsider ? One prison for another ? Most women would not think so . Both what she was born to and what she had married into were scale models of paradise , where the fortunate could enjoy lives of luxury and gratified desire . And all she found was chatter , hollowness , horror . She felt likep113crying at him , If just once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you 're doing now ! He stood stiff and still , only his fingers moved lightly on her collarbone . The silver base of the desk pen swam and spun in her tired eyes ; blurring in her unfallen tears her face looked back at her , distant in the rounded metal , with his face even more distant beyond and above . In a moment her whole head was full of another picture : he did have his arms around her , she hung breathless and laughing where he had caught her in the upstairs hall , directly in front of the pier glass . In the glass she watched his face come close beside hers , over her shoulder , and his arms come around her from behind . Their eyes hunted mirrored eyes , it was a moment all the more intimate for its doubling , for their being able to watch themselves watch it : their bodies and legs overlappedlike figures in a Greek frieze . " Answer me , " he said , and she said , " Yes . " " Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he said , " What kind of magic do you use in your smile ? Do you have any idea what your face with that smile chasing across it can do to me ? " " I hope so , " she said , watching his mirror eyes , holding his arms tighter around her breast . " I hope so . I practice it in front of mirrors . " Locked together , watching themselves in the pier glass in the gray light of a winter afternoon , they laughed , and liked the look of their own laughter . " Not what I mean , you do n't , " Burke said . " What I mean , you were born with . You 're one of those who were made to enhance life . " Twelve years . Twelve years of enhancement since then . " Sabrina , " her husband said , and she could see him , small and distant , in the rounded silver . " Yes . " " How bad is it ? If I could forget all this , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up , twisting , ready to cry , ready to have his arms come around her , but he had dropped his hand and moved back  --  still in part an antagonist . Her lips pulled up against the resistance of all the muscles of grief that wanted to pull them down . " Give me a little time ? " she said . " He is n't the real trouble . I am . I do n't understandmyself . I go around beating my breast searching for a function ,  |p114but  I never really want any of the functions that are possible . I founderedand went down halfway between duty and desire . Can I try to straighten myself out ? Would you give me some time ? " And at once she met the iron in him ; he had not modified by a single detail his original insistence on fair , hard justice . " Is it over ? " he said . " I want it to be . " " You want it to be . " " Yes . " Almost as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , time . How much ? " " I ca n't tell . What it takes . " " You baffle me , " he said , and turned away and stood looking into the pooled light of Monet 's lilies . The desk lamp threw his shadow foldingup the corner of the room and onto the ceiling . When he turned around again he had given up trying to keep the polite impenetrability he had worn most of the evening . He looked middle-aged and tired , with bags under his eyes , and his right hand jingled small change in his jacket pocket . " I was thinking coming up , " he said . " If you .. . This makes me want to commit murder , Sabrina . It may be just as well you take some time ; I may need some , too . But I want us to get past it , if we can . And if we do , I was thinking . . . why do n't you start in with the Pasadena Playhouse , go into acting seriously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group yourself , you could . " Something in her face must have told him not to go on . She could not help saying , " Have a life of my own ? Run out and play ? " He flushed dark red , so that at once she tried to turn the edge of her remark , crying lightly and hopelessly , " Maybe I could become a middle-aged character actress and win supporting Oscars . Mother would be so proud . " Her eyes smarted ; she took his hand and pressed it between both of hers , saying , " Burke , darling , maybe we can get past it . But do n't be kind , or I 'll weep . " The red still hung in his cheeks ; his expression had again hardened and become formidable , and in spite of her words , she wanted him kind . Stubbornly gnawing at something already gone past , he said , " What do you mean you do n't know whether this other business isp115over or not ? It 's not exactly the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A retort flew to her lips and was blocked there . She faced him across the consequences of her lie : driving , and alone . The thought of how recently she had been locked in unlovely fornication up on the foggy ridge made her physically ill ; she would never be able to pass the place again without a shiver . It seemed to her that Bernard , whatever he had been  --  ecstasy , anger , a dare , a substitute  --  was already past , and what he had been was so tainted in her mind that she wondered she could meet Burke 's eyes at all . And she was dismally tired . " It 's late , " she said , " and I 've hardly slept for days . Ca n't we talk tomorrow ? How long can you stay ? " " I should n't stay at all . I 've got two patients going into surgery tomorrowmorning  --  this morning . " " But you could stay . " " Yes , I could . " " Please . I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood with both hands in his jacket pockets ; his shoulderslifted with a conclusive deep breath . There was an uneasy hangdogsmile around his mouth . " Is there some guest room made up where I can sleep ? " Steadily she took his arm and turned him toward the door . " Could you bear to sleep in my room ? " " Bear to ? Yes . " " It might look funny if you did n't . " They went upstairs under the somber lowering of Emily Wolcott , past the egg-white organdy of Deborah Barber , straight into and past the sullen stare of Sabrina Hutchens . Her door clicked behind them and shut out the sleeping house . " The far bed is yours , " Sabrina said . " I 'm going to have a shower to relax me . " Just for an instant , as their eyes met , Burke smiled  --  his old smile , questioning , even diffident , the mask of imperturbability and purpose wiped away : a smile of real sweetness , with both a question and a promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her lungs , a difficulty of breathing , a sense of something dramatic and dangerous about to hap/pen . Carrying fresh pajamas and robe , she went into the bathroom . Under the shower she hardly moved ; she felt like a primitive woman in a purification ritual , as if the scent or stain of uncleanness were to be washed away and she restored to touchability . And it was as if a pair of eyes inside her mind looked steadfastly straight forward so as not to see what was in their periphery . Tiredly refreshed , she dried herself and got into the plain blue pajamas  --  shehad always despised nightgowns  --  and pulled the cord of the robe around her . Leaving the dressing room she hesitated , almost knocked , before she pushed through . The bedroom lights were off except for a small lamp on the bedtable . Burke sat on the edge of the bed in his shorts . As she came in he stood up , and then once more there was a dueling and searching of eyes in semi-darkness . She heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white goatskin rug between the beds . Saying nothing , looking into her eyes with a strained , harsh glare , Burke raised his hands and loosened her robe and pushed it off her shoulders to the floor . He unbuttoned her pajama tops and pushed them after the robe . Then abruptly he was on his knees with his face buried in her belly . With her arms around his head she hugged him , and heard the grinding of his teeth . She tipped her head and stared up at the ceiling , crying silently , Oh my God , what am I , what am I ! " No ! " she said aloud . " No , oh no , no ! " Violently she twisted away from him , tangled her feet in the goatskin , half fell against the bed . He was still on his knees , clinging to her legs . " No ! " she said again , hoarse and gasping . " Burke , I was n't just driving around . I 'm not fit to .. . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was with him ! " He let her go ; on his cheekbone the bedlamp lit the shine of tears . She scrambled up to sit on the bed , and watched him assemble himself bit by bit , breath and emotion , body and mind and pride , and stand up . Their glances crossed once , grating like the ends of a broken born ' , and after that she could not look at him again . She heard him dressing , heard his feet moving around the room , but she continued to sit huddledtogether on the bed with her hands pressed between her knees , and long shudders every few seconds ran the length of her body . Still without a word , he had started for the door ; and still she couldp117not look at him . Through chattering teeth she said , " Take my car , the keys are on the dresser , " and he said , " Shall I leave it at the airport parking lot ? " and she said , " Yes , Virgil can get it tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through her body and contractedher shoulders . She waited for what else he would say . But he said nothing at all . Just for a moment she summoned the courage to look up . With his hand on the doorknob he was devouring her with a look pale and terrible . Then without a word he went out.  |p118STRANDED  by receding sleep , the mind flopped on the margins of consciousness . Unwilling , it turned and turned , tried to dive , floundered against the immovable , threshed in panic , and woke . She lay staring upward , just as she had been doing when she last remembered . Her mouth was dry , her eyeballs ached , she felt how she had awakened frowning , pinching her brows down upon light or trouble or both . For a second the rasping of the breath in her throat sounded fantastically loud , until she recognized the sound as not her breathing at all , but the regular scratch-scratch of a rake on the gravel paths outside . Through the blinds , a golden gloom ; under them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried salt . Between the beds the robe , the pajamas , the twisted goatskin , lay where they had been kicked . As the memory came back she had to clamp eyes and teeth shut upon the picture of him rising from his knees as if his whole body were tied together with bandages . That repudiation would burn on his pride like napalm ; and though he might find relief by plunging into work as a bomb victim burning alive might plunge into water , he would be afire again as soon as he came out . And herself , who had done it , done all of it ? Not much better . It seemed a pitiful thing that a person should cry in her sleep and awake with a knitted frown.  |p119Her  eyes opened again and she stared dully at the light below the windows . Words revolved in her head , a sentence stupidly intact from some book , repeating itself as if it meant something . When I awoke , it was broad day . Now where ? It seemed important to place it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for almost at once she recognized it . Robinson Crusoe , the morning after shipwreck . Years ago , she used to spend hours in this room reading , sprawled across the bed with her chin over the edge , the book on the floor , her heels in the air , assuming postures that her mother said were neither ladylike nor good for the eyes . The gray light now was the same , the words brought back something that once her imagination had leaped to take in : hope , activity , self-reliance , the magical island to be explored , the ship to be plundered of everything needed for the re-establishment of a life . She worked her dry lips . Her eyes , slanting again over the bed 's edge , caught upon the tangled rug and the clothes that love had cast there . How could she re-establish a life , after what had passed ? On what basis of trust or confidence , and with whom ? Burke , stabbed and stabbed again where he was most vulnerable ? Bernard , netted in a web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illicit warm one than upon the one who held himself stiff and austere . The scratching rake went on , diligent and absorbed . How beautiful to get up every morning and make neat comb-marks in a path , or milk goats in a corral , or coddle the shoots from a rescued handful of grain . Or walk into office or clinic with the mind fixed on lovely simple problems : an overdue shipment , a child 's broken bone , the lump in a frightenedwoman 's breast . It was unfair that they should both have the solace of work , and she should not . She coveted the peace of women who stitched the seams of shirts . How cunning of people to enslave themselves , as the phrase went , to a job . Then the days would go down sweetly , one by one , each with its teaspoonful of responsibility , accomplishment , and reward . As for Mrs. Burke Castro , she could cry in her sleep , awake frowning , borrow whisky from the servants . Unless  --  and she looked the possibilityin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad day to which she had awakened  --  she could do what shame and conscience told herp120she should do , give up what she could probably not have anyway , and learn the cool consolations of obedience as the society doctor 's society wife . She rang for the maid , and to the discreetly opening door threw an order for coffee , orange juice , and cigarettes . In the shower she stood chattering under the cold water as long as she could bear it . Later , toweling herself , she looked out the dressing room window into the gray lichened limbs of oaks . Below those lay the familiar horseshoe of tree roses and the striated walks . The man who had combed them had gone . It was very quiet . The swarming streets and ringworm subdivisionsof the Peninsula might have been a hundred miles away . Intelligentpeople held back the intrusions by owning their horizon . Then , liberated from obligations , protected from interruptions , they could sit in the midst of order , beauty , and harmony and contemplate the disorderof their own lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along a horizontal limb . His vest was slate blue , his belly patterned like rusty chain mail , his throat and eyebrows outlined in white , his back gray . His plume bobbed jauntily over one eye . Altogether a spruce , plump , self-satisfied bird . Behind him , nervously hurrying , came a female , a demure gray devotion . When the male stopped to peck at a knot on the limb , she waited , and after he had passed on she stopped and pecked the same knob . He walked to a bend in the limb and hopped down to a lower level . She hopped after him . He paused to rub his beak , both sides , against a patch of green lichen . She came behind and sharpened her bill on the same patch . One after the other they disappeared into the leaves , a paradigm of conjugality . Fidelity . Sabrina framed the word at her naked image in the dressingroommirror . Fidelity , another of those words from the dictionary of archaisms . An unthinking and excessive devotion , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poison with irony something she had already lost the right or title to ? Why must she lash out at something or somebody when she found herself in the wrong ? With her hair falling forward on her shoulders she looked like a North Beach weirdy . When she gathered and held it at the nape of her neck she became the Speicher portrait , great-eyed and somber , askingp121something . Her dark-tipped breasts moved with her arms as she brushed ; when she set the brush down they drooped  --  too far ? As if putting hand to a pain she cupped , lifted , and let go , watching the effect . Catching her eye in the mirror , she grimaced . Is that it ? she asked herself . Is it only the old demon du midi ? As commonplace as that ? A woman of thirty-five frightened of middle age ? It angered her to have felt that pang of dismay , for she knew its source  --  an anxiety as old as adolescence , or older , the apprehension that in love she might be  --  had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant maenad , she watched herself , remembering . With Burke , yes . She admitted passivity , habit . Whose fault , she would not have dared to guess . Sometimes , when he did become heated with desire , she had been embarrassed , nearly , by his compulsion to name what they did , verbalizing organs and act as if only words made them real . Last night , if she had been able to go on with it , would probably have been like that . But with Bernard ? No . Even that horrible business in the car had shaken her and left her tender . So I am not cold , she said to her questioning image . I 'm not , I never have been , it 's only that Burke has n't known how to let himself go , and I have n't known how to . . . . If I 'd had more practice in expressingemotion I might not have been blown up by it in the end . But that was practically to admit her own inadequacy . Testing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been loved by only two , " and she felt how meager , after all , was the experience that had blown her life apart . Nearly all women had been loved by several , some by many . She knew an arty Hollywood couple who were always talking about group sex ; you kept hearing of these orgies where men and women crawled together in a stew of naked bodies , tangled like angleworms , exciting themselves with pornographic movies and a slither of promiscuous touch until , she supposed , a maddened female simply impaled herself on the handiest erection . Once she had read the memoirs of a prostitute who boasted of having forty men in one day . Ah , but that was the ideal , that was not for ordinary mortals . She turned her lips inside out in disgust . Her breasts were watching her like dark eyes . Sickened of herself , she turned away . In the bedroom she heard Bernadette put down the tray . With ap122name like that , she should have been the sort of maid that male guests cornered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman addictedto television and pentecostal tent shows . The last time Billy Graham had been at the Cow Palace she had gone to hear him seven times . How did someone like Bernadette wake up ? Singing , chirping God 's grace ? Heavily and gloomily , in rebellion against a mean fate ? Or placidly , finding the job adequate to fill the whole mind , the spirit content to attend on the dumbwaiter , bring trays , make beds , polish up bathrooms , replace damp towels , take a little ironing down to her room where it could be done while she watched with one eye the nervous flicker of love and trouble on the television screen ? " Mrs. Castro ? " said the German voice through the door . " Yes ? " " Your mother would like to see you . " " All right . Has she had breakfast ? " " Two hours ago . " " Is she still in her apartment ? " " She do n't feel so good , she 's in bed . " " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be right along . " She took a last look at herself and put away the uneasy questions to which she had awakened . She supposed she owed her mother a visit  --  they had hardly done more than greet each other so far . It was even a sort of pleasure to have the obligation . She reminded herself to call the beauty parlor and see if she could be squeezed in . And she had asked Barbara to bring the children to swim . Already , she saw , it was nearly ten  --  broad day . Even without wrecks to plunder or goatskins to sew into clothes , there had to be ways of passing the hours . Her mother lay propped against several pillows , a froth of lace at the throat and wrists of her dressing gown , her hands limp on the Florentineleather of a writing portfolio . She looked as if she might smell of some ingenuous apple-blossom scent . Since she had given up her glasses and adopted the eye exercises , her face seemed less severe than Sabrina remembered it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was eager and almost wistful . In the bow window the long white nylon curtains rippled , chasing sun and shadow across the round intarsia table with its tray and its vase of copper-red roses.  | " Mother , " Sabrina said , " you look like someone 's painting of a Dear Old Lady . " " Grandma Moses ? " Her smile was shaky and her skin palely blotched ; she seemed frail and very feminine . In fact it was an astonishmentto Sabrina to comprehend what must have been apparent all her life , how utterly feminine was everything in this room . The fact had its probable explanations , simultaneous with the observation . It was shrewd of her , Sabrina thought as she moved toward the bed . It was shrewd , finding herself abandoned , to leave behind her the place andpeople associated with her humiliation , but bring along everything that constituted her defenses . Reproduce the Nahant house and build a wallaround it and fill it with the family accumulations . She had made a nest as snug as the inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a French king 's mistress . The cheek she touched hers to was withered and soft . A stiff hand came around Sabrina 's shoulder as they kissed . " You 're not feeling well , " Sabrina said . Helen Kretchmer , passing the door , smiled in . Wincing at some obscure quirk of real or imagined pain , Deborah Hutchens said , " I regret it . . . only because of my regimen . If Doctor Sanders knew I was not out playing golf he would be . . . very up-set . " " And it would n't do to upset Doctor Sanders . " " He 's very strict with me . " Which , of course , she loved . This bossy woman loved to be bossed , and that was a surprise . Or was it only that a rich woman needed a doctor the way a Catholic needed a priest  --  a fact that Burke had built a career on . Sabrina sipped her lukewarm coffee . Her mother , after watching her for a while , said , " My dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you been overdoing ? " " How can you overdo , doing what I do ? " " You have great circles under your eyes . Maybe you should see Doctor Sanders while you 're here . " " And get put on a regimen ? Golf and cold showers ? " " Cold showers are perfectly wonderful for you . "  | " I hope so , " Sabrina said . " I just got out of one . " She drank her orange juice and lighted a cigarette . Helen Kretchmer , solid-legged , tanned , honey-haired , immaculate , a girl beside whom Sabrina felt obscurelycorrupt , leaned smiling in the door again . " Excuse me , Mrs. Hutchens . I just had a call from the library . They do n't have anyone to suggest except the man who does their own rare books , and he 's tied up for months . They think the best places to call would be bookbinders in the City . " To Sabrina , smiling in her exaggeratedlyfriendly way , she said , " We 're hunting someone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Whatever for ? " Instant displeasure showed in her mother 's face . " Please do n't let us ... begin on your cynicism . The papers are the intimate record of an important family . A historian would . . . find them invaluable . " " Are you going to turn them over to a historian ? Will we have Carl Sandburg and everybody digging through the archives to find out what Uncle Bushrod wrote to the Boston Transcript about Mr. Lincoln ? " Her mother 's hands moved with a touch of the old peremptory impatienceon the tooled leather . " In spite of your jeers , it is not impossible . Eventually , perhaps , scholars will work here as they do in great houses . . . abroad . " Through the steam of the refilled coffee cup the collapsing face with its mulish chin seemed braced back in the nest of satin and lace , a face still stubborn , and with its old glare , but without its old force . The shaking hurt it ; it made her look weak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was a Wolcott , one of a predictable tribe . What Oliver thought senility was no more than the tribal habit of accumulation ; but where others contented themselves with material things , she also collected Time . In one way Oliver was right  --  the past was every bit as real to her as the present . Save it all . Some day Grandmother Emily 's diaries might be revealed as greater than Pepys or Evelyn . Helen was still in the door . On impulse , Sabrina said , " It does n't sound like a very technical job . Have you thought of someone like Leonard MacDonald ? " " Barbara 's husband ? That queer fellow ? Could he do it ? "  | " Why not ? He could find out how to treat the bindings . And he likes books . He might get a chuckle out of the Wolcotts . " " Then he is . . . not the right person . " " Oh , Mother , he 's literate , he 's intelligent , he 's a friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's got a third child coming , he 's in his summer vacation and would have the time . Who 's a better person ? " Deborah fingered her lips . A look like daring glinted in her eyes , a bubbly little snort escaped her . " I imagine Uncle Bushrod would be ... astonished . . . to find himself being catalogued by a fellow in those workmen 's trousers . Bushrod was always so . . . correct , he 'd expect a librarian in morning clothes . " " Jol , " Sabrina said . " Shall I ask him ? How much do you pay ? " " Mr. Cantelli charged thirty dollars a day for doing the bindings , " said Helen Kretchmer from the door . " I do n't know , " Deborah said . " This requires a person of . . . special capacity . We might have him list the collections too , if he has time . Would that be enough , do you think ? " " If you offered him more he 'd probably think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowned , not irritably . The light of anticipation grew in her widened eyes . She began to stretch and clench her hands , workingthem in the air . " Splendid ! " she crowed . " Oh , I do hope he will consent . I 'll . . . help him , if he 'll allow me . " " Why would n't he ? You 're paying him . " Thinking of the night before , and the odd , truth-party sort of talk they had had , she said , " Maybe he and Bobbie will convert you to their current cause . " " Cause ? " " Conservation , sort of . Planning . Last year I suppose it was interracialhousing , or protecting the national parks against power dams . " " Oh yes , I think I recall that . I believe we . . . contributed something . Helen . . . no , it was before you came . But now it 's something else , you say . " " These American domestic types fool you , " Sabrina said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervisors and throwing herself in front of bulldozers ... " " What ? "  | " Oh , not literally . But organizing , and propagandizing , and ringing doorbells . Maybe they have to prove an education was n't wasted on them . " " But what is this new cause ? " Sabrina had to laugh . " Mother , I 've discovered the perfect red herringfor you . Drag a cause across the trail and you quit sniffing even after the family collections . Parks and greenbelts  --  you know . Make developersput a park in every subdivision , make planning commissions reserve open land when they approve site plans , make the state landscapefreeways and the towns prohibit billboards , get landowners to donate land for future parks . " " Why it sounds like . . . a perfectly splendid thing , " her mother said . From the nest of pillows , her eyes ( she had pouches of her own ) forgot to frown at Sabrina and peered into a future California ponded with open fields , dark with copses ( she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with poplars or whatever they planted along roads . Her mouth , opened a little , trembled , and she raised a furtivehand and pressed it firm . " It is a splendid thing . Want to donate the Woodside place ? " " Oh my goodness ! " " That 's what I thought . " " Please do not . . . bait me , Sabrina . I am not well . " " I 'm not baiting you . They asked me to ask you if you 'd like to give some land . " " I consider that your air of knowing in advance what my answerwill be is . . . baiting . " " All right , I 'm sorry . " She tried the coffee pot and found it empty . " Why not give some , then ? They 'd put your name on a bronze plaque , and mount a portrait bust of you on a concrete pillar , and call the oldest tree the Deborah Oak . " " You make it sound splendid , " her mother said . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I shall have to brood upon it . " And if she brooded upon it , it was sure to take fifty years at a minimum . Her heirs could settle that one . Sabrina said , " As long as you own it , it wo n't make much difference , it 'll still stay open country.  |p127Maybe  it 's better if you do keep it . I must say it gives me the crawling itch to think of the Great American Public swarming through there scattering beer cans and stoning the squirrels to death . " Over her shoulder she saw with annoyance that Helen Kretchmer still leaned in the doorway , listening and smiling . " Helen , call Boris , will you , and see if he can work me in this morning ? " An abrupt order , as if to a servant . And a slow , hot , comprehending flush . Good . " Of course , Mrs. Castro . " She went away , and Sabrina said to her mother , " If I look as bad as you say , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nervous , " Deborah said . " Were you serious about the portrait bust ? " " Sure . Why ? Would you like that ? " " It would be interesting to see oneself . . . turned to stone . In our family we were always painted . " Her hands worked in air . She changed the subject , as usual , without transition . " Should you like to have a ... dinner party or luncheon for some of your friends ? " " There 's nobody I want to see , especially . If I feel like looking anyoneup I can take them to the club . " The weak blue eyes lost interest and rolled away in an exercise that showed their whites horribly . " For heaven 's sake , Mother , must you ? " " It 's important to keep at them , " Deborah said . " Eventually the exercises will . . . change the shape of the eyeball . I see ever so much better since I . . . gave up glasses . " " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portrait bust . They 'll mount your head on a totem pole . " Deborah giggled . " Perhaps I could haunt houses . " Her hands quit working and dropped on the portfolio . Out of a clear sky she said , " Is Burke coming up ? " Her eyes now , for all their watery weakness and the light shaking of her head , were hard to evade . " Not that I know of , " Sabrina said . " Lizardo says he was here last night . " Sabrina snapped to her feet . " Lizardo does ? What kind of MeddlesomeMatty has he got to be ? "  | " I heard someone . I asked him who it was . He did n't want to tell me but I . . . made him . " Steps approached the door , and Sabrina twisted around . Tattletales and snoops , there was one at every entrance . But the soft face of Helen Kretchmer smiled in at her  --  carefully , correctly . Being put in her place had taken some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take you at eleven-fifteen , Mrs. Castro . " " Yes , all right . " The girl went away , but not until the typewriter started up down the hall did Sabrina let her eyes meet her mother 's , watching from the bed . " Yes , " she said , " he came up . But he could n't stay . He had to be back at the hospital this morning . " " Sabrina , I hope you have n't quarreled . " " We have n't quarreled . " " But there is . . . some trouble ? " " Yes , there 's some trouble . " " Oh my dear ! " " It 's all right , it 'll work out . " " Is there . . . another woman ? " " What ? Oh no . " The slow , growing alarm in her mother 's face mounted to a pitch too well remembered , repeated at every adolescent crisis . It amounted to a certainty that something dreadful had happened , and an equal certainty that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . it 's not you , Sabrina ? You have n't been foolish ? " " Did you raise me to be foolish ? " Her mother sighed . " You 're a grown woman . But grown women have been foolish . . . before this . " Clumsily opening the portfolio , she scattered papers around . Blindly she fumbled them together again . Her mouth trembled into violent helplessness and then was pinched firm . She said , " My dear , if you 're even thinking of . . . separating , let me tell you . . . there can be many years ahead and they can be ... lonely as the grave . " With frail violence she sat up , straining forward ; she alarmed Sabrina with her paleness and weakness ; she seemed to be issuing a warning from her deathbed . " I was reading Mr. Longfellow 's translation of the . . . Divine Comedy , " she said.  | " The innermost band of the . . . ninth circle of hell . . . did you know . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get upset , " Sabrina said after a moment . " If I have to live alone , I 'll have to live alone , even if it is lonely and cold . " " You wo n't like it . " " I do n't like it now . I never have liked it . " They were closer to intimacy than they had been in thirty years . Deborah Hutchens ' head moved as if in pity , and Sabrina , stung , said , " Were you surprised at that movie last night ? " A forbidding glaze came over her mother 's eyes . " You recognized him . " " Yes . " " And what did you think of him ? " " Naturally I was interested . " " He is not worth your interest . " " My father ? " " He was not a good man . Oliver should have had . . . better judgmentthan to resurrect that old film . " " Where is he ? Or is he dead ? " " I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much that you just wiped him out . " Her mother 's face was as stiff as carved wood . " Yes . " " So then , " Sabrina said , " you prefer your hell lonely and cold . " She was unprepared for the shaking anger in the old blotched face . " Sabrina , " her mother said , kneading her trembling hands , " I was ... concerned about you . I tried to . . . offer you some advice . I did not look for insolence . " Sabrina stood up , her eyes locked with the faded blue ones in the deathlike head . The smile on her face felt stiff and inadequate and sad . She thought , My God , she 's as confused as I am , the minute you flush her out of the cushions she 's lost . " I 'm sorry , Mother , " she said . " Would you rather I took my troubles away ? " " You know better than that . You know you are always welcome here . " " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armistice . " But please , ifp130I 'm going to make a mistake , it 's got to be mine . You ca n't believe  --  can you ?  --  that a person 's family has any business interfering in her marriage . " On that note , which was perhaps not fully understood , and which she would not have sounded if she had thought it would be understood , she left . At the garage door Virgil touched his cap to her . " Have you got a car I can take ? " she said . " Mine 's at the airport , I 'd like you to take somebody and go get it sometime today , if you will . The keys will be in the parking-lot office . " Was it the uniform cap that made chauffeurs seem the most servile of servants ? All her life servants had embarrassed her , all except Lizardo . In her childhood , when she had to be delivered or called for , she had made drivers leave their caps off , and maids wear a coat over their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hated . Now , irritably , when Virgil brought out the station wagon , she climbed in and slammed the door , and smiling into the teeth of his deference , flung off the hand brake and tramped down on the throttle and peeled away like a hot-rodder , shooting gravel in the doors of his immaculate garage.  |p131FOR  A HALF HOUR Boris 's equivocally erotic hands massaged the knots out of her mind . Then for a while she was trapped in a row with four others under the roaring helmets of the dryers , and could fall back on a copy of Vogue , turning coated pages in which bony women demonstrated the astonishing ingenuities of elegance : women uplifted , corrected , disguised ; women gorgeously jeweled and intricately coifed ; women with hair that looked as if it had been cut by satyrs pursuing them with hedge shears ; angular pen-and-ink women with autumn mist mink in natural color superimposedon them ; women in sacks with bows on their behinds ; surprised-lookingwomen in baths and barrels ; women in towels on bathroomscales ; proudly fastidious women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles . It was certainly nothing new ; it was , for that matter , paleolithically old . But her own involvement , once she noted it , tempted her to scorn , for this was a game , apparently , that she played as helplessly as any . Let a woman be vain , proud , ambitious , insane , cruel , goody-goody , restless , bored , anything , still her body was the seat and instrument of her preoccupation . Mostly it came out as glamour , and glamour could be definedas intention , and fashion was intention 's dramatization . The business of a woman 's life was contained in the ritualized progressp132from the invitation to the embrace , and even when leaving one embrace she could apparently go nowhere except into another . And after the embrace , after the sticky flower trapped its pollinatingquarry ? And especially if no pollination took place ? Then what ? They forgot to say in Vogue . Repeat until tired , maybe . Take it for a free cadenza . But sooner or later , after the body 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mind , and if you tried to be honest . After the embrace , the questions . Even she had helplessly gone that road ; her discontent was a discontent of the mind , but she had found no expressionfor it except the body . Hating going to waste , she had found , Burke said , an odd way of becoming useful . Vogue made it clear to her all over again what she must do if she wanted to live with herself . A wife without ecstasy was better than a mistress with a hurting conscience . Yet as she thought this she found herself sitting tense and rebellious , and her hands were aching from their clutch on the magazine . Boris shook her hair , released her , led her back to a booth . The woman opposite , a little withered woman , was having drawn upon her eyelids a line of turquoise , and around her lashes a line of black . Her claw rested upon the arm of the chair . The nails were long ovals of polished black horn ; on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half walnut . Not Hillsborough or San Francisco : more outlandish than the local taste . New York , possibly ; Texas or Los Angeles , possibly . But female . As the operator stepped back , the tipped head came down and the rimmed and green-shaded eyes examined themselves with unsmilingseriousness . Then the woman 's glance met Sabrina 's in the glass , and became at once a beam of the coldest malevolence . Boris began brushing back the heavy sheaf of her hair , and she was recalled to the scrutinizing of herself . Later she escaped into the early-afternoon heat , tainted with smog . She had not gone a block before she felt faint and queasy . Ahead was a dingy stucco front , a neon cherry on a neon toothpick in a neon glass . She stuck her head inside and saw three empty tables , a bar with two men sitting at it and one behind it . The bartender tilted his head back and stared at her . She felt like someone in a foreign country , unsure of the local tongue. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his towel . " On'y sandwiches . " It was not inviting , but she was there . The two men at the bar watched her in the mirror . Over the radio , tuned intimately low , the Giants were getting their brains beaten out in Cincinnati . The bartenderbrought her the stinger she ordered and shook his head over them . On the road they stank . Pitching . They needed a left-handed reliefer bad , especially against an outfit like this Cincinnati outfit , with all that left-handed bench . He stood relaxedly . " You a baseball fan ? " he said . " Some women are , some ai n't . " The sweet , cold , minty drink calmed the fluttering in her stomach . She had another , and then a tuna sandwich and a glass of beer , while a thin trickle of trade came and went and the game with its distantwaterfallsound of the crowd murmured on . The bartender came and slid pretzels across the table to her and said that Mays was n't hitting , either . His average stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was n't hitting the long ball . How many runs had he driven in on this road trip ? How long since he homered ? " But I forget , " he said , smiling with black teeth . " You never did say whether you was a baseball nut or not . " The Giants scored twice while Sabrina finished her beer , and the bartender felt better . So did Sabrina , restored by drinks and food and the sleazy gloom and the masculine rumble and putter . The bartender 's confidences flattered her . Men were more restful than women . She left him a dollar tip , and when she went out she threw back from the doorway a smile that she saw him store away . Shopping occupied her for another half hour : things for Bobbie 's children . Then , thinking ahead , she turned into a liquor store and orderedtwo mixed cases delivered to Lizardo . She did n't want to go out every time she wanted a drink , and she had her grandmother 's word for it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lizardo opened softly to her ring , and she dumped her parcels in his arms and told him to have somebody take them to the pool . She told him also about the liquor he could expect : he could put it in his closet . But she did not escape without pacifying his anxieties . " You itt something ? " he said . She knew he smelled her breath.  | " I et something and I drunk something . Is Mother napping ? " " Yes . " " Anybody call ? " In his eyes she saw the reflection of the startled , insistent expression of her own . The shake of his head twisted in her feelings , and it was all she could do to avoid bursting out in an exclamation . Neither of them ! Bernard she had not really expected until five-thirty , and yet she found that what had not even been an anticipation had turned to a sour disappointment . And Burke , whom she had put aside in her mind as too painful to face , but whom she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he have picked up a telephone while he was out at lunch ? He might have wondered how she was . At the pool , Oliver lay as limp on the diving board as if he had fallen there from ten thousand feet ; his heavy arms hung down , his face was turned into the matting . Minna and a maid were shooing shrieking children into the dressing rooms . Nobody paid any attention to Sabrina as she came in and closed the gate . Oliver did not move . A boy pursued by another ducked around her , and pursuer and pursued feinted and jockeyed with her in the middle like a tree . The pursued one skidded sideward , slipped , caught the other 's shove , and went sprawling into the water . " Here ! " Minna said . " You two ! Come on now , get dressed . " From the dressing rooms came roars and squeals . A naked boy skittered past a door , shrieked , clapped his hands to his loins , vanished . The one in the pool dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . " I 'm taking the whole bunch to the Redwood City rodeo , " Minna said . " Are n't I the lucky one ? " Her figure had sagged and widened with child-bearing , she had unattractive white strap marks across her freckled shoulders , her hair was mussed from the white rubber cap that she held now in one hand , and her smile was a little crooked , one cheek lifting more than the other as if she had had a mild stroke . " Yes , " Sabrina said . The crooked smile widened , the eyes opened until wrinkles rosep135clear into Minna 's hairline . " Do n't be sarcastic , I ca n't bear it . " Distracted , she shouted into the bedlam , knocked on the wall until she got a lessening of the noise . " I 'm going in and get ready . We 're leaving in exactly ten minutes . Anyone who is n't in the station wagon when I come out will get left . " " Daddy will see they get there , " Sabrina said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Minna said . " That hound ! " She limped off on wooden clogs , an effective exit . Lying back against her cushion , Sabrina let the sun cover her . Children pattered past ; she opened her eyes to smile and speak when someone she never did see said , " Hello , Aunt Sabrina . " Whispers , giggles , noise diminishing to two or three voices , then to none at all . Smell of chlorine and wet cement and lawn . A little wind moved the wistaria pods hanging from the arbor along the front of the dressing rooms . Oliver groaned . The back of his neck wrinkled like a movie Prussian'sas he raised his head . The side of his face was waffled from the matting , and his mouth made wet sounds . " Is it safe ? " He sat up , straddling the board , rolling his shoulders and stretching his arms , powerful and loose . " Ah , Sister . " He looked like something on a billboard  --  It 's Lucky when you live in California . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went away cursing everything except the bodies of the natives . " T'hey 're creating a beautifulrace , " he said in envoi . " The brain may wither away to the size of a lentil and the moral sense may atrophy entirely , but they 're going to look like Tahitians . " " Sun god , " she said to Oliver , and went in to dress . The dressing room was soaking . She kicked sodden towels around the floor to take up the worst of it and then kicked the towels under a bench . When she came out in her suit , Oliver had not moved from his straddle of the board . His shrewd squint was on her as she turned over a red-hot mattressand lay down on the cool side . " Feeling better ? " " What is this ? " she said . " Everybody asking me if I 'm feeling better . " " Who 's been asking ? "  | " You , Barbara , Mother , Lizardo , everybody I 've seen , practically . " " You looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look so spooked ? " " Not quite . " " " Then you should n't go by what you see . I 'm worse off today than I was yesterday . So 's Mother , thanks to your film premiere . Did you know you put her to bed ? " " She 'll get over it . " " I suppose . Maybe you did some good , at that . At least she talked about him a little . She said she did n't know if he was alive or dead . Did n't you tell her ? " " Why should I have told her ? I was n't supposed to know myself . " Varnished with sun and sweat , he bounced gently on the stiff board . " What do you mean , you 're worse off than yesterday ? " She turned her face downward on her crossed wrists and did not answer . " You 're mixed up with Barney Mendelsohn , is that it ? " Stricken , she reared up on her elbows . " Barney Mendelsohn ? " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing  --  big rich voice ? " " You know him , then . Last night you knew him . " " I see him around here and there . Is n't he at the Emporium ? " Sabrina lay down again . She was too tired to be much upset . The very fact that Oliver knew Bernard made everything seem less frantic and impossible , somehow . " Well , so now you know , " she said into the mattress , and turned her head a little to see him . He had gripped the sides of the diving board and was raising and lowering his body with his arms . Grunting with strain , he said , " He married ? " " Oh sure . I would n't have it any way but the hardest . " " Yeah . Well do n't let it get you down . It happens all the time . " " Does it ? " " Does n't it ? " " If it does , that 's one of the things that get me down . " The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg , did a momentary one-hand stand , brought the leg under , and came down crosswise , facing her . " No kidding , why all the tragedienne postures ? You 'll dramatize yourself into a breakdown . "  | " Will I ? That 's one way to make myself seem important . " The expression he wore , somewhere between bewilderment and amusement , nettled her , and she rose up on her elbows again . " God , Oliver , do n't you ever question the life you live ? Sometimes I think I got involved in this business just to prove that something was worth getting excited about . And if I 'm worse off today than I was yesterday , it 's because I 've begun to doubt even it . " Scratching his shin , he regarded her . " That 's quite an attitude . Barney would be flattered . " " Oh ! " He said , " You always did want to live every minute as if you were the first monkey being sent to the moon in a rocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic-smelling pad . " No , I 'd just like things to mean something . I 'd like to mean something myself . " " You 're wound up like a little tin automobile . Practice some of Mother 's yoga . You need to learn to relax . " " Relax ? " she said , glaring at him . " You too can be happy and contented ? Try our improved pre-frontal lobotomies , certified by hundreds of satisfied users ? " " Or try a psychiatrist . I 'm not kidding you , Sister , you sound as if you could use some help . " " You bet I could use some help , but not that kind . Original sin according to the gospels of Vienna . The hell with it , simply . I do n't believe in those people , not as healers . If I 've got guilt feelings , I 'm good and sure I ought to have them . I do n't care to find out whether I 'm animal , vegetable , mineral , anal , oral , or genital . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some medicine man tries to get me to admit I remember a time when Mother repudiated me or when I wished my brother was dead . She 's always repudiated me , and I 've wished you dead plenty of times , but that 's not what 's bothering me . " He bounced the board lightly . " What is ? " When she sat up suddenly , the blue pool , the lawn , the lounges , the arbor , the white refrigerator in its alcove between the dressing rooms , darkened to a tintype indistinctness , almost disappeared . Then the diz/ziness passed , color and sun and sharp shadows came back . " I wish I knew , " she said . " The world , maybe . Being female , maybe . Burke , maybe . Too many existentialist novels , maybe . A lack of opportunity  --  something . Is there anything to drink in that icebox ? " " Beer . There might be gin and tonic . " " Want one ? " " Not now . " When she came back with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooded lounge , Oliver was under the board . The water sloshed around his thighs as he chinned himself six or eight times . Then he hung , half floating . " You really manage it , do n't you ? " she said . " Manage what ? " " You 've got everything the way you want it . " " Aside from taxes , government red tape , five kids , the necessity of keeping Mother from playing the fool , et cetera , et cetera . " " You never get wondering if just managing the estate is enough ? You never wonder if you have a right to be alive ? You do n't have to be reassured you 're doing something useful ? " " Oh , come on , Sister , for the love of God ! " He surged upward and his frowning face appeared over the end of the board , glared , went down again . " Useful ? " he said from below . " Useful who to ? I 'm useful to you and Mother , I trust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed , well exercised , comfortable , and entertained . " " What kind of entertainment ? Danger ? Spear-fishing , things like that ? " " That 's all right . Gambling . Women . Ball games . Bottles . Movies . TV . Comic books . I 'm not fussy . " She drank half the bitter contents of her glass . " There you are , " she said . " Rich , healthy , handsome , the father of sound children , a lifetimeresident of Paradise , with just enough responsibilities to make playtime pleasant . You 're almost the American ideal , do you know that ? You 're what this civilization has been working up to . When everybody gets like you , we 're in . " " The hell with you . " The arms flexed , the face rose , subsided , rose again . She thought in contempt and admiration , He is , he 's a purep139Whatd'yecallit , a somatotonic . He 's worse than Mother . Even when he 's talkie ca n't help fle ' h ' His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes glinting at her . " You need a breeze through you . You 're morbid . Why do n't you go up to Carson City with me tomorrow ? " " What for ? " " The ride . Some fun . We 'll take the Mercedes . Chase the cobwebs out of you . The sports-car races are on over at Minden . " " Are you driving in them ? " " Not this year . " " Who 's going ? " " Just me . " " I might at that , " she said . " Are they likely to pile up and roll through the bales of hay and catch fire and kill forty spectators ? " " Why , do you want them to ? " " I think so . If you 'd guarantee it I 'd go . I 'd like to see a good bloody disaster . " Casually and mindlessly active , Oliver chinned himself . It seemed to her a deficiency of consciousness in him that he could so enjoy sun and water , air , light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being in any way aware of how much he was enjoying them . He closed his eyes and let go with his hands and sank soundlessly under . Many secondslater he came up a long way down the pool , to lie brown and buoyant , sustaining himself with the gentlest of breast strokes . His arms thrust once , hard , and he surged forward , pushing a wall of water . " Okay , " he said with his chin down , his mouth at the very surface . " We 'll make it an expedition . " " Do n't count on it , " Sabrina said . " Only maybe . " In the drive a car door slammed . Excited children 's voices , running feet on the path , the clash of the gate , and here came Barbara 's two hurling themselves toward her , crying , " Sabrina ! Hey , Sabrina ! " Hastily she put the glass under the lounge where it would n't get kicked over , turned loose her smile , and braced herself for the theatrical hugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Hello , Louise , hello , Dolly , hi , lovers , how 've you both been ? "  |p140FOR  A WHILE , Lady Bountiful , she could distribute gladness out of packages  --  a curly dog with a red tongue , a tiger with a plush tail , two rubber swans , a set of play dishes . Extravagantly loved , she was made to become one of them , and swim and splash and chase and be chased until she fell into a lounge , exhausted , and repudiatedthem , referring them to the pool and the sandbox . Barbara , her center of gravity so wrong that she could neither sit up nor lean back comfortably , eventually shooed them off . " Sabrina 's tired , " she said . " Go entertain yourselves for a while or I 'll have Daddy drown you both . " Sabrina waved them an exaggeratedly limp good-by . Through the shadow of the headache that darkened her sight she saw the smile and the pucker of a question in Barbara 's face . All the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confidences that had been promised yesterday afternoon . And yet not even to Barbara would it be possible to tell what she had been through since then . Coldly reported , it would sound like the doing of a woman completely out of control . As , perhaps , it was . She heard Barbara say , " Is it . . . are things any better ? " " No , " Sabrina said , and groped under the lounge for the melted/down remnant of her second or third  --  good heavens , what difference did it make ?  --  gin and tonic . " No , no better . But maybe closer to a solu-tion . " Barbara waited ; her eyes were brown and full of light , like the eyes of animals , like Bernard 's eyes . It seemed easier for brown eyes to look love , somehow . " What ? " Barbara said . " Go back to Burke ? " Sabrina looked down her brown legs to her brown feet . Without turning her eyes back toward Barbara she brushed away a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . More sympathetic silence  --  and she found that she could grow as impatient with sympathetic silence as with many other things . Abruptly she stood up . " Let me fix your drink , " she said , and took the glass over Barbara 's protests that there was still a lot in it . Starting away , she stopped , looked back , and said into Barbara 's manifest bewilderment , " I forgot to tell you , I 've got Leonard a job . Is he doing any-thing ? " " A job ? No , just repairing television sets . " " Starting Monday , how 'd he like to be Mother 's rare-book man and archivist ? " " What ? " " Do n't spoil it with whats . It 's all arranged . Mother really has a job she wants done . He 'd be doing her a mighty favor . The pay is thirty dollars a day . If he wants to work more than five days a week we can probably arrange time and a half for overtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it ? I mean ... " " He 's fully witted , is n't he ? " Sabrina said . " None of the Wolcotts and Barbers was . Anything they could write he ought to be able to catalogue . " She went off to the refrigerator and fixed two more drinks , and then with the sweating glasses in her hands she slipped into the dressing room and looked at her wrist watch on the shelf below the mirror . Ten minutes to five . To her own face , vivid and ice-eyed in the cool mirror , she whispered , practicing , trying the meaning on her mind , " I 've been thinking and thinking , darling . We were right in Oaxaca . We have to stop right here . We must n't see each other again , we must n't call each other . Ever ! But oh , darling . . . ! "  |p142She  closed her eyes , opened them , turned away out into the shade of the wistaria arbor . The shadow lay so dense it was almost black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pool and its borders were bone white , chemical blue . She saw the underwater light shake along the pool 's blue side , and the steps in the corner crawl like somethingseen through flawed glass . The children 's heads were bent together in the sandbox , Barbara from her lounge was craning toward the refrigerator alcove where Sabrina had disappeared . Of a sudden she was furious to have them gone . If he should call early , she would not be there ; if he called once and missed her , he might not call again . " My word , " she said , coming from the shade into the blaze of sun . " Where 's the afternoon gone ? It 's already five . " She made it so plain that even her protests did not keep them there another ten minutes . Before she heard the Chevrolet start on the other side of the fence she was in the dressing room and racing into her clothes . At five-fifteen she was in the front hall of her mother 's house , breathlessly asking Lizardo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks she had had pounded in her breathing and pulse as she hurried upstairs . Dialing , her finger slipped so that she had to start over . She got the switchboard and gave Bernard 's name . There was an immediate honking of the busy signal . " I 'm sorry , " the operator said . " That line is busy . Will you wait ? " ' She waited . What fool could be calling him now , after closing time ? Or had her own call cut across his ? Had she , by her impatience , only  --  " I can ring now , " the operator said . A click . The voice . " Darling ! " she said . She realized at once that the word must have sprung at him out of the telephone like an armed robber out of an alley . He said , fumbling , " Just a minute , please . " Noises  --  the closing of a door ? Offended , she waited on the signs of his discretion . " Now ! " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call you  --  " " I was afraid you would n't . I could n't wait . " " I was just waiting till the switchboard operator goes off . This is n't too good , any minute somebody could plug into the line , so take it a little easy . Maybe I ought to call you back . " " No ! " she said . " Now that I 've got you ! "  |p143He  laughed softly . A pause . " I 've been thinking about you all day . " " I too , " she said . " And trying not to . " " I feel lousy about last night . " " Do n't . " " It was messy and stupid , and humiliating for you . " She said , " I saw you , at least . We were in touch . " His laugh again , low and secret , his voice resonant and tuned for confidences . And this was the thing she had been wanting more and more as the afternoon wore on  --  this whispering contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed a long way to the ends of her fingers , and when she spoke it seemed that her voice was like the magnified whisper of a movie screen where lovers mutter for their own ears alone but must be heard in the back rows . She said , " It 's like a disease . Do you have any idea ? " " None whatever . Tell me . " " Ah , you . I wish I could touch you now . " " So do I. " " It is a disease . You 'd think going to bed would cure it , at least for a while , but it only makes it worse . " Hearing him say something , she listened . " What ? " " Remember the switchboard . " " Sh , sh ! " she said , mocking him . " There are ears everywhere . I 've just lost my upbringing . I was never like this before . " " You 're wonderful . " " Am I ? I feel like one of these snake women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of women , is n't it ? And yet I think I love you , and a snake woman is n't supposed to be able to do that . " " Darling , " he said , " do n't you think maybe I 'd better call you back in five minutes ? The operator will be trying to clear the lines . " She sat up straighter . " We can hear her if she cuts in . I wanted to tell you , Burke was here when I got back last night . " His answer came only after a pause , and veiled with caution . " He was ? What happened ? " " Nothing . He went on back . " ( But something did happen , somethingsickening that makes me ashamed . ) " For good ? What 's he going to do ? "  | " I did n't ask him . " Rocking her head , the edge of the mouthpiece hard against her cheek , she cried , " Oh , Bernard , does it matter what he does ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could just worry about us . I wish I could have lunch with you in the City , I wish you could come down here for week ends , I wish we could just be open and not afraid of being seen .... " " Garden of Eden , " he said neutrally and regretfully . " We had Oaxaca . " She was tempted to take desperate and ill-tempered hold of that " had , " it made everything so past . Instead she said as if playfully , " But we were n't Adam and Eve , darling . We were trespassers . We sneaked in from the Land of Nod . " From his uncertain laugh she judged that she had been in some way troubling . He said , " I guess that one went by me . What 's this Land of Nod business ? Are you high ? " " No darling . I 'm low . " " I 'm sorry , " he said , so softly she hardly caught the words . " I wish  --  " " Darling , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going to say when you called , but listen . We ca n't just sit around being sorry . Let 's go away somewhere . I do n't care where . Let 's go down to Big Sur and sit on the lighthouse steps and watch the whales go by , or let 's go to Norway salmon fishing . I do n't care . But let 's not hesitate and quibble , let 's plunge . This is the only life we 've got . " " It 'd be lovely , " he said in his low , regretful voice . " It 'd be heaven , " and again she found herself picking at his tenses and from them derivingdisappointment . The conditional . Would be . He was going to make excuses , he would evade her . The excitement died , anticipation collapsed , she slumped on the bed and everything bright in her went dull . " But you wo n't , " she said . " I do n't mean enough . " " Sweet , I wish you 'd try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , I 'm tied . " " Untie yourself ! " She heard for answer only the humming line . " I did " Darling ,  |p145who  gains if you get talked about and I become something treacherous to my children ? Listen , I heard today of a place in the Carmel Valleywe could get . It 's off by itself , walled patio , pool , everything . We could have it from now to the middle of August . I could cook up some excuse to get away nearly every week end , or I could maybe send the family off to Huntington Lake or somewhere . . . . " " Bernard , " she said , " it 's an ugly dishonest dream . " He was talking fast and earnestly , and she sat cupping her right elbowin her left hand , her right leaning the receiver against her ear . Did n't she think this was the wisest way , at least for now ? It would let them see each other , they could keep in touch . Maybe later , sometimewhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . She listened with her lower lip bitten thoughtfully under and her eyes on the dense leaves and lichened limbs of the oak outside her window . Sun infiltrated the whole mass ; for every leaf of green there was a leaf of hot light ; dappled afternoon fell through her windows and lay across the floor nearly to her feet . A little wind stirred , and the air , the whole room , shivered . She heard Bernard 's voice pause on a question , and in the humming moment , over it or through it , from another world , a quail 's anxious three-note call , twice repeated . " Darling ? " he said . " Do n't you see that ? Do n't you agree ? " The wind moved again , the air shivered . There was goose flesh suddenon Sabrina 's bare arms . Bernard was still talking . Quietly she lowered the telephone from her ear and laid it in its cradle . Already remote , he died in the middle of a word . Principally what she felt was shame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking out into the green and gold . From the hall beyond the closed door at her back she heard the squeak and rattle of a tea cart being wheeled from her mother 's room to the dumbwaiter , then the sound of the sliding door , then a remote , internal murmur of pulleys as the old ropeoperatedelevators went down . She saw how the disturbed sunlight moved on her arm and on her dress . Still quietly , not questioning the impulse , she opened her door upon the padded hall , and went down the stairs past the glower of the generations . No one was in the lower hall or  --  she looked in  --  the drawingp146room . Lizardo had Friday night and Saturday off . She turned around the newel post and opened the backstairs door , and without snappingon the light went down the narrow coil of steps . The air was cooler , the light from the half-windows in the foundation wells was greenish and subdued . She had a strong sense of descending through deeper and deeper crypts toward some catacomb . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great dim room to the left , with its white wooden lockers along two sides , had been one of the stages for their theatricals at the infrequent times when she could coax the keys to the dress collections from her mother . A maid had always come along to see that they did no damage , and the maid generally brought washing or ironing . That whole area of the past smelled of camphor and laundry soap and steam and hot cloth , and of the fuel oil from the furnace room . The ghost of its old smells lay on the air now , a thin odor of preservation and disuse . For a while she stood looking at the lockers , filled with the dozens and dozens of dresses and hats that , if she had been permitted to use them freely , would have made her into anything she desired . She could have plucked personalities out of those closets as freely as people now plucked them out of pill bottles , if hers had been a house where things were for use instead of for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasional skimpy masquerade with the three or four inner-circle friends before whom one need not feel too embarrassedat the restrictions and the inhibitions . Those few , and a maid to watch them , and a meager dribbling-out of one costume apiece from the closets of plenty . Sabrina took hold of the handle of a locker and pulled . Locked . Why not ? The lesson of her childhood had been that nothing you really wanted could be had . Whatever it was she had come looking for , the past or some impossiblecomfort , it was not there . This was only one more room in the family museum ; it told her neither who she had been nor who she should try to be . She turned and went down the hall of whitewashed concrete , one side light-welled and the other close-hung with framed pages of illuminated antiphonals  --  something that Aunt Sarah , in ap147religious or historical phase , had collected . Their gold leaf gleamed , their square black notes climbed and descended on the staff lines as overgrown with gold and lapis lazuli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tried again , as in the past , to puzzlemeaning from the crabbed and abbreviated Latin : frozen music , petrified worship , unintelligible , quaintly attractive . Raising her hand to knock on Lizardo 's door , she had a dreamlike vision of her own face , serene , looking out from a starched white coif , her pale lips forming the murmur of hymns or prayers , and she thought , That 's one way . Would n't it be a joke if I wound up a Poor Clare or something . The door opened and Lizardo looked out , but a Lizardo so changed from what she anticipated that she dropped back a step . This one wore light blue gabardine slacks and a cream-and-tan sport shirt with a yoke . The flashy clothes changed him utterly ; he looked like a worn-out roue , fastidious and corrupt , like one of the gamblers and pimps she had seen outside bars and Chinese gambling houses on Stockton 's Alvarado Street , waiting for the pickers on a Saturday night . " Are you going out ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " " Not yet , " he said . " Plizz ! " He rushed forward one of the heavy , dark , over-carved walnut chairs that had once occupied stiff space in the Beacon Street or Dartmouth Street or Nahant house . Sabrina , sitting down like an embarrassed caller , found herself smoothing her face with her flat hands , feeling safe and shaky . " I hardly recognized you , " she said . " You 're so elegant , Lizardo . " But she recognized the room . It was a little blurry from all she had drunk , but hardly changed . The neat bed wore its serape cover , the guitar hung from the wall with its tasseled cord drooping , the desk held its row of magazines and paperbacks neatly on edge between the plaster bulldog and the terra-cotta bust of Jiggs from whose head , in the past , had grown green grass hair . Above the desk , six square feet of wall were solidly filled with newspaper and magazine pictures of General Douglas MacArthur in black dime-store frames . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . Lizardo 's uncritical adoration beamed on her and warmed her , andp148that was surely a part of what had drawn her down here . It had been Lizardo much more than her mother that she went to when anything was wrong  --  perhaps because it was usually her mother who made things go wrong . She supposed Lizardo had fulfilled some of the functionsof a father , a father without authority or punishments . Smiling into his smile , she said , " You 're so elegant you must have a date with a girl . " An indescribable expression moved in his wrinkles , something gratified , wistful , lecherous , and sly . " Yes . " " Really ? No kidding ? " " Oh , yes . But she waits . " " She must like you . " " Oh berry much ! " " Well I 'm astonished at you , you old Romeo . You never used to go out with girls . You used to sit home and compose songs . " Privately , she had always wondered what he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States ; a Filipino was caught between the immigration quotas and the miscegenation laws . She supposed that like other lonely bachelors he must sometimes have gone to some miserable whorehouse that ignored the color line . That could be where he was bound tonight . But at his age ! His wrinkles were deceptive , but he must be sixty at least . She looked again around the neat , sailor-like cell , and pity made her shrug her shoulders together and exclaim , " I 've always thought yours was the nicest room in the whole house . " " Yes , " Lizardo said . He could not keep his lips over his teeth ; his smile kept breaking out white and toothy . He went over and laid a finger on one of the pictures in the MacArthur gallery . " This my girl . " Sabrina went to look . Hemmed in by two dozen reproductions of the general 's godlike profile was a newspaper photograph of a very pretty Filipina , perhaps eighteen , wearing an evening dress with an orchid at her shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , and she had smiled shyly into the camera at some dance . " That pretty girl ? Who 's the rival ? "  | " Oh , him , " Lizardo said . " This was bepore I met her . You like to hear ? " " I certainly would . " " On my bacation , " he said , " I go to San Prancisco , I hab nice rooms , suite , in Pilipino hotel . I like t'ings nice por my priends . So somebody comes , and manager asks me gib up one room , all rooms are pull . I say all right , sure . He say we hab to share batt , but doors lock inside , no trouble . I am not knowing who comes into my place . But when I come back at night I go into battroom and I smell perpume . I say , Aha , it is a lady in here ! ' " Sabrina moved a little . He was leaning , literally panting to tell his story , and when she moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of disbelief . The skin of his face was dry , beardless , shrunken on his delicate skull . " It 's romantic , " she said . " Like a movie . " " Better than moobie . " But her little movement had thrown him off , he evaded the consequences of his own tale . " So . . . I met Es-trella . " " In the bathroom ? " " Ah-ha ! No . She stays a while , we got acquainted . " It was on the end of Sabrina 's tongue to ask what a girl of eighteen was doing staying alone in a hotel , but that did not seem discreet . Something tired , disillusioned , and sympathetic in her said that if poor old Lizardo had got taken in by a whore , at least he was getting some excitement and some love . So she said only , " It really is romantic , Lizardo . When did all this happen ? " " Fibe , six mont 's ago . Christmas . " She leaned to look again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General MacArthur were focused in upon the girl and her escort from every side . Most of the MacArthur pictures were from the years of the war and the surrender , and the newsprint was yellowed under the protecting glass . The picture of the girl was at least as yellowas the yellowest of the general . Pity moved the heart in her breast like a disturbed toad . Not daring to look at him , she said , " She 's terribly pretty , Lizardo . You 're lucky . " When she could stare at the photograph no longer she turned on him ,  |p150gay  again , and said , " It seems like old times to be down here . Rememberwhen you used to sing me your songs ? Sing me one now . Is my contraband booze here ? Let 's have a drink and you sing me your song about General MacArthur . Have you got time ? Will your girl wait ? " " Oh , yes . " He stood before her in his libertine 's clothing and looked at her with concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What is good for you ? Come on . " " You pilling okay now ? " " I 'm feeling divine . " " I t'ink you got some trouble . " " I think so too . Lizardo , darling , come on and sing me a song to cure my woe . But give me a drink first , please . " He brought a bottle from his closet , went to the basement refrigerator for ice , and brought her a drink . He did not take one himself ; she had never seen him take one . " What you do ? " he said as he handed it to her . " Do ? " " You stay here , go back to Pasadena , what ? " " Ah , if I knew the answer to that one ! " But feeling what a bleak look she gave him , she sipped her drink and said brightly , " Actually there are a million things to do . Tomorrow maybe I 'll go to the road races with Oliver . Then maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter a nunnery . Or devote myself to social work and take sewing and deodorant soap to delinquent girls at the county jail . Or maybe I 'll build a house at Carmel and cover my hollow heart with a green copper roof and warm it with radiant heat and furnish it with Finn Juhl chairs and hang Weston photographs of Point Lobos on its grasscloth walls and peek out at the world from under a twelve-foot overhang . That would be in the family tradition , at least . And I could always ask friends down . What would you think I ought to do ? " His worry was all over his face as he took the guitar from the wall . He shook his head , and while he tuned he watched her askance across the varnished curve of the guitar . Sabrina , prickling with irritable energy , her teeth on edge , wandered to the desk and picked up a maga/zine and put it down again , throwing a brilliant , encouraging smile back at Lizardo . " I 've tried to remember that MacArthur song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time I 'm going to write it down and get it right . " She pulled open the desk drawer to look for pencil and paper . Staringup at her was a flat black automatic . With one knee up , his foot on a chair , the guitar across his body , Lizardo leaned looking as if he might cry . " Well my goodness ! " she said . " Are you scared of burglars ? " His eyes would look everywhere but at her . They wound up fixed on the ceiling , as if they found there the pure tone his fingers were trying to pick out of a string . He bleated , " I hab enemies ! " Quietly Sabrina shoved the drawer shut . Without paper or pencil she went back and sat in the carved walnut chair . " It is por protection , " Lizardo said . " Of course . I did n't mean to rummage your things . Forgive me . " For a few seconds longer he plinked and tuned . Then he took his foot off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabrina filled her mouth with cold , hardly diluted bourbon . Smiling a pleading smile , Lizardo strummed an entry that was martial and severe , and at her nod , began to sing . " Oh , General MacArt'ur , he say , I come back to Pilipines , I come back to Pilipines , I come back to Pilipines . ' General MacArt'ur , he say , I come back to Pilipines , I go now , but I return . ' " Lower and sadder than she had been at any time that day , Sabrina sat listening , applauding with her eyes and her smile and thinking of the dream girl cut out of a newspaper fifteen years or more ago , and the enemies , imagined for no conceivable reason except to ring the toosaferefuge with dangers and light the drab life with melodrama . She listened to the guitar style , flamboyant but not very precise , and looked at the pictures of the Hero , the General , Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines , and she thought , You poor old devil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sluggish and heavy , and when Lizardo finished she saluted him with a smile that felt as stretched and unreal as the painted smile on a balloon . She left word with her mother that she would not be at home for dinner . Some time  --  not long  --  she spent in a bar on El Camino . When the incoming dinner crowds drove her out , she turned as if in obedience to an accepted penance up toward the Skyline . Steadily , with her eyes and mind wide open , she cruised between alternating stretches of subdivisionsand heath until she saw approaching the mouth of the blind road . Her foot did not ease on the throttle , the anticipated shudder did not come . The lane opened briefly and passed , no more than a littered dirt road ordained shortly , with its history of furtive loves , shabby quarrels , and desperate men hooking hoses to the exhaust pipes of cars , to be graded down and built over by the oncoming tracts . She could not persuade herself that anything vital to her own life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning homeward from a cemetery after a funeral . Closer in toward the City was a place she had loved since childhood , a gray farm anchored like a lighthouse on the sea cliffs , with a pond behind it to mirror the sky and the buildings and the windbreak of cypresses . This too , she supposed , was doomed  --  would be gone by now if whoever owned it had not loved it and hung on . She pulled off the highway at the turn and shut off the engine and sat looking , as nearly blank in mind as if she had been on the edge of sleep . The sun was setting in the offshore fogbank . She sat unmoving , not taking her eyes off darkening sea and darkening sky until land and sea and sky had dissolved together in dusk , and lights that she had not seen born winked all along the curve of shore . Eventually she started the engine again and drove on . She had a sensation as if the car were the little boat of a Ouija board , pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but pushed ; and she herself helpless but unattached , until through traffic lights and unfamiliar new suburbs she reached what she was headed for , and her right tire rubbed the curb of a deadendstreet in Stonestown . Now torpor and indifference were taken away like a bandage thatp153had bound in and deadened pain . She watched like a wolf from the dark , greedy for every sign , every detail , of the way he lived . For she had taken it in completely that this security was what he feared to lose . His two-story stucco shouldered its neighbors for room on the narrow lot , everything in it incorrigibly , predictably , uppermiddle . House , lot , neighborhood , flowerbeds , patch of lawn , even the aralias in tubs on each side of the blue door , could have been duplicated two thousand times in the western subdivisions . House built ten years ago to sell at $27,500 . Neighborhood carefully restricted until discriminatory clauses in deeds were invalidated by the Supreme Court ; since then , zoned by quiet neighborhood consensus and realtors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the glow showed her ambiguous image brooding in the windshield , jerked her hand down into the dark seat . Except for her own car and two others , the street was clear . All up the hills , toward the darkness of the Sutro Forest , lights bloomed in lines and circles and crescents . The wind sliced into the car with a night-time edge . What were they doing in that house , he and his possessive wife and his three probably silly and unattractive daughters ? In God 's name , why should she sit out in the dark as furtive as a thief while they inside owned him completely ? What were they doing  --  playing cards , records , radio ? Reading ? Doing crossword puzzles ? Or glued to television like forty million other idiots ? If she chose to , she could walk up to that door and push the button , and , whoever answered , demand to see him . Before them all she could force a show-down . In three minutes she could crack that secure middleclasshome like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power for destruction . Remembering Bernard 's voice shushing her on the telephone , proposing secrecy , hypocrisy , evasion , she thought , He 's afraid of me , and he 's right . Then she froze . His door let a slash of light down the front steps . She saw him plain in the opening , tall and bare-headed in a shortsleevedsport shirt . He seemed to sniff the air , he looked at the sky and then casually at Sabrina 's car . Did he recognize it ? Could he see her ? Had he come out to signal her ? She eased toward the far side of thep154seat , gradually turning her face , and saw him put a letter under the flap of the mailbox to be collected by tomorrow 's postman . To her ? But then he would n't leave it around for everyone to see . Once more  --  keenly ?  --  he looked across at her car . She half lifted her hand to beckon , but he had already turned . The slab of light narrowed and vanished across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aralias . With her heart thundering in her ears she opened the door and stepped out . Somewhere two radios or television sets were antiphonally discordant . Sauntering , she went around the eye of the dead-end street and back down his side . Her eyes pried at the edges of the windows where the drapes did not quite close . Ring his bell ? Present him an outright challenge to the choice he had made ? For he had made it , not she . The acknowledgment left her eyes so hot she felt they must glow in the dark . She swung a blind look at the lights scattered all above her on the hills . She had thrown herself at his head and he had ducked . It was unthinkable that she would be that shameless again , but even if she were , he would n't come on her terms . He would have his cake and eat it too , or he would go without his cake . Behind his passion and his warmth , behind the deference and admiration he showed her , behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of his previous commitment , which he would not break . She could burn his house down , shake or break his marriage , but she would get out of it nothing but revenge  --  surely nothing of what she had hoped to fill her life with . She went on past his walk . A few houses down , a door opened . Sabrina controlled an impulse to get away . Girls ' voices , the stomp of a rock-and-roll record , people shouting . Then a girl in toreador pants and pony tail ran down the walk . Passing Sabrina , she glanced up , and Sabrina saw a young face still lighted by what she had left  --  dark , inquiring eyes , heavy brows , a face slightly chubby , teeth that showed in an even , curious half smile . The eyes that looked at Sabrina would have looked at anyone else with the same interest , and forgotten with equal promptness anyone they encountered . Just passing , she slowed toward dignity , and then her sneakers were pattering again . Sabrina watched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard 's door . One of his daughters , secure , contented , full of thirteen-year-old excitements , fond of Daddy , snuggly and affectionate and thoughtless . She thought of herself at thirteen , and heard down some corridor of her mind the receding jingle of bells on the squaw boots that had first taught her she was female , mysterious , and to be loved . Instead of that , she lurked outside the door of her reluctant lover , a vampire driven by an ancient incurable ferocity . How might she look to anyone inside there , to that chubby innocent with the eyes like a painting of Ruth or Naomi ? " My God , " she whispered , " is this me ? " In a direct abrupt angle she crossed the street , slid into the car , started the motor , circled the turnaround , crept on past his house as slowly as the car would move . She did not pretend to herself that she would ever come back , or that he would come to her . Whatever possibilityhad been there she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of hope she was leaving behind her . She watched his house until even by craning she could no longer see it , and the breaking of contact was as reluctant as the last touch of fingers in good-by.  |p156THEIR  WAITER was a man with a soft , corrupt face and a voice like a shy girl 's . The two boys at the corner table back of Sabrina 's kept arguing about him . One was positive he was a castrato , the other thought he was a flit . They bellowed joyfullyinto the Wagon Wheel 's din , a yard behind Sabrina 's back . " I do n't give a damn , you understand , " said the advocate of the castratotheory . " It 's nothing to me . But I can tell the difference between the wrong hormones and no hormones at all . Look at his face  --  no beard , skin like a woman . And a choir-boy voice . " " The voice does n't prove anything , " Flit said . " The hell it does n't . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The hell it does . " " The hell it does n't . How do you account for it , then ? " " You can be born with funny vocal chords . Maybe he 's a male alto , or a counter tenor , or something . " " What ? " " Maybe he 's a counter tenor ! " Castrato groaned . Into their low-ceiling corner the incomparable clatter of two hundred diners crashed and pounded . " Oh , man , " Cas/trato said as if in pain . " Counter tenor , he says . Under-the-counter soprano , you mean . Man , you do n't know anything . This guy 's de-prived . " The babble broke and drowned them out . " Is n't it nice , " Sabrina said , forming each syllable for lip-reading . " Mmmm ? " Oliver had been looking down at the lighter in his fingers . His forehead wrinkled as his eyes came up in question . His cigarettehung steady in the very middle of his lips . " Other people 's conversation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dying-fish faces she was accustomed to draw in the margins of letters . But her depression was only too real . Too hard a day : an early start , a hard , fast drive over , too many martinis before lunch , a hot and blistering afternoon , too much talk , too many people , too much dust . The only good hour of the whole day had been lunch at Addie McAllister 's ranch . She had wandered outside with her barbecued-beef sandwich in her hand and found a calf that had sucked her fingers . But that was only an interlude . Most of it had been as stupid as this overheard conversation in a corner thick with cigarette smoke and the reek from the charcoal broilers . She felt drained , dried out , coated with an ugly film , and she was hot enough to die . " I wonder how many places like this there are in the United States ? " she said . " Places that smell and taste and sound exactly alike , where they anaesthetize your taste with alcohol and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you 're not at home unless you 're loud . " From two feet away he looked into her eyes . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " There was n't much choice if we wanted to eat on this side . This is the best place in Carson . " He looked almost offended , as if she were blaming him unjustly for the institution of the charcoal-broiled top sirloin . " Oh , do n't mind me , " she said . " It 's just that I 've had about all the heat and noise I can take . " His eyes were quick and judging , and at once his hand was in the air , his fingers snapping for the waiter . It occurred to her that he was being considerate ; he could be a brother if he tried . He said , " Are you all right ? Would you feel better waiting outside ? This is going to take a minute . "  | " Maybe I will go out . " He rose when she did , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was not so sure herself that she would make it , the room spun so , layered with smoke and detonating with sound . The boys in the corner stopped talking to watch her leave , and she dropped on their brown , flat-topped , insolently healthy heads a look that should have scalded the hair off them . She felt like crying at them , You brash cubs , sometime you 'll find out every poor maimed unfortunate in the world is n't there just to joke about . Why not a little pity , why not a little decent silence ? The tables were packed so close she had to wedge through . From the bar , where people were lined up two deep waiting , someone called , but she waved blindly and went on . The headwaiter by the door creased his underworld face at her , and then the hot air of the street flooded around her and she stood breathing quickly against a pole . Second by second the smoke and hysteria and the nauseated feeling of pollution evaporated away . She filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City 's main street was surprisingly quiet after the clamor inside . The sun had been behind the Sierra for some time , and the light , though not the air , was cool . Eastward and southward across the tops of buildings she saw lion-colored mountains still in sunlight . The wind that came rattling the leaves from cottonwood to cottonwood down the short side street was warm , dry , faintly scented with sage and even more faintly with something rarer  --  the pines on the mountains . Oliver came out and stood at her side . " Feeling better ? " " Much better , thanks . " " I thought you were going to conk out . " " I 'm all right now . " " Not a very successful day . " " You won two hundred dollars . " " I mean for you . " Though she had learned long ago to be alert for the tone of irony in his voice , she did not hear it now . He seemed honestly concerned ; he had actually proposed the races as therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't up to it . " " No disasters . " " No , " she said . " Not enough blood . "  |p159They  walked through a blast of barbecue smoke to the parking lot . Three quarters of the cars in it were Porsches , Mercedes ' , Austin Healeys , Jaguars , MG 's , Triumphs , Lancias . Oliver pointed to a squat gray racer as if he expected her to say something . When she turned a blank face he was astonished . " Reventlow 's Scarab , " he said . " The winnah . You were n't paying much attention . " " I was never a very good spectator . " When he opened the door of the white Mercedes he had to brush and blow at the drift of cottonwood fluff that had gathered in the seats . The corners of the lot were white with windrowed cotton . Sabrina got in and closed her eyes . She heard the door shut solidly , heard Oliver walk around , felt the car lean with his weight . The key clinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked and saw Oliver , in his plaid cap , pulling out of the boot the hooded jacket she had worn coming over . " No thanks , " she said . " I 'd rather blow . " She lay back , looking up into the big cottonwood that spread from the lot beyond . The breeze was rattling up there , and she looked into thousands of heart-shaped , trembling leaves that glinted like light dry metal and pattered like a shower of rain . From all through the tree , from the split clusters of bolls , seed-fluff streamed off across a sky as blue as a Dutch tile . When Oliver reached to turn the key she laid a hand on his wrist . " Wait . Let 's sit a minute . " " We 'll get home about two as it is . " " Just for a minute . I like the sound of the leaves . " He turned his back half against the door so that he could watch her . After perhaps two minutes while she sat with closed eyes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other night . " She concentrated on the lonely and musical sounds of the tree . From a distance she said , " The news does get around . " " You did n't make it up , I gather . " She opened her eyes and came back . " Oh . . . you know . He thinks he 's furious at me but I wonder if he really cares . I 'm only a postscript on his life . He 's married to a medical practice . " " I wonder . " " Do n't wonder . He is. "  | " Even if he is . " " Even if he is , what ? " " Even if he is , make it up . " " Just like that . " " Just like that . " " Suppose he would n't ? " " He would . " She captured a filament of cotton , lighter almost than the air that carried it , and tried to lay it on her palm , and when it would n't stay she blew it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " she said . " Maybe he would . What about Bernard ? " He was doodling the gearshift stick around through four positions , and while she waited for him to answer he began to whistle " Siboney " through his teeth . The stick moved jerkily in the parody of a rumba step . His hazel eyes glinted sideways . She took his meaning , but the momentary angry defensiveness that came bursting up toward speech stopped short of words . For his contemptwas not too different from the feelings she herself had had the previous evening , while she prowled Bernard 's middle-class street huntingthe ghost of ecstasy behind his blue door . Blue doors in New Mexico , she remembered , were supposed to keep witches away . Well . Oliver said , " Your disease is n't so uncommon there 's no known cure . It 'll cure itself if you 'll let it . " Her lips thrust out at him . " Relax and enjoy it ? " Her brother 's exclamation was almost a grunt . " Wear it out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know Burke , he 'll take you . He 'd think he had to keep you on a short lead , and he 'd get pretty prissy , I would guess , but he 'd take you , partly because he thinks you 're Bewitching Womanhood on a patty shell and partly because he knows damned well how much you 've meant to that fancy practice of his . The other business is no good . If you will pardon my crude terms , Barney 's a weak sister . He could n't hold you three weeks . He 's nothing  --  I do n't know how in hell you came to pick him in the first place . Wear it out and get over it . These things happen . There 's no reason they have to last . "  | " Unless you ca n't shake them , or unless they 're only symptoms of something else . " " Oh , for Christ 's sake . " While she sat sullenly , sunk in the bucket seat , he turned thickly behind the wheel and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off it . And let me tell you something else . You 're a little too noticeable to go around making a spectacle of your blasted life . " " Is n't that quaint , that was a point Bernard made . " " Then he 's got more judgment than I gave him credit for . " " It 's the worst thing I know about him . He 's afraid . " Just for a moment he squinted , guessing . " Balls , " he said . He turned the key and the motor chuckled . But before he could drop his hand to the shift stick she was out of the car . He regarded her grimly . " Now you 're sore . Good God , Sabrina , you act fifteen years old . Get in and let 's go home . " " I 'm not going back yet . " She turned her face upward to the myriad tremble and glitter of leaves , the silent snow of fluff . With a gesture as positive as unleashing a dog she let her mind escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the stir and shimmer of the tree she said , " Oliver , did you ever think of buying a ranch ? Raising cattle ? " He barked out a one-syllable laugh . The moment she looked down he began ludicrously and savagely to bounce up and down , tossing imaginary flowers to both sides , a **25;3055;TOOLONG Ophelia . Here 's pansies , that 's for thoughts . " Seriously , " she said . " Oh , seriously . Well , seriously , no . Taxwise it has advantages  --  guaranteedand fully chargeable losses . Likewise Nevada has a pleasant absence of state income tax . As a way of life , however , I mean as a way of finding something positive to do in the world , no . If you remember , I am tied to certain properties in Hillsborough and Woodside . " He barked again . " Why ? That the latest project ? " " I was just thinking how lucky pioneer women were . I wish Burke had been driving a covered wagon when I met him , and I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wash clothes everyp162Monday in a boiler set on a greasewood fire , and make soap out of ashes and bacon fat , and stand off Paiutes with a Sharps rifle . " She said it principally to get a rise out of him , and yet there was a streak of truth in the fantasy . Preposterous as it was , she had seen herself in calico at that cabin door . Oliver was shaking his head slowly back and forth . " Can you imagine me in Addie McAllister 's shoes ? " she said . " Boots , rather ? Out in the corral with the men at roundup time stabbing steers with hypodermics and notching ears and clipping horns and branding even castrating ? I 've seen her . " His morose eyes never left her face . " No , " he said . She paid no attention . " Burke could come up on week ends and for his vacations . In the fall the cottonwoods would be all yellow and in spring there 'd be pussywillows and in winter we could run up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could bring all your fifty children to ride the horses and catch pollywogs in the irrigation ditches . And I could have a million dogs . You know the first thing I did when Burke and I were married ? I got a dog , just because Mother would never let me have one . Do you know my dog Fat Boy ? I wish he was here now . " " So do I , " Oliver said . " I 'd have him bite you . Where does it get you to wallow around in all these daydreams ? " " Somebody 's got to raise the steaks for the nine million charcoal-broil steak houses in the United States . " " Have you forgotten all the people you know who set out to live the healthy outdoor life here or down in the Santa Ynez or somewhere ? The few who make it go grew up on ranches in the first place . The rest go to shrinkers twice a week or have already taken their overdose of sleeping pills . Cattle ranches are a symptom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his violence , and made a disgusted pit ! with his mouth . " You pernicious hag , get in , so we can get started . " " I told you , I 'm not going back . " His eyes cocked up at her from under bushy brows ; his face went through several expressions and settled on one of polite interest . " So what 'll you do ? " " Maybe stay here for a while . "  | " Here ? In Carson ? " " Somewhere around here . I like the way the trees sound . " " That 's fine . What do I tell Mother ? " " Do you have to tell her anything ? " " Cut it out . Of course I 'll have to tell her something . She 'll ask . She 's so convinced that the dissolute Hutchens strain is breaking out in you that she 'll ask in fear and trembling . " " All right . Tell her I stayed over with Addie to learn cattle ranching . Or tell I went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headlinesin 1970 ? Tonopah Mystery Woman Believed Lost Socialite . A woman who lived for ten years in a Tonopah hotel room may be sociallyprominent Mrs. Burke Castro , wife of a Pasadena physician , Tonopah police said today . Mrs. Castro disappeared from a parking lot in Carson City on June 21 , 1960 , after an argument with her brother , wealthy playboy Oliver Hutchens of Hillsborough . Contacted at his mother 's Hillsborough estate , Mr. Hutchens said . . . what did you say ? " " Choose any four-letter word . " A party came out and crowded into two cars and pulled away . The cottonwoods pattered overhead , the breeze was almost cool . She thought that if she could find some place to walk , the half-stupefied headache she had carried out of the restaurant would go away . She had no heart for fencing with Oliver , and less for listening to his advice . She wanted contact with clean things , wind and trees , sagebrush , desert , stars . And no people . Eventually Oliver accepted the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Enough . And credit cards . " He swung his sunglasses by the earpiece . His head bristled with virile short hair . At seventy he would have it as thick as ever ; he would be a white-haired , pink-faced old man dangerous to waitresses and his younger friends ' wives . These things happen ; there 's no reason they have to last . He said , " Let me ask you straight , are you responsible ? Sober ? In your right mind ? " " Of course . " " How long do you expect to stay ? "  | " I do n't know . Until I think things out . " " Want me to stay over and drive you back tomorrow ? " " Oh , Oliver , let up ! I 'm not staying over to meet Bernard , so you ca n't embarrass me that way . Stay if you want to , but I 'd rather be alone . " " So , " he said , and , straightening , laid his palm on the gear shift knob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're at Addie 's . You might check in there if you decide to stay more than ten years . There might be messages . " She stepped aside as he cramped the car around , and from his angled position he said , " Do n't get lost . " " Ah , would n't I like to ! " He did not shoot forward as she expected . His face was scowly . " Sister mine , I wonder if I ought to leave you ? " " Go on , your chivalry is showing . I 'll be all right . " " Where 'll you stay ? " " I 'll find somewhere . " " How 'll you get home ? Plane ? " " Or rent a Hertz car . " " So , " he said again . " Well , whatever it is , find it . " He laughed . " Or lose it . " He burst away , bounced at the driveway entrance , shifted with a whurtl whurrool and was gone . At once Sabrina walked around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street that shortly dwindled away into desert . Out ahead to the left she saw U.S. 50 cutting eastward toward the broken country where the Carson River made a belt of trees . Ahead to the right was the high desert range she had seen over the roofs ; she thought she could see the Indian School at its foot , miles away over a sloping patchwork of alfalfa fields and pastures . But she bore away from the cultivated land , heading into the scabby flats straight eastward , parallel with U.S. 50 . As a gauge of how much was left of afternoon she watched the shadow of the Sierra that crept up the face of the eastern range . In the fiat heels she had worn for the races she found the walking easy enough , but she was offended by the scattered refuse . Every clump of sage or rabbitbrush wore flags of Kleenex , around every stalk was folded newspaper or waxed bread wrappers . Glass was everywhere , andp165bullet-plugged cans , broken toys , cartons , dried and curling shoes , crockery . Instead of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities had been , Carson City tossed its litter out and let it blow , so that archeologists of the far future would find the town 's life spread in a thin geological horizon across miles of valley . The breeze puffed at her back , flowing down from the cooling mountains . She tested the air for unpleasant odors and smelled only dust and sage . Very quickly the desert took the pollution out of the garbage people flung across it . Not even carrion retained its stench long . But it was all ugly , especially the cans , one of the ugliest shapes of human waste . Only glass , which lasted forever , might ultimately acquire beauty on that dumpheap . Over many years it acquired a delicate ultraviolet tint . Remembering Addie McAllister 's mantel with its row of those relics , Sabrina found herself examining the rubbish as she picked her way through it , hoping for the sight of an unbroken flask or medicine vial with the lilac of fifty years of sun in it . She would have taken such a find as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broken country along the river , as well as the shoulder of the southeastern range . North of her was an irregular noise of speeding cars . Walking with her eyes on the rosy spurs of rock that were still in sun , she thought , Maybe I should go out in the desert somewhere . What if I just kept on walking ? Maybe Manitou or somebody would send me a vision and tell me my secret name , out in the middle of some dead sea bottom with my tongue leather in my mouth and my skin burned black and the sky like tin , and all around a horizon like the backbones of dinosaurs . Maybe sufferingand purging would bring an inward look so profound that ever afterward a person would be unshakable . Maybe then I 'd know what I should do , and be able to do it . She went on between clumps of sage , down curving channels of ashlikeearth . The sun on the peaks had shrunk till it was on only one face of rock , and then between the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought it down , the peak went dun . While she counted one , the light that had been dammed there went a hundred and eighty-six thousand miles into space , on its way to make a sunrise on some other planet.  |p166Out  of breath , she paused . The pounding in her temples , the dilated look of everything , the grayness that seemed instantly to flood the world when that candle peak went out , her recollection of the uneven course she had pursued out from town , made her realize that she had been quite drunk , and was still far from steady . Never mind : the desert would purify her as it purified everything . She was perhaps a mile and a half out on the flats , excruciatingly alone , a sparrow whose fall might or might not be noted . Above her the sky was full of light , though the earth lay now in its own shadow . On the other side of the Sierra the last sunset on the continent was in progress . How strange and sad to be a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars from the highway . The wind that in the parking lot had brought to her nostrils a touch of coolness and peace touched them again with the warm , unmistakable scent of pines that it had kept intact across all that aromatic reach of sage . Like a hope ? Eager for portents , she grasped at the possibility that recommended itself to her like a patent medicine . Tired ? Run-down ? Out of joint with your world ? Scared that the fault is really in you , not in others ? Then simplify . Find a world you can quit being afraid of . Try fresh air , work , the company of animals less troubling than twentiethcenturyhuman beings . Head for the desert or the woods . Briefly , experimentally , she saw herself walking a night road with someone , their footsteps soft in dust , the ranch house windows lighted , the barns dark , the night wind stirring and rattling the leaves , and beyond them , enclosing it all , the far , soft , hollow roar of the mountains . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked like cracking glass . Where on earth was her pride ? She said aloud , " Bernard , damn you , I will pick you off me like a burr ! I must ! " Abruptly there were tears on her face . She sat down with a moan , and leaning back on her braced palms among the runty forest of sage , she stared blindly at the sky . For a long time she sat without moving . The tears stopped , her cheeks dried . A small boatlike cloud coasting over the southeastern range went red , then pink , then mauve , then gray . The greenish sky deepened , the sage plain filled with shadows that between the dark clumps became almost as dark as the sage itself.  |p168There  was a soft sound of wind , like a sigh : another day endured and survived . Purify me , she said to the shadowed desert . Tell me the name to go by . Tell me what to do , and teach me how to do it with a whole heart . She tuned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's heat had already radiated away ; the air was cool . A few stars had revealed themselves brighter than the sky they were set in . This was the hour , she remembered , when sidewinders came out of the sand and the desert 's nocturnal life began to stir . Her ears strained against silence , whispers , rustlings . Carefully she leaned forward and rubbed her hands , pebbled with indented gravel . Beside her her handbag was a swimming paleness . She grasped it and rose , bringing into view the wider darkness and the uneven line where earth fitted sky . Only then , up to her waist in sagebrush , glaring into shadows , did she comprehend what a figure she made  --  a woman in a cotton print dress , clutching a white summer handbag , all alone a mile or two out in the scraggy desert , with tears dried on her face and her ears alert for the sandy slither , the small dry coilings , of danger . Lashing her fear with irony , she assured herself that it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wander away from gamblingjoints , divorce courts , bars , motels where they lived with one man while divorcing another , and jounce and stumble ridiculously , in angry or lamentable tears , out into the wilderness , to be rescued later , hystericaland panic-stricken , by bored lovers , deputies , posses of excitementhuntingloafers . Whatever the desert might offer a savage living out his ritual obligations , it did n't offer much to modern woman . The contents of her bag recommended themselves to her notice : a partial pack of cigarettes , a compact and lipstick , a broken roll of Lifesavers , a crumpledhandkerchief , a purse , keys to the car she did n't have with her , a gas card , a restaurant credit card . Not exactly what the well-equipped hermit should take along . To think of doing anything alone , anything whatever , was preposterous . She turned , and the neon halo of Carson City bloomed against the wall of the Sierra like the lights of rescuers . Through wind-movedp168trees , or what she imagined were trees , the town 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  most carefully , for she had not entirely shed her fear  --  among the gnarly clumps , the glass-and-can-strewn ground . Hunt her soul in solitude ? There was no one she less liked to be alone with than herself . Search her soul for answers ? There was no more answer in her than there was in an echo . She gave back nothing but questions . Sneaking from the image of herself self-exposed on the dreary flat , she groped toward the lights of Carson , and when she paused , hunting a passage among the shadows or listening to a frighteningsound , she heard the traveler wind , the growing and then diminishingof cars on the highway , the troubling sounds of her own difficult shamed life : the breathing , the beating of the heart . Whatever she needed , it was not herself . She did not like herself . She needed someone with whom to keep in touch , someone to comfort her when she whimpered and reassure her when she was scared . And that had to be , could only be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she found herself at the edge of the State Capitol grounds . People were strolling there , sitting on benches ; she fitted herself among them and took her unnoticed place . There was an air upon the proprietary couples of comfortable relaxation after a day 's work . They spoke in low voices , their laughter was gentle . They seemed another race from the tourists in the bars and cafes and gambling joints along the highway . For a time , shoes in hand and the lawn soft-prickling under her stockinged feet , she watched a boy hunting nightcrawlers with a flashlight , pushing a can ahead of him , probing his light among the grass blades for the telltale reddish shine . Around her among the smells of cooling night under the rattle of cottonwood leaves the slow couples moved . She would have liked to live and belong and take part in this town  --  not the hoked-up tourist town , but the working town , the cattleraising , alfalfa-growing , politics-arguing , intimate , practical , Biggest Little Capital on Earth . Was that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a healthy world and make herself a place in it only another of the emotionalexplosions that had begun in Oaxaca and left her in bits ? Or wasp169it the beginning of reconciliation and wisdom ? She had hated her unrewardinglife ; here was an alternative , possibly even a way to lead Burke out of that highly paid attentiveness he enslaved himself to . She could heal the healer . What you did conditioned what you were ; if you did trivial things , you were trivial ; nothing , you were nothing . The Wolcott tradition might tell her to collect sun-tinted bottles , but she wanted more . There was too much life in her to let it be frittered away . Made to enhance life , Burke had told her long ago . Here might be a way . In the soft dark , full of a growing excitement and triumph , she said with her lips but not her voice , It all changed , it all started to go right , one night when I was up in Carson and fell in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next block . Standing at the cashier 's desk between a counter of cheap bright goods and a bank of slot machines , she changed a dollar into quarters and dimes . As she turned away , to test her luck she dropped a dime into one of the slot machines and pulled the handle . The wheels whirred , clicked : cherry . Spun , clicked : cherry . Spun , clicked : bar . Into the cup , with a tinny clink , the machine spit four dimes . An omen . Sabrina scooped them out and slid into the telephone booth . One of the dimes revived the telephone into a hum , and she dialed operator . When the voice came she shoved the hinged door shut with her knee , enclosing and illuminating herself , and lifting her mouth close against the black cone she called collect . The intricate system made its heard connections , voices passed on data . Then the number answered not in Robert 's or Annie 's voice , but in Burke 's own . " Hello ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and cut out again . Then they were alone on the line . " Hello , Burke ? " she said , and had to clear her husky throat . " It 's Sabrina . " " Yes , " he said , " I know . " " I thought we ought to . . . talk things over . " " I 'm surprised you think there 's anything to talk over . " " At least I can say that I 'm miserably sorry . " " Yes , " he said . " That 's what you said the other night . "  | " It 's true ! It was true the other night and it 's true now . " " I 'm glad to know it , " Burke said , " but does being sorry help ? " " I hoped it might help a little . " " Maybe it does , a little . Maybe we need something that helps a lot . " Stalemate , so soon . He was a stone . Once he had said to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could certainly hold a grudge . Already the mood of penitential optimism that she had brought to the booth was heating up toward hostility and self-justification , and that was not what she had wanted or intended . She could imagine his head bent down as he listened politely and unforgivingly to her humbling of herself . Bitterly she cried into the mouthpiece , " This time I 'm calling you . What do you want me to do , get down on my knees ? " It was a moment before he answered . She thought she heard a dry little cough of a laugh . " I doubt that that would help either , " Burke said . " I tried it . Remember ? " " Ah ! " Sabrina said . " Ah , that 's dirty ! " The booth was so airless that she kicked at the hinged door and kicked herself into darkness . Sittingin the bluish radiance from the drugstore she said urgently , " Darling , please let 's not quarrel ! Ca n't we try to be reasonable people ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all over , I 've given him up totally , I 'm asking you to forgive me . Can you ? " She hung upon the lengthening , stubborn silence . " I do n't know , " he said . " Oh , please ! Because if you can I 've got an idea for us . " " Do we need an idea ? " " Does n't it seem to you we do ? " " Ideas sound about as useful as feeling sorry . You ca n't smash .. . smash everything and then smash it again and then expect to kiss it better . " Now for the first time she heard the quaver of anger in his voice , the way he swallowed a word to get his breath , and she gripped the receiveras if it were the receptacle of all her own anguish . She said to herself , This is how you decided , forget what it costs , and cried into the listening , unsympathetic wire , " But darling , if we both tried ! You said you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want us to get a ranch up here , like Addie McAllister 's , and get back to some healthy kindp171of life . I could be of some use , I could do something ! And you could come up week ends , or oftener if you 'd turn over more patients to the others , and ride and relax and get over all that strain . Maybe if you liked it you 'd want to give up your practice down there and move up here permanently . I should think you 'd want to heal people worth healing instead of all those . . . people such as I 've been . . . Dar-ling ? " She was talking to silence ; for a second she was afraid he had hung up . Then she heard his breathing . Without inflection he said , " It might be a good idea for you . Why do n't you go ahead ? " " For us ? " " For you , " Burke said . " Not for me . " " Oh , darling , why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly hear every breath he drew . " You want to know ? " he said in a quacking voice . Sabrina moved her knee , and the light came dingily on in the booth . She saw her own face uptilted to the mouthpiece , furiously listening like someone caught at a keyhole , and though she could not see the lips move , she heard the stiff words . " Say it . " " Because when I left the other night I was through , " Burke said . " After that , how could I ever trust you again ? How do I know what you 're doing in Carson right now ? How do I know you 're not snug in some motel ? " Strangling , Sabrina kicked the door : the light went out and left her in the cold radiance of diffused mercury vapor . Whispering , she said , " I 'm not . I 've talked to him once , on the phone , since I saw you . He wanted me to go to Carmel with him and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . " " Maybe , " he said . " How would I know ? " " Darling ... " " You do anything you want , " Burke said in a high tight voice . " I 'm out of it . " " I knew you were heartless , " she said , still whispering . " I knew you were as cold as a lizard . But I never knew that if I came on my knees you would care so little that you would . . . " A high shelf of blue boxes of Kleenex outside the booth burned for a moment as yellow as fogp172lights and then came fading back to blue . " When you were on your knees , " she said , " I hurt you because I had to , because I 'd lied and I could n't go on lying . But when I 'm on mine you take your revenge as cold as ice . " She reached to hang up , and from a foot away the receiver said , " Sabrina ! " She kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it said . She dropped it in its holder . The booth light somehow was on again . She pushed through the door to avoid it and the sight of her own reflection . Her hands were shaking ; she braced them against a counter , hesitating in the strange , somnambulistic unreality of mercury-vapor blue . A girl with loaflike buttocks crammed into flimsy slacks was hanging on the handle of a twenty-five-cent slot machine , watching while the bands spun and stopped . " Pfffft ! " She let the handle bang up and said to the girl behind the counter , " Jeez , I should have stuck with the one at the Western . That paid once in a while . " " This is ripe , " the clerk said . " It 's hardly paid all day . " They stopped talking as Sabrina came between them with the remnantsof her change in her hand . As she might have dropped a scrap of paper in a wastebasket , she dropped a quarter into the machine and pulled the handle . She heard it whirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway to the door it clicked , after two steps it clicked again , after another it clicked a third time . The fat girl bleated and the jackpot crashed . Sabrina looked back from the doorway . Coins were still rolling ; the fat girl was on her knees , the clerk with a look of glad envy was leaning over the counter . " Jeez ! " she said . " Irish dividends ! " Their heads turned as Sabrina moved , and when they saw her starting out the door the fat girl screamed , " Hey , you leaving your jackpot ? " " Keep it , " Sabrina said . " Maybe it 'll bring you some of my luck . " The street was Christmas-colored with neon . She went down it blindly , thinking , Oh damn him , damn his coldness , damn his hurt grudge-holding vanity ! If he 'd only been the slightest understanding , we might have . . . He did n't have any reason to . . . Might have what ? said the cynic in her cerebellum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? And wo n't he ? Oh God , wo n't he ?  |p173iG  LL RIGHT , " Barbara said . " Tell me all about your first Mondayamong the rich folks . " The children were in bed , there was an undemanding tootle of Haydn coming in from KPFA , the house had been aired of dinner smells . " They are different from you and me , " Leonard said . She bit off a thread and laid aside the dress she had been mending and picked up a pair of faded jeans . Her ankles were giving her trouble with this baby ; she had to stay off her feet as much as possible . " I know all about that , all that about they have more money . I want to know what you did . " " It wo n't instruct you much . That 's a funny household . " Sprawling on the sofa , he laid aside his book and put his foot carefully in her lap among the sewing . She lifted it off and dropped it on the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way you look at it . Nothing happened . I dusted off some books , and treated some with my secret formula , and talked some with Mrs. Hutchens , and had tea with some people you would n't believethem if you read them in Dickens , and then on the way home I spent four eighty-five for paperback editions of books I had coveted up at the castle . "  | " Oh , come on , Leonard . You do n't have to make up melodramas or anything , but I 've been an understanding parent all day , and now I just want to sit and listen to you talk , and sew tiny garments , and be cozy . " " So , " he said . " Well , I reported for duty at eight a.m.  --  " " Which was too early . I kept telling you . " " It was not too early . That is a spartan house . I was greeted without enthusiasm by the Filipino butler , who obviously wished I would use the servants ' entrance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me he is an old sour . He lets me into this gloomy ancestral hall . There is not a sound except a vast ticking from the grandfather clock , like a time bomb . Then as I stand there it strikes one  --  just one . A couple of portraits on the walls , real old ravens , fix their eyes and beaks in me as soon as I turn my back . My shoes squeak . Eventually I sneak into the library and shut the door . " " You liar , " Barbara said . " You walked in there bold and bow-legged as a lion . " " So now , " Leonard said , " I am safe except for Brutus or Cassius or somebody on a bronze manhole cover above the door . He is trying to stare me down , and succeeding . They have swathed the whole room in sheets and drop-cloths and have put up a big trestle table for me to work on . It 's so much like the funeral parlor I worked in in Schenectadythat I begin to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf and remove all the books . Then I wash down the shelves . Then I dust the books I have removed , a book at a time and sometimes a page at a time , with a clean flannel cloth , and I lay them in order on the table and I start painting their bindings with a mixture of lanolin , beeswax , cedarwood oil , and some additive whose name I forget . This is called the British Museum Mixture , a formula courteously provided me by the curator of special collections at the Stanford University library . Tomorrow I will rub all these treated bindings down and put the books back . Is this the kind of details you want ? " " Tell me what books . " " Kee-rist , " Leonard said . " Did you ever look into those shelves ? " " Not really , I guess . "  | " Everything you ever wished you 'd read . I am Don Juan in a nunnery  --  threethousand well-preserved virgins yearning to have their covers cracked . " " Do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today I handled about two hundred , and while I was about it I admit I cracked a few . Given my health I will crack a lot more . Studs MacDonald . " " Ah , " she said , " can I help it if I 'm pregnant and useless ? " Their eyes met ; they smiled deeply . " How is he today ? " Leonard said . " Kicking you around yet ? " " Not really . Just sort of push-ups . " He put his foot on her thighs again and she left it there , pulling her sewing free on top of it . Haydn paused , murmured a moment , and became Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in a musical-comedy mood . " You have n't told me what books , " she said . He lay back with his hands under his head and shut one eye , then the other , squinting at the ceiling . " Jowsus , the books . Folios , quartos , crown octavos , duodecimos , cordovan and tree calf . She has two of these unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , original water-color illustrations by Matisse , Dufy , and Pissarro , bindings in pastel leather by some fabulous bird in Paris . I became a hand-washer , believe me . But those are n't what I got hung up on . They 're only for admiring , not reading . What slowed me down was the ones I 'd have liked to curl up with . Ever look into a veritable Audubon ? Or A PictorialHistory of the Civil War ? Or Sylva of North America , with those illustrations of trees and leaves and twigs that make you wish you were a bird so you could perch on them and sing ? " " You had fun . I told you you would . " " Fun , sure . Also twinges of proletarian unrest , thinking of all the time book dealers have spent finding those mint sets of Parkman and Motley and Prescott and Henry Adams and Gibbon and Macaulay and Carlyle , just so they could sit unread in Mrs. Hutchens ' library . It would almost be better if they were n't real . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travels six feet long that nobody had ever opened , I think , till I spent fifteen minutes on the company time this afternoon sneaking a few pages of Maximilian of Wied . Fun ? I guess yes . "  | " Did you see Mrs. Hutchens ? I 'll bet she 'd let you borrow things . " " I did indeed see Mrs. Hutchens . She was in every thirty minutes . I babbled my enthusiasm for her library , too . But when she murmured and hesitated and boxed her ankles and finally came out with the word that I might want to take certain things home to read , I got cold feet . She 'd relish a gap in those shelves the way she 'd relish a gap in her teeth . " " Oh , well , if you can get them in paperbacks . Anyway Dolly or Louise would probably have cut the illustrations out of them . What else did you do ? Did you see Sabrina ? " " Sabrina went up to Nevada on Saturday . " " Reno ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . I could n't exactly ask . " " Gee , I hope she has n't decided to divorce Burke . " " If you ask me , she 's one jump ahead of the shrinker man . " " I do n't know . Maybe she should divorce him . He 's so much older , and so busy all the time , and so sort of stiff . She needs something to do . " " Is a job so hard to get ? " " How could you convince yourself a job was necessary if you could buy out the company ? She 's had jobs ; she just could n't take them seriously . She 's got the notion she and her whole class are parasites  --  she 's got this New England notion of usefulness in the world but she ca n't think how to be useful . " " She hates being a flea but she wo n't hop off the dog . " " She 's too proud to do a lot of things , and too restless to just enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she is n't . " " Well , " he said , " she 's a charming girl . She 's so charming she can make you nearly forget how selfish she is . " " Oh , Leonard ! " " Is n't she ? Has n't she always used you like a human hot-water bot-tle ? " " You do n't have to be insulting . Anyway what about that fivehundred-dollarcheck to the Greenbelt Committee ? " " Yes , " he said . " That shakes me . But man , I find it hard to establishp177sympathy with somebody who ca n't find anything to do with ten milliondollars , or a hundred million , or whatever it is . There must be something money 's good for . " " She does n't want any place in the world that she has to buy . " " So it is n't good she wants to do . It 's herself she 's worried about . " " But I thought you liked her ! " " I like her fine . I just think she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mainly to herself . But she wants other people to watch while she goes to hell no-hands . She hates being a woman . " " Sabrina ? She 's got more charm in her little finger than most women have in their whole body . " " Sure , " he said . " She can focus on you in a way to melt glass . But take it from an old cover-cracker , hers is one cover I would n't ever be tempted to crack . " That left her astonished . She spread the material of the jeans across his shoe and studied it . " That 's funny . I would have thought . . . " " So maybe I 'm wrong , " he said . " After all , she 's got this red-hot affairgoing . Anyway I 'm only tempted by ancient virgins in half leather . " " Ahhh , " Barbara said comfortably . " Poor Sabrina . Well , tell me about tea . Who was there ? " He removed his foot from her lap . Mozart caracoled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her to sniff too . " The odor of learning , " he said . " Ineradicable . Lanolin to soften the leather , cedarwoodoil to keep out bookworms and silverfish , beeswax for a hard sheen . Tea ? That was something . This Helen Whatsername summonedme about four-thirty and I had to go . They were all too well bred to comment but not too well bred to stare . My shoes do squeak , too . They do n't squeak anywhere else , but in that house I sound like a Japanese student in buttoned cottontops . " So here I come , creak , creak , and cringe down on a satin sofa smilingand smiling and sniffing my fingers at them . There is a gal with gap-teeth : Mrs. Whitebread ? Whiteside . Also a Moral Rearmament lady just back from a convention on Mackinac Island . She has bluep178hair and gentle gentle eyes that she fixes on me with a hungry imperative . Also a gentleman who was once religious editor for the Des Moines Register . Every time I look at him his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rabbit , mnmn , mnmn , mnmn , with his lips sticking out and his eyeglasses flashing at me . Mnmn , mnmn , mnmn , and away goes his paddy into the cookies again . He parts his hair like T. S. Eliot , and when he speaks he bends his head down sort of demurely , and you can see clear to the bone . " This editor tells me he has been commissioned by Reader 's Digest to do four articles on The Religion of Everyday . The price of these will be twenty-five hundred dollars each , mnmn , mnmn , mnmn , and off goes his hand into the cookies . Mmmn , mnmn , mnmn , restores your faith in humanity that a great magazine read by forty million people in seventeen languages should be willing to pay so well for articles on faith and good works as exhibited by the simple everyday American . " " There is n't any such man . You 're making him up . " He raised his hand for an oath , sniffed his fingers , smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did commission those articles , too , and I think the price was twenty-five-hundred apiece . But about that time the Filipino renews the cookie plate , and passes the orange juice . The Moral Rearmament lady asks him if he 's ever been to Baguio , where her outfit has another conference headquarters and where she was recentlythrilled to hear delegates from Japan publicly apologize to the Filipino people for starting the war . The editor is on fire at once . Snatches a cookie . Restores your faith in humanity , mnmn , mnmn , mnmn . The Filipino says he been to Baguio many time , he come from Ilocos Sur , berry close by . The Moral Rearmament lady tries to make him admit the Peninsula hills are very like the hills around Baguio , but I do n't think he buys any of that . The woman with the teeth , Mrs. Whitebone-Whiteside , lights up a cigarette that Mrs. Hutchens and the Moral Rearmament lady courageously overlook , and the editor gets another cookie as they go by . Mrs. Whiteside gets the word from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , and she tells me what a delightful time I am in for , simply divine . Then Mrs. Hutchens tells us a story about Uncle Bushrod , how he couldp179never bear the undignified postures of crawling in and out of early automobiles , so about 1912 he had a special Silver Streak Rolls built for him , so high he could walk straight into it with a tophat on . " " I know , " Barbara said . " We used to play in it sometimes . Oliver still drives it to these antique-auto shindigs . " " Well , I have always had to stoop . But just when Mrs. Hutchens has finished her tale , and the Moral Rearmament lady is looking yearningly at me , bent on conversion , I see my chance , so I stand up , cre-e-e-a-a-k ! and announce that it 's time I got home . " " You make yourself out such a goof . I 'll bet you were the life of the party . " " I was mute . But I was getting away with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less than overjoyed to find us there . He gives us this little steely glint , you know , like a house detective . He does not shake hands , neither does he bow . He looks , he ticks us off . Mrs. Whiteside , how do you do . Mrs. Bent  --  I believe I have met Mrs. Bent , yes . Moral Rearmament , is it ? Buchmanites ? Yes . Mr. Spencer ? Good afternoon . You 're .. . " A writer , the editor tells him , and is about to fill him in on the Reader 's Digest articles when he notices that the opportunity is gone by , the Young Laird is on me now . MacDonald ? Oh , Barbara 's husband . No smile . The bastard has met me at least five times , each time all afresh . So then the horrid truth comes out , that I 'm the new archivist , and that catches his attention all right . Really ? he says . Really ? I thought you were a schoolteacher , he says  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you doing up the chimney , I thought you were the guy we called to pump the septic tank . " Old Mrs. Hutchens is murmuring , and old Mrs. Whiteacre is lookingpained , and old Mrs. Bent is fumbling at her reticule and shooting her stole , and the editor is screwing his chin out of his collar and flashinghis eyeglasses around , and Helen Whatsername  --  who incidentally is something of a dish , did you ever notice ?  --  sits there with her knees and ankles together . This Oliver has quite a knack . I wait till my defrostersare working and then I creak away , and the editor grabs a last cookie and follows . "  | " You 're exaggerating . " " Naturally . What I really did , I stepped up to the insolent bully and said , Who do you think you are , shouldering your way into an innocent tea party and insulting your mother 's guests ? You cad , I said , I 'll teach you the manners you seem to have missed learning , and with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , sort of . Definitely , I should say . " " I wonder why ? " " Deponent sayeth not . As I was creaking out the door with the editor behind me I heard Mrs. Hutchens ask about Sabrina , and he said she 'd stayed up at somebody 's ranch . Then I found myself in a column of two 's with the editor . First thing I know he skips to get in step . I stumble and break it up . Right away he skips back in . He will not be denied . He is full of togetherness and vital adjustment . I try little minty steps and he 's right with me . I step out , and here he comes , hup two three four . I almost expect him to call for a cadence . " He is telling me it restores his faith in humanity to know someone like Mrs. Hutchens . Great heart , wonderful woman shedding good on every side . Clearly I am one of the sides . He will put me in an article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know Great Books . The Filipino pursues us and opens the door and we bump each other around bowing ourselves out . He wo n't go first because then he could n't keep in step , and it 's obvious he does n't trust me to keep the faith . So we go out together , and sure enough I catch my cleats in the mat and spoil his exit . " Barbara sighed and rolled the Levis and stuck the needle under the threads of a spool . She said , " I wish I was a man and got to meet interesting people . Now would you like to hear about my day ? At nine-fifteen Louise and Dolly had a fight over the things Sabrina gave them yesterday and I had to separate them for an hour . At ten the dishwasher overflowed and spewed suds all over the kitchen . At eleven I discovered we were out of butter and lettuce and you had the car . At eleven-thirty  --  " " Peace , " he said . " Peace , perturbed spirit . How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " All right . I guess I should give him some other kind of exercise than practicing pushups against my kiddlies . " " Kiddlies ? " " I said kiddlies , didl't I ? " she said . She stood and smoothed the maternity dress across her front . Her eyes met Leonard 's , and she laughed.  |p182LIVER  let the silence extend itself , looking back at his motherwith a controlled absence of impatience or rancor . The mulish , pebbled tightening of the chin meant that she was feelingbalked or rebuked . A dim pink showed in her cheeks . The secretary , apparently not sure whether to go or stay , had poured his tea and then gone over by the windows . The afternoon behind her hazed her head and shoulders with gold ; the back of her neck looked as fuzzy and soft as a pussywillow . When she saw him looking , the easy flush rose in her throat and cheeks . But not confusion , he assured himself . Complexion , not confusion . She struck him as a girl who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was riding , you would not see daylight between it and her . Presumably she had felt his remarks as partly a criticism of herself , and that was all right too . It would n't hurt her to be a little off balancefor a change . In his controlled , pleasant voice , he said , " Mother , do n't be absurd . I 'm not accusing you of extravagance , or trying to put you on an allowance . I 'm only saying that the expenses of this place are getting so high we ought to talk them over . " " Are there any more expenses than there have . . . always been ? " " No more people , no . Just everything costs more . Taxes double every few years , wages are three times what they were in 1940 . You knowp183what the monthly payroll comes to , your house and my house and the grounds ? " His mother put her fingers against her trembling mouth ; he half expectedher to stamp her foot . " I should think it petty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I should think we are not in danger of becoming insolvent . " " No , just in danger of sleeping past our station . " Helen Kretchmer murmured something and moved toward the door . Oliver acknowledged with his eyes the discretion that prompted her , as well as the smoothness of the way she moved . She had a molded , muscledlook like a well-shaped mare . He looked back at his mother . " I 've just been going over the accounts . Nine gardeners , a driver , a secretary , a butler , a cook , and a maid , and at my place a cook and a maid . Altogether , just about five thousand a month . Ten of those people we also house , and seven of them we feed . We maintain six cars and two trucks . It 's about time we asked ourselves how long we can support all that goes along with thirty acres and a castle . " " They increase in value all the time . " " What good is that ? Unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But we still qualify as a ... ranch , and many expenses can be deducted . " " Two acres of pears , " Oliver said . " Believe me , I stretch those as far as they 'll stretch . But you do n't justify a five-thousand-a-month payrollon two acres of pears . " His mother 's hands rubbed and rustled in her lap , then hung and flexed beside the chair . He saw her thoughts working outward , stiffeningher neck and her long , shaking head . Her lips came together in a parody of firmness that exasperated him . " I 'm sure I do n't understand why you accost me this way , " she said . " There are no unnecessary persons on the place . Do you want me to . . . economize ? " " Look , Mother , you do n't know what 's been happening . What was a dollar is a quarter now . The only things you can do in this market are to speculate on the future earnings of common stocks or play real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there 's only a dribble of income above expenses , and you ca n't do the second unless sometime you 're willing to sell . "  |p184Her  hands hung down , unflexed ; her clouded eyes watched him with suspicion . " You have some proposal . " " I might have a half dozen proposals . But we ca n't just sit . " Timing , he had told himself before he started in on this , was most important . You aimed yourself like a torpedo boat and at precisely the right minute you let fly . And sometimes you bluffed in one direction and came in at the last second in another . He said casually , " I suppose we could sell some of the excess acreage of this place . That 's what a lot of people have done . " Her eyes looked absolutely white . " Subdivide ? " Crossing his legs , Oliver set his cup on the teacart . Pleasantly he said , " No more than twenty acres , maybe . You could get forty thousandan acre . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days . " " Oh , no , " she said as if her wind had been knocked out . " No . " " You 'd rather dwindle . " " Do n't we simply remain ? " " We remain till costs and taxes whittle us away . " As if looking for support , she glanced to both sides . " I could n't think ... Sell off part of the estate ? Surround ourselves with little .. . neighbors . . . people we do n't even know ? " Her snobbery was so unconscious it was innocent , and it gratified him because he had been counting on it . He said , " I would n't like it any better than you would , but I 'm telling you , it 's time to do something . We have to make more or spend less . If you want to live at your present level I 've got to have either land or some free capital to work with . Between you and that white elephant of a trust , Collier and I are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't agree to what 's necessary . " " I will never agree to . . . sell off part of the estate , no . " " Or anything else . " " Have you proposed anything else ? " One for you , Mother , Oliver thought . He said , " Give me your power of attorney and I wo n't have to bother you . I can make a little deal here and a little deal there and that 's all I 'd need . " " You want my power of attorney so you can subdivide ? "  | " No . Give me that and I would n't need to touch this place . " " What would you do ? " " Whatever 's necessary . " He hunched down , squinting quickly at her face : still mulish and suspicious . At once he changed direction . " There 's something else , something I 've mentioned before . These charities of yours . I 've been adding them up . If I had what you 've given to your committees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have built it into a million dollars . " That brought her head up . Snort fire , he thought , paw the ground . She said , " I have never given to a cause I did not think worthy . I 'm surprised you should suggest I might become . . . small . " " I 'm not suggesting anything . I 'm only saying that if I had that much free capital I would n't be bothering you now . " " I think you were suggesting that I . . . turn them away . " " I 'm dead sure some of them should be turned away , but I never suggested it . I only suggested you look closer before you shell out . Or set yourself a flat sum , twenty or twenty-five thousand a year if you want to feel that noble , and stay within it . Even if you just made sure you only donated to things that are legitimate and deductible it would help some . But somehow get a lid on . And also give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little money . If you did that you could double your charities without hurting anything . " Quiet and reasonable , he slid down in the loveseat . The midsummerafternoonsun outside flickered and sifted through the oaks and scatteredhalfway down the long room . Everything around Oliver reminded him of the inertia he had to overcome . The furniture was the same old ornate wicker that had furnished the tearoom in the Nahant house . Because the Nahant house had fronted on the sea , and had had a vast window to view it through , this tearoom had the same window , though it looked out only into lawn and oaks . Because in the Nahant tearoom there had been a brass telescope through which the family and guests had watched seabirds on the buoys , the same brass telescope stood on its mount here , ridiculously aimed out into the liveoaksfifty feet beyond the glass . His mother watched him with an expression of furtive dismay , and in irritation he stood up , walked to the telescope , and put his eye to thep186eyepiece . The crotch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow . In the crotch was a small fold or pocket , and from the fold , as he watched , popped out a small sharp bill , a lively gray shape . A wren . He made a mental note to have Jameson do some surgery on that tree . Oaks that got over-watered as these did grew too fast and were likely to fall of their own weight , simply collapse some morningand with a slow soft concussion lay their tons of limbs on the lawn . And a hole like the one the wren was nesting in would catch water , rot , and weaken the tree . When he took his eye from the cool brass , his mother 's face was still turned toward him . " I am trying to understand what it is you want . " He reminded himself to be pleasant and controlled . In most things , his mother liked to be bossed and liked to unload responsibility , but if she thought her personal security was threatened she could pinch down like an abalone to a rock . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the simple document that would free his hands . Ominously she said , " Oliver , my dear , I . . . think you have some scheme in your head . " " Would you like me to bond myself ? " he said bitterly . " Then could I be trusted to handle your affairs ? If not , you 'd better get a new manager . " " My dear , you know  --  " " All I know is I ca n't do it if I have to come to you de novo on every little transaction . Suppose you had another stroke , or died . Can you even imagine what a mess you 'd leave things in ? " " My will is . . . in order , " she said . Her mouth was slightly open , and trembling ; her eyes begged him . She did not like to discuss death . But though he might upset her , he had not persuaded her . She wanted not the slightest change , she willed to remain immovable in transplanted New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power that would let her do so . " Of course your will is in order , " he said . " The trust is in order , too , tied up so tight Houdini could n't untangle it until you die , and after that not even Houdini could keep the bureaucrats from gobbling most of it . Do you have the remotest idea what the . . . blasted confiscatory estate taxes would do to us ? That 's why I want your power of attorney  --  to take advantage of the boom so that when they cut us in half we 'll still be as big as we are now . To keep even you have to move , Mother ! You ca n't just hang onto property . They 'll tax you out of it . " " So it is some sale you want . " Oliver tossed up his hands , shoved them down into his pockets , strode up the room six steps and back again . He spun the telescope and looked through it backward . Far , far down the receding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idol  --  the goddess who insisted that everything come to a dead stop . She said , " Oliver , you know I do n't . . . wish to hamper you . I appreciatewhat you do . But you and I want different things . You 're aggressive , you do n't like . . . simply to enjoy things . You want to buy and sell . You 're like Uncle Bushrod , he was always deep in some scheme or other , Mexican silver mines and things . You will have .. . full control soon enough . Do let me have . . . my last years free of worry that you might . . . subdivide ! " " I give up , " Oliver said . He came behind her and laid a hand on her shoulder ; he could have crushed the bones under the white blouse like dry weeds . Strangely they moved him ; she was getting old , and you forgot , seeing her putter around playing golf every day , how frail she was . And she had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that behind her stubbornness now ? And yet he could not afford to let her have her way . He said , " Look , forget the power of attorney if it bothers you that much . But give me just one thing . I 'd like to develop the Woodside land . " He felt in her fragile bones how she took that in , first as a hope , an escape from his first proposal , and then as a possible trap . " You do n't need that for your personal comfort ! " he said . " That 's only raw land . You bought it for forty-five thousand and I could sell it for nearly three million tomorrow . I can organize a development corporation and make twice that . " " Houses ? " she said faintly . " Little . . . ranch houses on that lovely hill ? " " How long has it been since you 've been down there ? Minna may ride there ten times in a year . The kids hardly use it at all any more , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A family picnicp188once a summer . You could keep some acreage if you wanted . Keep twenty acres along Canada Road . But open up the rest , the freeway 's coming right past it . " His mother rose , saying shakily , " I . . . had other plans for it . " " What ? Build a country place ? I 'll give you your choice of lots . " " No , I ... " He planted himself before her , prying to know what she was faltering about . But she escaped him . Shaky-lipped , she said , " Please , you have . . . upset me . I want to . . . go to my rooms . " " Mother , this ca n't wait , honestly . Will you give me or my corporationan option on that land  --  at least three hundred and eighty acres ? " But she groped and fumbled away so that he took her arm , afraid she would fall . " Please , " she said . " I shall . . . have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the drain . " He was walking beside her , attentive and angry . Her palsied head turned and the opaque watery blue eyes looked into his with withering shrewdness . " Does it ? " she said . Grimly smiling , a Disney wolf that had missed its spring , he escortedher to her room , rang for Bernadette , stooped to kiss the withered cheek . Sitting on the edge of the bed , his mother looked at him accusingly . " Think hard , will you ? " he said . " This is important . " Down the hall Helen Kretchmer 's door stood open . She sat brightly smiling behind her typewriter , and as he paused she said , " Is Mrs. Hutchens all right ? Does she need me ? " He stepped into the room , once his own bedroom , now joined to another bedroom and bath and used as an office . Anger and frustrationstill tightened the tendons of his fingers . He said , " She 's all right except she 's out of her mind . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the back of her neck . The hair was short , and for all he could tell , naturally curly , the kind of mop that could be shaken but never got much out of place . With her athletic figure , her pale blondness , she looked like Miss Minneapolis Milling Industry . " What ? " she said uncertainly . He stepped past the typewriter table and with his spread hand took her by the back of the neck . Steering her , he walked her to the win/dows . She did not resist , but only looked at him astonished out of the corners of her eyes . He said , " Look . You like your job , do you ? " " Very much . " Her neck felt firm and strong and soft-skinned under his fingers . He squeezed , and then suddenly fury was in his hands ; he tightened his grip and saw fear come into her eyes . She bent away . He relaxed his clutch but kept his hand on her neck . For a blind second there he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it ? " he said . Perhaps it had not been fear at all he had seen in her eyes ; certainly there was none now . She turned against the pressure of his hand . Almostscornfully she said , " Are you firing me ? " " I do n't think so . You 're a poor girl , are you ? Need all the money you can make ? " Now she gave him a curl of red lips . " Heaven will protect me . " Oliver began to smile too . " I think it will . You might hold your job . You might even get a raise . Listen . If Mother says anything to you about me selling some Woodside land , you think it 's a good idea . Peoplehave to have homes . The land sits there eating up taxes . It 's time it was developed . Got that ? " Her hunching blue look might have meant anything , and yet he would have bet on her . Like a serving maid making a prissy mouth before the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking me to do anything she would n't like . " " You know the score , " he said . " If she wants to keep up a palace  --  and that includes you  --  she has to agree to some sensible management . Collier is in favor , I 'm in favor , now I want you to be in favor . Okay ? " Hunched against the gripe on her neck , she looked at him sideways . A slow , warm , unhurried stir began in him . He said to himself , Why in hell have n't I been doing more about this ? The whites of her sidewardeyes were very clear , the iris a pure Dutch blue . For a moment they stood with their noses no more than ten inches apart . Then Helen spun away . Her transparent skin warmed with the easy flush . Her cool voice said , " Thank you , yes , I 'll remember . " Stooping forward , looking in as she passed , Bernadette went heavily past the door . " You 're all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . right ! " Her eyes didp190not go down . They followed him to the door , and were on him as he went out . " Remember ! " he said around the jamb , but got no answer . At the foot of the stairs he was stopped by Lizardo  --  and that was another thing . Sabrina ought to have her head examined , getting that familiar with a servant . He 'd get too much into the family and he 'd have to go , or else he 'd be found foxing or finessing somebody on his own hook . Smuggling in Sabrina 's whisky was only a beginning . Darling . Good Christ . " What ? " he said . " Telepone , " Lizardo said . " Doct ' Castro . " Oliver took it in the library , picking up the telephone after one look of angry distaste at the signs of MacDonald 's labors and one sniff at the taint of cedar oil and beeswax on the air . " Burke . Hi . " " Hello , " said Burke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if you know where Sabrina is . " Oliver looked up at the ceiling . The minute a man got caught in what Burke was caught in he even began to sound like a cuckold . " God , no , " he said . " That 's a hard question , these days . She told me to say she was going to stay with Addie McAllister . " " I 'm at Addie 's now . She has n't been here since lunch Saturday . " " How about the hotel or one of the motels ? " " I 've checked them all . " " She said something about renting a Hertz car . Try there ? " " Both in Carson and in Reno . She has n't rented one . " " Oh , fine , " Oliver said . A concentration of irritations and frustrationsshook him for a second like a tree in a blast . Of all the things he did n't need , the least necessary was a cops-and-robbers search of Nevada for his berserk sister . " Goddamn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was full of the love of cottonwood leaves and talking about disappearing into the desert for ten years . She might have , I suppose  --  she 's crazy enough to be camped out in some wash in the Bullfrog Hills . " " I 've been trying the real-estate offices , but no luck there either , " Burke said . " She called me about ten Saturday night and was talking about buying a ranch . "  | " She was singing that song to me too . Health , the outdoor life , animals , no more cocktail parties or bridge luncheons . " " Yes , " Burke said , " but where is she ? " Oliver said what he thought was true . " I expect she 's out in some sagebrush joint playing Emma Bovary before an audience of barflies , if you really want to know . I gather you did n't go for the ranch idea ? " " There are certain limits , " Burke said . " Then she 's probably in some desert garden eating worms . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she drunk ? " " Maybe a little . Maybe later a lot , if I know her . She 's been pretty upsetabout something . Maybe you know . " He listened carefully . After a moment the wistful cuckold : " Was she alone ? " " She was passionately alone , " Oliver said . " I offered to stay with her but her soul craved solitude . " The gust shook him again ; he damned all women to hell . " Look , boy , Mendelsohn was n't around . I doubt if he 's with her now . " With his eyes on MacDonald 's sheet-draped table and careful piles of books , he listened . The voice was dry . " Oh . You know about that . " " She talked to me about it . But I think it 's all kaput . " " That 's what she told me . " A pause . " That does n't tell us where she is , " Burke said . " If I thought he was with her I would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer joint in the valley . Now I do n't know whether to raise a search party , or go to the police , or what . " Oliver drew his chest full of cedary , waxy air and let it out slowly . " I should n't think you 'd want to go bleating around Nevada , Has anybodyseen my wife ? ' Would you ? " " I guess my embarrassments are n't the important thing right now , " Burke said . " Something 's happened to her . This is all so completely unlike her . " " Not so unlike , " Oliver said , " and for God 's sake let 's not get noble . " He made in his mind certain calculations and , irritably , some postponements . " Look , " he said , " tell Addie just enough so she wo n't talk . I 'll get Harrington or some other peekhole detective and catch the firstp192plane to Reno . I 'll telephone you from the airport just before we leave , so you can meet us . Where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ... quite like this private eye business , " Burke said . " Balls . Would you prefer going to the cops ? How 'd you like the headlines from that kind of search party ? " " That 's not the important thing . She may be in trouble . " " It 's important enough , " Oliver said . " Even if you 'd like those headlines fine , I would n't , and neither would Mother . I 'll call from the airport . " " All right , " Burke said reluctantly . " If I was only sure she was perfectlysafe , you would n't find me pursuing her like a  --  " " But you 're not sure , " said Oliver . " I am , but you 're not . After about two hours , you 'd better stick in your room for my call . " He hung up , and for several seconds sat drumming his hard fingerendson the desk . He cursed his sister systematically as an emotional fool . He wished he had muscled her into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she probably would have waited for a chance and jumped out on her head at seventy miles an hour . When she got in one of these moods , she would do anything to demonstrate how shatteredshe was.  |p193TxE  FEEL of smooth dark motion broke . She was jerked forward and back and joggled half awake . She heard the engine sputter and then , faintly creaking , they had coasted to a stop , and a silence like feathers began to drift around her ; she beganonce more to tilt over into unsupported fall . A pounding broke in , a voice grated . She came back a long way from exhaustion , apathy , sleep , space , death , wherever she had been , to see the Member from Petaluma leaning , glaring at the gasoline gauge and knocking with the heel of his hand against the cowl . There was a greenish , pre-dawn light . Outside the car there were pines . The Member from Petaluma swore sullenly and unbelievingly . All the elaborate pantomines and the vaudeville routines had been worn off him ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revels . He looked jowly and mad , and his stale night-time breath filled the car . " Where are we ? " she said . " How the hell would I know ? " the Member said . " Twenty halfassedmiles from anywhere . Somewhere out along beautiful Tahoe , the Lake of the Sky . " He climbed out and slammed the door and stood looking uncertainlyp194up and down the road . His sport shirt was pleated into wrinkles across the small of his back . He looked at his watch . Behind him the roadsidewas bulldozed bare clear to the edge of the pines . The tips of the trees all wore extensions of new light-green growth . She could smell the quiet , and the duff of the forest floor . " Do you want me to do something ? " she said . The Member looked in the window , opened his mouth , and shut it again . Slamming his palm against the fender , he stared sulkily up the highway . Sabrina rolled her head and looked the other way , down past a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to the misty far shore , with its rim brightening to sunrise . Her head rolled back and her eyes met the Member 's , glazed and streaked as marbles . " Why do n't you stay right here and immerse , for Christ sake , " he said , and started off up the road . But in a moment he came back , and , glaring at her accusingly , took the car keys . Without lifting her head from the seat back she watched him lurch away up the shoulder of the highway . Then she closed her eyes , and when she looked again there was only the curving road and the line of white posts and the pines . The moment she pushed herself erect in the seat her head began to pound . Her mouth was woolly . The front of her dress was unbuttoned , and when she started to fasten it she found the brassiere undone too . Her whole body winced in a numb , unbelieving shudder . Had she , with that animal ? Trying to clear her mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , groping back through the long blurred ugly dream . How much was dream , and could be awakened from , and how much was reality of an unbearable kind ? And how long had that night been ? Her mind teemed and swarmed , and she sat with gritted teeth , letting the clearer images boil out toward the edge of memory like trash in a boiling spring . Bars and gambling houses , several , perhaps many , in Carson , Reno , around Tahoe . Once she had fallen in with acquaintainces from San Francisco who were worried about her , and fed her , and said they would take her home . But she had hidden in the women 's room until they faded , got lost , anyway were gone . She hadp195stood against the rails of crap tables until her hips were sore . Upwellingmemory overflowed with reaches of white-lined green baize , with lights , eyes , the lick of dealers ' rakes , the staring faces of dice . In the chilly car she shivered her shoulders suddenly together , sickened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk , drunk . How long ? A night and a day ? Another night ? She did not remember eating anything except the charred steak the San Francisco party had insisted on ordering for her , and that she had barely touched , drinking double old-fashioneds and laughing all the time . She did not remember sleeping at all , though she must have , somewhere . The shudder went through her again . She stared out at the empty arc of road and the absolutely motionless pines . Somewhere , somehow , into that spiteful debauch had come the Member from Petaluma , a creature of fable or farce . She had recognized him at once as someone she was looking for . Multiplied in reflecting surfaces of metal and glass , he hung in her memory like twenty identical jack-o-lanterns . Oh , she had fallen upon him . Before five minutes had passed they were collapsing with mirth . He had a ponderous deadpan soggy-drunk approach that struck them both as incomparably witty . Out of a blur of light and color he came looming , confidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  What I ca n't unnerstan ' , how we happen to get together ? Splendid thing , ca n't unnerstan ' it.  --  I was out looking for men to match my mountains.  --  Assolutely astonishing . That you should fin ' the one man .  --  There 's a divinity doth shape our ends.  --  Ha ! May I pay you a serious complimen ' ?  --  Would I have to stand up and turn around ? Laughter . They hung on each other . He was a dumpy man in a loud sport shirt . His throat and arms were hairy , and he had a bronchial coughing laugh that purpled his face and left him staring glassy-eyed , wheezing at intervals , patiently waiting for the consequences of her wit to pass.  --  Never fin ' a girl like you in place like this . Hardly believe it . You min ' saying again how we happen to meet ?  |  --  My psychoanalyst told me to go out and in the destructive element immerse.  --  Oh now hey . No destructive elemen 's here , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen thousan ' white leghorns but when I 'm on party I know how to ack . Uh ? What is this , destructive elemen 's ? He stared in upon her , wheezing . Behind or before and beside his face in the continuous filmstrip of phantasmagoria she saw her own . She had been watching herself while she laughed with him . Once her face looked back at her from the round of a glass with hopeless , openmouthedterror , and it seemed to her , thinking about it , that just then she had had to force herself almost sober in order to go on with the antics of drunkenness . There was another time , clearly remembered , when she looked at the Member and saw him with ass 's ears . He mugged at her , and she reached a fairy hand to touch his red face with love . Sometime she must have slept , for how could anyone have kept it up without passing out ? She had been out on her feet half the time . There were great absences in her memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he stamped away . It destroyed every notion she had of herself ; she could have lifted her face and screamed . To be , by despair or spite or self-loathing or anything else , so totally transformed . To lie down with pigs , to be pawed , and perhaps worse , by an animal like that . The only thing that gave her half a hope was that he had gone away furious . And yet even if the worst had happened , it was not so bad as that telephone call . " Excuse me , " she said to him at some point , " I want to call a friend . " " Good idea , " the Member said . " Call one myself . Haw-haw . " Swimming below the breakers of noise , they moved effortlessly past crap tables and a chuck-a-luck cage . A change girl crowded past them leaning backward against the silver pregnancy of her tray , and Sabrina dropped dollars and took quarters and dimes in exchange . Through the open doors she caught a glimpse of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multicolored from multicolored parked cars , and thought how not so long ago all this had been deep mountains , softlyp197roaring with silence like a seashell . Now all the beauty of Hollywood and Vine . Vulgarity , vulgarity . In desperation she reached out and took hold of the loose tails of the Member 's sport shirt . He pranced , and she drove him . Immersing , she plummeted like a stone . The four-way clock hanging from the rustic ceiling beams said 3:42 . Touching the faces of slot machines to keep the floor steady , she made the corner where signs said He 's and She 's . The Member winked and disappeared . She went on , wearing on her face a smile that felt like a swelling , and feeling in her mind a . . . could it have been a hope ? Before the telephone booths , suddenly shaking-handed , she dropped some of her change on the floor , and a man on the way to the He 's stooped and rose again , handing her two quarters . She went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as she stood waiting in the booth it began to tip smoothly into a continuous turning fall . Weightless in space , she knew neither up nor down nor sideways ; and feeling or dreaming how desperately she needed solidity , she opened her eyes and fixed them with hard effort until in an unexpected quarter the steadying chrome ring of the telephone swam into focus . That too could have been reality . But she did not remember calling . And was it reality when the sharp , frightened woman 's voice cried out , " Hello ! Hello ! " ? Dreaming or waking , " Mr. Mendelsohn , please , " she said . " But he 's asleep ! What is it , at this hour ? Who is this ? " " I 'd like to speak with him , if he 's there . " From her toppling suspension it seemed she listened . Whisperings . Then his voice , clogged and breathless . Through all the narcotic layers that muffled her fall  --  for she fell , it seemed now , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear , perhaps , of her . " Yes ? Hello ? " " Hello , darling , " she said . " I wanted to hear you , I 've been going through hell  --  " " What ? " His voice was so hoarse and flat she would not have recognized it . " What is this ? Is it some crumby joke ? " " You know it 's no joke , " she said . " Is she right there ? Maybe that 's better , maybe it 's better she knew about us. . . . "  | " Well , you had your joke , whoever you are , " Bernard said loudly . " You woke us up at four in the morning . Very funny . " Click , she was hanging to a dead wire . She toppled , toppled , toppled . Once , from the rim of the Canyon de Chelly , she and others had rolled a bare dead tree into the canyon , and thrown themselves flat and hung their chins over the cliff and seen it fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a match , until it jumped into fragments at the foot , and a long time afterward the unwarrantably solid whon2p ! of the tiny crash came up to them on their brink of stone . She fell like that in the booth , but interminably , without the comfort of an end , for the bottom fell away beneath her as fast as she fell into it . After light years of that , she came to herself with sweat starting all over her body and her hand clenched around the receiver . Shivering , she hung it up , found her handkerchief , patted her face and throat . When she stepped out of the booth , the Member from Petaluma started from beside the door of the He 's and greeted her with warmth . He , at least , was no dream . " Hey , you really were calling somebody . Thought you were kidding . " He loomed comradely , his hand around her arm . " Tell me again , " he said , " how the great flat feet of Fate led us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else you call at four bells in the a.m . " Swallowing her nausea , she yanked his shirt tails . Dear Vulgarity , dear Caliban , dear Bottom , you will do as well as anything else to shatter on . Meantime I have to get used to the image my face throws on a mirror . Then everything was sick and dizzy . She said , " Let 's get out of here ! " Gallant , he offered his elbow . " Assolutely . Any particular elemen ' you wan na immerse in ? " " Just let 's get out . " " Drink firs ' ? " " Let 's get out ! " His face looming multiplex through the gelatinous air , he steered her toward the door . Sitting in the dead car , Sabrina began to comb her hair , and before she thought , she had tipped the mirror to see . It gave her back herp199distracted gaze ; her eyes stared and stared until she had to look away . The brightening sky was not a finite dome , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the planet Venus that still had strength to glow above the eastern rim was not set in the sky but adrift in it  --  she saw past it . Feelings that she had not known since adolescence rose in a cold tide and swallowed her as the space between the stars might swallow a grain of dust . What folly , what posturing , for one grain of dust to fall with so much anger and pride and self-pity , and to imagine that its selfdestructionmade a track like Lucifer 's , and that there would be some bottom , and at the bottom a crash , and that from the crash a sound of meaning would go up . What did she want , lamentations ? Did she want to be brought home on a shutter so that Burke could throw himself weeping on one end and Bernard fall on his knees at the other ? And yet with almost the same impulse of thought that lashed herself , she was asking them , Is it messy enough to prove I was serious ? Could there be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had jumped under a train or stolen the apothecary 's arsenic ? She opened the car door and stepped out . The air was pure and keen , a patch of grass running down the slope was blue with wet . In the gray clarity she felt furtive , a slug uncovered by a kicked stone . Against the pounding in her head and the insistent hammer of guilt in her pulse , she closed her eyes , and in the clenched darkness of her mind she simply hung on . After a while she said , from a thick throat , Nobody , not anybody , would believe what 's happening to me . If Burke had valued her in the slightest . If he had ever valued her . If anyone had ever valued her ! My God , must a person go crying through the world for love , and be turned away ? She moved like an old woman a few steps along the road , and the moment she looked she recognized where she was . Ahead of her a graveled drive looped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a horned point thick with pines , then a meadow ; and in the meadow was Charlie Grulich 's boarding kennel . Three times she had boarded Fat Boy there ; last summer Grulich had helped her prepare Fat Boy for a show.  |p200At  once , without a second 's pause , she started down the drive . She still wore the flat heels she had worn  --  how long ago ? Two days ? Three ?  --  to the road races , but even so she turned her ankles on the stones . At the sound of a car she hid behind a tree until it had passed . The edge of the sun brimmed over the lake 's great bowl and dazzled in her eyes . The amethyst water disappeared in light , at her feet the pine-needled ground was suddenly gilded . Her nose took in the medicinal witch-hazel smell of mountain misery and the lake-edge smell of wet stones and roots . A Canada jay squawked off through the trees . Far off , an outboard exploded in a hot snarl and was throttled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she heard the slam of a door , a whining and barking of many dogs , and the growl of a man 's voice talking and crooning in an unimpatient monotone . She hurried past the gate in the woven wire fence and on around the house , and there in the flat gilding of sunlightwas Charlie Grulich unlatching doors and letting dogs out into the run.  |p201ARD  MACDONALD awoke and lay listening for the sounds that traditionally meant morning , and heard none of them . No roosters , no milkhorses , no buses or early-to-work trucks rumbling across the bridges of sleep , no chirp of sparrow or hammer of woodpecker , no curtains moving in light auroral breezes with a slur of fabric on wood or screen . What Greenwood Acres awoke to were thesounds of the over-crowded future , where what is good is what annoys least . Morning in Greenwood Acres was zoned out . No rooster crowed because it was forbidden to keep chickens in Greenwood Acres  --  or chinchillas , or peacocks , or any other form of livestock . The paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be flopped , or added to , or reversed , or rotated on the lot , no one of the two hundred sixty examples of that design had a porch . The milk came only every other day , and not early in the morning , and not by horse , and not in glass bottles ; most housewivesbought it at the supermarket and saved a cent a quart . No sounds of building rebuked the sloth of sleepers , because in a tract developed by mass methods for maximum profit and utility there was no room for more building . Two boys who had built a tree house in a big oak that had somehow escaped the bulldozers had been madep202to take it down because they did not have a building permit . No kids were playing baseball in vacant lots : there were no vacant lots , and some day both big-league baseball and the American soul would suffer for that lack . No trees gave back oxygen to the air and tickled the nostrils of sleepers with freshness , and the meadowlarks that had used to sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were thousands of saplings , all planted to a plan , there was nothing much that a bird could make use of . Mosquito abatement had forestalled the thin evil whine to which dwellers in less fortunate places might awaken . The housefly , with his droning and his butting against the screens , had been zoned out with the horses and cows . No traffic disturbed the rest of last-minute sleepers because Greenwood Acres had been carefully designed withoutthrough ways . It lay sinusoidal , looped back upon itself , celled with little family units and patios behind screening fences , as peripheral and  --  the thought was not unheard of among its citizens  --  as subject to stoppage and infection as a vermiform appendix . Nevertheless , the true social shape of the future . Exclusiveness with crowding , Leonard said to himself , and turned his head cautiously and saw that Barbara was still asleep . He reflectedthat awakening in this house was a little like awakening in your coffin , for the functional design was not only functional , it was all but hermetic . Plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builder could sell tract houses without picture windows  --  but it was mainly fixed glass that looked out into the fenced patio , and not much of it was in the bedrooms . Why should it be ? The first thing newcomerslearned was that the California night air was more destructive to pharynx , tonsils , and sinuses than chlordane was to ants . Hence no nostalgic but unhygienic New England or Midwestern or Southern open windows ; no matinal movements of curtains ( no curtains ) ; no shivery lung-filling drafts of new day . Here the householder opened his eyes to the dusk of drawn drapes , to walls and ceilings of natural plywood ( no maintenance costs ) , and to the many-times-rebreathed air in which he had lain down . In Scandinavia or Scotland , Leonard sometimes maintained in argument , people cursed with a gloomy climate learned long ago to touchp203their lives with crimson and gilt , to reflect and make use of what little light they received . But it had not yet occurred to Greenwood Acres that it could learn that trick , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its plywood sleeping cubicles it lived with gloom . It would not tolerate hearing this . Its people thought of themselves as sun-dwellers , and had tans to prove it . Carefully he folded back the covers and stepped out on the cool asphalt tile . For a second , head tilted , he listened to the airless silence . Stepping into shorts and Levis , he watched Barbara 's bulbous unmovingshape , and heard her breathing sweet and soft . She had had a restlessnight ; let her snooze . Barefooted , bare-chested , he went into the bathroom and stealthily closed the door . The bathroom , landlocked , with only a plastic skylight bubble for a window , was even more hermetic than the bedroom , damp and breathless and hung with drip-dry laundry . He moved quietly among light clinkings . Shaving , he confronted himself . Black hair sprouted springy from his chest and belly , with a line down the middle that divided him in halves . His wrists and forearms were thick and hairy , fuzz spread across his upper arms and shoulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ape , he said . He lathered his face and throat . Scraping with the razor , he leered into the mirror like a trapped ball player into the televisioncamera . You bet , he said , only way to get a decent shave . Barefootedhe capered . Down his right cheek he scraped a clean swath ; the mown skin looked shiny , almost opalescent . From the ape began to emerge , decorous , barbershop-smelling ( a he-man aroma ) , the householderof Greenwood Acres . Tiptoeing to the girls ' bedroom , he peeked in . Louise was only a tousle of pale hair on the pillow , but Dolly was awake , drawing on the air with a forefinger . She started to sit up , but with his finger on his lips Leonard nodded his head at Louise and then tipped it back toward the other bedroom . Tucking the corners of his lips up under his earlobes in an idiot grin , he tiptoed on past . It was stuffy in the entire house . He opened the front door , the half-door into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray morning overcast ; the air was chilly , with a faint sour smell of smog in it . Thep204lid of the garbage can was wet . From the patio came the kitten , to stand looking up at him soundlessly mewing . He stooped to run a hand along her back , along her tail , lifting her hind quarters off the floor . The refrigerator showed him an unopened package of bacon , a canteloupe , milk . In the cupboard a package of Zing informed him that all he needed to do was stir into boiling water , set aside a moment , and serve . Whistling between his teeth , he measured coffee into the percolator and turned on the burners under it and under the tea kettle . His bare feet , moving him along the counter , stepped into something sticky , and he went to the back door to scrape his sole on the cement step . The cat rubbed back and forth against his leg . " All right , all right , " Leonard said , and poured a saucer of milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , getting out bread for toast , he stepped in the saucer , and he was on his knees with a sponge when Dolly came in dragging her teddy bear . " Are you getting breakfast ? " she said . " Did you think I could n't ? " " Why ? " " Why what ? Why am I getting breakfast ? Because pretty soon you 're going to have a new brother or sister , and I 'm getting in practice for extensive fatherhood . Want to help ? " " I want strawberries and Cheerios for breakfast , " she said without a smile . " Petition denied . " Smoke accosted his nostrils , and he jumped to release the fuming toaster , whose pop-up did n't work . The toast , burned black , he dumped into the garbage pail . " Petition denied for these reasons , " he said to Dolly . " A , we have no strawberries for your Cheerios , and B , we have no Cheerios for your strawberries . You 're having Zing . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and when he moved she put her arms around his leg and moved with him , riding his instep . " Not the kind I make , " he said . " How about bringing in the paper ? " " I want some Cheerios . " " Listen , " he said , with her round silkyiead under his hand . " We'rep205giving the old lady her breakfast on a tray , as a surprise , and I ca n't do it without you . Suppose you get your slippers on , so you do n't get cold , and get the paper to put on her tray . " While he talked , her face puffed out at him , her eyes were squeezed down to glints . Then she exploded in a laugh and started running . " Shhh ! " he said through the pass-through . " Let 's not wake the customers . " He jumped to the smoking toaster . Burned black again . The tea kettle began to get its breath for a whistle . Leonard poured two cups of hot water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook salt over it , hesitated , shook again . Dolly came in with the damp paper . " Here , " Leonard said . He moved aside a pitcher , glasses , an unwashed broiler pan , a can of cocoa , a roll of waxed paper , and some other items to make room on the crowded counter . He got out their biggest tray and showed Dolly where to put the paper . " You 're the maid , " he said . " See if you can remember all the things like napkins and spoons . " The water in the saucepan was boiling . He poured in Zing , stirred wildly to keep it from boiling over , and yanked the pan off the flame when it boiled over in spite of him . A smell of outraged cereal arose . " Look , " he said to Dolly , who was laying spoons in a mathematicalrow on the tray , " see if you can toast some toast and keep from burning it , baby . I 've flunked twice . " With one eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found a net sack of oranges . The day was accelerating around him ; it was a juggling act to keep all the essentials in the air at once . Coffee , yes ; then down the burner some to keep it warm . It spit over its spouted chin at him when he had his back turned squeezing oranges . Zing  --  off the fire now , and safe . Sugar , cream  --  he steered Dolly to them and she got them on the tray . She wanted brown sugar on her Zing ; he found it for her . The smell of smoke swung him around . His round-eyed helper confronted him with a scorched finger in her mouth . " Sister , " he said , " you 're going to grow up as incompetent as your old man . On the ball , baby , what do you say ? Let 's see your poor finner . " He examined it , cured it with . a smack . Eventually there was cereal , coffee , orange juice , a cantaloupe cut inp206four . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of performance and personnel . He felt good . It tickled him to see Dolly putting the napkins in one corner of the tray and then , reconsidering , moving them to the middle , patting them smooth . His mind idled along while his hands jumped from job to job , and stumbling upon an old song , he fox-trotted around with it : " My pet , how I love her , My pet , thinking of her . . . " With the toaster filled for the fourth time , and his eyes glued on it , he sang , " I pet with nobody but " He flipped the toaster release . Too pale . Down again . " My pet . " Louise padded in with a knuckle in one eye and the kitten hanginglimp under one arm . " What 's the matter ? What 's burning ? " " Love like a burning city in my breast , " Leonard said . " Have you washed ? " He leaped . Ah , just in time . He said , " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around lightly , and then rouse up your angel mother and when all is ready you slip me the signal . " " Ow ! " Louise said . " You darn naughty kitty ! " The dropped cat slid behind the stove . Leonard stooped and kissed the clouded blue eyes . " You 're cranky from too much Fourth of July . Come on , Plumbbob , get ready , hey ? And a little brush on the hair . " He got another round of toast through the toaster , put butter and honey on the tray , and spooned out four bowls of cereal . Somewheredown by the bay , far-off , incongruous , peremptory , mournful , louder than usual under the overcast , a factory whistle blew seven o'clock . There was a sound of activity from the bathroom , the sandy hiss of water in the pipes . Leonard got two more slices through the toaster . Just as he was removing them , two brushed , shining , roundeyedfaces leaned , one above the other , around the doorjamb , mugging silently at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he hoisted thep207overloaded tray onto a backtipped palm and marched , barefooted , bare-chested , and hairy , into the bedroom , singing , " She 's so refined , sweet and kind , perfect gem . Has she got It ? Lots of It . Oh baby she 's got Them ... " The girls jumped around , yelling , " Surprise ! Surprise ! " Barbara , sitting up , scowled blackly . " Them ! What an omen to wake up to . " She smiled . " But I forgive you , you 're so sweet . Give us a kiss . " After a frantic sweeping aside of bottles , magazines , and clothes , he lowered the tray to the dresser . When their lips met she yanked the hair on his chest . " What makes you so sweet ? " " It 's me nature . How do you feel ? " " I must be sick , if I get breakfast in bed . " He went out and returned with a small tray that he put in her lap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blindly for things on it like someone groping for lost objects behind a bureau . While he sorted her out juice , melon , toast , cereal , and coffee , he said , " You were up and down a good deal last night . " " I could n't seem to get comfortable . " " I can stay home today , if you want . I do n't have to go to Mrs. Lofty 's . " " Oh , no . You go ahead . If I need anything I can call you . " " At least you 've got two superb helpers . " He got them seated on the foot of the bed and handed them orange juice and Zing . They gulped their juice , looked into their bowls , made identical faces , and laughed . " Let 's eat in here every morning , " Louise said . But Leonard looked around the tiny dark cell packed with double bed , dresser , bed table , and chair , and at his daughters spooning cereal and dripping milk on the spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifle confining , would n't you ? Of course when Mummy has this baby there 'll be more room . " " Honestly , " Barbara said , " what are we going to do ? We never have worked that one out . As long as he 's in a basket we can manage , but what about when he gets bigger ? " " He can sleep in my bed , " Louise said.  | " No , in mine ! " " Quiet , please , " Leonard said . " This is what we 'll do . We can either , in a dignified way , box in the carport for him when he gets too big for the house , or we can purchase a larger dwelling . How about something up on the hill , with a view of the bay and a patch of woods out behind full of horses and rabbit hutches and poison oak for the children ? " " Yes , please , Daddy ! And a swimming pool . " " First things first . First Mummy has this baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheering school board , and then we go to our favorite real-estate agent , a jovial , Santa Claus-like fellow , and we say , We 'd like a small estate , please . Something spacious , gracious , indoor-outdoor , for modern living . Because if we 're anything , we 're . . . gracious . ' What is it ? " Dolly stared with porridge on her chin . She giggled . " You 're all curly . " He looked down , clutched his naked chest , and rushed from the room . In a minute he came back in a clean T-shirt , mumbling apologies . As they ate in their mussed plywood box they heard Greenwood Acres empty itself . Voices , cars , the clicking sprockets and chains of bicycles , receded toward the gates and the SP station . By the time Leonard had rinsed the dishes and put them in the dishwasher , and had got into socks and shoes and a checked shirt , wives were beginning to return with the family cars . The house , wide open , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors . Somebody scolded somebody . The radio next door , tuned unneighborly loud , reported that the weather would be clear except for morning fog near the coast , westerly winds ten to eighteen miles an hour , high in San Franciscosixty-four , in San Mateo seventy-eight , in San Rafael eighty . Barbara sat enthroned in the cluttered bedroom . He liked her best just this way , without make-up ; her essential , even-tempered , placid sweetness was then undisguised . The skin under her eyes , slightly darkened , looked so petal-soft it tempted his fingers . For almost a minute he stood looking down at her . " You call me , " he said . " I wonder if you should n't have your bag packed , just in case . " " I 've had it packed for two weeks . "  | " All right . I just want you to live up to the solemnity of the occasion . " " You go ahead and worry , " she said . " It 's good for you . But do n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want it said I had my third child in a Chevvy that has n't been washed for a year and a half ? " " Criticism ? " he said . He bent and kissed her . Her brown eyes were very soft , very deep , amused , untroubled . " Take it easy , now . " " I will . Do n't drink too much orange juice . " He lifted and bussed his daughters . Before climbing into the old Chevvy he bent to look at the oil drip underneath it . Sooner or later he was going to have to put the old crock up on blocks and pull the rear main . He looked inside . Papers , dust , Dolly 's lost sweater , a political sticker he had been going to put on the bumper and not got around to , a loose speeder wrench , a sack of tire chains that had been in there since a ski week end late last winter . He took chains and wrench and sweater out , crumpled the papers and the bumperbanner , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he brushed off his clean Levis , checked his gleaming shoes , climbed in , and stepped on the starter . Sedately , shaved and laundered , his thinning hair bristling , he drove off toward Pyracantha Avenue and the main gate , satisfactorily later than the commuting slaves , but still in time to make the Hutchens door by eight o'clock . By suburban ways he reached the hurrying channel of El Camino , where he was stopped by a long red light . Ahead , back among the discreet patrician lanes , waited the world of Mrs. Howard King Hutchens . For all the resemblance it bore to his own , he might as well have been going to work for Harun al-Rashid . With his nose full of the exhausts of El Camino he thought of that dustless , purified , humidified air and that underwater quiet . To be involved in this solemn business amused him . Some morning he ought to arrive in a skin-diver 's mask . Dr. Jekyll , I presume . It is n't much , he said to himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the working conditions are n't so hot . But it 's a living.  |p210The  stream of cars slashed by , unbreachable . Then the red changed to yellow , the latecomers scooted through , a channel appeared . He gunned the old Chevvy across like the hosts of Israel before the waters could roll back again . As he drove along , already half metamorphosed , under the great gum trees , he said to himself that Mrs. Howard King Hutchens was something . She entered into this archive business as if it were an elopement.  |p211SOMETIMES  she got to help with little chores . She could hold a scared dog while Grulich removed a foxtail from ear or eye ; or she could bathe and strip some terrier out in the yard . That was a job she liked : at home she often took Fat Boy into the shower with her , and roughed him up with a towel afterward until he tore around the house shaking himself and rolling and running his face along the rugs . But here bathings and strippings happened only when someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant the loss of a friend . And there were great reaches of empty time . Sometimes she tried to read . Grulich was an amateur pot-hunter , and his parlor was full of mealing stones and Paiute baskets and the publications of the Bureau of American Ethnology . Selecting something more for its weight than its interest , she could go outside and let a few dogs into the exercise yard and sit down in the white coveralls Grulich had loaned her , and with her back against a tree consult the burial habits of the Mi-wuk . That way she could maintain her daytime apathy , built on the pretense that her stay here was a kind of convalescence . With Grulich she exchanged perhaps a hundred words a day . He was as taciturn as a stump ; at meals , if he looked at her at all , he lookedp212outrage and accusation : What are you doing in my house ? What do I get by letting you in ? Embarrassrnent , and the neighbors talking . The dogs would willingly have got mixed up in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept her here . Thank God a dog was without embarrassments , ambitions , moral judgments , responsibilities , or fear of what people said . If he loved you he licked your hand and lay down by you and came when you called , and if you went away he waited hopefully in the driveway until you returned . If you got angry with him or hurt him , he forgave you at once , unasked . Also , no matter how badly a bitch treated a dog , he would never fight with her . Uncritical love plus chivalry to females : where were you likely to find a man as decent as almost any dog ? But she did not pursue that ironic strain , or wallow in her own distress . More often than not she sat with her mind passive and nearly empty , in her lap a heavy book open to engravings of naked women gathering acorns or making soap of yucca root , and ran her hand absently over the ears and the blissful , blinking eyes of the red setter or the Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was another thing about dogs : they loved to be touched . Off in the blue daytime air was the pulse of the lake 's summer life , rising sometimes to the roar of a motorboat towing water-skiers past , falling sometimes to the fused murmur of the highway , the boats , passing airplanes , the noises of the lakeshore resorts . She could sit with her eyes out of focus , staring at the twiggy ground , and let her mind go slack and dreaming , and in that mood could hear , back of the healthy outdoor sounds , a throb that was compoundedof all the yells and groans and sighs of a vast hell . Dante , passing around the lake 's basin asking questions of these shades , would have found here the usual lustful ones , the avaricious , the gluttonous , the sinners through wrath , the flatterers and those who dealt in simony and barratry , the envious and the proud . But more likely , crowding around the traveler who spoke with a human voice , these Tahoe shades would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lust for kicks . They would have found Dante himself a sensation , and trampled one another for a sight of him : ap213freak of the moral intelligence . And they would have pointed out , and he observed , their special punishment , which was the same as their sin  --  to indulge themselves . The pleasure halls of their hell never closed , the neon burned twenty-four hours a day , dealers succeededone another in shifts , any hour was the hour for a drink . The food of hell was charcoal-broiled New York cuts and french fries ; the change girls were selected for their figures and probably for their complaisance . Panting , the Members from Petaluma drove through the neon-tinted murk screaming with laughter . Where they found quiet , they destroyed it ; where they encountered beauty they left their pleasure palaces or their beer cans . But where she sat it was quiet . For ten years she had gone through all those other circles herself , boredly or angrily or restlessly or spitefullysampling their sins and their punishments , and then in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a light bulb , she had betrayed Burke , her marriage , and herself . She sat now in the place reserved for traitors , and there , as her mother said , it was lonely and cold . One thing , she assumed , would reprieve her : the touch of unqualified love . But from whom ? How ? She had the dogs , and no one else . At night , when the lake 's hum broke down into single , far-heard voices or motor sounds , and stillness began creeping inward like nighttime animals edging closer to a sleeping camp , she hooked one of the dogs on a leash and walked him down along the shore . She told herself that whether she was involved in a cure or a punishment , there ought to be comfort in darkness , quiet , the cold wet fishy smell of the lake , the night sound of water on the beach , the companionship of a friendly little animal . But she resisted the comfort she went hunting . When at night she shed her apathy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was undergoing was neither punishment nor convalescence , but evasion . She could not pretend to herself that she was thinking anything out , or making a contrite peace with her own motives , or finding justifications for her disintegration , or arriving at any plan for her life . That sort of reconciliation would have to be built on the assumption that for every action there was a specificp214motivation , which once understood made everything balance out neatly : if B stood for boredom , N for neglect , D for a do-nothing tradition , I for instability , T for time , and C for conscience , thenBut what about the violence of her collapse , for which there was not only no adequate motivation , but very real and puritanical inhibitions ? What if , a normally intelligent , highly fortunate , reasonably sophisticatedwoman , you suddenly blew to bits , and nothing set you off but accident , and nothing steered you from then on but furious uncharacteristicfeelings like those that must drive the she-murderers of the newspapers ? What if all unexpectedly you found yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one hour you were frantic with lust for one man , and the next anguished with pity and duty for another , and the next wild with revenge against them both , and all the time full of desperate loathing for yourself ? What if your metabolism , personality , mind , changed suddenly as if you had been fed a horrible mess of personality-changing drugs , Miltown and Benzedrine , bolts and jolts , Spanish fly and whatever it was they were supposed to put in the men 's food in the army  --  saltpeter ? There was no equation that would make her understand herself . And anyway , what good would it do her to bring her own emotions under control when others , whose actions were out of her hands , continued to be motivated by coldness , suspicion , timidity , God knew what ? Renounce her desires , like a good girl ? She had been renounced , doubly renounced , and with reason . Halting the straining terrier with a pull on the leash , she sat on a stump , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all forest ; and in front the glimmering , misty , light-starred lake . It was a very big lake , a Shining Big Sea Water that reached to the far edge of the world , where it was fenced by mountains . Overhead there were stars , but in the south a lick of lightning showed the loom of thunderheads . The water was stealthy-still . It made only a tiny sucking , a sigh like breath , a lip and a lap against the shingle , and then stillness again . The air was tumid with coming rain.  |p215The  terrier came against her knee and she closed her fingers in his fur . Her other hand felt around on the ground until it found a pebble to flip into the water . The lonely , forgotten plunk brought the dog up quivering , sniffing and straining toward the lake , and she hugged his head against her leg . They heard the thin sounds of water lapping at the edge of a great stillness , and she thought that anyone , hearing that sound , might be reminded of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterhole a half million years ago might have cocked his head at it , obscurely knowing his source . The last survivor of a humanity that had destroyed itself might take what consolation he could from that watery promise of resurrection and renewal . Wade in ? said her mind , watching her brightly . Stand up right now and walk in ? The shoes would be full at once , then it would be cold around the calves , the coveralls clinging and motion difficult as the knees went under . Then water dragging at the thighs , the clothes very heavy now and the breath catching in the chill , cold gripping waist and breast until it lapped at the throat , the feet tiptoeingand the chin tilted to keep the mouth out . A last look at soft dark , soft sky , gathering storm , the lights along the shore . From behind her the anxious yip of the terrier , uncertain whether to follow . Then the settling of the heels , the relinquishing sag of the weight , the burying of the face , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending . So young , so unhappy . She would keep it in mind . The coveralls would be a good touch , a sort of sackcloth . And there should be incidental music : from a cottage not far away , where lovers were kissing and whisperona dark porch , a phonograph would be playing La Mer . She threw another stone . Her fingers , lifted from the needles and litter , smelled of earthy , moldy , aromatic things , penicillin , earth 's mysterious curatives . It was fantastic that after a week here she should still be swinging in so wide an arc . Having exhausted herself in a vulgar tantrum , a melodramatic outburst , a Walpurgisnacht ( give it a fancy name and it would n't sound so dirty , vengeful , and stupid as it really was ) she did not feel in the least steadied or healed . She only felt sickened ,  |p216and  she had no idea what medicine to take , for she diagnosed her sickness as herself . When she was quiet in her mind , the quiet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think and feel , as often as not she found growing in her an unreasonable and implacableconviction of wrong and hurt . And when she became aware of how she was twisting to throw the blame back on Burke 's chilliness or Bernard 's cowardice , then she retreated into the self-loathing and disgust which was her apathy 's truest center . Lord God , how to be ? A woman , a sack of organs , a creature whose center of gravity was in the pelvis , how did she justify herself when the pelvis proved unproductive ? Not with pleasure , for pleasure with Burke seemed increasingly less possible , and pleasure outside she had sampled to her sorrow : it lay like a colony of streptococcus in the throat of her conscience . Quit being a woman then , forget she was a walking womb ? Become some busy Neuter , lady executive or chairman of committees , put to what was called productive use the education that had been wasted on her ? The phrases for it came into her head , bitter as acid : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had found a doghouse . Charlie Grulich escaped from people and hid himself among dogs and ancient cultures . Why not she ? Become a goddess of fertility , learned in blood lines , steering by howeverlittle the history of living things ? Imagine ! they would say . She was wealthy , well-born , the world at her wish , and yet she chose to retire into the country and breed schnauzers . Ask her why schnauzers and she will reply with a smile that they are the most faithful of all dogs . But look at her hands , how brown . Look at her face , how serene . Yes ? her scornful mind answered her . Have n't you seen them around dog shows all your life ? How vicarious do you want to be ? They 're worse than the blue-ribbon horsey kind , worse than the promiscuous kind , worse even than the busy Neuters . Or more pathetic . The southward clouds had piled up , sneaking toward the zenith between flares of sheet lightning . Leaning from under the sprucep217tree 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way . A bright flash , like the cracking of a dish with light behind it , and this time a low roll of thunder . Assuming that her trouble involved more than a choice between two men  --  or the loss of both of them  --  and accepting such other whimsies of luck as a tipped uterus , then the problem clearly was to find something worth her commitment . Start at the top , the greater glory of God ? Hardly . One could abstractly comprehend the problem as a religious problem without being persuaded to denominational answers . If she wanted to do the work of a Poor Clare she would have to do it without the habit . Or pleasure , the glutting of the excitable organism with sensation ? That was the special sin of her class and her country , what occupied the Tahoe or California circle of Hell . But she herself had never had a gift for enjoyment ; pleasure had always left her uneasy ; her consciencealways got involved in it . When she jumped into the fleshpots , as last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So make a virtue and an existence out of pure discretion , take all things in moderation , exist by willed temperance  --  and for it , too ? All sins , said smug Bobbie and Leonard MacDonald , were sins of excess . They were so right . Even the examination of one 's personal difficultiesran at once toward excess , until the soiled conscience swam into mere spots before the eyes . She wondered bleakly what Burke was doing , and imagined him eating moodily and alone in the house they had shared . She could not believe that his self-righteousness would permit him to regret the choice he had made ; and yet she could not believe he was happy there , either . The house was hers as much as his  --  which was to say that it belonged to neither of them . Three times in eleven years she had redecorated it , trying to bend it into something personal , and every detail in it was of her choosing , and yet it had escaped her . Like everything else in her life it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could see Burke , for comfort 's sake , eating at the coffee table in the living room , or relaxing with a late highball in the patio ; and yet the livingp218room reached out behind him in shadowed spaces unfriendly to him as to her ; and upon the patio fell an invisible , dampening bloom of dew . The bowl cracked again , the thunder rumbled closer . It occurred to her , not for the first time , that she might try to get something out of talking to Grulich . At least he had made a sort of life that could be lived singly . But Grulich went around encased in his own silence like a deaf man , chewing on his dead pipe . He had sagging angrylookingGerman cheeks and he took no interest in human problems . He did not like humans , he liked dogs and dead cultures . The only reason he had ever let so ambiguous and dangerous a creature as herselftake refuge in his place was the reverence he had for Ch . Bernsdorffvon Bernsdorff , that product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a picture of Fat Boy on Grulich 's wall . Under the loose skin of the terrier 's neck she could feel the solid column of muscle . The image of Burke alone in their house was pitiful to her , and yet she knew what would happen if by any impulse of affection or magnanimity he should ask her to come back , and she should go . They would both try , they would will themselves toward consideration , she would try to be humble and he would try to forgive . But the tensions of their life would go on , the first time he had to choose between her and some patient he would choose the patient , both his self-righteousness and her conscience would lie in wait for some moment , and when the moment came he would reveal that he thought of her in exactly the same terms she used for herself . And she would not take it . Being in the wrong , always in the wrong , she would strike out , and there they would be , glaring at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other women might slip and learn to forgive themselves ; she could not . Other husbands might forgive fully , and forget ; Burke could not . He would forgive in the mind only , never as an act of love . And he would always go where his duty led him , and she would always mistrust his duty because he had chosen to naturalize it in the country of the well-to-do . Start all over , then ? Go back into circulation like an eighteen-yearold , with an eye to the availability and possibility of every unattachedp219man ? She had seen the look on the faces of many divorced women ; she had seen them set themselves like traps . The very thought repelled her . She had been for twelve years a trusted and faithful wife , she had known for ten days Bernard 's corrupt sweetness . She could imagine no relation with a man that would not be spoiled by the memory of one or the other . The terrier quivered under her hand and whined in his throat . Then lightning cracked the bowl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant his rigid , prick-eared head , the lit side of the spruce trunk and the droop of a branch , and the lake blackly shining like wet asphalt , and up above , in the periphery of her vision where the place of the flash ached in the firmament , a turmoil of boiling cloud . Then blackness with a vivid after-image like a faded negative , then real blackness , then the thunder . The dog lunged against the leash . She pulled him back and he whined , licked her hand , leaned out against the chain testing some smell that fascinated him . He lifted his feet nervously , his body shook . How queer , to live so alertly by a sense that in her hardly existed . Her own nose could barely smell the needly ground and the lake 's wet margins and the indefinable promise of rain on the air . He could sift out and sort every stray wisp of night wind , and know by pure mystery whether a taint at his nostrils was a woodrat that had poked its head out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down stick-legged to drink a half mile away . " Ah , Muggsy , " she said , " smell me an answer ! I 've got to have something to live for . I ca n't just be , like you and Fat Boy . I 've got to matter to somebody , or to myself , or why am I human ? " The moment she whispered it , she felt the twinge , the angry hurt . Her pride was as stiff and sore as a hand that the cat had clawed . The forest breathed at her back . Off somewhere , suspended apparentlyin upper air , was a residual noise of humanity  --  a horn , a boat getting in fast ahead of the storm . She lifted her face from the wiry fur and rose and went to the water 's edge and dragged a hand through the water . It felt milky warm , and she thought how everything is only seeming , how everything has definition only with relation to something else . A flashlight moving on a dock could be biggerp220than a star . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrest that some would cure with a sleeping pill , could tear her apart . A lie that some would tell as naturally as breathing she could not persist in at all . Bernard , who had added lying to disloyalty , kept his Stonestown security and the trust of his wife and daughters , while she , who had taken both her marriage and her emotions seriously , kept nothing . The dog pulled her sideways and entangled himself in bushes , so that she had to grope in the dark to free him . Immediately he burst off up the shore and upset her . Angrily she yanked him back , but at once squatted among the stones and hugged him . Trembling , he strained away . " I suppose I could give up my life to other people , " she said into his hairy ear . " Mmmm ? Like Schweitzer ? Go off and become a nurse in a Navajo hospital , or use my money to establish schools for spastic children ? But it would be such a phony thing  --  I 'd know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do things like that want to be called saints , and being called a saint would gag me . " The breath of air from behind her came again , and with it a brilliant zigzag of lightning that hung and quivered , visibly rushing down its crooked length . Under it the lake 's livid surface stirred as if its hair were on end . Sabrina shortened her hold on the lead and pulled the dog around , feeling for the path back to the house . " So many things gag me , " she said . The terrier did not want to come . Dragging him , she emerged into the little meadow and looked up and saw the whole sky without stars . All around the edges of the bowl world , lightning flickered and winked . The sense of coming storm awakened and excited her , and she hurried . Still reaching and clawing back toward the woods , the terrier yapped , agonized , and at once the kennels broke out into ragged barkings . Against the lighted window of Grulich 's parlor a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upsetting the dogs . " See what you 've done ? " she said . He scrambled and clawed away , striving after impossible happinesses in the dark woods , so that she had to wrap the leash around herp221hand and haul him across the meadow , feeling with her feet for the path smooth and sunken in the turf . A gust of wind stormed around her , the horizon all around flickered with light , and she saw the path , the gate in the wire exercise yard , the line of cages down both sides with dogs standing up against the screen . Then out . She stumbled . A splash of rain hit her in the eye . It was all she could do to drag the terrier against his desire . " Come on , " she said , out of breath and laughing , more alive than she had been for days . " Come on , you little beggar , before I make a symbol of you . " The rain caught her in the exercise yard . On both sides , stretching against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roared and yapped . Pulling sideward and backward , the terrier walked hindlegged , pawing at air , choking on his collar . By the flashes of lightning Sabrina saw the first big drops pelting down , and twigs and dust jumping . Wet blotches spread on her shoulders , her face was wet . The air , the open ground , the pines , were alive with a gravelly rush . The terrier stood on end , crosswise , backward , between her legs , wild with excitement , so that she had to land him in his pen by the leash , like a heavy struggling fish . When she closed the door on him in a great sheeted flash he was leaping high against the screen and adding his frantic yapping to the uproar of dogs and the rushing of rain . She closed the gate and fumbled with wet hands in the dark to snap the padlock shut . The rain came slanting thickly across the hooded night light . At a brilliant flash she jerked her hands away and then put them back , cringing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her hair was beaten across her face ; the shoulders , arms , and thighs of the coveralls were soaked ; her face and hands streamed . Running , she made the door of Grulich 's cottage , burst it open , and shut it behind her . Wind and rain were shut out , noise dropped away . She stood there with her heart and her eyes as still as the still air of the kitchen . " Oh , " she said . Burke and Oliver were sitting with Grulich at the kitchen table . Immediately Grulich got up and went into the front room . His look said to her , accusingly , that he did n't want anything to do withp222it . In a minute they heard him going up the stairs . The floor above them creaked . They heard the hiss of rain . " Well , Sabrina , " Oliver said . He was looking his customary ironic self , but Burke , with whose eyes hers had been locked from the moment she slammed the door and turned , looked ill , white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thinness and narrowness of his face and the length of his teeth were accentuated . She thought a little wildly that he looked like Woodrow Wilson about to scold someone . But mostly what she felt was a kind of panic like a schoolgirl coming to an examination for which she has not studied  --  the panic that recurs in anxiety dreams decades after one leaves school : the course one signed up for and forgot all about , the examination overlooked until there is nothing to do but take it and fail . This was the end of her lull , and she was still unprepared . Though she had imagined their meeting , she was no surer than she had ever been about how to face him , and she was caught unbracedfor the emotion she felt : not shame , as she had anticipated , but something awkward as a fishbone in the throat  --  pity that he looked so bad , almost gratification that she had done it to him . To evade his eyes she went into the little room off the kitchen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel off the door and came out again wiping her face and hands and patting her wet hair . Around the towel , lightly  --  but it came out flippant and wrong she said , " Well , how did you find me ? Hire Peekaboo Pennington ? " Oliver bent his head in ironic acknowledgment . Burke said nothing . Busily Sabrina dried herself , an extended and closely followed pantomime . Her hair was so wet that she took the pins out and shook it down and rubbed it with the towel . Then she had to go and get a comb and stoop to the mirror above the sink and re-part the hair into its smooth wings . She gathered the sheaf at the back of her neck and held it until she could grab up a piece of brown cord to tie it . In the mirror she saw what the backward weight of her hair did to her eyes , and then she shook the long pony tail loose and turned . " You 'd better get out of those wet clothes , " Burke said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its nail beside thep223sink and draped it over her shoulders , hooking back a hand to pull her hair free . The night outside winked brilliantly twice ; she saw the nervous response twitch in Burke 's eyelid . They could n't talk for thunder . Burke 's nostrils flared out and then in , and she thought , He 's putting that on , he thinks that communicates both his strong disgust and his self-control . The yellow blind , drawn over the open window , sucked strongly outward , kinking like tin . They waited . She saw that the spasmodic contraction around Burke 's eyes , which sometimes had touched her because it seemed to mean a warmer man trying to break through the repression , had become a tic . His left eye winked at her three times while the thunder rolled and rumbled down . So he could n't be putting it on . He looked tired and ashamed . Oliver rose . " Excuse me , " he said . " Now that the family is reunited I guess I 'll wait in the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burke said . " I know I do n't . But I 'd rather . Excuse me ? " He jerked a thumb significantly at the ceiling and went out . They heard him running past the window ; at his heels came a blink and a shattering crash as if someone had been waiting for him with an anti-tank gun . Sabrina , trying to smile , felt that she only grimaced . She had difficulty in facing Burke squarely . The composed , pale face with the uncontrollably twitching eyelid was both too steady and too shattered . " Now what ? " she made herself say . " I suppose that 's up to you . " For a moment a hope ; she felt how her eyes jumped to his . But his glance was gray as granite , unwarmed . " Why did you hunt me down ? " she said . " You might have been in trouble . " " Yes , " she said , disappointed . " Of course you 'd do your duty . " She stood up to the painful flickering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crooked grimace . " Well , I was . I still am . " " What are you going to do ? You ca n't stay here . " " I do n't know , " she said , and felt how little kept this dialogue from breaking into a melodrama of accusations , tears , blame , reconciliations that reconciled nothing except the moment 's hysteria.  |p224He  reached out a pack of cigarettes . His hand , she saw , was as usual very clean and perfectly steady . Even more than his emotionless face , it contradicted the twitching lid . When they had settled her little problemhe would go on back home and at seven tomorrow morning he would be on his rounds of the hospital . Seeing that he was still holding out the cigarettes , she shook her head . " I 've quit . " Quietly he put them away without taking one himself . He said , " I gather you did n't buy that ranch . " " No . " " It might be a good idea for you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tune . " For a moment she let her eyes blaze at him the blame that she was never quite able to suppress , and she said , " When I thought of that I was on my knees , I was thinking of ways we might work it out . " The twitch became a series of quick flutters . He bent his head a little down , and frowned as if pain had gone through his eye , but he said nothing . He looked withdrawn and waiting . Remembering his face buried in her belly , his tears on her skin , she could hardly see him for a moment , the room cracked and shattered so . Right then , with a little lie that did not even need to be spoken , she could have healed it , probably . By not acceding to the lie she had perhaps made it incurable . And yet he had come hunting her . " You 're not on your knees now , " he said finally . " Would you be , after your husband told you he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mad . " " Yes , " she said , " so I gathered . " With an upward , squinting look , an incredulous shake of the head , he said , " I ca n't believe this is you . Overnight , practically . It 's likebeing bitten by a shark you never even see till he hits you . " " I suppose , " she said wearily . " But it did n't come on overnight . " " You never gave me the slightest sign . " " Were you ever looking ? " Angrily she pushed away from the sink and went to the window and grabbed the cord of the blind . When she swung around to face him she saw that impatience or anger had putp225whitening lines around his mouth . So here they were back at it  --  recrimination , hostility . It was hopeless . Raising the shade halfway , she looked out into the streaming dark . The air smelled of wet pines and wet grass . The dogs had evidently been chased into their tepees by the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your mother 's and over the phone you said this affair was over , " Burke said . Without turning , she made a bitter face into the washed darkness , renouncing what had never been hers and what she had mistaken for something better than it was , but renouncing it in pain . " Over ? Of course it 's over . " She turned . " I 'm ashamed , " she said . " Apparently that is n't enough , but it 's all I can do . I 'm sick of myself , I 'll never understand it . It 's over , but I 'm not . " The tic in his eye was very bad ; he stared at her with his lips grinning back from his teeth . " No , " he said . " Apparently not . There 's for instance the report of this detective . " " Oh , you did hire a detective ! " " What other way was there ? I could n't just let you disappear , not knowing whether you were dead or alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so everything you 've been doing would be plastered all over the newspapers ? " Sabrina looked warningly up at the ceiling . She could imagine Grulich up there with his hands over his ears or his head under the pillow . She found that she had braided the shade cord into a chain stitch ; now with a jerk she unraveled it , watching Burke 's strained , twitching face . " Not that it made much difference , " he said . " You were in and out of every club on the lake , blind drunk , cashing checks , showing your credit cards . It did n't take any detective to trail you through those two days and nights . You left your name and address everywhere . " He was showing no excessive self-control now . His head was drawn back in a curious stiff way and his eyes were half closed . He kept stretching his lips over his teeth as if they had shrunk and would not quite cover . His voice , though he kept it low , was full of hissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she watched him , thinking , It 's like sex with him , the more he names it the realer it is , and the more it maddens him.  |p226He  looked down irritably as if he might give it up and stop talking , then his eyes came jolting back . He said , " If you 're so ashamed , what about your friend Henderson ? " " Henderson ? I do n't know anybody named Henderson . " " Lying again ? " he said with a terrible look . " Your friend Henderson from Petaluma . " Her heart and her breath had stopped . " Oh , " she said . " Him . " She ran the chain stitch up the cord again . " How else do you suppose we found you ? He told us where he 'd left you and I thought of Grulich . " The short leg of the table clacked down as he leaned forward . Intensely fixed behind the irrelevant winkingand narrowing of the tic , his eyes looked insane . " I never thought my wife would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . " Unexpectedly her breath started again , a short , jerky inhalation . " I picked him up , " she said . Her fingers unraveled the cord . It slipped from her hand , the shade flew to the top with a horrible racket . For a moment there was the rainy dark , then a flash lit up the whole sodden yard , the threshing pines , the path shining wet across the meadow . Afterward she felt her own cut-out silhouette in the window . Without the cord she needed something to do with her hands . " Why ? " Burke said at last in a cracking whisper . " Why ? Why ? " Under the canvas jacket she was shivering , but when she put her hands inside , on her shoulders , they felt warm and steamy . " Why ? " she said , and bit her chattering teeth together . " To make everything as bad as possible , I guess . To be real somehow . To die somehow . I do n't know . " " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , you go and do something twice as  --  " " Oh , sure , " she said drearily . " Of course . " His face looked as if he might shout something wild . After a hard , unbelieving stare he passed his hand along his jaw and looked down at the floor . His eye jerked so rapidly that she wondered why he did n't clap his hand over it . She could no longer believe he was only acting the appropriate but controlled emotions of a wronged husband . He shook like a dog , and stared at her in silence with his wild twitchingp227eye , and she could have gone to him in pity and put her arms around him and held his face to her breast , but something aloof , quick , and cool that had watched her through the whole scene said , " No , it would only be pity . When he got over the bad spell and you got over your pity he would still not have forgiven you , and you would still not have forgiven yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt , but unless he makes a move that means love , it wo n't do . Dirty as you are , he 's got to want to touch you , he 's got to hold you , and shut his eyes and hang on . If you matter enough to him so that he 'll . . . " " Sabrina , " he said , " do you think you 're sick ? " A long breath , a sigh really . " In the head , you mean ? " " Nervously . " " It would be nice to have such a nice simple comprehensible explanation , would n't it ? " she said with a wan smile . " No , I 'm not sick . Sick in the soul , maybe , whatever that means . " There he sat , his neat long head , his narrow jaw , his familiar bony shoulders , his hands , his wrists  --  her husband , intimately known . " Oh , Burke ! " she said , and now he blurred through tears . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wrong reasons , and tried to pretend they were good ones , and it did n't work . I 've never belonged to anything , really belonged , in my life . I never even belonged to my marriage . No , that is n't quite true . I loved you , I did . But you never gave me any chance to be a woman , darling . If you had , maybe I could have become one . " He was at his old trick of examining his hands . Squinting painfully upward , he said , " I 'm afraid I do n't know what you mean . " " I suppose not , " she said . " Maybe all it means is that I 'm a wretched neurotic female . But I 've told you I hate myself for what I did to you , and that 's the truth . You told me on the telephone you did n't care what I did , and maybe I wanted to do something so vile you 'd have to care . But I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you 'd sweep a crippled cockroach into the fire . I was giving myself what I knew I deserved . " She waited . He did not say , " Let 's go somewhere and heal this together . " He did not say , " Poor darling , you 've had a bad time . " Hep228did not say , " Even after all this , you 're the one important thing in my life . " He sat at the table and said with a twisted smile , " You 're sure you were n't giving me what I deserved ? " Miserably , with chattering teeth , she turned away from him . " I suppose it 's possible , " she said . She heard his dry voice , intolerably steady again  --  how could he ?  --  say , " Well , if you meant to punish me , you did the job . " Sabrina shrugged . She might have said , " I 'm sorry . " She might have said , " I 'm glad . " She said neither . And at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff correctness that made her want to screech and fly up the chimney , he said what she had been wanting him to say . " In spite of all this , I 'm asking you to come back , " he said . " Will you ? " She snapped around and was met by the wink and flicker of the tic . But his face was composed , his mouth steady ; his hands , crossed on the table , looked relaxed . He seemed almost amused , as if he had posed her a riddle and was waiting for her to give up , and she understood that one of her deepest , longest-standing , and most ineradicable grudges against him was that he felt no guilt himself . No matter what he might say or how miserable she might make him , he took no blame for what had happened . Of that crushing rejection on the telephone he said only , " I was mad . " He saw nothing demanding change in their marriage , but asked her now , as he had asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . Other grievances she might have manufactured in self-pity or self-defense , but that one she had not made up . And yet she wanted to go back , she wanted to be safe , she wanted to quit being what she had become , she wanted  --  and would have melted if it had happened  --  his hand on her . A touch , a human touch , in place of this judicial withholding while she made up her mind . Then she made up her mind . " I 'm not fit to , " she said , and wondered why she had fallen back on that hypocrisy . " I 'm ready to forget it . " Their eyes met in a crooked , glancing look . He squinted his eye nearly shut to stop its twitching ; but except for that galvanism he had completely regained control of face , hands , voice . Not she . She chokedp229on the word , and tried it again and choked a second time , but got it out , as thick as the word of a moron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hands on the table , he did not look pained and he did not plead . " Do you want a divorce ? " he said . " I . . . No . " " Would you fight it if I started proceedings ? " " No . You 've got every reason . " " But maybe I do n't want one either . " She shivered inside the canvas jacket , and felt the wet coveralls clinging to her legs . " All right , " she said . Now his mouth did twist ; she thought for a second he was going to rage and quarrel at her . But his teeth came together ; he smiled . " Right where it was before , then . " Sabrina moved her shoulders . " If you want . " " Where will you go ? " " I guess if Oliver will give me a lift I 'll go back to Mother 's . " The rain was slackening . A flash lit the window and she counted four before the thunder broke , receding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had not lifted a hand to touch her . She could see in his face nothing of what she realized she had hoped to find.  |p230THE  TRESTLE table had been removed from the library . What confronted him on these mornings was not a workroom but a solitude fit for a worldly pope . The air smelled with thin richness of his late preservative oils ; the light was cool ; the day ahead promised its agreeable inconsequential labors punctuated by anecdotal visits from Mrs. Hutchens . And first there was the pleasant business of readying the tools . From a cabinet he took the card file in which he had indexed every item thus far examined in the Hutchens archive . Beside it on the blotter  --  somebody changed the desk blotter for him every two or three days  --  he laid two ballpoint pens , one blue and one red , and several folders of un-indexed papers . On the shelf he placed , open side out , the labeled pamphlet cases , for which Mrs. Hutchens would substitute permanent boxes in full calf with gilt lettering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how people , of a kind , were transformed into history , of a kind . Energy , if it could be called that , into matter , if that was what these papers were . Substance into essence , if you preferred it backward and in another terminology . Like a bleat from a dusty throat the labeled cases insisted , " I was . Never mind what , I was . Here is proof . " And inp231the end there was a sort of lesson in them ; the acquisitiveness and eccentricityand conspicuous waste of a whole family became representativeof something , and worth preserving . Now Mizraim cures wounds , and Pharaoh is sold for balsams . Meantime he was a monk in an opulent cell . He pulled up the padded leather chair , looked at it with respect , sat down , opened a folder of papers , and began listing . A child 's penciled letter : My dear Emily , we are glad you had a nice journy , we hope Mary Stillman will come and stay with you , when are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the beautiful two lips ( tulips ) arnt they pretty ?

I would just as leave lief you would have somebody read this letter . I send my love to you all . I hope you will not care because I dident write the letter very nicely . Affectionately from Mercer G. Wolcott your Brother . A note from Harvard University , School of Veterinary Medicine , Hospital Department , dated June 17 , 1884 , addressed to Bushrod Wolcottand dealing with the discolored teeth of his setter . A folded paper containing a reddish , five-pointed pressed leaf and the date July 6 , 1865 . An envelope addressed " Cornelius M. Wolcott , Present , " and inside it a note marked " Confidential " : My dear Sir : In the discussion about uniting the parties on one candidate for Gov'r against Mr. Andrew , we have had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be able to agree upon anyone , tho Yr. name meets with the least opposition . If they agree at all it must be upon an " old Whig , " and a man of buss'ss is preferable to a lawyer . It will be you or nobody . Yrs . truly , Somebody Illegible . So Mrs. Hutchens ' grandfather , an energetic man of buss'ss , had almost made it into another sort of distinction , or at least into candidacytherefor . Inscribe on his tombstone , " He nearly met with the least opposition . " Evidently that was the extent of it , for if the Comce 's , whoever they were , had been able to agree , there would have been a vast body of documentary evidence preserved by the family . Even their apparent method of wildly random sampling would have pre/served something more than this one note . A close miss , then . Leonard made a card for Cornelius 's file , marked it " CORN . " in red ink , and put the letter in its chronological place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now a green Eintrittskart to an Innsbruck circus , clipped to a menu from the Albergo Daniell , Venice . A clipping from the Boston Transcriptfor August 14 , 1900 , entitled " An Interesting Letter from Bangkok , Siam , " addressed to " Dear H.H. " and signed with the initials M.G.W. This began , Where in the Far East do you imagine I am on this quiet , beautiful Sunday morning when the sea here in the Gulf of Siam is like the waters of Vineyard Sound on a perfect July morning ? and it ended , The thermometer is only 87 degrees , but it seems much hotter , and I am constantly obliged to use my handkerchief . Running his eye down the two columns , Leonard encountered such comments as What a dirty , unattractive people the Chinese are , to be sure , and Singapore , the capital of the Straits Settlements , is a lively and most cosmopolitan town , on an island 275 square miles in extent , and We have seen the king four times now : twice he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather short man , 47 years old . There went old Mercer , gathering data on exotic ports and being bowed to by kings . I would just as lief you would have somebody read this letter . There was a carpety shuffle in the doorway and Mrs. Hutchens ' face , long , liver-spotted , and smiling , appeared around the jamb . She was followed by Helen Kretchmer , and they were dressed as usual for golf ; Mrs. Hutchens even wore her spike shoes . " Good morning ! " she cried . " Hard at work . . . as usual . What interesting things have you found today ? " Leonard had risen . With his hip he pushed the card file more safely onto the desk . He said soberly , " I wonder if I should bring this to your attention .... " " What . . . do you mean ? " " These papers . " He tapped them with the backs of his fingers . " Your Uncle Bushrod seems to have been a little indiscreet . This business of smuggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " What ? " " Also the charges that were brought against him as a Czarist spy during the Russo-Japanese War . He just barely got out of that by taking refuge in the Tokyo Embassy . " Mrs. Hutchens ' face had gone slack and flabbergasted ; her jowls drooped and shook , her eyes were idiotic with shock . Leonard was alreadyregretting what he had started ; he did n't need Helen Kretchmer 's quick frown to tell him to lay off . But he was started . The glib foolery spun itself out , getting lamer with every word . " Then there 's this item about the colored woman he lived with in Barbados , the one who claimed his estate when he died . . . Jeez , I do n't know . " " Uncle . . . Uncle Bushrod ? " Leonard smiled , and he aimed his smile to be of maximum voltage . " Maybe I put it too strong . They did n't ever pin it on him . There was a chance the dope was smuggled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Czarist spy turned out to be an adventurer named Bushmill 's Potstill . And the woman from Barbados , she was n't quite on the up . She admitted later it was a frame . She was sore at all the Wolcotts becauseMercer had killed her brother in a duel one time . " With relief he saw in Mrs. Hutchens ' face signs of recovery . He told himself , Never try that again . You do n't kid her about the ancestors . She said breathlessly , " My goodness , it seems it was . . . time we had someone go through those papers . I hope you have . . . destroyed anythingincriminating . " " Oh yes ma'am . You want me to go on burning such things ? " " Things like that I . . . certainly do . " Peering , she regarded him . Helen Kretchmer had begun to smile ; he had the feeling that she smiled at whatever Mrs. Hutchens smiled at . The old lady pulled a golf glove over her enlarged knuckles . " Shall you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ought to get through the papers without any trouble . " " But not the dress collection and other things ? " " There may be an interruption . Pretty soon I 'm scheduled to become the father of triplets . " " Triplets ! " " At least . " 234The old blue eyes peered , the sharpness of the expression a compensationfor the dimness of the sight . " You will have to put labels on your jokes . . . for me , " she said . " I 'm afraid I was not . . . trained to your kind of humor . " Then she was shaking with silent laughter . " But I find it amusing , " she said . " How is dear Barbara ? " " Right in the pink . I think she enjoys being pregnant . " " How . . . nice , " said Mrs. Hutchens . " How very nice . And in the autumn you go back to being a schoolmaster . " " Happy golden rule days . " " Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps ? To finish ? " " I might have a week or so . But why do n't you get someone else ? Helen , maybe . " " No , no . Helen will be . . . sufficiently occupied . I should be .. . ever so much obliged if you would do it . I think you would do it with sympathy and understanding . " Obviously she meant it ; he was touched . Her eyebrows were as gray and fuzzy as strips of rabbit fur . She laughed to herself , and her eyes peeked up in a glance that he could only think of as coquettish . " And who besides you could find the . . . daggers and dueling pistols hidden in the . . . hems of the dresses ? " " Maybe you 're right at that . Not everybody is qualified . " " Then you will ? " " If you want me to . " " Splendid ! " she crowed , with the sudden bugle-like sound she made when pleased . " How perfectly . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you have already done . And please carry my love to Barbara . I remember her ever since she . . . was such a little round-eyed girl . " " Mrs. Hutchens , " Helen said , " if we do n't get along we wo n't even finish five holes before lunch time . " Two smiles , one abstractly pleasant , the smile of a good receptionist , the other old and yearning and fond . They went on out , the old lady picking up her feet from the priceless rugs like a cat walking in the wet . Sometime later , another sound of interruption at the door . He looked up , expecting to see Lizardo , or Mrs. Hutchens returned from golf , andp235looked instead into the face of Sabrina Castro . She had the air of having been waiting there until he noticed her ; he detected the symptoms of held breath that one of his daughters would have displayed under the same circumstances . His first thought was that she had deliberately posed a picture for him . His second was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lover man ? His third was jarred out of him by the almost trembling eagerness of her smile and by the fact  --  it took a second to see what it was  --  that she wore no make-up , had scrubbed herself plain as a nun : Lord , she is good looking when she forgets to be Eustacia Vye . " Well , hi , " she said , and came on in . " I never saw such concentration . You must like being a librarian . " " It 's nice clean work , " Leonard said . " Saves on laundry . " She was paler and thinner than when he had seen her last , and it was hard to say whether the hysterical tension that had been evident in every move and word was gone , or only under control . Even without make-up she made such a package of elegance that it was hard to see her plainly . It was that air of fastidious elegance , more than anything else , that always made him wary around her . Her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , were on him curiously . " How 's Bobbie ? " " Great with child . " The image of her face , also without make-up , but how different  --  smudged with violet under the eyes , puckered with smiling as she kissed him good-by in the plywood cell  --  made such a vision of reality and worth as against the groomed spuriousness of Sabrina Castro that he moved a little way down the desk . " She 's not close ? " Sabrina said . " About a month . " " I meant to write , but I did n't . I just got home last night . " " From Reno ? " " Reno ? " " I thought you were up there on a ranch somewhere . " " Oh . No , I 've been staying at Tahoe . " " Rugged duty , " Leonard said . Her eyes touched his slantwise , out their corners , and he wondered if it was that trick , not so much coquettish as curious and alive , that gave her her charm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all thep236greater with her lips pale and her eyes unaccented and her cheeks an even , fading tan . He could see how it would be a real discomfort to a lot of men , the way the skin tightened across her cheekbones when she smiled , the way she seemed at once to ask and promise something . Her voice was husky and confidential , and she had an interested and alert air , the sort of manner that could attract you to a bright pupil in a class . Maybe her charm was no more or less than intelligence . And yet admitting all that , he retained the impression of something acted , of self-consciousness being persuasively natural , and as usual their talk went like light sparring . " Very rugged , " she said drily . " How 're my girls ? " " Your girls are too much with us , late and soon . They 're like a recurrentvirus , or undulant fever . " " I want to see them . " " There 's nobody they 'd rather see . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with disconcerting interest . Her eyes were steady , but with a kind of flickering in them as if by a thousand all-but-invisible movements of the eyeball she focused many details in a single glance . He had the naked feeling that she was observing every fleck and marbling in his eyeballs and every winker in his eyelashes , and for some reason , while he held her eyes with what he hoped was an expression of friendly irony , he thought of Henry David Thoreau and his habit of putting visitors clear across the cabin on Walden Pond , so as to leave room between them for conversation . Sabrina looked down with a half smile , a half shrug . " How are you getting on with the Wolcotts ? " " So far they have n't kicked me out of the family tree . " " Was n't it a tribe ? Especially Grandmother 's generation . Not one of them ever did one solitary useful thing . " " Oh now , " Leonard said . " Look what an interesting pattern of challengesand responses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of checkbook  --  butEmily , and Grace , and Sarah , and Mercer , those were all people . Especially Mercer . " " Why ? " " Why ? He 's interesting . "  | " I remember him , " Sabrina said . " He was a little crabby vain man . Everything he had had to be better than anyone else 's , and nobody ever did anything to suit him . Once when he was out here  --  it must have been right after we came , I could n't have been more than five or six  --  he got the idea the gardeners were n't taking proper care of the roses . Nobody in California knew anything , naturally . So he made them mix up about five tons of manure and leaf mold and peat moss and sand and whatnot , to some recipe passed on from gardener to gardener , in Nahant , or maybe learned from one of those Boston historians who were such rose fanciers , and he had them dump it right by the rose gardens and he was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes ? " he said . She had a glint in her eye , a pursed curl of selfdeprecationon her mouth  --  the bright pupil reciting . " It turned out he did n't have his gaiters with him . He was furious with his valet , because ever since Mercer had gone grouse shooting with the Prince of Wales  --  that would have been Edward the Seventh , would n't it ?  --  he never did anything outdoorsy without his gaiters on . Of course San Francisco could n't provide any ; the barbarians did n't know what he was talking about . Mercer sent back to Boston for some , or was going to , but they never came . After he went home , the gardeners did something with the fertilizer , I do n't know what . Stored it , maybe . " " That sounds pretty standard for Mercer . " " Strictly standard . He went forth to battle but he always fell . " " Poor old Mercer . " " He was the most incompetent of the whole lot , " Sabrina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great swell , though . I 'm sure he put the fear of God into what he would have called tradespeople . But sad . Did you know that in his will he left one whole house  --  he had about six  --  with a valet to look after it , and a fund to look after them both , so that his whole wardrobe could be preserved intact , not a stud or a necktie missing ? I suppose Grandmother 's dress collection gave him the idea . The collection was to be open to the public once a year . Probablyit still is . " " If the valet can find his gaiters . " " Any valet who had learned anything from Mercer would n't be able to . My Lord , think of all those empty suits with Mercer inside them . "  |p238They  laughed , and for the space of the laugh he felt easy with her . The air was not charged with her usual challenging , competitive , essentiallyhostile irony . Then she turned her eyes on him sideways again , and his wariness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She just looked , for that second , scornful and discontented . " Challenges and responses my eye , " she said . " What on earth , in all their lives , ever challenged any of that bunch ? " He spoke before he thought . " Money , maidenhood , sterility , plenty of things . " Now she was looking at him hard and directly , and the scorn that had been only a curve of the lip was unmistakable . " The last time we talked you did n't think those were much of a challenge . " " I 've been converted , " he said pleasantly , and kicked himself for giving her the opening to air her grudge against the world . But she shrugged , looked around the library , gave a light laugh . " Well , hooray . Are we going to carry the challenges and responses down to the present ? " " Not much data after Mercer . You got any personal diaries ? " She pulled down her mouth . " Not to be opened till the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It might be the gem of the collection . " She was leaning on the desk on one hand , the fingers bent back so far they looked painful , while she looked over the papers spread there . " I 'll tell you what I will do , though , " she said , and gave him a glance dark and frowning . " I 've been thinking about my family lately . I keep thinking what if I descended into this family and snooped around among the frustrated and lost and asked them who they were in life and why they were punished by being made empty and ridiculous . Do you think that would teach me anything ? " From three feet away she compelled his eyes . He saw a tiny brown mole , beauty spot till now unnoticed , at the corner of her right upper lid . Carefully and with a smile he said , " Trying on the different styles of damnation ? " She did not want to joke ; she seemed to insist on sober attention . " Would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record ? Can I be the first visiting scholar ? " " Why not ? " he said . " Your mother is in all the time , and Helenp239Kretchmer is typing all the diaries so we 'll have copies for public use . Come join the seminar . " The doorway gleamed with the white jacket . " Lunch , Miz Cas-tro . " " All right , Lizardo , thanks . " To Leonard she said , " You 're staying , are n't you ? Do n't you , usually ? " " Your mother felt it demeaned the family for the librarian to eat out of a brown bag . Excuse me a minute , I ought to call Bobbie . " He picked up the telephone and dialed , holding it on his arm . Sabrina said , " Let me talk to her when you 're through . " From the receiver the crackling homunculus voice said , " Hello ? " " Hi . How 's it going ? " " Nothing stirring . " " Feel all right ? " " Like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's looking good . Guess who 's here . " " Sabrina ? " " Check . " " Let me talk to her ! " He kissed the mouthpiece and handed the instrument to Sabrina . " Two minutes only , the patient is very weak . " Exclamations and questions and answers and assurances burst out behind him as he went into the lavatory . Myna birds , strictly . This Sabrina was a different person with Bobbie : chirps of extrovert affection , endless reminiscences , a closed culture shared only by the two of them . He washed his hands , ran his fingers along his blue-bearded jaw  --  still reasonably smooth . In deference to his surroundings he smoothed his shirttails and buttoned his collar , thinking of the snottiest advertisement he ever saw  --  three disturbed and sneering golfers glaring across the green at an ugly duckling , sartorially unkempt . You tell him , Joe , he 's your friend . " Mind your own business , Joe , " Leonard said , and opened the door . Sabrina was saying , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , if you feel all right . I 'll come over early and help . Do n't tell the girls I 'm coming , I 'll surprise them . Really ? I sure do . I 'll see you then . "
