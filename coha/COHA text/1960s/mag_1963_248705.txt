Black &; White-Harambee ! <P> Only a few years ago , Kenya 's whites raged against Jomo Kenyatta as the bloodthirsty founder of Mau Mau . In 1961 , a governor of Kenya labeled Kenyatta " a leader to darkness and death . " On a London visit in 1962 , Kenyatta was pelted with rotten eggs by white extremists brandishing placards reading , " Hang Kenyatta ! " Yet last week , as his country 's newly elected Prime Minister , Kenyatta was a hero to most of Kenya 's remaining white farmers . <P> At Nakuru , capital of the former white highlands , 400 farmers crowded the town hall to hear him , determined to base their decision to leave Kenya or to stay on what he had to tell them ( in the past two years , 6,000 have left , but 60,000 remain ) . Kenyatta appealed to the whites to forgive and forget , to join hands with his three-month-old African government and prove that different racial groups can live harmoniously together . <P> " There is no society of angels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are human beings and as such we are bound to make mistakes . If I have done a mistake to you , it is for you to forgive me . If you have done a mistake to me , it is for me to forgive you . " He assured the white settlers that they would be allowed to farm their land without interference , though the government will use idle land , and promised more police action to prevent the stealing of cattle . <P> When he finished , the white farmers roared Kenyatta 's battle cry of " Harambee ! " , a Swahili expression meaning " Let 's all push together-get up and go . " Not all were won over . But most decided to stay in Kenya so long as Jomo Kenyatta continued saying and doing the right things . His speech , said Farmer Leader Lord Delamere , was a " unique and historic " event .
