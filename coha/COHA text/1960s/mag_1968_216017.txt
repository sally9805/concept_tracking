Furiously swinging an ax , the London adman whacks his desk into sawdust . " Andrew , darling , " soothes the boss , " you 're always threatening to resign . " Andrew darling 's hackwork is nothing compared with what Producer-Director Michael Winner ( The Jokers ) has done to this splintery British satire on the high cost of selling out . <P> Having demolished his desk , the rebellious adman this time really does cut loose . Determined to go straight , Andrew ( Oliver Reed ) leaves the business , the boss , and the ball-and-chain . To further prove his good intentions , he even jettisons his two mistresses . Soon he gets an honest job at the Gadfly , a drab little literary magazine , where his principal duty is rejecting manuscripts . The rest of the time he accepts the adoration of a puddingy secretary ( Carol White ) who finds him as irresistible as he obviously finds himself . <P> The boss , played by Orson Welles , wants him back . Eventually Welles , whose acting is confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sting by acquiring its assets and offices . Undone , Andrew makes one more commercial , this one about Truth . The night of a banquet for the Creativity in Advertising awards , he unreels it-a naive diatribe against planned obsolescence that includes footage of a bulldozer shoveling bodies at Buchenwald and an atomic mushroom cloud rising while a little girl sings All Things Bright and Beautiful . <P> Manifestly , Winner believed that throughout the film he was courageously exposing the underside of affluence . Actually , What 's ' Isname simply knocks tired old targets in a weary new way , with a kind of tasteless , toothless satire that gums where it should bite . <P> In a mock defense of the ad game , Welles proposes that " the main product in the 20th century is waste " and predicts that in 200 years the world will be standing on a huge mound of garbage . Possibly . And close to the bottom will be this story of a Fake 's Progress that is as false as an 8 note .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
