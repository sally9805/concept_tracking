Almost unnoticed in the whirl of the week 's news came a U.S. move that could mean much in the long-run future of the cold war . Defense Secretary Robert McNamara announced the merging of the Army 's combat-ready Stateside troops and Stateside troops and Stateside units of Air Force 's Tactical Air Command . The new joint command is designed to speed up the airlift of U.S. troops to overseas trouble spots and to guarantee them close aerial support once they swing into action . In particular , the command will aim at fighting limited , brush-fire wars wherever the Communists might strike a match around the world . <P> McNamara 's plan is a bold attempt to cure a basic weakness in U.S. fighting strength that has existed since 1947 , when the Air Force was set up as a separate service . Without its own aircraft , the Army became dependent upon the Air Force for transportation to the fighting front and close tactical support when it got there . But the Army and the Air Force all too often failed to work well together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of World War II that the rifleman needed help from the fighter-bomber . Unable to count on TAC airlift for practice jumps , paratroop commanders talked wryly of chartering their own transports . <P> At McNamara 's request , the Joint Chiefs of Staff last winter began studying the problems of an air-ground merger , gave their enthusiastic approval in a 1-in. - thick document stamped top secret . On other projects , the Joint Chiefs have made McNamara and President Kennedy fume with shoddy staff work , but this time their study held up under criticism , was put into effect with few changes . <P> The new command merges the Strategic Army Corps , composed of the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions and the 4th Infantry Division , with the F-100 and F-105 fighter-bombers , reconnaissance aircraft and transports of the Tactical Air Command . In an emergency , the long-range planes of the Military Air Transport Service would deliver troops and supplies to a staging area overseas , where they would be shuttled into battle by the shorter-range transports of the new command . The new system , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-third , fly 1,800 paratroopers some 8,000 miles in 2 days and put them into action backed up by fighter-bombers . <P> Named to head the new command , which is unnamed as yet , was the Army 's Lieut . General Paul D. Adams , 54 , a West Pointer ( ' 28 ) who is proud of his rating as both a paratrooper and a combat infantryman . Adams , who will be promoted to full general for the job , commanded the land forces during the U.S. intervention in Lebanon in 1958 , and he knows how hard it is to get troops to the right place at the right time . Says he : " The unified command is the only way to get the job done . "
