txt From Canada British Columbia 's decision to dam the Peace River not only assures one of the largest hydroelectrical projects in the world but represents a complete reversal of Canadian power policy .

If Canadian rivers are not harnessed without further delay , it is suspected that their output will not be able to compete , a decade or so hence , with that of American nuclear plants . The argument about exports in recent years centered around the Columbia scheme . Premier Bennett , of British Columbia , insisted that power from the Canadian sector of this international river-should be sold to the United States . The Die fenbaker government was determined that most of the power should remain in Canada . On this point Mr. Bennet appears to have won his fight but the ratification of the Columbia treaty is held up in the Canadian Parliament , for the present by the decision of the new Liberal government to renegotiate it with the United States and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
