It was low man out ; nine incumbent Democratic Congressmen were running at large for the eight seats left to Alabama after reapportionment resulting from the 1960 census . Last week the ninth man turned out to be none other than Mobile 's Frank W. Boykin , 77 , a flamboyant fixture in Washington for 28 years , a Mason , an Elk , a Moose , a Shriner , and a very Odd Fellow . <P> A multimillionaire ( real estate , timber , livestock ) , with an imposing mane of grey hair thatching an elephantine hulk ( 250 lbs . ) , Boykin 's political stock in trade was a boisterous greeting : " Hello there , Pardner ! By God , everything 's made for love ! " Funny thing was , Boykin really meant it . " God is love , see ? " he explained . " He made everything , did n't he ? So everything is made for love , get it ? " He took genuine pleasure in doing favors for friends . He established a 100,000-acre game preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks from Washington and all points south . He could put them in 69 beds in his big house , and he loved to send them out hunting deer , wild turkey , quail , dove , wild boar and even buffalo . <P> In 1949 , Boykin threw a testimonial party for Texas ' Sam Rayburn in a Washington hotel , invited just about everybody in the phone book . Winston Churchill cabled his regrets , but 900 others came to sample a score of cases of Scotch and bourbon , along with Quebec salmon , Alabama venison , Montana elk , bear meat from the Okefenokee Swamp , Georgia turkey , and antelope from Chugwater , Wyo . Boykin 's all-for-love motto was bantered about the banquet hall . Everybody had a great time , and jolly Frank was delighted to fork over the $16,000 tab . <P> But brotherly love is wearing a bit thin in Alabama these days . And among the nine Congressmen running for eight seats , Boykin was both the oldest and the richest ; many Alabamans apparently figured that he was the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 14 past elections , folks had remembered the ebullient fellow who had hauled water for construction gangs at eight , become a business success at 16 , a near millionaire at 21 . But now Boykin 's was simply a case of love 's labor 's lost .
