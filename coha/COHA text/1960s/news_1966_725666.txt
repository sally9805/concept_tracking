txt The agency has ciescillied the installation ; fiS . a vital : first step in the construction of , the controversial center . Mr .. Lindsay was riot ately available for comment on the letters released by the authority . ' . A : Matter of Money The principal issue ' in the negotiations is how much the Port Authority will pay the city in lieu of taxes for the 16-acre Trade Center site on the Lower West Side . The center would include twin .40-story towers and ' several smaller buildings . The administration ? officials assert that the agency has flatly ' refused to discuss this matter , or any others , ' until it receives permission to have the telephone lines installed . The authority 's assertions about the Mayor were contained in two long letters released late last night . One , dated July 5 , was from Howard S. Cullman , honorary chairman of the agency , to S. Sloan Colt , the authority chairman , filling him in on a meeting with Mr. Lindsay that Mr. Colt had been unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mr. Colt to the Mayor , dated June 27 . In the first letter , Mr. Cullman reported that during a meeting at City Hall on June 28 , Mr. Lindsay had taken him and Austin J. Tobin , the agency 's executive director , into the hall and told them that " . . he agreed with our view that the permit to ' close West Street should be issued in the public interest , but that the negotiating committee had taken a position against this and he felt he could not ' pull the rug out from under them . ' " He urged that we return to the meeting with the negotiating committee for ' just 30 minutes ' and simply state our position on the other two items on the agenda  --  arrangements regarding streets and payments in lieu of taxes . Says Mayor Reneged " If we did that , then , he plainly stated , this would enable him to get those fellows off the hook and . . . he would then direct the immediate issuance of the . . . permit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his associates " fulflled our part of the bargain , " the Mayor did not . Back out in the hallway , Mr. Cullman wrote , " we . reminded him of his commitment . and called upon him to stand by his word and issue the per mit . He avoided a direct answer . . . . " Mr. Cullman continued describing.the rest of the meeting and subsequent developments in the negotiations : No meetings have been held ebtween the two parties since the June 28 session he described . In the second letter , Mr. Colt reviewed . for Mr. Lindsay the history of the negotiations and said that he and his colleagues were " puzzled and disappointedly " by , the administration 's approach . At one point Mr. Colt writes : " Although you say that you are strongly in favor of the Trade Center , you are permitting the Deputy Mayor to block its construction in order to maintain what ' he apparently thinks is a stranglehold on the Port Authority in these negotiations . " Administration 's Stand This is a reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head the city 's special negotiating committee . Mr. Colt has accused . Mr. Price of blocking the issuance of the permit . The administration officials said that the city was prepared to " come down on virtually every point in the negotiations , " and that in some cases it was willing to accept " less than half " what it originally asked for . Despite this , the officials said , the Port Authority 's executive director , Austin J. Tobin , has refused to discuss any matters until he is given the permits necessary to install some longline telephone cables beneath the Trade Center site . The city 's permission is required because it would be necessary to close part of West Street to Install the lines . In a statement released . last night , Mr. Tobin said : that if such permission was granted he would " sit down around the clock to work out an agreement " with the city . The administration , however , has made it clear that it will not grant the permission unless , thousands of dollars on the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former owners nor payments in lieu of taxes from the authority . The municipal officials insist that the administration has not asked anything unreasonable of the authority . On May 29 Mr. Price 's negotiating committee forwarded to the agency a list of conditions for city approval that Mr. Tobin , subsequently described as " preposterous . " The talks became deadlocked as , a result and , to avoid a complete breakdown , the Mayor suggested that the two sides agree to bring a third party into the talks . The sides have been unable to agree , however , on who or what that third party should be . The authority has suggested that it be the courts ; the city has proposed an impartial arbitrator . As to that , Mr. Tobin said in his statement : " The commissioners of the Port Authority do not have the choice of simply accepting or rejecting arbitration . For fundamental reasons of law and public policy the commissioners , as public officers of the two states New York and New Jersey have no power to delegate their statutory responsibilities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Moreover , what the Corporation Counsel offered as ' an arbitration ' agreement was a wholly illusory and onesided scheme under which , at the city 's option , the city would force the Port Authority to accept the Price Committee 's price tag of $29-million a year for 99 years for the city 's ' cooperation ' on the World Trade Center . " The administration officials denied that they had made any such proposal . They charged in turn that the authority 's proposal to take the matter to the courts amounted to nothing more than an effort to permit the agency to condemn cityowned land . Asked whether the deadlock was irreconcilable , they declined to speculate , adding : " Right now we have no ' other plans than to continue to write Tobin letters , telephone him and try to get the negotiations started again . " The officials emphasized that the conditions submitted to the agency May 29 were negotiable items , not hard demands . The Price committee had asked the Port Authority for annual payments of almost $27-million for the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center was authorized by the New York and New Jersey Legislatures in 1962 . The authorizing statute provided that if the authority and the city could not agree on terms , the agency could apply to the New York Legislature for the right to condemn the city land on its own . Administration sources said they doubted that the Legislature would grant such permission over the city 's objections . The ; cipty has asked the authority to commit itself to make major ' port improvements , including a huge new passenger ship terminal on the Hudson River . Altogether , the improvements would cost close to $240-million . The Port . Authority , in return , is reported to have offered an annual payment of $4-million . " The Port Authority 's offers on all the points are so far away from ours , " an administration official said yesterday , " they 're not even in the same ball game . " as the officials put it yesterday , there is ! " some slight improvement in the city 's position in the negotiations . " " So . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they asserted . Impasse serious They declared that the impasse Was a serious one because neither side had the power to force the other to do anYthing . " If we do n't agree , no one can make us agree , " they said .
