txt The United States has acquired a mammoth foreign coin collection in the currencies of other nations under the Food for Peace pi ogram . It is too big  --  in the billions . It is money that can be used only in the country of its of And only for certain specific pur ? poses , under the law . It has been Acquired through the sale of Food for Peace shipments for which payment was received in these currencies . Credit sales climb This bulky coin collection has prompted President Johnson to call for a halt in these transactions . Not an abrupt halt , but a phase out that would abolish foreign-currency agreements entirely by Dec. 31 , 1971 . Instead , he wants more and more sales for dollars , on a long-term credit basis if necessary . This newspaper has just learned there is already a significant trend in this direction . That is , a drop off in foreign-currency sales // *Peace-food dollars sought // and a pickup in long-term credit agreements during the past year . Spain for instance , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted completely to dollar deals now , under longterm credit terms . The United Arab Republic , with foreign-currency purchases totaling more than $804 million in American money , now has switched to a combination of purchases for dollars , with only about a quarter of the shipments for local currency . Yugoslavia has just signed a new Food for Peace agi cement for which it will pay in dollars only , on a long-term credit basis , according to officials who keep tabs on this massive foreign-coin collection . All in all , a tally of Title 1 agreements ( sales for foreign currencies ) shows that in calendar year 1965 there were 26 of these agreements compared to 49 in 1964 . Outright sales rise At the same time , agreements signed under Title 4 ( for dollar payment on long-term credit ) increased from 18 in 1964 to 20 in in 1965 . The figuie is even higher now , counting dollar sales made in recent months . Another bit of encouraging news , pointed out by Food for Peace authorities , is the increase in commercial sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million to S9,779 million . Particularly significant is the fact that Food for Peace shipments declined at the same time . They fell from $1,758 million to $1,450 million  --  a substantial decline . It means that more countries are buying more United States farm products on the open market and less under the special Food for Peace program . Officials credit the program with stimulating a demand for American agricultural products abroad . There are five ways to acquire Food for Peace under the present law : by payment in local currencies ; payment in dollars on credit ; as relief in the event of national disasters such as floods or earthquakes ; by barter ; and as donations . The President feels the time has come for a change in the program  --  even in its name . He calls it " Food for Freedom . " The present law expires this year . He would replace it with one which not only puts emphasis on dollar payments but gives preference to those who show a disposition to help themselves . Food for Peace has been big business since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To date , 433 agreements , with an export market value of 510,500 million , have been entered into with 52 countries . The total cost is even higher when storage , pi ocessing , and shipping costs are added . Domestic use required While foreign currencies accumulated under this program may not be spent outside the country of their origin , they are used in substantial amounts for many purposes . For instance , to pay American Embassy expenses in these countries ; for the purchase of strategic material ; for defense purposes ; for loans to American businessmen in these areas ; and to foster American foreign policy generally . More than $311 million , from this foreign-coin collection , has been used to defray American expenses abroad within the past year . Some 52,700 million has been spent for these purposes since the beginning of the program . In fact , in only 10 countries does the United States have holdings of foreign currencies in excess of requirements , in the opinion of the Treasury Department . These countries are : Burma , Ceylon , Guinea , India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Arab Republic , and Yugoslavia . Indian shipments boosted By far the largest amount is in Indian rupees  --  adding up to more than $3 billion , Pakistan is second , with a foreign-currency collection of more than $1 billion . " We have been making Food for Peace shipments to India for 10 years , " a Food for Peace official remarked , " and it is worse off today than ever before . " Yet , because of the famine there , food shipments have been stepped up . This may result in an over-all increase in food shipments in 1966 . Brazil 's Food for Peace program is the most massive one in Latin America , with sales totaling 124,399,159,000 Brazilian cruzeiros , as of March , 1965 . The dollar value is not easily arrived at because of the volatile exchange rate . It is estimated at a quarter of a billion dollars . Even so , the government feels the program has brought more benefits than drawbacks . But from now on , the emphasis will be different . " Food for Freedom " would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm surpluses . Few surpluses are left . The program , as the President has outlined it , would be geared to American foreign policy , calling for some increased production on the part of farmers in needed crops , but avoiding any build-up of surpluses costly to the government and dangerous to the economy ,
