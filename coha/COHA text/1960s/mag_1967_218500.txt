MAN and moment met at a still point in a changing world . Ten years earlier , it could not have been done at all . Ten years later , it had become routine . But at this particular time , all the world could feel that its hopes , for a few excruciating and exhilarating hours , lay in the hands of one young man . And when Charles Lindbergh landed the Spirit of St. Louis on Paris ' Le Bourget field , people everywhere-groundlings with a sudden vision of a boundless future-experienced a leap of the heart . <P> For he flew alone . And on a single engine . He was the first real hero of the machine age , and in a sense the last . For not only was he in control of his machine , he was its partner ; it was still possible to love it . Today 's vast machines , casually performing vastly greater feats , exact service ; but they scorn affection . They require large teams to tend them , and dwarf the individual . <P> Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no one under 50 can fully appreciate what it meant . It became America 's national saga , all the more classic because its hero was to be shadowed by tragedy and did not prove to be free of flaws . " Slim " Lindbergh looked like the original country rube , with cowlick and baggy breeches , and he stirred folk memories ; there was about him something of the raggedy fellow at the Sherwood tournament who outshoots the sheriff 's best archers . <P> " The Flying Fool , " they called him . Where his rivals prepared elaborate rations , Lindbergh bought five sandwiches from a restaurant , remarking : " If I get to Paris , I wo n't need any more , and if I do n't get to Paris , I wo n't need any more either . " When he was dragged from the plane at Le Bourget 33 hours and 30 minutes later , legend insists that he said : " Well , here we are . " He was mobbed by the public and feted by the great ( he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . President Calvin Coolidge sent a U.S. Navy cruiser to bring him home , and was waiting for him at the foot of the Washington Monument when he arrived . U.S. Ambassador to France Myron Herrick spoke for most when he declared : " He stood forth amidst clamor and crowds , the very embodiment of fearless , kindly , cultivated American youth-unspoiled , unspoilable . A nation which breeds such boys need never fear for its future . " Young Lindbergh seemed engagingly modest , and remarked that he had merely wanted to prove the possibilities of future air travel and the need for commercial airports . <P> <P> Man &; Legend <P> From the start , the legend was slightly askew . Lindbergh was no Flying Fool . Even at 25 , he was probably the best knockabout flyer in the U.S. He was chief pilot ( of three ) for a tiny airline with a newly awarded contract to fly airmail between St. Louis and Chicago . Four times , lost in fog , he had been forced to ditch his plane and jump for his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sophomore year to take a course in flying , bought his first plane ( for $500 ) a year later , and qualified as a pilot in the Army Air Service . As a barnstormer , he walked wings , became a master of every stunt a Jenny could be put through . Landing was just a matter of picking the likeliest-looking pasture ; navigation was done by spotting the shape of rivers , or sometimes by swooping low over the railroad station to read the signs .
