The hand-picked members of Bertrand Russell 's " International War Crimes Tribunal " were all dolled up for their denunciation scene . French Novelist Simone de Beauvoir glittered in a silver lame blouse , while Playwright Peter Weiss , who had worn a corduroy jacket all week , donned a grey , striped business suit for the occasion . But all the pomp and ceremony could not add one bit of suspense to the peacenik extravaganza-or respectability to the " verdict .

Paris ' L'Aurore dismissed it as " a circus . " Le Figaro Litteraire accused Sartre of " childish ness . " London 's Observer said that the trial gave an excuse " to those who want to avoid thinking seriously about Viet Nam . " It did more than that . It finally exposed the extreme critics of the U.S. position in Viet Nam for what they are - cynical and ridiculous .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
