txt Instant Ph.D. ? Well , not quite . But Cornell University is out to prove it need not take a dreary 9 or 10 years from freshman registration to that final sheepskin . Some universities are exp.erimenting with intermediate degrees ? Yale 's master of philosophy program , to go into effect in 1968 , will be one step up from the routine masters and one step down from a Ph.D . Cornell is knee-deep in its first year of a compact , inevitably controversial six-year Ph.D . program . The idea , which Cornell proudly asserts now is being copied by California Institute of Technology , has roots in an April , 1964 , speech to parents at a weekend convocation by the dean of Cornell 's College of Arts and Sciences . Its essence is three years of undergraduate education and three of graduate work . Arts and sciences dean Stuart Brown had his doubts about recruiting ( 16 is a tender age for commitment to a Ph.D. ) , but the program had its special lures . A $2.2 million grant from the Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer scholarship help as needed over the first three years and full $3,000-a-year fellowships plus tuition and fees for each of the last three years . These are the years when many graduate students get bogged down with teaching-assistant chores in an effort to pay their bills . while writing dissertations . Also , traditional .. undergradUate requirements , including a major , are waived . Margaret Ferguson of Delaware , Ohio , one of the program 's 48 enrollees , admits the waiving of usual distribution requirements in math and science had its appeal for a girl whose main academic interest is languages . ( In all , 360 freshmen applied . ) Several of these freshmen say they may not stay at Cornell all six years ? the program does not frown on transfers . But they admit the compactness has its advantages . " My parents both teach at the . university ? , *Please.turn to Page 5 By Gordon N.

" My mother 's always bemoaning the fact that she does n't have her Ph.D . There are five kids in our family ? it makes it hard to go back . This just seemed a simpler way . " Attainments cited ' " It has n't been so definite for me , " says Matthew Clark of Clarksburg , Md. , whose key interests are linguistics and music . " I fully intend to stick it through for the six years , but it was more of a mechanical decision . . . . If I could teach without a Ph.D. , I would n't necessarily get one . " The enrollees live with four resident advisers in a coed dorm , a former motel which is the envy of residents of Cornell 's less than luxurious freshman dorms . The chosen 48 are by definition superior students . Nearly half were valedictorians or salutatorians of their senior class in high school .

Most of the program 's students have chalked up more than their share of advanced placement credits and plunge right into advanced courses . Tim McKibben of Iowa , who says he does not think he will have read enough over the six years to tackle the Ph.D. , is taking a graduate Beowulf course , a course in the philosophy of math , and a seminar on medieval literature . On the side he is auditing music and Shakespeare courses . Last semester he also taught an informal evening seminar to fellow students on T. S. Eliot 's " Four Quartets . " As any new program , this Ph.D . plan is a natural target for social and academic criticism . Some department heads are not at all sure they will accept these special students as advanced degree candidates two springs from now . Others on campus have been skeptical about the merits of " isolat ing " so much academic talent under one dormitory roof . However , those involved in the program insist these barriers are falling fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer bunch of quiz kids here , but , as you can see , they 're a delightfully normal group , " says 0 . J. Matthijs Jolles , professor of German literature and chairman of Cornell 's Department of German . He teaches one of the program 's seminars . Mary Ann Haagen , a senior in music who serves as a counselor to the students , says they are meeting plenty of other Cornell students through classes and extracurricular activities . Three or four have joined fraternities . The group has its own bowling team . Mr. Finch and Professor Jolles emphasize that the program 's impact on other university requirements is not the least of its benefits . There has been a general easing of undergraduate requirements for other students . The recent faculty decision to drop freshman English and institute ' seminars may well have been influenced by the plan . It has helped to foster a general experimental attitude on Cornell 's part , say the two faculty members .                 @ @ @ @
