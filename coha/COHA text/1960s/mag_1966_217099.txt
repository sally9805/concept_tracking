" You ca n't have a team , " rues a top Tory , " kicking its captain in the middle of the game . " Yet that is exactly what has been happening to Conservative Leader Ted Heath . Busy shielding his shins from Tory toes , he has been unable to mount a forceful attack on the Opposition 's real opposition , Prime Minister Harold Wilson 's ruling Laborites . But last week Heath finally kicked back . When his shadow minister for colonial affairs , dapper , dagger-tongued Angus Maude , wrote in the Spectator that " the Opposition has become a meaningless irrelevance , " Heath called him on the carpet of his West End bachelor flat . When Maude emerged 30 minutes later , he announced his resignation from Heath 's frontbench . <P> Wilson promptly seized upon the event to chortle that " the Tory Party is split from top to bottom . " Heath took to the telly to explain that " this resignation does not mean that I am against discussion of party policy or criticism , but there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Few Tories would quarrel with that , but not a few wondered if Heath had " shot the right fox . " More than Maude 's maunderings , it has been the outspoken speeches of Shadow Defense Minister Enoch Powell opposing the official Tory positions on defense and incomes policy that have set Tory backbenchers-and some frontbenchers as well-to squabbling . Nor has the all-dominant issue of Rhodesia , which has split Tory sympathies three ways , aided Heath 's task as captain . <P> Appropriately , Heath 's new show of firmness came as the Gallup poll reported , for the first time since he took over , a slump in Labor 's standing , halving the margin of their lead over the Conservatives to 4% . While Wilson has been preoccupied with foreign affairs , mainly the Rhodesian crisis , the electorate has been increasingly nagged at home : increases in bread prices , wage disputes , inadequate gas supplies during winter cold spells , power failures . This week Parliament reconvenes , and the minor grievances at home will provide the Tories with fresh ammunition . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polls in a by-election for a seat won by Labor the last time by a scant 1,000-odd votes . The Tories have a fair chance of snatching it away-and reducing Wilson 's parliamentary hold to a perilous majority of one .
