Gilbert Stuart tartly maintained that " no one would paint history who could do a portrait , " but as the chief depicter of George Washington , he showed that to paint portraits is often to paint great history . Over the centuries , on a less exalted plane , an amazing amount of homely personal history also stuck to the brushes of the portrait painters , but the daguerreotype and the photograph in the end reduced this broad popular stream of American art to a trickle . The rise and decline of portraiture is the most striking theme of a World 's Fair exhibit called " Four Centuries of American Masterpieces " ( see opposite page ) and housed in the Better Living Center . <P> More Doll Than Boy . The first New World painters called themselves artisans and drew picture signs for taverns , or coated fire buckets , depending on the state of business . In that stern and frugal age , a commission for a portrait was a plum . " Limning " a portrait meant producing a flat two-dimensional likeness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor and not any sureness of craft or conviction of life . Primitive , untutored and serene , the anonymous 1670 Portrait of Henry Gibbs is a charming example of the limner 's style . The floor is in perspective ; little Henry is not . More girl than boy , more doll than either , the child seems to be floating through the picture , not rooted in it . Yet the boy 's and the painting 's mood of grave , graceful self-possession is undiminished after nearly three centuries . In time , the limners became the itinerant painters who criss-crossed the continent by foot , horseback and wagon well into the 19th century , painting family portraits in return for food and temporary lodging . <P> Artists of loftier vocation expatriated themselves to study in England and to absorb the classic mastery of Renaissance portraiture . John Singleton Copley was one such , but before he left U.S. shores , he had already put together a masterly portrait gallery of some of his fellow Bostonians . His Portrait of Nathaniel Hard , a famed silversmith and engraver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probing intensity that is uncannily lifelike . As John Adams said of Copley 's portraits : " You can scarcely help discoursing with them , asking questions and receiving answers . " <P> Bravado &; Bravery . The idea that portraits were history came naturally to Western Painter George Catlin . In the 1830s he resolved to assemble a pictorial record of the last golden years of the Indians freely living their own lives . He rode across hundreds of miles of unmapped prairie , visited 48 tribes and painted 600 pictures . His Indian Boy is a triumph of photographic realism blended with psychological insight . There is a trace of bravado in the boy 's stance , backed by ultimate bravery in the clenched right fist . Around the eyes and mouth is the faint hint of sadness of a boy fated never to roam and rule the land of his father .
