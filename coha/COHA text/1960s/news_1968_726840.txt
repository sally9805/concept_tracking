" Commenting on Mr. Goldwater 's candidacy , Senator Hayden declared : " Well , Mr. Goldwater has been elected to the Senate twice , not by large majorities  --  and he has the right to run again . " Politically Active Mr. Goldwater , who started writing his column while a Senator , gave it up when he ran for the Presidency and then resumed it after the 1964 election , says his health is good and he is looking forward to the campaign . He has kept his hand in Arizona politics by playing a peacemaker role in the split bet ; - veen the conservative and the ultra-right-wing factions of the state Republican organization .
