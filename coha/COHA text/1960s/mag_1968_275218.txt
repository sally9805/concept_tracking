Century At Arizona 's Prescott College , fresh man orientation is a trifle more strenuous than listening to a series of welcome speeches . Instead , incoming students , both male and female , strap on 40-lb packs and spend three weeks hiking through dry , bramble-strewn canyons and scrambling down 165-ft. cliffs ; for three days , they must live on their own , surviving on nothing but water . In addition , they paddle kayaks and canoes for 95 miles around a wind-chopped lake , struggling to keep afloat during cloudbursts and camping overnight on the rocky shore . <P> The explanation for Prescott 's rigorous " wilderness course , " declares the school 's president , Ronald C. Nairn , is that " man is a part of nature . Millions of years of his evolutionary history are rooted in life as a hunter , a nomad , an adventurer . Deep facets of personality and emotional needs are tied to his past Urban industrial society increasingly fails to meet these needs . " gritty native spirt is only one part Prescott 's unique educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed a system of wide-ranging integrated courses that bridge the gap between humanities and the sciences . The curriculum concentrates on great ideas rather than an accumulation of facts . The object is to help each student create his own world view , relate classroom concepts to his own life and become what one school official calls " a cultural revolutionary . " <P> Unfettered by Tradition . When Prescott opened its doors in 1966 , it was conceived as a private , four-year liberal arts college " unfettered by any tradition that would limit its opportunity to relate itself dynamically to the emerging 21st century . " That goal was explored at a symposium of 100 educators and businessmen sponsored by the Ford Foundation , resulting in funds for construction of the college 's 43 buildings on 640 acres of rolling plain six miles north of Prescott , Ariz . Though present enrollment is only 186 , Prescott plans to expand to a maximum of 1,000 by 1978 . <P> All Prescott 's students take a heady curriculum in four areas : anthropology ; language and literature ; civilizations ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cinema as well as courses on the Christian tradition and comparative mythology . The study of systems at Prescott starts with an analysis of logic and mathematics , branches off into astronomy physics , chemistry , psychology and political science . The anthropology department deals with man 's relationship to his environment , to his culture , and to himself . It ranges from courses in geography and geology to zoology-all backed up by six weeks of field work in the nearby desert . In their first trip to the desert , Prescott students unearthed pueblo ruins left by predecessors of the Hopi Indians in A.D. 1100 . <P> To the Limits . Prescott 's most novel enterprise is the outdoor sports program Convinced that students need more than the artificial competition of games Prescott has abandoned traditional team sports . Instead , it has adopted the techniques developed by Outward Bound , an international program of more than 20 wilderness camps that stresses adventure , challenge and sell sufficiency.                    @
