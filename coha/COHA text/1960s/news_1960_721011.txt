txt With the steel dispute cleared away from the economic horizon , businessmen confidently are planning to step up borrowing to increase inventories , build plants and buy new equipment . That 's the report from businessmen and hankers interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters in a dozen major cities around the U.S. The growing demand for borrowed money promises to push interest rates still higher in the months immediately ahead  --  for the Government and consumers , as well as businessmen . With banks , insurance companies and other lenders already hard-pressed for loanable funds , many would-be borrowers will find it increasingly difficult to line up loans  --  at any interest rate . Evidence of a growing demand for credit comes from a wide range of businesses . " We 'll be borrowing long-term money to handle our normal growth  --  about 25% to 30% more than last year , " says James A. Ryder , president of Miami 's Ryder System , Inc. , which operates a big intercity truck line and leases cars and trucks . Ryder borrowed about $42 million last year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $28 million in outside financing will be needed this year , compared with $19 million in 1939 , " says A. W. Trimble , vice president of Pacific Power &; Light Co. of Portland , Ore . " We have arranged , subject to approval by the Federal Power Commissioa and regulatory bodies in Oregon and Washington State , a $20 million credit agreement with a group of banks to cover a major portion of the needs . " " Depending on the way business progresses in 1960 , I would expect we will borrow more than the $10 million we got from banks last year , " says H. D. Nelson , comptroller of Clark Equipment Co. of Buchanan , Mich. , maker of lift trucks , construction machinery and related products . Worried about inflation , the Federal Reserve System for months has been keeping a tight rein on the funds banks have available for lending . The wage increases won by the Steelworkers Union this month are not likely to ease the System 's worries ; the pay boosts are expected to put upward pressure on wages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the System are required to keep on deposit with the Federal Reserve amounts equal to a specified percentage of the deposits on their own books . The banks since late 1958 have had to borrow from the System to keep these reserves at the required level . At last report on Wednesday , the banks ' reserves exceeded requirements by $104 million , but this was more than accounted for by $195 million of borrowing from the System . Personal Saving Slips Insurance companies and other savings institutions also were pressed for loanable funds . While Americans ' personal incomes have been rising , their spending has been growing even faster . In the third quarter of 1959 , the latest period for which figures are available , the Commerce Department reports personal saving ? after-tax income less consumption spending ? was running at an annual rate of $21.9 billion . That 's down from $24.1 billion in the previous quarter and from $26 billion a year earlier . This scarcity of loanable funds already has made it more difficult for many borrowers to find loans  --  and has brought sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans are likely to become even more expensive and less readily available . Commercial bankers generally look for business loan demand to be strong enough in 1960 's first half to more than offset the seasonal factors that usually bring a decline in loans in the early months of a year . Commod- ; ity dealers and food processors now are pay- ing off loans they obtained to purchase crops last fall . Wholesale and retail trade firms are repaying loans they used to accumulate invent tones for the Christmas selling season . As long as businessmen still are able to find money to borrow , most of them  --  for the present at least - say they wo n't be greatly deter  --  ed by its price . " Tight money influences our plans , but in order to do our job we still have to borrow ? it just costs that much more to do business , " , , iys E. W. 1 ? loltii  --  mn , Ural i icr Marine Corp. , of Waukegan , Ill. , a manufacturer of outboard engines . The high cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for expansion or inventories , says George , executive vice president of Flintkote Co. , New York-headquartered building materials producer . " We simply take the cost of money we need , say for an acquisition , into account as part of the cost of making the deal . " Flintkote in the past two years has purchased several sizable concerns in the building products field . As money tightens , however , more businessmen may share a recent experience of Brunswick  --  Balke  --  Collender Co. , a Chicago maker of howling equipment . The company last month tried to expand its line of credit with a New York City bank . " They said they were loaned up to about 70 ' , of their deposits and just could n't take on any more , even though they said they wanted to , " reports L. 11 Sit anhind , Brunswo k s financial vice pi esi ? dent " So they recommended that we go to a certain Detroit hank , which was glad to lend the money " The ratio of loans to deposits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City banks than it is for most banks elsewhere . No matter how much they shop around , some would  --  be borrowers are likely to have no luck at all . Says a Boston banker : " We 're not looking for any new borrowers . We 're keep . Ing our money ior our good , older culltoMers . " Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Co. , like many banks , says it will be screening loan applicants more closely this year , weeding out companies whose credit standings leave something to be desired . The bank also is rejecting loans it considers speculative , a course being followed by most banks . ' Last Friday , " says Wentworth P. Johnson , Fidelity-Philadelphia senior vice president , " we were approached for a loan to improve a great deal of Florida real estate . " The request was rejected immediately without investigation . With credit scarce and costly , businessmen naturally are trying to limit the size of their increased borrowing needs . Banking on higher profits this year , many expect to plough back more dollars into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they otherwise would have received . " We anticipate higher earnings this year , and we hope to retain a greater percentage of our earnings so we wo n't have to go in heavier for borrowing , " says a spokesman for Detroit 's Burroughs Corp. , a major producer of business machines . Burroughs nevertheless plans to borrow $5 million to $10 million more this year than last , on a short-term basis , " for working capital purposes , " the spokesman says . Packard Bell Co. , Los Angeles-based electronics firm , has retained most of its earnings in recent years " and I suspect we 'll retain this year possibly a little hit more than the 70C1- retained last year , " says Robert Bell , president . Packard Bell will build a $1 million plant addition this year but plans no increase in its borrowings . Hopes to Plough Back More Southern Co. , big Atlanta-based electric utility holding company , has been ploughing back 30% to 35% of its earnings but hopes for a higher percentage " so long as the ploughing hack is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Harlee Branch , Jr. , president . But Southern Co. , which did no short-term borrowing in 1959 , now is " prepared to borrow about $22 million in two-year notes from nine banks to further finance our construction program . " Mr. Branch says . The borrowing still is subject to approval by regulatory authorities  --  and Southern Co. ' s directors . In New York City 's bond market , most investment bankers look for an increase in corporate offerings of new bonds and stock this year . " I expect considerably more corporate financing this year , " says one investment banker . " With the steel dispute ended , corporations are looking forward to a prosperous 1960 and 1961 , and they 're thinking about broader expansion plans . " Corporate sales of new securities in the first 10 months of 1959. the latest period for which figures are available , totaled $7.9 billion , a sharp decline from the $10 billion figurefor the like period a year earlier . With bond interest rates climbing , many corporations have been reluctant to commit themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , they 've decided to rely on bank loans , In the hope that bond borrowing costs sooner or later will slip to lower levels . A. lot of companies are still of this mind  --  a fact that will limit the rise in bond financing and put added pressure on the banks . More Stork Issues High bond interest rates , coupled with high stock prices , have led to some increase in new stock issues . New Issues in the January-October period last year totaled $1.7 billion , up from $1 billion a year earlier . But tax considerations are likely to limit the rise in stock sales . Bond interest is deductible for tax purposes , while stock dividends are not . " Even if a corporation pays 6% on a bond , " says a New York investment banker , " the actual cost to it is less than 3%. thanks to the 52% corporate tax rate . " Investment bankers look for an increase in bond interest rates in the next few months , but expect it to be small . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not by much , " says one investment banker . " A company now paying 51 , . ' t , % may have to pay 512% . " This banker and others point to President Eisenhower 's forecast of a $200 million Federal budget surplus in the current fiscal year and a S4.2 billion surplus in the year starting July 1 . If the President 's estimates are proved correct , the Treasury is likely to be doing less financing in the next year or so . Some Washington officials believe the impact of a reduction in Treasury borrowing could be great enough to lead to a leveling-off of all interest rates before long . Bankers Expect Rate Rise Most commercial bankers say that , if a leveling-oft develops , it 's not likely to come before mid-year , They see nothing but a continued rise in bank interest rates in 1960 's first half . New York City banks recently increased the interest rate on loans to brokers and dealers on securities to 51 : : % from 5% . Changes in this ra , e usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rate  --  the rate charged the biggest business borrowers with the best credit ratings . The prime rate still stands at 1% , but most bankers expect it to rise before long . " It seems like a prime rate increase might be fairly imminent , " says Tyrus Stansberry , vice president of Detroit 's Manufacturers National Bank . " We can expect the prime rate to be pushed up a half point some time in the first half , " says C. B. Stephenson , president of First National Bank of Oregon , a statewide chain based in Portland .
