Generations of busy mothers have long blessed Mead Johnson &; Co. , maker of Pablum , Dextri-Maltose and a cradleful of other ready-mixes for plumping up baby . Last week many of the same mothers were buying a new Mead Johnson product , a powder called Metrecal , with an opposite aim : taking weight off themselves . <P> The powder , which is mixed by dieters with water or skim milk , is such a hot-selling item that it has already spawned some 40 imitations from Sears , Roebuck 's Bal-Cal to Quaker Oats 's Quota , just out this week . With Metrecal sales up to an annual rate of $40 million , Mead Johnson 's 1960 gross is confidently expected by company officials to jump this year from $65 million to $100 million , the profits to double to $6 a share . To help keep ahead of the imitators , the company last week put on sale a canned liquid Metrecal , which is easier for paunch-conscious businessmen to keep unrefrigerated in a desk drawer for their noonday meal . <P> Creating an Illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Metrecal is a new trick coaxed out of an old product . The man who turned the trick : President Daniel Mead Johnson , 46 , grandson of Founder Edward Mead Johnson . D. Mead joined the company in 1936 as a New York salesman , in 1949 became vice president of sales and , in effect , chief executive . Concerned that the company was almost exclusively identified with baby needs , he set up a research department ( 1960 budget : $3,500,000 ) to develop a diverse line of Mead Johnson products . <P> One of the department 's first finds was an invalid 's food called Sustagen . A mix of skim-milk powder , soybean flour , corn oil , minerals and vitamins , Sustagen was designed for hospital patients unable to eat solid foods . It worked so well at giving patients the illusion of having eaten a solid meal and killing off between-meal hunger pangs that last year Mead Johnson decided to call it Metrecal and put it out as a weight-reducing food . The chief change was to recommend a limit of 900 calories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Metrecal a day . <P> It Works . As an ethical drug company , i.e. , prescription products mainly , Mead Johnson 's first concern was to maintain the good will of doctors who prescribe most of its products . It wisely started advertising Metrecal in the American Medical Association Journal , and even though it subsequently broadened out into general magazines , it ended each ad with a plug to see " your physician " about weight problems . This gave Metrecal the respectability that most slimming concoctions lack , sent sales soaring . And it works . <P> To food and drug men , the big question is whether the vogue for " drink-a-meal " diet potions will turn out to be just another passing fad . Mead Johnson is certain that in Metrecal 's case it will not . Metrecal is still the big seller over the imitations , despite the fact that they are cheaper . Mead Johnson , which has already trimmed its prices , can cut further , if necessary , and still make a good profit . The cost of making a can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 50.
