For well-heeled travelers , a trip to Italy more often than not includes a stay at one of the 16 world-famous CIGA hotels . The rich list includes the Grand and Excelsior in Rome , the Gritti Palace in Venice and Milan 's Principe e Savoia . At prices up to $100 a day , the CIGA chain has developed a loyal and profitable following by living up to its motto : " The client is a name , not a room number . " <P> Now , in an abrupt about-face , CIGA plans to reach for the equally profitable middle-price , room-number trade . In partnership with Alitalia and an Italian holding company , it is getting ready to build a chain of 800-bed modern " Aerhotels . " " They will have all the American internal fittings , " says Managing Director Giorgio Campione , " including ice water and paper-wrapped glasses . " The first two Aerhotels are to be opened in Milan and Rome in 1970 . <P> Campione figures that Aerhotels will get most of their business from the new 450-passenger jumbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffles packaged tours into Hilton hotels , and Pan American , which feeds customers to its Intercontinental chain , Aerhotels will serve Alitalia travelers . <P> Under Campione 's leadership , the hotel chain increased its revenues by one-third , to $17.3 million , between 1961 and 1967 . While new plans call for catering to the drip-dry set , CIGA will continue to coddle the upper crust . The rare cathedral glass of Venice 's Danieli , which was built in the 15th century , will still be repaired by the only living artisan with the necessary know-how . Faithful customers , who range from Europe 's nobility to Actor Peter Sellers , will still receive the same tender care they have learned to expect from CIGA employees . At Rome 's Grand , for example , silver-haired Lorenzo ( " the Magnificent " ) Colasanti , a 35-year CIGA veteran , stands as ready as ever to pay Elizabeth Taylor 's bills when she goes shopping and forgets her money .                   @ @
