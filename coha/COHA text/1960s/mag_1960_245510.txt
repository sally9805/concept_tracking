In principle , all the food that Russians eat comes , or should come , from either collective or state-owned farms . But in stubborn practice , an astonishingly high proportion of the Russian diet , especially on its tastier side , is still supplied by private farming . Last week a new Soviet handbook provided statistics : <P> In 1959 , city and village dwellers tending backyard gardens , and collective or state farm workers cultivating private gardens limited to one acre , turned out 46% of all the meat , 49% of all the green vegetables , 49% of all the milk , 65% of all the potatoes , and 80% of all the eggs consumed in Russia . The excess above home consumption is sold in the network of officially tolerated produce markets to which Russian housewives turn when goods are unobtainable in state stores . <P> The official Russian policy is that in due time , as the food supplies in state stores become more plentiful and cheaper , private gardening and the keeping of cows and chickens , etc .. will wither away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite an official campaign to compel private farmers to sell all livestock to the state , a third of the beef cattle , half of the milkers , and four-fifths of the goats are still peasant-owned.
