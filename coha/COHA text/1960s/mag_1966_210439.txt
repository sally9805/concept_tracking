IN MY FATHER 'S COURT by Isaac Bashevis Singer . 307 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $5.50 . <P> " There are still mysterious forces at work in the world , " says Isaac Bashevis Singer . Dipping his pen in an inkwell of wonders , he has drawn out , in his demonic , forceful fiction ( The Family Moskat , The Magician of Lublin , Short Friday ) , a fantastic and various vision of Eastern Europe 's vanished Jewry . His work has already commandingly established him as the greatest living master of Yiddish prose and as one of the enduring leaders among U.S. novelists . Now 61 , he has issued a memorable memoir of his Polish boyhood-a group of brief , incidental sketches that Singer first wrote in Yiddish for New York 's Jewish Daily Forward . In translation they are brisk , bright and engagingly exotic . Even readers who have never heard a shofar will recognize the book as a letter from home . <P> Extra Cot . For the poor and pious Singer family , home stood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There Isaac Bashevis ' red-bearded rabbi father ( who chastely refused to look a woman in the face and could not , insists Author Singer , recognize his own wife ) learnedly ruled his roost . He also ruled his rabbinical court , the Beth Din , an institution that dated from the days of Moses and was a blend of synagogue , law court and psychoanalyst 's consulting room for the superstitious , the bereaved and the troubled . For Isaac Bashevis , it exemplified " the celestial council of justice , God 's judgment , absolute mercy . " One time a miserable pauper , who was forced to keep the corpse of his wife in his rat-ridden cellar room until it could be buried , asked if it were permitted a good Jew to sleep in the same bed with a body . The whole horrified neighborhood tumbled out compassionately with donations of food , clothing-and an extra cot . When an elderly penitent insisted that God would never forgive her for having long ago abandoned her illegitimate baby on the steps of a church , Rabbi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reminded her that God has no evil in him . <P> Only heresy really scandalized Father Singer , who kept as closely as possible within the confines of his own Orthodox home , rarely even stepping out onto the balcony . By 1914 , all that was changing . While elderly rabbis dreamed up endless commentaries on the commentators on the law and books of wisdom , young intellectuals were turning socialist , reading Dostoevsky , shaving off their earlocks , or sailing for New York . Encouraged by his rebellious elder brother , I. J. Singer , young Bashevis thrust increasingly beyond the limits of his Orthodox childhood into the world of intellectuals and artists . He records with touching candor the delight he felt when as an adolescent he first wandered into the studio of a famous sculptor and discovered a stunning new society that honored the body as fervently as his father had honored the soul .
