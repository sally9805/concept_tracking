Never on Sunday ( Melinafilm ; United Artists ) is a rambunctious little politico-philosophical fable about The Virtuous Whore and The Quiet American . Written , produced and directed by Jules ( Rififi , He Who Must Die ) Dassin for a sum ( $125,000 ) that would scarcely pay the light bill on the average Hollywood feature , Sunday has been playing to packed houses in Paris since last May . The title song of the picture is one of Europe 's top tunes these days , and for her work as the leading lady-of-the-evening Greece 's Melina ( Stella ) Mercouri was proclaimed 1960 " s best cinemactress at the Cannes Film Festival . <P> The plot of the picture seems at a glance no more than a reroast of an old chestnut : the tale of the reformer reformed . The hero ( portrayed by Director Dassin himself " because I could n't afford to pay an actor to play the part " ) is an intellectual Boy Scout from Middletown , U.S.A. , who takes a trip to Greece in the wide-eyed expectation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . " He finds instead a warmhearted , disrespectful prostitute ( Actress Mercouri ) who tumbles only for the men she likes , charges only what they are willing or able to pay , and never does business on Sunday . <P> The Boy Scout , horrified to find the glory that was Greece reduced to such sordid circumstances , decides to do a good deed . With the secret financial assistance of the local vice czar , who fears the prostitute 's casual price policy will ruin his market , the hero initiates a program of cultural aid to the heroine 's underdeveloped area : the mind . Obligingly , the heroine at first abandons the pleasures of the body , discovers the pleasures of the intellect . But in the denouement she also discovers that when nature is denied , spirit suffers too . The film ends with a blare of strumpets as the heroine leads a rousingly hilarious red-light revolution and the luckless hero sails home sadder but wiser . <P> Dassin 's satire is obviously directed at the U.S. , but his touch is light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unlike his hero , Dassin is not trying to save anybody . He merely wants to suggest that the missionary mentality , which he believes to be an American complex , is at best childish and at worst ineffective . The idea is scarcely original , but Dassin expresses it in a wonderful rush of animal spirits and earthy humor . ( Best bit : a scene in which an aging trollop recounts her favorite dream . " I get married to a man 84 years old , " she says wistfully . " He has a little money , and-do I get a rest ! " ) Dassin himself , a man with the curious , worldly-otherworldly face of a middle-aged elf , is always amusing to watch . And mercurial Mercouri , a sort of Levantine Carmen Miranda , embodies with phenomenal vitality the philosophical premises of the film : 1 ) know-how is not necessarily power ; 2 ) money can not buy anything that really matters ; 3 ) the only way to save the world is to love the people in it and accept them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 , 1951 , the name of Harlem-raised Jules ( Brute Force , Naked City ) Dassin was one of the hotter properties in Hollywood . By late afternoon of that day his name was mud . The difference was made in the few moments it took one of his fellow directors to tell a congressional committee ( TIME , May 7 , 1951 ) that Dassin was a Communist .
