txt WASHINGTON ? Two months ago , when the Senate Finance Committee was just beginning the hard job of writing a. major tax reform and relief bill , its chairman , Russell B. Long of Louisiana , made a prediction . By the time his committee , and the Senate as a whole , got through with the bill , Senator Long forecast , it would contain even bigger tax reductions than the version already passed by the House of Representatives . " After all , " he said , " We 're entitled to have a- little fun , too . " Senator Long was widely criticized for his statement , and subsequently said he had n't been entirely serious . But last week , it became clear that his prophecy was going to be fulfilled . For the Senate , in acting ? on the tax reform bill , approved . by Senator Long 's - committee , has made of it an even bigger tax relief bill than the one passed by the House . It has also chipped away at some of the reform provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has added some new ( though relatively narrow ) special privileges to the tax law , and has grafted onto the bill an enormous increase in social security benefit payments . Oddly , it had looked for a time as though these things might not happen . The Finance Committee 's bill , which contained most of the major reforms voted by the House and tax relief provisions that . were actually somewhat more modest , easily withstood the first attempts that were made to change it on the Senate floor . Two of those tests involved the politically-sensitive oil depletion allowance , which the Finance Committee had voted to reduce to 23 per cent . When the Senate stood firm , last Monday , against attempts both to restore the allowance to its present 271/2 per cent and to reduce it further to 20 per cent , it looked as though the committee 's lines were holding . But it did n't last . On Wednesday , the tax change that has for a decade been demanded by the public in its letters to Congress more than any other  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ; er th.1 bitter , but not always unwavering opposition of the Administration , which objected to the heavy , immediate revenue loss . The version of the exemption increase that was adopted  --  a rise to $700 next year and $800 in 1971 ? was sponsored by Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee , a Democrat . The success of the Gore amendment suddenly changed the entire mood on the Senate floor . An " anything goes " attitude swept the Senate like a grass fire . First , up jumped Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana , a Democrat , with an amendment poking a large hole in the repeal of the investment tax credit , an alleged small business amendment that would actually benefit every corporation , regardless of size . It passed . Then Senator George Murphy of California , a Republican , started pushing a plan for permitting elderly persons to take bigger medical deductions , a plan so designed that two-thirds of the cash benefits would go to elderly persons with incomes in excess of $20,000 a year . That passed , too . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in college that has been fought as unsound and wasteful by each of the last three national Administrations . ' Christmas Tree Bill ' But what really caused some members of the Senate to start calling the tax bill a " Christmas tree bill " was the Senate 's decision , on Friday , to add $6.5-billion worth of increases in Social Security benefits . Senator Long himself started this , in an apparent reversion to his earlier intention to let the Senate " have a little fun . " But by the time the voting was over , Senator Long 's proposal had been expanded by 50 per cent . In all , the negative budgetary effects of the new payments , the additional tax cuts and the shrunken reforms voted by the Senate were approaching the $12-billion mark . Senators who were publicly voting for the Christmas presents were privately agreeing that things had gotten out of hand . But they reassured anyone who raised worried questions about the financial consequences that the joint Senate-House Conference Committee that will write the final version of the tax bill could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That remains to be seen . Not that the conference committee will not try to do exactly that . But its job promises to - trerhely difficult . For while conf2rence committees have wide latitude , they have to maintain a semblance of compromising somewhere near the middle ground between the House and Senate versions . And thus the more high-priced the amendments the Senate hung on the bill , the harder it will be for the conferees to eliminate all or even most of them . There remains the possibility , therefore , that Congress will yet send to President Nixon a bill he would feel required to veto . Some claim it had all been planned that way in the first place , perhaps by Senator Long , himself , who does not like some of the reform provisions , especially those dealing with the oil industry . A more commonly accepted view is that it is simply inevitable that political pressures will turn any tax reform bill into a giveaway package . The possibility of a Presidential veto was raised again yesterday by Senator Hugh Scott of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill " gets any worse , it may prove in the President 's eyes to be disenabling . " " Unless the bill looks better when it comes out of conference , " the Republican leader said , he would have to - echo a statement made earlier by Senator Robert P. Griffin that " I just would n't bet against a veto . " Democratic leader Mike Mansfield , noting that the tax measure still had to go through the conference committee , said he did n't take such threats seriously . " 2 think they 're premature , " the Montana Senator said . He said he hoped the increases in the minimum Social Security benefits would go through , but added that he did not know what the chances were . Among those with long memories of the history of tax legislation still another interpretation prevails , however . That is that tax legislation reasonably unencumbered with giveaways requires real leadership , both in Congress and in the Administra ' tion . From the White House , unambiguous signals are necessary and they were not forthcoming this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tax-writing committees  --  must command sufficient respect so that amendments do not prevail against their opposition . For a while , it looked as though Senator Long , who has worked industriously on the present bill , had reached this position of eminence . But apparently not . - EILEEN SHAISTAILAIST
