When starchy Strongman Mohammed Ayub Khan , 54 , stepped from his green and white Boeing 707 at Washington 's Andrews Air Force Base last week , U.S. officials were well aware that they had come to meet a talkative tiger . Days before in London , the plain-spoken President of Pakistan had demonstrated his old soldier 's scorn for diplomatic niceties , had loudly broadcast his doubts about U.S. policy in Southeast Asia and threatened to " reexamine " his country 's SEATO and CENTO commitments . At planeside , his grey guardsman 's mustache bristling , Ayub was terse and blunt . " We naturally take deepest interest , " he told President Kennedy , " in what goes on in this country-and especially what you do , sir . " Then he strode to Kennedy 's new bubble-topped Lincoln and plunged into a giddy , four-day whirl unrivaled in recent capital history . <P> Highlight of Ayub 's busy week was his first night in Washington , when he was guest of honor at Jackie Kennedy 's imaginative fte champtre at Mount Vernon . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests boarded four flower-laden boats ( each with its own musicians ) for the 15-mile cruise to George Washington 's sprawling estate . The ladies had been instructed to wear short dresses ( the better to clamber about Mount Vernon 's expansive lawn ) , and the men wore white dinner coats-except , unaccountably-the clothes-conscious President and his brother Bobby . Both turned out in black tuxedos . <P> <P> Beautiful Evening . Ashore , the Mount Vernon grounds had been solicitously sprayed with DDT to rid them of their native gnats , mosquitoes , ants and chiggers . George Washington 's white-pillared manor house was equipped with electric lights for the first time in its history . White House Chef Ren Verdon presided proudly over Army field kitchens that served avocado and crabmeat mimosa , poulet chasseur avec couronne de riz clamart ( hunter-style chicken with rice ) , framboises la crme Chantilly and petits jours secs . After dinner , the guests strolled across the lawn to rows of camp chairs , settled back for a concert by the National Symphony Orchestra ( selections : Mozart 's Allegro con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's American in Paris ) . <P> Brains &; Backbone . Next morning , after only two hours of sleep , Ayub showed up at 9 a.m. to lay a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier , then checked in at the White House for a long , serious talk with the President . This time , he came bearing gifts : two Pakistani rugs for the President , a painting for Mrs. Kennedy , a doll for Caroline and two silver rattles for John Jr . In return , Kennedy had Ayub measured for a tailor-made , gold-inlaid shotgun ( a 12-gauge Winchester 21 ) , which will be sent directly to Pakistan as soon as it is completed . At noon Ayub addressed Congress ( see above ) , moved taciturn House Speaker Sam Rayburn to remark : " We have been in the presence of a man with iron in his backbone and brains in his head . " <P>
