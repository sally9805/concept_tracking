At a cost of $1.3 billion over five years , De Gaulle 's program would provide 50 medium-range bombers , a handful of atomic missiles and an atom-powered sub . The plan 's reception was hostile . Members of the finance and defense committees pointed out that such a meager atomic force would cost a lot of money but still not give France parity with the U.S. or the Soviets in the " atomic club .

Le Grand Charles decreed punishment rare in any country calling itself a democracy . Government employees who signed or support the petition , such as teachers , face suspension at one-third pay ; actors and directors were forbidden employment in French radio and television or in state-run or state-subsidized theaters and films . Minister of Culture Andre Malraux ( whose daughter and divorced wife were among the signers ) was ordered to draft a bill denying state financial aid to any artist who signed the manifesto . <P> <P> Commented France 's respected newsletter , Index Quotidien : " The Fifth Republic seems to have reached the critical stage of disenchantment and trial . . .
