ANTI-MEMOIRS by Andr Malraux . Translated by Terence Kilmartin . 420 pages . Holt , Rinehart &; Winston . $8.95 . <P> <P> Andr Malraux is a mysterious fellow -a natural-born actor who saved his histrionics for real life , a novelist who fashioned his books out of the materials of history and wrote himself into most of them in roles he actually played . So multi-chaptered is his life , in fact , and so intermixed is it with the events of his times that no adequate accounting could be contained within one book . Accordingly , when it was announced that Malraux would write the first volume in a projected autobiographical series , it was possible to wonder just which Malraux the author liked best . <P> There was something dashing about the passionately militant young Malraux , for instance . At 22 , in 1923 , this Malraux was arrested for trying to smuggle Khmer statuary out of Cambodia . Already an anticolonialist , he helped form those revolutionary forces that would eventually drive his countrymen out of Indo-China and make Mao Tse-tung master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recommend him too . As an almost mythical liberal of the 1930s and a famous novelist ( Man 's Fate , Man 's Hope ) , he helped organize and then commanded the brave , ramshackle Republican air force that flew against Franco 's armies in the Spanish Civil War . Finally , if the author felt inclined to autumnal apologia , he could start by revealing himself in his current incarnation as De Gaulle 's Minister of Culture : the man who gave Paris a long-needed face washing , planted a copy of the Venus de Milo in the Paris Mtro and , lately , helped the General resolve last May 's student riots . <P> Flights of Rhetoric . A private account about any or all of these gifted Malrauxs would have been fascinating . But , as curious readers of Anti-Memoirs soon find , the author , now 67 , has loftily decided to leave nearly all of his personal chronology out of his autobiography . ( " Almost all the writers I know love their childhood , " he writes , thus disposing of all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers instead is an odd , episodic mixture of action and reflection , frequently obfuscated by Malraux 's fondness for flights of impenetrable Gallic rhetoric . The book includes part of an early novel , some narrative accounts of his adventures in the French Resistance and elsewhere , and long replays of longer interviews with Mao Tse-tung and Nehru , both of whom he visited in 1965 not only as a former fellow revolutionary but as an informal emissary from De Gaulle . <P> Though disappointing , Anti-Memoirs is a remarkable cultural confection , especially for readers armed with some prior knowledge of Malraux and France , not to mention a tolerance for offhand allusions to everything from Vishnu to Vichy water . Its most accessible elements are brief recollections of personal danger , each spiced with the author 's sense of fate and history . Such incidents were chosen because they brought Malraux , the man of action , face to face with death-and the limitations of human courage-just as his lifetime has brought him face to face with the limitations of the revolutionary aims that he pursued so hotly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
