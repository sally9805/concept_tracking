If most of Europe seemed angry at Charles de Gaulle last week , no one seemed to know quite what to do about him . Speaker after speaker at the European Parliament in Strasbourg ringingly condemned Charles de Gaulle 's imperious thumbs down on British membership in the Common Market . As a result , declared Common Market Chairman Walter Hallstein , the Six have been plunged into their " first real crisis-a crisis of confidence . " In European capitals from Bonn to Rome , France 's Common Market partners spoke bravely of ganging up on De Gaulle , perhaps by blocking his plans for associating France 's former African colonies with Europe , or even by boycotting French goods . <P> Empty Chair ? But when the speeches were over , European parliamentarians speechlessly realized that there was almost no concrete action that they could take against le grand Charles . De Gaulle seemed to hold all the trumps . Some members of the other Common Market five had talked of giving France the " empty-chair " treatment , carrying on their efforts for European unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would it serve to exclude France from NATO councils ? None at all . Its contributions to allied fighting strength are sufficiently meager-it is two divisions behind its commitments in Germany , it withholds its Mediterranean fleet from NATO , keeps most of its metropolitan territory out of the air warning system , and even prohibits foreign nuclear weapons on French soil . Still , sheer geography gives France a veto on NATO planning . Could France be ignored in the tariff discussions of the 40-odd members of GATT , or in OECD , the European economic coordinating group that grew out of the Marshall Plan ? Hardly , since the economies of all Western European nations are intertwined with France 's . The urgent French need to export food surpluses , and its booming market for other nations ' industrial goods , are the stick and the carrot that have given the community much of its momentum . <P> Even Belgium 's Paul-Henri Spaak , perhaps the most implacable foe of De Gaulle 's plans for Europe , agreed last week that there was no general support for retaliatory measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was in tears at Brussels when France blackballed Britain , went home breathing defiance of De Gaulle and threats to topple Konrad Adenauer . He got nowhere ( see West Germany ) . And after all the oratory at Strasbourg , a " solemn protest " motion condemning De Gaulle 's " domination " of Europe was defeated by a tie vote of 38-38-hardly a resounding gesture of defiance . <P> Personality Change . By their very lack of passion at the new realities , European statesmen proved that there is still a lot of life in deep-rooted nationalism , whether De Gaulle 's or anyone else 's . The Communists had found out the same thing in Yugoslavia , Poland , Hungary and East Germany . There were differences : Russia had tried to impose a unity , and Western Europeans had hoped to evolve into a unity by democratic means and for mutual benefit . Western Europeans still insist that the idea of Europe will carry the day , but at the moment there is a new consciousness of one another 's disparate tastes , talents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
